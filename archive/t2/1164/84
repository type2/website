I've managed to drill the end of my crankshaft for a tap. It required  
an angle extension on my drill. I don't think this monster ovaled the  
bore too much.

As soon as I tried to tap the bore, I remembered exactly what caused  
the broken ez-out. My tap and die handle thing is exactly the same  
length as the diameter of the fan shroud opening. I wiggled it when I  
was using the ez-out -- snap!

I decided not to do that again. Instead, I'm going to get one of the  
smaller drivers as soon as I post this.

The bolt that sheered is one of those self-locking bolts. Is that  
right? Is thread lock on a normal bolt just as good?
