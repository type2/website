Pull the engine FIRST. And have a trailer or towbar and alternate
storage handy.

You would be surprised how much the rear is going to come up with the
engine out and it would suck to pull the motor while inside only to have
the Rivi top wedge itself against the door when you drop it.

Measure your clearance now from floor to door with the door raised. Now
measure the height of the bus and add 4 to 6 inches. It probably won't
go up THAT much but better safe than sorry.

If you discover it's going to be too high with the motor out you should
be able to attach straps from the frame to the bottom shock mounts and
lower it that way after the motor is pulled.
