Subject: Thanks for info on XR700 ignition system - Now TCP Globals

Just wanted to say thank you to all that responded to my question re: spark plug gap and this ignition system. Now, I didn't get any replies about TCP Globals Restoration paint. Has anyone ever used it?
The price is amazingly good, and after I contacted them, the tech guy said he felt it was as good as Sherwin Williams or Omni. Here is a link to some comments on the AMC Forum for those of you that do home paintjobs and can't afford 500 dollar gallons of paint. (remember Ramblers and Javelins etc.?) :-)
