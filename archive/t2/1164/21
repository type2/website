Subject: re:Reupholstering a 1968 Bus seat

Hi Jamie,

 

I redid one of the seats on my '69 last year. It had some broken springs as
well. I found another seat, and took the springs out of it, then passed the
seat onto someone else who was doing the same. 

 

If you are lucky you can find another seat, that is broken, and salvage some
of the springs from it.
