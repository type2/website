Subject: Helicoil time

Problem: hub to crankshaft bolt broke, drilled out, ez-out broke,  
dremeled out, big mess.

Condition: engine in Vanagon

Next step: use hub as a guide to drill for helicoil. I may add a  
bushing to the hub, in a jig held down by the three fan bolts.

Any words of wisdom?

Mark
