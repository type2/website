Subject: Reupholstering a 1968 Bus seat

Hi folks,
I have started to reupholster my seats in my '68 panel.  I have the seat
covers and the pads from Wolfsburg West.  I stripped the old upholstery of and
removed the covers.  I found that I have three springs broken and the foam pad
that was on the rear of the seat back has dissolved.  Does anyone know where I
can get these parts? Thanks.
