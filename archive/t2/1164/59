Subject: Tire deflation question

Hi All,

Opinion please:

While I hesitate to bring up the topic of tires given the last go'round,
this should be a fairly innocuous Q! Aside from removing the top of my
Riviera conversion, installing a taller garage door, chiseling out wheel
troughs (my HOA is not a fan of the last two), the only way I can think of
to get the Bus inside of my garage for storage while the engine is in the
throes of death rattles is to deflate the tires to compensate for the 1
1/2" excess height... about how much can one deflate a tire and move a
short distance without mucking up the sidewalls?

Thank you, Mike
