Subject: Odd Electrical Problem

I'm having a strange problem with my 1968 bus.  When I turn the key to
the acc position, the two dash lights go on as they should and the
fuel pump (I have an electric fuel pump) kicks on.  When I turn the
key to start the engine I get one click an all power goes out.

When I tried to jump it with my battery box - same results.  However,
I was able to jump start the car from another car.

I charged the battery over night with a trickle charger, and it
wouldn't crank. So, I left the charger on for an entire day, and it
started right up, but I had inadvertently left the charger attached
when I tried to start it.   When I removed the charger, it wouldn't
crank.

So, I went at bought a new battery, and it didn't solve the problem.
Same symptoms as before.  When I turn the key to start, all power is
gone.  One more point, when I have the key in the acc position,
turning the headlights on also makes the ignition and oil lights
(red/green) lights go out - no power to anything.

I don't even know where to start with this one.  Battery cables are
secure and the neg cable looks properly grounded.  Ideas?
