Mark,

Drill out the old thread and tap for a slightly larger bolt. It will make
the job simplified. When you are ready to install the new bold, dab some
anti-seize compound on it. :)

I would avoid the helicoil in that application. Helicoils are OK at best
and really don't work well on high heat and stress areas that need specific
torque settings.
