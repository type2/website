Mike,

The Vanagon case is a slightly different casting than a Bay window case but
the square-port heads are exactly the same. The motor can be used, but the
breather venting and dipstick location is different.

All your tin and FI parts will swap right over.

Here is a link to a photo of one converted

Hope this helps.
