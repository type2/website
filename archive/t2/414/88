Subject: loss of power

I recently got my bus back from impound. It was runnin perfect before it 
went in. Now it dies sometimes on startup. especially if i give it a little 
gas it will sound like its gonna be ok, but when I let off the gas it wants 
to die. This only happens sometimes. A lot of the time it is starting fine. 
But I am experiencing a severe loss of power. I can still get up to highway 
speeds, but it takes a while and is using a lot of power. It uses as much 
power to reach 20-30 mph as it used to use to reach 50-60.
thanks.
