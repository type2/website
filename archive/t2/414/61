Subject: Re: [T2] '72 seats up for trade

IN NORTHERN NJ (think Newark)...

(Because I hate it when the parts I want are in California...)
'72 seats... passanger's in good condition, driver's has a rip
and a broken 'S' spring. Frame's appear to be OK. Anybody
nearby use 'em? Won't fit my '79 and I have too much stuff.
If you can pick them up and have 'something' that fits a '79
(not too particular, I'll store something that fits a '79...)
email me...
