Subject: quick heating question

More questions.......
Too hot to think about winter, but I'd like to be able to use the bus year
round if I can.
I've got the '72-74 heat exchangers on my 78, and I'm pricing out what it
would take to put heat in. I need control boxes, the tube from the control box
to the exhanger, and do I need those elbow tubes that go on the side? I'm
assuming I need to buy the '72-74 components to fit the heat exchangers, but
will they fit the body?

Thanks
Mat
