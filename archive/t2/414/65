Subject: 27x8.5x14 BFGoodrich tires

I have a question about 27x8.5x14 BFGoodrich AllTerrain tires. Will they fit
to 1975 Westy without any body or suspension modificaton? I just "checked"
clearance and it looks they will fit but I need confirmation before I spend
$...
Thanks

Piotr
Westy '75

PS. I already read tires info at www.type2.com but there is no CLEAR
information.
