part of the problem is that VIN numbers now have 14 digits and the older
VWs' only have 10 and many computers kick em out automatically as
invalid.  I know when I go to the inspection station the vin is routinely
rejected and a manager has to come over and enter a special password and
overide the computer, funny thing is the computer prints out the correct
information based on the VIN when it is finally entered and accepted...
