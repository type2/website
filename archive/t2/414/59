probably, it depends on the resistance of the coil. there are directions
with the unit as to how to test this. if you don't have the original crane
or allison direction sheet, you can download it from the crane website, they
are very clear as to when you do and don't need the resistor.

i believe they are talking about the bosch electronic module, which was only
on 79 and later cal busses. ignore this as it doesn't apply.

i have two of them on cars. they work flawlessly in my experience. make sure
to follow the instructions on getting the signal in phase.
