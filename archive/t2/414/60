Subject: RE: [T2] Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

Regarding Bus Depot, they do have an option to 'expedite' an order. For a few
dollars more, they will process an order immediately rather than putting it at
the end of a list. It will ship ups ground and the price is somewhere between
the cost of ups ground and second day air. I placed an order this way and the
order was shipped that day and I recieved it 2 days later. They don't make it
obvious that this option exists so you need to inquire about expedited
shipping. Also, it would only apply to items in stock.
