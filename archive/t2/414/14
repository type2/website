I used the 091 Transmission and Input shaft, the 002 Bell housing (only
because I didn't have a 091 Starter)
and a 1974 1800 with the 1800 clutch/flywheel. The 091 input shaft is longer
and it makes the installing
the engine a bit more difficult, but just leave the exhaust, muffler and
rear tin off until the engine is in and
you can squeeze it in okay. I don't know if you can use the 091 Bell Housing
or the 002 input shaft as options
as I didn't try them. 10k and no problems. Oh and thanks for the heater
boxes David they're still on there.
