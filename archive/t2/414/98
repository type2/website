It's the door buzzer. It goes off when the key is inserted and the door is
opened.

The gray/black wire goes to a terminal on the ignition switch hence the
bundle. The grey wire goes to the black contact switch in the door-jam. When
the switch is closed it grounds the circuit and the buzzer goes waaaah.
