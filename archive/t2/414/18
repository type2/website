This isn't my vehicle, just one I've seen. It's a beautiful royal blue, 
looks perfect as one drives by. It's for sale by the owner of a bike shop 
I frequent. I hadn't posted about it as I'd only seen it occasionally and 
when it disappears, I figure it's sold. At any rate, I was in the bike shop 
the other day and it wasn't there, nor was its owner, but the guys at the 
shop told me that the owner is asking $15,000 for it. They reported 
that it has been appraised at $20,000. I have no idea what a vehicle 
like that ought to be worth and I apologize if I'm posting something 
laughably expensive. All I know is that it's a beautiful vehicle, a definite 
headturner. Were I rich, it would be mine.

The vehicle is located in Sequim, Washington on the Olympic 
Peninsula. I will make calls and do what I can to get pictures and info if 
anyone thinks they're interested.
