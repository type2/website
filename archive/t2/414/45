Subject: VIN # and stableizing rust

Hi all,

My son and I are making progress on our 74 bus.  We had a problem with the
wishbone in the front of the trani that our miracle worker at Bob's Bug shop
fixed.  (a bit expensive, but oh well). It is running well now.

Meanwhile we got a letter from our insurance # that says the manufacturer has
no record of the VIN # for the bus.  So this is a mystery we have to solve.  I
read some of the archives and thought maybe if I posted it here someone might
be able to help solve the mystery. . .

The VIN is 2242110330  on the title this number is preceded by 003 in
parenthesis.  I don't know what that is about.

Finally, we are going to work on getting the body stabelized over the summer.
What is the best way to stabelize rust?  Any ideas.

Bill
