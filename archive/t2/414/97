No. Although you follow the same basic procedure for finding TDC and
adjusting the valves in 1-2-3-4 order, solid lifters require a feeler gauge
to set the gap between the tip of the valve stem and the tip of valve
adjusting screw.

Hydraulic lifters require you to make contact between those two surfaces and
then turn the screw two more turns and no more.
