Subject: VIRUS UPDATE

Hello,

I recently found out about the BUGBEAR virus because it was brought to my
attention that some of the listees were receiving strange attachments and
where the messages were"FROM" were being faked by this virus.I recognized
the attachment as being an exhaust calculation for a project I worked on, "KPG
exhaust."
I have located the virus and it has been removed from my computer.
Thanks to all that showed their support and gave helpful advise.

Darren
