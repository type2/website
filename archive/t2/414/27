Subject: RE: [T2] Front License Plate

Laura,

Almost all late model buses that I have seen in Alaska, Washington,
Oregon, and California had their plates bolted onto their front
bumpers with the two bolts provided.  Although I have seen a few
westies with the front license plate mounted into the interior of
the spare tire which they mounted on the front.  Maybe there is
somebody with a plate holder, but I think that most buses just used
the bolts in the center of the bumper.  I am of the sentiment that a
plate holder would look much cleaner.  I have never much liked
mounting my front plate to my front bumper, because the plate tends
to hang lower than the bumper and occassionally will scrape when
pulling into a steep driveway from a level street.  Kinda hard on
the license plate.
