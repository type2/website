Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Question

> I've got a AW code 1800 MT motor which should be timed at 10 ATDC, however
 my stock distributor is no good. I've been using a later distributor marked
 in the RMMW
 catalog as 1974/1976-1978, 1980-1983 Non-CA Distributor # 0 231 170 093 for
 several k now with no problems. But due to a recent tune up and other
 problems, I'm back to retiming it and I think I've inhaled too much exhaust
 since the last time - Should the timing be  set according to the motor
 (10atdc) or according to the distributor (7.5btdc)?
 It sure runs cooler in the ATDC range, but doesn't seem to like 10 degrees
 as that makes it stall out.

Time it to the distributor you are using.
Set it to 7.5 before but make sure you do not have vacuum at the advance. Only ported vacuum goes to it
[vacuum appears after you open the throttle]. Your dizzy should have a single vacuum unit on it, correct? It
should have 581 stamped on the arm.
Your old dizzy should have had a dual vacuum unit on it. Probably was a 021-905-205J, Bosch 0231 173 009 or
VW 021-905-205N, Bosch 0231 181 005?
What is wrong with it?
