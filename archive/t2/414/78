Subject: bosch oil filters

Hi

I inherited some Bosch oil filters from a friend. They're both tagged as T2
72-79, 1700-2000cc engine filters. I have a '78 with a 2000cc engine, so I"m
assuming these will fit.
1. Anybody have bad experience using Bosch filters?

I've read that "some" engines are supposed to use a filter that has a
particular valve on it,
that apparently the Mann and Mahl filters have.
2. Anyone know if the Bosch filters have this valve?

Thanks
Happy 4th!

Mat
