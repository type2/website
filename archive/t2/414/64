Subject: Re: [T2] Front License Plate

Assuming that VWoA did not come up with a license plate holder of
themselves, I would expect them to use what they had on European buses:
clamps that srewed on the top rear edge of the bumper and provided mounting
brackets for the plate. They used two clamps - one on each side of the
plate. That would explain the bumpers without mounting holes - there weren't
any ...
