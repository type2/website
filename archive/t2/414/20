for an auto tranny don't forget to remove the half shafts and mark which
side they were on since the sides are different.  or get the rear wheels
off the ground, I know the manual says you can tow a short distance but
you are towing a 30 year old tranny with unknown conditions

no weight numbers, use "DEXTRON" auto tranny fluid.

works fine just as long as it says "DEXTRON" equivalent,  I use Mobil 1
synthetic auto tranny fluid in mine and have for some time

the final drive use 90weight gear oil but this is put in from under the
vehicle NOT the fill tube.

you have an early vacuum shift auto tranny and almost everything internal
is NLA, however it is exchangable with the later 010 auto tranny which is
still rebuildable

the 73 has vacuum shift so be sure to check the vacuum line that runs from
the side of the rear part of the tranny.  also the shifter linkage must be
very accurately adjusted since the detents are in the linkage in the front
of the bus (this was one of the major flaws of that design, later trannies
010 have the detents in the tranny.
