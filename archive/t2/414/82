> Well one short term fix it to buy a standard ignition switch at any FLAPs
for 5$.  You then pull and connect the wires to your switch.  A good place
to put it without drilling would be where the lighter goes.

I ran the ignition wires to the defroster switch in our bus.  It even lights
up when you pop it to start the bus (when the starter works).
