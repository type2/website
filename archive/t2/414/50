Subject: Crane / Allison elec ignition install ?'s

I have a 76 bus, and a black coil. 
Do I need to add a ballast resistor? 

Also, the directions say to disconnect and remove the OE Bosch module,
and to tape off the module plug and the plug at distributor on the OE
harness. What the heck does that mean? Are they just talking about the
condenser? 

Anyone who has already installed one of these, please, let me know. It
doesn't sound too complicated, if I can just understand some of the
terminology being used, I think I'll be ok.
