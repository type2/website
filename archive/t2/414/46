Subject: Re: [T2] VIN # and stableizing rust

Bill, I just recently registered my 79 camper and the previous state had 
made an error on the vin number on the title.  Florida has a mechanism 
whereby an employee of the tag office or an officer of the law can sign and 
affidavit verifying the VIN number.  You might wish to go to your tag 
office to get this straightened out.  the 003 is NOT part of the vin 
number.  Likewise, I don't see how your insurance people would be 
contacting VW to verify the vin number (maybe they do) but how?  do they 
write to the museum in wolfsburg?  Is sounds like a bureaucratic 
nightmare.  Fortunately, my tag folks were very nice and cooperative and I 
had multiple documents with the correct VIN number and an affidavit from 
the police.  Greg
