Subject: Buses Of The Corn Reminder, August 8-10.

Hi Volks,

Wow, it sure is summery around here! And a good thing too, as Buses Of 
The Corn is now only five weeks away. Start planning now to bring your 
Splitty, EuroVan, Baywindow or Vanagon to the best Bus event in Whitby, 
Ontario this August*.

Right now we have over 20 buses registered, but there's room for about 
4 times that many. We've reserved the entire group camping area at 
Heber Down conservation area, and that makes plenty of room for as many 
as can get there.

BOTC will feature lots of fun bus-oriented events: the Tie-Dye workshop 
on Friday and Saturday, FMBC Breakfast Burritos on Saturday morning, 
the Bus Camping Competition, Type2 driving challenge, Frisbee Golf, 
Scavenger hunt and the Corn Roast/Pot Luck Supper. And then we dish out 
the lavish assortment of door prizes!  Sunday everyone will pack up and 
many may head out to the Great Canadian Bug Show in Mississauga.

If you're planning on coming, drop me a line at 
busesofthecorn(-at-)pottsfamily.ca, or reply to this message.

I've created a .pdf flyer you can print to share with your 
internet-challenged bus friends, it's available for download at

Last year we had buses coming in from as far as Michigan, West Virginia 
and New Hampshire... If anyone needs info on route planning, border 
crossings, or reassuring that Buses Of The Corn is 100% SARS-free, 
please drop me a line and I'd be happy to help.

Buses of the Corn is sponsored by GermanSupply.com and the Full Moon 
Bus Club. Guaranteed 100% SARS and Mad-Cow free or your money 
cheerfully refunded!
