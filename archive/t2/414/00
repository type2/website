Subject: UPDATE::Re: [T2] Valve not wanting to adjust !!

I have solved the problem valve:
the valve was weaker then the rest of head #1.
Ichecked the valves to make sure they were level, they
were, I then removed head and took it to my local vw
house (Car Craft), had them install 4 new springs, 
reinstalled head, checked for clearance......... BINGO
!!
My valve adjusted without a prob. only cost me $20,
and a small piece of time.
They also sold me a shim kit just in case, this way I
could shim up rocker arm for clearance.. I will return
this kit un opened tomarrow..

I have the complete engine back together, tin painted,
new exhaust. This baby should run fine now... I will
post again after i install engine tomarrow..!!

thanx guys for your response..
