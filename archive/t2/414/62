Not all busses especially later models came with front licence plate holder
as it wasn't required by some states and then you have two model of busses.
One with holes drilled into the bumper with the plate attachment ready or
you have a solid bumper and no holes.

Also, I found out that if your car was produced with the non licence plate
front bumper and you move to a state where they require a front licence
plate you do not have to alter your OEM as it may cause a strucual falure(
doubtful, but it will work in court if the judge ask you). so dont go
tearing up your front bumber just to put a plate on if your bus was designed
not to have one.

Not saying the cops won't try to pick you up for not having it on there..
but all you have to do is show them a  bumber with no holes and also your
2nd plate stored in the car and they gotta go buh bye.

i know from way to much 1st hand experience and have thought a cpl of times
of adding the dang bumber licence plate holder.. but i refuse to put a drill
to my original condition bus !!!

Sorry, not meaning to rant or rave..just some times...
