I dug my Bentley out and looked at the illustration there, and I think I have
it figured out. a couple of question remain though. I have two different clamp
seal styles. One looks like braided metal wire, the other is some type of
solid material, like graphite. why the difference and which is better? I am
off to the flaps and muffler shops to search a replacement.

bought the Ernst kit from Bus Depot over a year ago. I used on of the clamps
from the kit to fix my aging tailpipe last year, so I am short one. There are
different clamps in the kit, and I am not sure which to use for which
connection. I have looked in the library and archives but found no complete
information. Which clamps go where? The old exhaust is so rusted it is hard to
tell. Are there any good illustrations available? Also, where would be a good
place to purchase some new clamps? I live in Brockton, MA, and there are no VW
flaps around. Are there any better clamps out there that people have used? I
have seen the article on using the welded on flanges, and do have a mig, so I
could go this route but I am trying to finish the job this weekend. How about
welding up the connections directly?
