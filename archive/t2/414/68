Assuming its still fuel-injected, I would do a complete diagnosis of the vacuum
lines. The one that usually pops off (that gives this exact symptom) is the line
from the brake booster to the air plenum (its actually a T fitting the other one
goes to the decel valve)...

If its not this one then go here (thanks to Richard Atwell):

and double-check EVERY hose.

If it still wont start, check ignition system...
