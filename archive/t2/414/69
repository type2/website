Subject: ingition switch

ok i figured it out. it was the ignition switch. i can run the bus now by 
starting it, then turning the key back to a contact point, it takes a few 
tries but i can usually get it.  My question is this. will it get 
progressively and quickly worse?  can i drive it for a week or two without 
getting stranded (as long as i'm willing to tinker with it 'til it runs).?  
How hard is the snip, add toggle trick?  on which wire would the toggle have 
to go?  how hard is the ignition switch change in late busses.  I don't have 
the tech manual and john muir kinda ran around late bus switch swap unless i 
missed something.
thanks again
