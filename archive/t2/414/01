Subject: 68-73 fuel sender needed!

Well, I pulled my engine and gas tank before I found out that the 211 
919 051 sender (fits '68-early '73 buses) is No Longer Available, at 
least not at the moment.  Ronnie told me that he's pretty sure they'll 
be back in production once the waiting lists get long enough.

Anyway, does anyone have a new or used (working please!) sender they 
would like to sell???

I can PaytPal, send gold bars, my first born male child, etc...
