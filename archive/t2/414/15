Subject: Distributor Question

I've got a AW code 1800 MT motor which should be timed at 10 ATDC, however
my stock distributor is no good. I've been using a later distributor marked
in the RMMW
catalog as 1974/1976-1978, 1980-1983 Non-CA Distributor # 0 231 170 093 for
several k now with no problems. But due to a recent tune up and other
problems, I'm back to retiming it and I think I've inhaled too much exhaust
since the last time - Should the timing be  set according to the motor
(10atdc) or according to the distributor (7.5btdc)?
It sure runs cooler in the ATDC range, but doesn't seem to like 10 degrees
as that makes it stall out.

Thanks,
Chris
