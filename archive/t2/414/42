DAMN!  I knew that stuff should be less.  I searched the internet and 
couldn't find it.  I called several local RV places and couldn't find 
it.  I called several places listed as dealers on the manufacturer's 
website, but they didn't carry this particular product.

But thanks for the link.  Maybe I'll need another bottle for my 
splittie Westy (if the stuff actually works)..
