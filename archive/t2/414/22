Subject: worst gas mileage ever

I get the worst gas mileage ever.  I recently figured out my mpg on a trip 
from NC to NJ. All highway miles. 14 mpg! I know that auto trannies are 
supposed to be less fuel efficiant, but this is outta hand. Any way, on my 
trip from CA to NC I ended up in a repair shop in SAcramento. The guys there 
adjusted the spring in the intake air sensor box.  Told me it would help me 
make it through Colorado and then I should set it back. Said it would run 
cooler but suck on gas. It sucks real bad on gas. How do I set this spring. 
I opened upthe air intake box, but didn't understand what I was looking at.
Thanks,
Kyle
