Subject: Re: [T2] 27x8.5x14 BFGoodrich tires

I have them on my '78 Westy, and they fit fine and look great.  I still have 
suspension problems somewhere, so I can't be a good source on how well they 
handle, but they kick butt in the snow.  They increase your gear ratios, so 
hills are harder to go up, but they do well on the highway, and have been 
very quiet so far.  Hope this helps!
