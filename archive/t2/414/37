Subject: RE: [T2] Front License Plate

I think Richard is right, as I have that bracket on mine also:

However, one of the very first invoices I have, from 1977, was the PO
taking the bus in to have holes drilled for the front plate. Not sure
where you had to get your bus from to have them pre-driller, but this
bus was a customer pickup in Germany, then brought back to the states.
Maybe Germany did not require front plates at that time.
