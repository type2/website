Subject: 72-73 Locking gap caps

I have 6 NOS locking gas caps for sale. Type 2 members get first  
crack at them:

These are the original style from OEM Blau. Made in Germany. $25/ea.

Fits: Bus 72-73

I haven't tried but according to the part number also should fit:

Bug 68-71-72 (but not Super beetle)
Type 3 68-72

I also have three sets of keys without gas caps. They are the same  
style as in the photo and the numbers are 226, 210 and 223. Hopefully  
I can find the caps for them but if not and they happen to match your  
cap I will let them go as well.
