Is your tank leaking,, or any of the hoses?  No welding allowed !!

If your welding from above,, there will be little to no heat transfer from 
the weld unless you blow thru with too much heat.  lol,,, so don't do that!

You could pack the area with [pink] glass insulation.. then there will be no 
sparks land on the tank.. or heat transfer. Soak the batt of insulation in 
water.. for an even better insulation ,, spark arrestor.

I have a heavy wool blanket that I drench in water and lay over the area 
when I have something I don't want damaged by sparks.

myself,, I don't have any worries about welding right on the tank,, so ,, 4" 
away is like a mile.

I don't know if I can be helpful with my comments ... but muffler shops use 
torches to cut out stuff that is right beside fuel lines, tanks. etc.
A torch should be making a lot more sparks than your welding...

If your really concerned about your ability to weld that close..elliminate 
the hazard,, or maybe a pro might do it for you once you have it roughed in 
place.
