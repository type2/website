Subject: instrument/license plate bulbs

Group:

Busdepot lists a 10 pack of instrument bulbs, N177512, 1.2W w/ wedge base.
I assume these cover most of the lights on the dash.

There is also N177222, 2W, metal base.
What is this for? How many would I need to replace all dash?

Lastly, what is the bulb for the license plate light?
