Subject: 2.0 SQUARE PORT HEAD

I'm looking for a head for my '80 vanagon.  I lost all compression on the 1-2
cyl. side, and I need a fair to good head to get it back up and running. I'm
getting ready to pull the head to get an exact cause, but I'm leaning towards
burned valves to due excessive vaccum leaks when I bought it.  Thanks.
