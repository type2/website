Subject: 78 bus won't start

78 bus problem.  I have installed the rebuild 2.0 and have spark and can 
smell a little fuel when cranking the engine.   But she won' start.   I 
went back to my pictures and found a wire attached to a tin screw by 
number 3 cylinder?   Is this stock?  if so where does it come from?  I 
can't locate a wire that would match up to this location.  I thought I 
did a great job of labeling every wire, but I guess not?  any ideas on 
the wire?
thanks in advance.
