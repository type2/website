Subject: RE: [T2] Best valve cover gaskets?

I think the general consensus is that cork is best. I
used to use cork without the adhesive, but the gasket
can get misaligned (I think it gets sucked into the
rocker arm area). Now I just scrape out the groove on
the cover real good, apply adhesive, insert gasket,
and clamp it onto the head. Let it sit a few hours or
overnight, and it lasts a long time and for many valve
adjustments.
