Sorry I read it wrong. Just make sure you have plenty of ventalation and  
your life insurance is paid up. No really. go to what ever extent you have to  
that will make it safe for you. The hassles of taking the tank out is nothing  
compared to what could happen if that tank blows. I'd recommend taking it out.  
Then you can drain it out and make sure it's clean inside. I recall you had 
some  issues with the fuel last year. Good luck and be careful.
