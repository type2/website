Subject: rear sway bar install

I know this is an oddball question but who else would I ask?

does anyone have (can anyone get) photos of a rear sway bar installed??  
I have a set of 3/4" bars bought used, the front mounts the same as 
stock (mmm, stable), but the rear requires brackets to be mounted, I 
haven't yet figured out where. . . it's not obvious to me from holding 
up the bar under the rear of the bus.  I need to fabricate angle 
brackets to mount to the lower spring plate bolts IIRC and can probably 
figure out the dimensions.  Also what are the dimensions of the end 
links (and especially the spacer between the bushings).

TIA,
Will A.

PS also have 83.5 vanagon waterboxer, starts fine but won't idle when 
warm.  what things to check.
