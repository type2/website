Subject: transport suggestions

Lurker here asking question. Have bought a 73 Camper and trying to get it 
from Iowa to VA. Not having much luck with the transportation broker. 
Arranged first day of pickup on January 23rd, and no move yet. Do any of you 
fine gentlemen (or ladies) have a transporter they would suggest for a 
running bus?

For me to take the time off work, arrange truck and trailer, gas and all I 
don't think it is feasible for me to go get it. Plus there are heat issues 
and brrrrrrrrrrrr, thats a long drive with no heat.

Thanks for any advice,
Morgan and his first Westy
