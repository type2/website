Subject: Compression sucks

Bah. I've been trying to get the GWB started after his "refresh" for a
couple weeks now (ok, just doinking mostly). No joy.

Today, I decided to systematically diagnose the problem. Here we go....

Spark: Fatty sparks both from the coil directly and each plug wire.
Plugs: Plugs clean, and spark well when removed and grounded.
Timing: Right at TDC. Can't do much better until I get it started.
Fuel: Even though I can see fuel gushing from the electric pump, I tried
gravity feeding from a gas can.
Carbs: double checked that all the jets were clean. Good squirt from both
accel pumps.
Compression: ahhh....

#1: 60
#2: 40
#3: 110
#4: 100

Note that these are at altitude. Add 15% or so to match sea level readings.

Needless to say, my 1/2 head isn't sealing for some reason. I'm taking a
break at the moment before tearing the valve train off again. Hopefully I
just assembled something incorrectly.

I hope.
I hope.
I hope.
I hope.
