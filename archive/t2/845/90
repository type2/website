Subject: ADMIN Re: [T2] A Steeler fan's view of SB XL calls

steelersbus36(-at-)atlanticbb.net has been removed from the type2 
list.  He obviously did not take my advice to re-read the charter 
but chose instead to insult other listmembers.  Let's keep it 
polite and on-topic please, and if anyone needs to vent do it to 
one of the admins directly, not to the list.
