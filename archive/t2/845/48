Subject: [T2] Bad hesitation and huge flat spot right after partial

THE AFM IS OK!!!!!   If you remember I also had the exploded muffer
post.....BOOM! another setback.
Alright, well I removed ALL of the vacuum lines except the one coming from the
air plenum to the fuel reg. (no "T")
and the one from the throttle to the air box...  So just those 2 lines and
every other port was plugged off...
Well the aux. air reg. was still there, but plugged off at the other side of
the air plenum..
I got right around 10"...  Sprayed carb spray around some more in more spots
and found a leak at the manifold.
I finally foun a leak in the right manifold and had to remove it only to find
the spacer was split...
New spacer and some mega black permatex and then the vacuum went DOWN!!!
What???
I then re-connected the rest of the hoses (without clamps) and started up, she
was then up to about 12"..
Although its not what I want, she drove a lot better...  I could at least get
her the 80 miles home..
Well she is driving now, she made it home and ran pretty good...  Up to about
85% full potential I would say...
I am certainly not out of the woods, but you all have shed light where I
needed it, thanks....
