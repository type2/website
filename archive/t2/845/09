Subject: Re: [VB] Feel tank w/water to weld?

Getting water out of the tank is the least of your worries. I have a friend  
who has welded many tanks. Putting water in and doing the thing. Except the 
last  time when he was welding it just as he has many times before and BOOM. It 
blew  him away from the tank. No injuries but, he doesn't do them anymore. 
Welding gas  tanks can be very very dangerous. 
Letting the tank drain and air drying will work just fine to get the water  
out. You can put gas or water separater in it and shake it up and pour it out.  
If you have it compressed air can speed up the drying process. Make sure 
there  is no water in the air line.
