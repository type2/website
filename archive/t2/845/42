Subject: Buses by the Beach - Bus BRR Next Weekend!!!

Hey, Volks!

Time pack up the bus with Mylar blankets, hand warmers, space heaters and
crock pots for chili and head to Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana on
February 11-12th, 2006!

The hardy (stir crazy) Buses by the Beach gang will be out in force on
Saturday afternoon getting the fire going, setting up the crockpot chili
cooking and saying hello to old bus buddies and making new ones.   We'll hit
the toboggan runs that afternoon.

Here is some information below to help you get there:

Weather forecast for Saturday and Sunday is high of 26-27 degrees, low of 20
and a chance of flurries both days.  Yeehah!  We plan on arriving by 1:00pm
on Saturday.  

Cost for campsites with electric hookup is $11.00.  We will be at sites
numbered in the 80's on campground #3.  There are clean pit toilets near our
campground.  

There is a $5.00 Gate Fee for Indiana plates and a $7.00 Gate Fee for
non-Indiana vehicles.

For those Volksfolks not arriving in a bus, The Pottawatomie Inn is
unfortunately full for the weekend of the 11-12th, but there is occupancy at
the Super 8 Hotel  on SR120 and the Ramada Inn (3855 N State Road 127,
Angola, IN (877) 965-5341 just a couple of miles from the park.  The Ramada
has a rate of $79.00 for one night and the Super 8 is even lower.

Beautiful Pokagon State Park has a dual refrigerated Toboggan run that is
more fun than driving a fully loaded Westy down a mountain road.  Speed of
40 mph are hit on the way down!

Cost for to rent a 4 person toboggan is $10.00 per hour.  We got in about 2
runs per hour last year.  We just carted the toboggans back up the hill, but
it is possible to throw them in the bus at the bottom and drive everyone and
the toboggan back up to the top and get in more runs.

Firewood is $4.00 per bundle.  We are having the park deliver around 8-10
bundles to our campsites and will pass the hat on Saturday evening to pay
for the wood.  Remember, due to the serious problem with Ash tree beetles,
you cannot transport firewood.  We have to buy it from the park.  Bring
musical instruments if you play!

If everyone brings either crockpot chili or dishes to pass we should have to
enough to eat after the toboggan rides.  There are picnic tables to set up
on and share our food.

Sunday Brunch at the lovely Pottawatomie Inn is 11.95 for adults and .75
cents x kids age to 12.  It is an awesome deal with very good food.  Brunch
is served starting at 8:00 until 2:00pm

Front gate is (260) 833-2012.

Pete's Cell Phone is (574) 286-0848

See you there!
