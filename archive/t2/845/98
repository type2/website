Subject: Re: [T2] transport suggestions

Morgan,

I had my bus and a jetta shipped from CA to TN this past summmer.

My company paid for it and I used the internet to find a shipping "broker"

These brokers bring the customer and the truck drivers who are basically
independent contractors together.

Needless to say, I had "issues" during the move.  Bad communication,
misunderstandings about time/place/money.  I was on the road to TN
when the bus was picked up so we couldn't go over VW "peculilarities",
and he completely reconfigured his delivery schedule every day I spoke to
him,
showed up 2 weeks early looking for cash even though my contract with the
broker specified that I could pay him by company check.

My advice is to attempt to eliminate the middle man and deal directly with
an owner/operator so you can hash out all the details.  Once you send your
money to the broker, they could care less about you.
