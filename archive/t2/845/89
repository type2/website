I apologize. Didn't know that people were so up tight on 
this site. I saw TWO OTHER football threads and thought 
I'd answer with mine. Being that all emails come the same, 
it didn't matter if it was a reply or a new thread. Guess 
the third thread is a charm.

Oh...sorry.....Buses, Buses, Buses.
