If you think it is that wire, or want to prove that it is getting fuel, just
bypass the fuel pump double relay, so the pump runs all the time.  Muir's
book explains the detail of this procedure.

There is no wire stock grounding to the tin, but there is a wire that is
supposed to ground in that area, by the double relay and the injector
resistors, to the wall.
