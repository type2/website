Subject: spring sprung on cab door lock

last summer my 69 sunroof door lock got so stiff i shattered my  
tumbler. i picked up, re-keyed,  and installed a used one on the  
road. but it wasn't until this week i got around to sussing out what  
was up with the lock. i'm glad i waited too because i wouldn't have  
had the part i needed where i was rehabbing this one.

this week i had some down time with the windshield rust repair/ 
headliner install on the doublecab [wind, rain, chill] so i snagged   
locks one at a time to get me out of the dank weather. after doing  
the doors on the doka i finally attended to the funky lock on the 69  
cab door today. i found it not only dirtyish but the spring on the  
locking mechanism was in half. no wonder it was stiff. luckily i had  
a donor spring from another lock. that saved a special run to my  
storage unit [boneyard]. getting it removed was a mcgyver moment; i  
mean forty-five minutes. what a crazy funky repair. but hey, if your  
lock is stiff, and you think its a dirty cylinder - that may be.  
however it pays to dig a little deeper. maybe pull the lock an  
inspect the spring[s]. if anybody needs details and photos, pmail.   
i'm so relieved i didn't have to hunt down that spring!   - steve
