Subject: Feel tank w/water to weld?

Just wanted some opinions:  I had to pull the T4 in the split to fix an oil
leak.  While it's out I'm installing a bay window service hatch.  My gas tank
(made by PO) is not stock or baywindow.  It's a square off (sort of) tank
about 20 gallons.  It is a PAIN to take out and get back in.  Feeling it with
gas to the top is not an option.  Wondering what everyone's opinion was about
draining and feeling with water, weld (about 1 hrs worth) draining it
immediately blowing air through it then first tank of gas run water remover?
My main concern would be rust developing inside the tank in that short time
but causing a problem down the road.
