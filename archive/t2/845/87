chai, you really seem to be upset with the loss of 
FMBC.com Lashing out at people on all the sites. No need 
to jump on me about a thread here about football. You made 
your point that you dislike football on buscapades. My 
favorite football team won their first championship in 26 
years. I know you dislike football, BUT there are some 
volks who enjoy chatting about it. I saw two threads about 
the game here on type2. Did you scold them also?

It's an American past time. Just like the past time of 
VWs. I apologize if I broke any type2.com rules. It's a 
once in a "moon" event. I apologize about being happy that 
my "STEELERSBUS" has something to be proud about.

BUT, if you need "bus content????????????????????"

Jerome THE BUS Bettis retired after giving us Steeler fans 
10 GREAT years of football. THE BUS was not only a great 
football player, but a even greater man off the field. 
Never once did THE BUS tarnish the image of the Steeler 
orginization. Always a respectful and upstanding guy. 
Great leader by example. Thank you BUS for the great 
memories.

Hope you cheer up soon.
