	I clarified with my neighbor on the situation and I was mistaken.
It was the body panels that had been replaced, not the engine.  The PO had
taken the VIN plate and applied it to new fiberglass panels that were used.
At some point this plate was shaken enough that it fell off and couldn't be
found.  With a new VIN being applied by the DMV, his vehicle was now
registered as a home-made type under the year the new VIN was applied.  
	Good and bad in his eyes.  Even though its registered under 1995,
they still let him follow smog regulations for a 1966.  Bummer part is that
he can't take advantage of Colorado Collector Plates which require you to
only smog the vehicle once during it's registered life in CO.  And you pay
for 5 years registration at a time.  Like my '63 DC, where it's registered
until '09 and will never have to smog again as long as registration is kept
up.

	The only case I have seen where an older vehicle was not registered
under the year it was produced, was my current neighbors 4x4.  The previous
owner had completely restored it but replaced the engine and maybe some of
the drive train with a newer one.  Somehow, it was registered under a later
year because of this.  I can't remember the details but maybe this will
spark someone's memory?
