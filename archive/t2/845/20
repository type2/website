Subject: Re: New engine, no fire

Hello guys

Since I was not able to find the problem my friend return the engine to the 
builder ( he is a fine old man who works on VW since 1958, amaizing) in 
order to find the problem with the #1 and 2 cylinders.
The engine was built by this experienced Sr. but he just did the long block, 
the accesories, I mean, dizzy, gen, spark plugs, manifold, etc.  were fitted 
by a not too wise young man who also works with VW not long ago I must say, 
who forgot to used the cooper seal at the right side of the manifold that 
goes to the cylinders 1 & 2 causing a main intake leak.
Thank to you all for the help, by now I learned a new lesson, the road of VW 
knowlege seems to be endless, that makes it fun.

Roberto
