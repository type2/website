 78 bus problem.  I have installed the rebuild 2.0 and have spark and can
 smell a little fuel when cranking the engine.   But she won' start.   I
 went back to my pictures and found a wire attached to a tin screw by
 number 3 cylinder?   Is this stock?  if so where does it come from?  I
can't locate a wire that would match up to this location.  I thought I
did a great job of labeling every wire, but I guess not?  any ideas on
 the wire?

I believe the 'wire' you found is the Temp Sensor II, the cylinder head temp sensor.

Look at your FI wire harness. Follow back from the 2 plugs going to the #3 and #4 injecters. Do you find a
single wire coming out near the two harness's going up to the double relay and the resister pack?

Where did you plug in that single wire?
