Subject: Re: [T2] Compression sucks

Don
your engine compression numbers are awful !
The engine should run ,,,

you didn't mention if you plugs are wet,, as in gas is getting to the 
cylinders..
you said... "Timing: Right at TDC. Can't do much better until I get it 
started."

You can set the timing at any degree,, same way you set it at TDC,, just 
start at 5 deg or 7 , or what ever,, in fact..  I would dump about 30ml or 
fuel in the throat of both carbs...you can measure that out of a gas can.. 
or you can just pump the accelorator till you have basically flooded the 
engine....  then hit your remote start button,, and while it is cranking 
over,, twist the distributor a little until you hear it pop, bang, fart,, or 
back fire in your face!
LOL,, careful you don't have your face over the carb[s] as it just might 
blow a little back at you.

You might have to crank it over for a minute or 2 ,, but once it pops, bangs 
or fires,,

then you know you have fire and gas in the hole... just a matter of getting 
the timing closer...

That will get it running,, as for dialing it in to run right.. I doubt you 
care... as the engine needs to come apart to correct the compression .... 
unless you need to adjust the valves...

hope that gets you going.
