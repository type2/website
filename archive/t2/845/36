Better than water is filling the tank with argon, helium, nitrogen or some
other inert gas.  You just put a hose in and let the argon flow for a
while before welding and while welding.  Flow has to be sufficient to
make sure that air can't get in.

If you're working inverted, helium is the best gas as the filler is on the
bottom.  If you're working upright, then argon is the best choice.  If
you're using nitrogen, make sure the flow is sufficient that you can feel
it coming out of the inlet.

This is something for someone who knows what they are doing.  Be sure you
do before proceeding.
