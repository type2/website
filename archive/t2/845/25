   Not an older Landie?

I'm familiar with some tales of British cars languishing in showrooms
until sold...They then were registered as the year sold, rather than
under the manufactured year...i.e. a car built in say 1965 is regis-
tered as a '66...

OTOH, I've got a '66 MG Midget that fits into an envelope...Both
VINS (chassis and door jamb) were held on with screws and the
NJ title matches them...All it needs is a car to slip under them... ;-)
