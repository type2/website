$$

The are five factors here:

1) the rear drains must be open to allow water to flow out of the roof.
2) the front drains must be open to allow water to flow out of the roof.
3) The felt 'seal' must be in good condition to keep debris out of the
mechanism.
4) Both NLA sunroof cables must function perfectly in order for the rood to
function.
5) You must have patience and $$ to own a sunroof bus.

>what is the availability of parts??  - steve

LOL

------

Water actually freely flows into the roof with the sunroof closed and then
drains out through the tubes. The seal is (was) $125 if you can find one. Cables
are still available through certain unmentionable auction sites and ofcourse,
boneyards.

Is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY! There is nothing like driving a sunroof bus. (Unless
it has 23 windows too!)
