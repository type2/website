Subject: Squeeks and brakes

Question 1: Ashley ('71 Dormobile) has a squeek, more of a squeel perhaps
that I can hear when I take my foot of the accelerator and have my window
open. Isn't brake or clutch related and seems worse after a run than when
standing but is intermitant. I can't make it happen on the drive and can't
hang out of the back to look in the engine compartment when I am driving !

I suspect that it is coming from the dynamo, possibly a bearing run dry.
Does this make sense ? How bad is this ? I took the front of the pulley off
but couldn't get the back bit off - does it come off or is it built in ? If
I am correct, I assume the dynamo has to come out, how big a job is this ?

Question 2: How easy is a conversion from single to dual circuit brakes ? I
already have later disks on the van and have replaced all the components
apart from the master cylinder. Is the change just a case or replacing this
and pluggin the pipes into the new ports ? I just think the improvement in
safety will be worth it. This is a UK Van and so didn't get any of your US
vacume booster technology as we're all butch enough to push a pedal without
it :-)

Thanks
