Yes it is.  My refrigerator does this - I can leave it hooked up 
to 12V and when 110V is present, it triggers a relay (I think) and 
runs off of 110V.  I haven't bothered to wire the inverter up that 
way though - I just have a separate outlet for it and since 
nothing stays permanently plugged in, I just plug stuff into 
whichever outlet has power at the time.  Lame I know, but it works 
for me.

Yes, the blowers take a lot of electricity.
What about

Don't use anything that's not externally vented unless you like 
condensation, headaches, and possibly even dying an early death.
