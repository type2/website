Thanks Jim,
Any way to discover whether the low-VOC replacement will have the same
properties for this job?

Called my local SW rep after digging around on the web sites.  The B54 
line is still made but the W line is discontinued and phased out in any 
area with VOC rules.  B54 Z 101 is what is listed in their listings now 
as a low VOC HS replacement.  Here in denver the old style is still 
available at a couple of stores.
