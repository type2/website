Subject: Re: [T2] strange speedo

On the odometer there are a couple of things that will do it.  The reset 
button jammed a gear when it was pushed, or the drive gear inside for 
the odometer section has popped off or broken because of a jammed 
gear..  neither effects the operation of the speed section.   both 
require disassembly of the speedo.  Not worth the trouble normally.
