Hi all
This may be a stupid question...but I have 2 vans...and when I go to get 
parts for them ...well right now just the 1980 ...the parts store needs to 
know what kind of van...I have a 1980 vanagon...and a 1978 transporter...I 
think??? this is where I get confused...is there anyway to identify the 2 
vans ???...not from each other...that's not the problem.....some info on the 
title??? on the registration???...I've heard of all different kinds of names 
...the $64,000 question is ???...what am I really driving ??? ...hope someone 
out there can help ! ...thanks !!!
