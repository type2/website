Good advice. I'm working ont he exhaust at the moment too. I'll get my
heat exchanges off and to this as you recommend. Do you know what size
bolts you used?

Ironically, I tried Threads of the South in Atlanta and they claimed not
to have much for 1.00 pitch. They didn't even have a tap. Ace had MUCH,
MUCH more.

These aren't expensive items, but it's VERY annoying having to run to the
hardware store, putting it together, and having it come back apart after
30 minutes of drive time...
