Subject: Re: [T2] Gap between steering wheel and column. Why?

I had to adjust mine as well. Here is what I think is the problem. As
it turns out the entire body (the stuff under all the plastic)
actually moves up/down & is held in place by an allen bolt. you will
have to loosen the bolts holding the column to the dash & the one
attaching it to the front clip of the bus. then take an allen wrench &
put it in the hole kinda close to where you might hit your knee
sometimes. loosen it up & try to get the column body to move up. This
worked for me. I actually used a punch to "help" move the body. but
now the horn works fantastic.
