For Transporters:

1977: 227 2000 001
1978: 228 2000 001
1979: 229 2000 001

Not sure what the numbers are for vanagons, but it could be guessed that
they would continue in the same pattern.

Also, if you know if your engine has solid or hydraulic lifters that would
be a good clue, as 1977 buses are solid and 1978+ are hydraulic.

good luck,
Blaine
