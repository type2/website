Subject: Re: [T2] getting a sunroof in order

>sunroof sealed up with silicone
I have a sunroof bus that was latex bathroom caulked shut when I got it.  I 
got so lucky.  I spent the time getting out all the caulk out, which by the 
way DAP's Caulk-B-Gone product helps allot with if anybody ever runs into 
the problem (Doesn't work with silicone though), and everything worked fine! 
  The only problem was that the drain holes were plugged up.  I have all but 
one of them free now, and I am confident the other one will fall in line 
shortly.

>or is it a gasket?
I think you can substitute the felt seal that they mention with carefully 
checking, cleaning, and lubricating all of the mechanism every time you 
change your oil; if you don't mind spending the half hour.  Correct me if 
I'm wrong list, but it's whole purpose is to keep out the dust and dirt from 
the cable tracks.  You can do that on your own if you have the patience.  
Use a lubricant that does not attract and hold dirt like grease does.  I use 
a special sunroof lubricant that I found online, but I can't seem to re-find 
for you today (sorry).

Good luck,
Jay
