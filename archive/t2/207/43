You have to look around for "parts cleaner" but you *can* find it.

Look in the phone book under "oil marketers" and then call...ask who they 
deliver to that has what you want.

And *please* do not dump it.  I live in the country with a water 
well....if i dump it, i drink it.  yeccch!

The local county hazardus waste disposal folks are great.
Left about 6 gallons of parts cleaner with them about a month ago.
They don't want it in the ground either!!!

Cheers, dave

At any rate I buy them both from the local Exxon distributor (their the guys that sell the gas and oil to the service stations, so any brand will have it), there in the yellow pages under Oil Distributors. Another good thing, it costs less.
