Subject: re:partly camper

Thanks dude, your reply is really usefull.  Since you have a Z bed perhaps 
you could clear up another thing for me.  From what I have seen, the base 
looks basically like a normal seat, but they have special floor plates on 
either side that the seat slides on, correct?  Most of them seem to be from 
the campers, and therefore they have about a foot less width where the 
cabinet is on the side of the bus.  If I bought one of those, do you think 
it would be possible to retrofit the slide plates from it onto a standard 
bus seat, thus maintaining the full width of the seat in the back?  Or would 
it simply be time better spent to search around for a full width Z bed seat?

Jay
