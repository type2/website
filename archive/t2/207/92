Well, that's a new one on me. I do know that if you hold a piece of
plastic or plastic market bag up to the old style flat louvered vents
with the engine running, the vacuum created inside the engine
compartment will hold it there when the compartment is properly sealed.
At least that was the case with my old 62 bus, which did have
aftermarket scoops installed, as did a lot of them in those days. On the
other hand, it may well be that hot air escapes through the old vents
when driving at speed as the laminar flow of air passing over the flat
vents may create a more powerful vacuum than that created by the intake
fan. Never ran alongside to find out. But even if it did, my guess is
that it was a design flaw on the early bus because I'm quite sure the
vents were there to admit cool air for carb intake as well as engine
cooling. 

Last observation is that I can only assume the vents were put out into
the airstream in later models to act as air rams to force air into the
engine compartment. The designers could have stuck them out for looks,
but I suspect it is a modification done by the engineers to increase
flow of cool air into the compartment.

Anyone have any real data on this? I don't.
