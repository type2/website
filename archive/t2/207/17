Subject: Trip to yosemite oil temps and a eurovan

Took my 79 to Yosemite last week and had a great time there. Getting there 
was good too.
Bessie ran at about 210-215 on the flats (-at-)65-70mph (32-3400rpm), in 100 degree 
plus weather.
Pulling up the biggerhills though she ran at 245-255. This was in second gear 
going 30-33 mph (35-3800 rpm).
This is with an external oil cooler. I am sort of tired of the oil temp debate 
so if that is too hot oh well etc....
In general I felt like she ran like a top......!
	What is more pressing is that my wife, child and I roasted. We are also taking 
a trip to Lassen and Oregon this
summer and I am actually thinking about taking our subaru wagon. I guess I 
am just old and can't handle the
elements like I used to (back when I had a 71 Westie  that I took all over 
the north west).  Any thoughts on
cooling the inhabitants (yeah I know drive at night etc...).
	I also started pricing the eurovan. Anybody have any experience with it, or 
is that a different list? Any one know
if there are aftermarket cots or other ways to make another bunk.

	Oh yeah, in reading the thread about Brian's 79 and the whole in his tin 
and his question about the thermostat tab, I did
not hook up my thermo and am now wondering if the tab up is correct???????
	I also lost a couple of the sheet metal screws holding up tin on the passenger 
side of the bus. Have not checked if these
are stripped holes, but if they are not, would red lock tight prevent future 
slipage??? I will use bolts head screws rather than philips
so I can loosen them when I need to.
