  The low VOC has been a pain to the pro painters. however in this case 
the replacement is actually a higher grade product with higher solids.  
from the spec sheet it reads better.  I have a feeling it has a 
corresponding higher price tag as well.  I noted that when i was doing a 
paint job on the house that higher solids meant 15 to  20 percent higher 
price.
