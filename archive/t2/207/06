Subject: Re: [T2] I need a FI Gas tank bad.....  and NYC AIRS people request

I will be in NYC this weekend. Let me know where I can drop it off. At someone off the AIRS lists house, preferably and not too far off of 95. No charge. I believe it to be in good shape but I would treat it to make sure.
BTW... Anyone in the NYC area wanna let me crash in their driveway for two nites so I can catch the String Cheese Incident shows at the Madison Square Gardens shows without having to drive to a campground?
Peace,
