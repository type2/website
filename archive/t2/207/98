Subject: Replacing front wheel bearings-tips

We got our Westy with 60k mi on it, and I finally decided to replace the
front wheel bearings as one wheel was loose and would not tighten up
without creaks.  Spent 5 hours to reach the stage of replacing the hubs-
removed the wheels, brake pads, blew out the dust and crap, compressed
the pistons, removed and hung up the calipers, removed the rotors (phew,
the allen bolts came out), removed the hubs, and cleaned, cleaned,
cleaned everthing......turns out one outer bearing race had pitting on
one side, and the roller bearings were all teribly pitted too-haddda run
hot that way.   The other side was quite clean but darkened.  Both inner
races/bearings looked good.  A fender washer fit the inside of the small
bearing race fine, and I beat out the small races with a socket on a
1/2" extension.  The larger one required a punch to be used in circles
until it came out.  I dug out my 25 yr old pipe pieces I had used
intitially on the 71 Westy, which are about 4" long and sized to fit the
races so they can be tapped in.  I took the old races and ground them
down so they would just fit within the race lands.  So as not the stress
the pressed in lugs, I used a stepped 1"13/16th socket stood on a vice
anvil; it just fits inside the small bearing land.  I held the pipe over
the new races and tapped it with a sledge- after it was flush, used the
old race as a guide for the pipe.    Went in fine without resorting to
heating the hub and cooling the race.  The stubs of the axles have a
groove worn in the bottom due to upward stress the inner races pushing
up- but the good side rolled fine this way.  Might induce a slight
camber change, but I had the wheels aligned already recently.
