Not to defuse a brewing flame war, but Auto Zone will take just about 
anything besides nuclear waste, no cost to you. There is a big tank back 
there by the overhead door, they'll show it to you and ask for your 
phone number, and some idea of what you're dumping on them.

There are now smallish generators built for the sole purpose of taking 
the offal from car maintenance, heating it up, and turning it into 
electricity. Co-generation; the utilities are required to buy the 
electricity back.

I hope that is what Auto Zone does with it. Can't say for sure.
