Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line question

Well, the non-Calif 'bird beak' [the right angle rubber at the top of the
filler pipe] does not have a fill-pipe restricter to allow only the smaller
unleaded nozzles to fit. Back when air was clean and sex was dirty, the leaded
nozzles were a lot bigger in diameter. In the early/mid 70's leaded gas was
still available and they did not want you to destroy the cat, so they put a
restricter in the neck. Now adays here in the USA, all you can buy is
unleaded, so you won't be able to put leaded fuel in. But most Calif smog
check inspecters go by the book. They have to inspect and make sure the
restricter is there....even though you can't buy leaded fuel. A lot of them,
however, don't check anymore. You take your chances.....
I did find a metal plate on a bus one day, the plate that goes on the outside
and is held on with 4 screws and the cap turns in it, that had a built-in
restricter. Neat piece, I grabbed it, but I have no idea where it went. It was
a VW part. I will have to look for it and see if it has a useful part number
on it.
