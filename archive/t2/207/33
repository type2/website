Hello,
On my 79 Riviera, this screw-off cap is for the drainage outlet from the
indoor sink.  I don't know if you have a sink or not but if you do, check to
see if your bus also came with a small drainage hose (mine was stashed
somewhere near the fresh water tank -- looks like a mini garden hose) whose
head screws onto the fitting when you unscrew the outside cap.  Works pretty
slick when washing dishes inside the bus.
