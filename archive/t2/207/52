Subject: getting a sunroof in order

 
--Steve,

I'm workin' on my '79 deluxe sunroof now. Rust will likely be an issue all the way around. Mine was surface and is manageable. The 'roof has drains at all four corners thru the 'b' pillars up front and into the air scoops in the back. so it's not really "sealed" perse. There is a felt 'seal' around it, but I believe it's more for dust and wind than anything. Probably not available as a vw part, but replaceable with similar materials.

If your's is siliconed, it's probably because the drains clogged and backed up, not really a leak.

Check the cables out, as they are 200-300 bucks new, and not a hardware store type of thing. Mine are in good shape. New handles can be had, but check the mechanicals inside the escutcheon.

I can't wait to get my sunroof on the road.

Go for it!

Billy
