You can go to any automotive paint supplier and buy the color you want
and buy texturizer that mixes with the paint. It will give you the same
finish that the gel coat provided. Just read the instructions and test a
few spots on that old ice box in the garage to get the texture you want.
No FuFu required just stock stuff.
