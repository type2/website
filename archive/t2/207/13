Hello List,

Thanks for your thoughts on my exhaust question
regarding my 914 2.0L. I have broke down and decided
to buy an exhaust settup that is made for this engine.
The system that I ordered is not stock but it will
probably be more suited for my engine than the 1.7 bus
exhaust that I have. Here is a link to the exhaust.

Instead of using a cat. with it, I ordered their cat
replacement pipe. 

Anyhow, thanks for the link to this awsome sight. Have
a great day!

David Kelly
