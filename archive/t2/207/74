As for the FI cleaner, look in the archives for a thread on Redline 
additives.  I HIGHLY reccomend the SI-1.  If it isn't available to you, use 
the Chevr*n Techron, available at most FLAPS.  Change the seals.  Leaks can 
cause amazingly difficult to find symptoms.  Besides, they're easy to 
replace.  Just order the tool to remove the injector when you order the fuel 
line(try Bus Depot).
