On my '79, on the exterior, from the front door moving toward the rear,
I have:
 
1.	Fresh air vent for the Coleman heater (down low, about a foot
above the frame)
2.	Higher up, about door handle height, is the hose fitting intake
for the fresh water, but it's inside a white plastic housing that has a
plastic lid.
3.	Another white fitting for 110 power hookup.
4.	A second white plastic housing for fresh water with pull-out
tray that you can pour water into in the absence of a hose connection.
