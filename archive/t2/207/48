Subject: fuel line question

 
Karl has been filling me in on fuel lines, but I will post our last few emails to the list, as it is very valuable info:

Me:

yes 76 bus, okay, the tube is metal right? I forgot. So just a few inches to make the bend. But do you know the OEM size so I can try to match?

what about the filler neck? I know busboys has the non-catalytic version only (I have a cat) but whats the difference? Can I use their non-cat version safely? Any other parts I need for a full fuel line replacement?

Karl:

>What year bus?  If it is a 76-79, then you only need a special hose >on the tank end. It is about 4" long but it has a bend in it.
>NLA......


Me:
>>about the gas filler hose. I believe it is 52 or 53mm, but that >>metric size won't be easily found, so 2 1/4" is the correct
>>american size right? Need about another meter/yard?
