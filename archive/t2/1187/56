That sounds about right.  It's a serial 1/8th inch connection if I 
remember correctly, so you can't hook it up wrong.  You do have to 
install the termination plug.

If you manually move the flapper in the AFM while the engine is running 
(lift off the cover and push on it), does the afr drop?  It should 
probably drop until about 14 or 15:1 at which point the engine should die.

I'd recommend google docs because it's easy to use and people can add to 
it as well.  Google accounts are free, so all you need to do is go to 
google.com and create an account - super easy and then you can create 
the document online.. plus it's easy to share as well.
