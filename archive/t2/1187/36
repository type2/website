And mean check and measure the sensor values through the harness, not 
check that harness has continuity.  I would also post up all the test 
values as requested in the previous emails.  *Nothing* should be assumed 
to be working within spec.

If you haven't already done so, I would recommend starting a bus testing 
document and post it up on Google docs and make it public.  In there I 
would specify the test done, the results, and the dates.  I would also 
outline any changes.  All these email replies back and forth to various 
emails about what you've done makes it very confusing to know what has 
been changed/tested/verified.

But before changing the AFM, especially if you have an AFM that's been 
calibrated, I'd start with all of the other EFI parts to make sure that 
the ECU is getting good data.  This includes all the connections.

Just lay the back seat down and test from the inside of the bus :)
