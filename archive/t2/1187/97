Subject: brand new coil-distributor wire of 6000 ohms instead of  less

Hi guys,
I Checked my ignition wires and find out that the ignition 
coil-distributor wire has a resistance of 5000 ohms.
the official repair manual said that it should not be greater than 1200 
ohms.
I went to my favorite VW shop to get new Bosh wires and out of 
curiousity check the resistant of the brand new coil-distributor wire . 
the resistance was even worth : 6000 ohms .

Does any one tell me what to do ?

Thanks a lot and have a great WE (I am heading to Yosemite) !
