Subject: Product report : KMM branded rear wheel cylinder 211 611 047 D

Just a quick heads up on this wheel cylinder. My OEM cylinder decided to puke
a half reservoir of brake fluid all over the place, so I dutifully went into
my parts stash and found I had two replacements from KMM (generic importer,
who knows where these were made). It looked very well made, but when it came
time to mount it to the backing plate, I went through my complete repertoire
of mechanics language, and was moving on to navy language before I finally
realized that the threaded mounting hole for the wheel cylinder was off by
about 1/16". This was enough to prevent me from threading the bolt in. I was
finally forced to oval the mounting hole in the backing plate the 1/16" to get
it to mount up. NOT impressed. Not the best thing to do, but since it's
Sunday, and the locals just look at me and drool with vacant questioning eyes,
I was forced to improvise. So there's your heads up on this product. Maybe I
just got a bad one.
