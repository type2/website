yes I have a brand new AFM uninstalled and am phutzing with a known 
operating one.  I have been leaning it out, but am pretty much at the end 
of adjustment range.

was out driving before I got these e-mails and if there is any good news 
it is that the readings (10.1) are pretty much rock steady at all RPM 
ranges and moves richer when I back off the gas.

is calling for rain next couple days so not sure how much I will be able 
to do in the short term.
