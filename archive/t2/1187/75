Perhaps I can clear this up a bit. :-)

The code is  list1e  and it gives list members 5% off most orders over $50.
The idea is to largely offset your shipping cost so your order ships free or
almost-free. Almost everything is included. The exclusions are sale items
(denoted by the "sale" icon on the website), special-order or made-to-order
items (generally identifiable by shipping times of longer than "1-3 working
days") tires/wheels, gift certificates, and orders that you have applied
another discount code to (you can't "double dip").  The sale items, etc. do
count toward your $50 minimum even though they themselves do not get the
discount.

The code goes in the "referral code" field on checkout. Please do not
publicize it beyond the list, as we do not offer it to the general public.

Any questions, please feel free to email me!
