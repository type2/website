If you look at the left column, it tells you what terminals are being 
tested.  So the first is testing the trigger wire which connects to the 
coil by checking that there is continuity in the line.  The second is 
testing the throttle switch by testing the resistance between terminals 
3 and 18.

I would also have your bentley handy because the values change slightly 
from year to year, especially for the AFM, or "air sensor circuit" as 
it's called on the sheet.

This should make the harness/component testing go pretty quick.  Post up 
your results when you get 'em (preferably in a google doc or similar)
