Subject: [Q] Insurance

All-

Am trying to complete my '71 Westy, and am checking on insurance.  Guess
what!?  State Farm will only insure my bus if I don't drive it!

So, why don't I call Hagerty's or Grundy's?  Well, they won't insure my bus
either if the intent is for it to be a daily driver...

What the wisdom in this group recommend?
