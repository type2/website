Type2 Library has the Bosch L-Jet FI manual.  Print pg 40.
Go with pg 40, a VOM and a pencil to your FI brain's harness.
Test and write down all the measurements for reference.  Fix
something and measure again.

One advantage for electronic shop manuals.  Print a few pages
needed for the workshop.  Make notes on them, get them dirty,
no problem and at the end of the job, recycle them.


    I hope it helps somebody keep their FI bus on the road
