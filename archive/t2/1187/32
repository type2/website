Before you do any tests or start the engine, I would like you to measure 
and post the resistance of temp-sensor II relative to engine ground and 
also do the same for the AFM using the testing procedure to check the 
resistances as specified in the Bentley FI chapter.  Make notes of those 
values and then do the same tests again, but this time do the tests at 
the ECU end of the harness to verify that the values are still the same. 
  Post the values to the list.  While it's a pain to test these values 
through the harness, we're verifying that you're not getting some nasty 
resistance via the harness.

*Everything* needs to be methodically re-verified.  Something is getting 
overlooked - now we just need to figure out what it is.

re-read what I wrote - you're not starting the engine for this test.

Checking the spark plugs is more of a sanity check to verify that the 
engine is indeed running really rich and the AFR meter is reading correctly.

Well, it shouldn't be stalling at 13:1!  Obviously you're only going to 
move it a little bit to lean out the mixture.  This is also to confirm 
that the AFR meter is responding correctly.  Also, if you can't start 
the engine without the cold start connected, connect it, start the 
engine, and then disconnect the cold-start plug and then do the test.

Ok, well, let's keep at it.  There's only so much that can go wrong with 
this thing, and *something* isn't acting right - we just need to narrow 
it down to the problem component.

Well, the thing is, before you were completely guessing as to where the 
fuel was going.  Now we've confirmed that it is going into the engine so 
that limits the problem (i.e. we're not guessing as to whether it's 
ending up in the oil, being stolen, etc).  Plus, yes, there are 
long-term benefits to having the AFR meter.
