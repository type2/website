I can testify about the crap ignition switches! I've replaced the switch in
the beetle 3 times in the last 18 months!!

BTW.. Thanks to Jim I got a non Chinese switch as a back up and keep it in
the car with the fan belt for emergencies!

Probably one of the finest supporting arguments I've heard about not
using KMM (Kevin Mackey Manufacturing) Hydraulic products (China,
Mexico, etc.,) I've ever heard.  None of their hydraulic products are
made well, they leak or don't mount up well among other reasons, which
is why haven't carried their stuff in either my inventory or at
Airhead Parts in a LONG time. Stick with OE ATE/FTE or Brazilian Varga
and you will be a lot happier.

Their 68-70 Ignitions are a particular abortion, they love to fall
apart on the inside after about 6 weeks of use.

Their Wheel Bearings and Bug Running Boards have been good in the past
decade though.
