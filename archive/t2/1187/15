Subject: Rear Side Window Seal - Anyone Need one?

I have one left over from some recent bodywork I did in that area.  It is the
OEM VW seal from Bus Depot   "Rearmost Side Window With Vent Wing, Stationary
Portion Only. Euro look (no chome molding). Part Reference Number:
221845343C".  Fits left or right side.

For some reason, this seal would not work on my bus - it was too thick to fit
in the window opening.  Other than attempting to install it in my bus, it has
not been used.  I bought a seal from a different supplier to solve my problem,
but who knows, this one may work in your bus.  No reasonable offer refused.

Contact me off list if interested.

Rusty
