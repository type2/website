Subject: RE: [T2] Cancel Ring 71 bus

I have played with this numerous times to no avail.  On my '73 Campmobile
the cancel ring appears to engage the white plastic bar/tab that extends
from the stalk housing when the turn signals are turned on.  There are two c
shaped spacers that appear to provide more structure for the plastic housing
and take the brunt of moving the stalks.  One spacer has a knub, for a lack
of a better word, that appears to engage a slot on the steering column so
just the torque on the housing is not the only thing holding it and
preventing the housing from rotating when turned on.  Mine do not cancel
either.

If someone could give us more details it would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Tom 


Is the purpose of  the cancel ring in the steering wheel to return the turn
signal lever after you finish turning? MY signals stay on and I think it
might be that the turn signal housing is not close enough to the steering
wheel.
