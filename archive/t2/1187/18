Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Product report : KMM branded rear wheel

Probably one of the finest supporting arguments I've heard about not
using KMM (Kevin Mackey Manufacturing) Hydraulic products (China,
Mexico, etc.,) I've ever heard.  None of their hydraulic products are
made well, they leak or don't mount up well among other reasons, which
is why haven't carried their stuff in either my inventory or at
Airhead Parts in a LONG time. Stick with OE ATE/FTE or Brazilian Varga
and you will be a lot happier.

Their 68-70 Ignitions are a particular abortion, they love to fall
apart on the inside after about 6 weeks of use.

Their Wheel Bearings and Bug Running Boards have been good in the past
decade though.

> Just a quick heads up on this wheel cylinder. My OEM cylinder decided to
puke a half reservoir of brake fluid all over the place, so I dutifully went
into my parts stash and found I had two replacements from KMM (generic
importer, who knows where these were made). It looked very well made, but when
it came time to mount it to the backing plate, I went through my complete
repertoire of mechanics language, and was moving on to navy language before I
finally realized that the threaded mounting hole for the wheel cylinder was
off by about 1/16". This was enough to prevent me from threading the bolt in.
I was finally forced to oval the mounting hole in the backing plate the 1/16"
to get it to mount up. NOT impressed. Not the best thing to do, but since it's
Sunday, and the locals just look at me and drool with vacant questioning eyes,
I was forced to improvise. So there's your heads up on this product. Maybe I
just got a bad one.
