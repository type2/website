Been there, done that.

I once almost ended up stranded in the middle of Kansas on a  
cross-country roadtrip because of a warped valve cover until a beetle  
owner who happened to be driving by stopped to help me out.

Another time I had to stop at a Sheetz and fashion a new gasket out of  
cardboard, which when coupled with a copious amount of RTV was able to  
sort out a deformed valve cover gasket.

So I've gotten to the point where I:

(a) always start her up and let her run for a couple of minutes,  
keeping an eye on the gasket, any time after I pull it;

(b) carry 3-4 new gaskets and tube of RTV silicone sealant (high-temp); and

(c) carry a new valve cover.

I don't always use the RTV, and when I use it I try to make sure I  
don't over use it so pieces of it won't get sucked into the oil,  
but...yeah.

Watch those valve cover gaskets. :-)

Safe travels Bob!

Cheers,
    Tom
