Sorry for the confusion.I have two 'buses' one a '65 kombi. One a '69
singlecab.

 

The '69 singlecab was having problems with the shifting, and the '65 needed
the new steering damper bushing(and now some repairs to the shift rod, and
some missing seals)

Was he?   I think that got skipped in the message, and I lost track.    :)

 

It does have the correct shift coupler for a bay.

FWIW, I once had a 59 SC that had a late shift coupler on it.    When
replaced it with the early version the shifting improved.

Wasn't the OP working on a baywindow?  So the correct coupler would be the
later 
(cage style) one...
