Subject: RE:Hard shifting continues...

Ok-to clarify this is about my '69.

 

Was writ - "Looks like you are missing the rear seal which helps keep
dust/dirt from getting into the shift bushing in nose of transaxle.  Also
missing safety wire on the rear coupler, and front coupler is loosely safety
wired"

 

Could you help me out-what is the seal part that you are referring to?

The safety wire, can this be just galvanized wire, or should it be Stainless
Steel Wire?

 

I have been to a couple vendor sites-to try to get all the seals along the
shift rod that are either missing or appear to be split. As my '65 also has
some split seals, I figure I should do them both. I would like to make sure
I order all the right seals, so I don't have it apart, and then realize I am
missing a seal.aside from taking it apart, how do I figure out all the
correct seals to get. In my experience, taking it apart and putting it
together is the hard part, and I don't want to do that, and then realize I
am missing a seal. 

 

I wish they just sold a kit-with all the seals from front to back for the
shift rod. ;)
