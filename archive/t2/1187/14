Any adjusting bolts stripped?

Torque it to spec and then when it goes out of spec check to see if the 
bolts are loose again. Also the suggestion to mark the shifter plate's 
position is a good one. I like the MarkAll type permanent markers which 
will leave a mark on anything. I use them in my shop.
