Subject: Swapping muffler from bay window to vanagon

Working on getting our 81 vanagon smogged here in AZ. It came with an
extractor system and glass pack muffler that is has a leak in several
places. Looking at the setup, I thought I would be able to take the Ernst
muffler off our '74 Bay (sporting a 2.0 FI) and put it on the Vanagon.
However, there are some riser tubes coming from the rear of the heater
boxes that go to the fan shroud. These riser tubes prevent the muffler from
completely reaching the headers. Best guess is about 3/4 of an inch.

Here is the muffler we have...

It advertises that it can fit my vanagon, but clearly something is not
right. Has anyone else ran into this? All the riser pics I see online look
similar to what I have in place at the moment. My fallback is a crossover
pipe/cat/muffler setup from a '78, and I just ordered the exhaust gaskets
to make that happen. However, I'd still like to figure out what's up with
this other muffler setup.

Thanks in advance.

Peace,
Troy
