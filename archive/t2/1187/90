I also had the clutch cable tube break loose from the body in the 66 kombi
that is my current driver.   It was January, a year and a half ago.   It was a
pain diagnosing the shifting/ clutch issue.   As luck would have it, it
happened right around the time the bus got a new motor, so of course I was
blaiming the clutch on the new motor, rather than welds popping loose under
the body.

The welding fix was done with the clutch cable in place.  I would do it that
way.
Do be careful not to weld lumps into the tube, or weld the cable to the tube.

You do want the cable to move in there, and to be able to remove/ replace it.

Ibm going to bring some pics from Bentley, and from my camera to my body
shop guy and see what he says. He can probably weld something or other in
there. The zip ties are working-although I know they are only temporary.

Thanks for the tip on taking the clutch cable out-I would not have thought of
that. Ibll probably blow out the line at the same time, to get it as clean
as I can.
