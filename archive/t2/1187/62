Subject: Insurance, Guaranteed Value

Allstate here in California used to insure mine, however only standard
insurance, no stated or agreed upon value. In other words in any 
accident, my bus was
only worth a plugged nickel.

I now have Hagerty with "guaranteed value",
however good for only 2500 miles of pleasure driving/year which I log. 
So far mostly around 1k/year.

Any opinions regarding "Guaranteed Value"?

Cheers,
Chris
