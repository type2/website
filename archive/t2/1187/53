always,

also I am wondering if I hooked the gauge up right, I was trying to do a 
quick and dirty dutchman so I could drive it with better air flow while I 
tracked down the problem.  turn on ignition, gauge goes to full then back 
to zero.  start engine no reading at all for a minute or so (heating up I 
guess) then it goes to the readings I've reportedp

I have the AFM guide that is on the website and no matter how it is set 
the reading never goes above 10.1  goes lower but never higher.  ???? and 
it is pretty dern steady at 10.1 thru most of  the RPM range. varying very 
little.

will do although not sure where I don't have google account nor anything 
like that.   have a website that I am paying for and have never posted 
anything on it..
   hmmmm wait a minute I think I have free cloud account somewhere could 
put it there I guess.
