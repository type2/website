Will they let you drop it in WINTER, like Plymouth Rock does-(I am in
NJ)  if you have an RV, then it can be dropped for 3 mo min and 6 mo max
(just keep comprehensive on it)- and all your cars can be done this way,
good to put winter rat on while Westie goes off.....or drop one while
it's home being worked on.
