But did you check that the values are actually correct?  While I'm sure 
the new harness has great continuity, it doesn't mean it's perfect. 
Chances are it's fine, but it doesn't hurt to double check.  Otherwise, 
if we've exhausted all of our options later, we'll come back and double 
check it.

That said, I'm guessing your AFM is grossly out of adjustment, but we'll 
get to that after you've verified all of the other values.
