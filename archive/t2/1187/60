Subject: RE: Hard shifting continues...

To answer some of your questions:

It looks like you do need sag in your Bowden tube. I had shuddering when
letting the clutch out caused by this problem. I think I just used ordinary
washers. I suspect the c shape is so you can put them on without disconnecting
anything.

Here is a picture of the coupler at the nose cone. It joins between the
shifter linkages and the shaft sticking out the front of the transmission.
