I wouldn't say they're backwards as idle is usually richer than light 
cruise, so the difference in those numbers makes sense, but yes, it's 
horribly rich.

My first guess would be to pull the cold-start injector off of the 
manifold and run the pump (with the engine off) by pushing a screwdriver 
into the AFM and see if the injector is leaking.

Next, do your spark plug readings confirm those AFR numbers?

If the cold-start is confirmed not to be leaking, reinstall it but leave 
it unplugged.  Pull the cover off of the AFM and start the engine.  Then 
by hand, close the flapper by hand and see if your AFR drops from 9:1 to 
13:1 or so.  The problem may or may not be in the AFM...

Just so you know, there isn't that much that influences the amount of 
fuel that's injected - the cold-start injector is controlled by the 
thermo-time switch, so you can unplug the injector and there *shouldn't* 
be any fuel going in, but verify that by the test above.

Warmup enrichment is handled by the temp II sensor on the head, but it 
only handles warmup.  The actual mixture is dictated by the air mass 
which is measured by the flapper and the temp sensor in the AFM, and 
then the programming of the ECU dictates the appropriate amount of fuel 
to inject.  Beyond that, fuel pressure can affect things, but I don't 
think that would mess things up too much unless it's forcing injectors 
to stay open.

Anyways, address all of the issues above and get back to us.  This is 
good because we can really see what's going on in the engine now.
