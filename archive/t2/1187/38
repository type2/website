I had to troubleshoot my '78 vintage FI some time ago.  I found a
Bosch L-jet manual in the Type2 library.  I printed out page 40
and took some measurements at the FI brain connector.  The connector
is where the brain 'sees' the input from the FI components, etc.
The sum of the sensors and their interconnect through the harness
and connectors to the brain.  This may reveal some poor grounds,
intermittant connections, open circuits or other areas to improve.
Here are my notes from a marked-up page 40.   Best of luck.
