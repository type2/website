Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Insurance

This gets tossed around 2/year here and on samba.
 
My '77 is with Grundy, I
was told that if I camp in it I am F'd, but others have been
told otherwise. 
Still I go with them.  Certainly any of the collector ones you are F'd
if you
use it daily however.  You must have another DD, and you can use them for
various degrees of "pleasure" driving only depending on the company.  Grundy
for
instance doesn't have limits in miles but it is pleasure only.  Most
people say that they
will likely pay out if you are in an accident but will
drop you like a rock and blacklist
you from the other collector guys if you
don't follow the rules
 
SF will issue policies in some states on collectors,
but not always with AGREED VALUE
which is the bit you are ABSOLUTELY looking
for here (if you think it has value.)  SF
has also insidiously in some states
wormed people into STATED VALUE (worthless)
policies so be very careful,
though at least they will insure you for DD use in that case and
perhaps pay
you something.  They won't do a classic in AK, no one will, so I don't care.
In WV Nationwide did agreed value policies (at least 10 years ago), for DD
use, and they
were about what you would expect $$ wise, not cheap like
collector, not as bad as on
a new $40k car though.
 
As always I like the
pitfalls mentioned here:
 
http://www.lelandwest.com/stated-value-vs-agreed-value-classic-car-insurance.
cfm
 
for considerations about these matters.
 
Other people who do do agreed
value in some states include the AAA, Allstate, and
the military insurance
(whose name slips me.)

Am trying to complete my
'71 Westy, and am checking on insurance.  Guess
what!?  State Farm will only
insure my bus if I don't drive it!

So, why don't I call Hagerty's or
Grundy's?  Well, they won't insure my bus
either if the intent is for it to be
a daily driver...

What the wisdom in this group recommend?
