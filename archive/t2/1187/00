All of this will be reflected by the AFR.  Yeah, you might get some 
slight variation in MPG that might not be noticed by the AFR, but by the 
sound of it, Bob's getting absolutely horrible MPG and the AFR should 
definitely reflect that significant MPG issue if the gas is actually 
moving through the engine (opposed to getting siphoned out by a thief).
