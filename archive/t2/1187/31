only thing with it disconected is VERY hard starting.

they did in the past, will pull them now to confirm.

will do this so I can see the readings, but have done it recently and the 
engine stalls????

I know, and have replaced everything I can think of with known working 
spares.  injectors, temp sensor, AFM (3), ECU (3) fuel presure drove with 
gauge for months(right on spec) and a bunch of things that I can't think 
of at the moment, or were clutching at straws.

yeah what I told my wife yesterday, all that work and money to prove what 
I already knew....  but hopefully it helps in the long run, and it fills 
the last hole in my gauge cluster perfectly and it is pretty.. lol
