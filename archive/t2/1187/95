Subject: Just when "you" think you are a rocket scientist

You being "me" in this case....
Drove 125+ miles with a badly positioned valve cover gasket on my # 3&4 side.
Guess I did it on my just recent valves adjustment when I was too stupid to
not put in place new gaskets. (for which I have many on hand).

Oil light ultimately came on under idle speed at a stop light to tell me I was
down to 1 quart left in the engine.

Just goes to show that even the simplest of tasks can come back to bite you if
done improperly or you don't check your own work, which at my age of 65
requires a lot of checking!
