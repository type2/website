Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Insurance

I remember having an issue insuring my bus when I (permanently) moved
to the US, back in '91. Triple issue of having no US driving history,
just a student visa, and then driving some hippy camper bus. I first
had to get some real expensive insurance, like $100 a month, from a
company whose name I cannot remember. Was able to switch to State Farm
2 months later.

Now with USAA, no problem whatsoever.
