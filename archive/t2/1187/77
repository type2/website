This varies state to state, in WV you did not have to carry anything, anytime
on a
car that was not moving.  I would simply call Nationwide and take
vehicles off for
months or even not infrequently years, put them on for a few
weeks driving here
and there, take them back off.  The state only cared that
you paid property tax on
them which was minimal on stuff older than 10 years
or so.  Nationwide hated me,
in the pre electronic days particularly, but I
offered many times that I would love to
have a car dealer policy so I wouldn't
have to bother, and they wouldn't sell me
one of course without a dealers
license.
 
Jim makes a very, very scary statement here, especially regarding
State Farm.  The
"they let me declare my own value" may or may not be
reality.  I would again urge
anyone, with ANY regular insurer, but
particularly SF to READ YOUR POLICY very
carefully.  If it does not explicity
state it is an AGREED VALUE policy, you are simply
SOL if it get totaled, they
will offer you what they like, you will have no recourse, and
you likely have
been paying more for nothing.  I have countless friends in MD who
were with SF
and even well meaning agents, who were personal friends of the
friends often
did not know what they were selling.  SF was insidious in this urging
people
to take their old agreed value classic policies and roll their classics into
stated
value policies on their regular insurance offering lower premiums.  I
do read that
they still have classic agreed value policies in some states, but
in others they do
not.
 
Buyer beware here, read the paper, very, very few of
the regular mainstream
insurers will offer agreed value without professional
appraisal with comps, unlike
the classic car folks who do so usually with only
a picture and assurance it is not
your DD and is garaged, as with them you
simply pay as much as you want for
the $$ coverage you want.

Will they let you
drop it in WINTER, like Plymouth Rock does-(I am in
NJ)  if you have an RV,
then it can be dropped for 3 mo min and 6 mo max
(just keep comprehensive on
it)- and all your cars can be done this way,
good to put winter rat on while
Westie goes off.....or drop one while
it's home being worked on.
