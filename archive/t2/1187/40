Subject: 1970 bus ignition switch - "switch" - Bus Depot order

Just went out to the garage to begin the process of installing my newly
ordered and received Euromax ignition switch,
only to discover that instead of Euromax brand' as clearly stated on Bus Bepot
web page,
the switch received is ....  KMM !!

I'm not happy,
but at least I caught the "switch", "swap", "error", "switcheroo", whatever.

Now, to get what is proper !
