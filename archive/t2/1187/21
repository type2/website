I've had no problem w/Euromax switches.  I have one installed in a
friend's 68 Bug for the past 6 years or so.  In fact, that's all I
will carry at Airhead Parts.

Another Euromax sourced switch I carry is OEM Kostal for the Late
74-79 Bays and all Vanagons (plus a mess of other VWs, even my 914).
You can tell these from Chinese supplied by the fact that Kostal
switches are Black and White, all others (even VW OE Mexico) are ALL
White.  The VW Mexico variety of these don't have the 5th terminal for
the Seat Belt Warning Light per US Specs, but will work.
