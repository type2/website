Subject: Need a Canadian list members help.

Hey all, I'm needing help from someone in the great white south (south of me
anyway.)
If anyone in a major metropolitan area would be interested in making
some phone calls
for me in exchange for Paypal for say a 6 pack, I'd really
appreciate it.  Don't really care
where, though I guess the west side of the
continent might be better.

My task is VW, though not T2 related.

Thanks
John
