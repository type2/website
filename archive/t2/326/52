I guess it depends on what you refer to when you ask:

IF you are talking about the horizontal WESTFALIA installed lpg tanks for the
stove and fridge on some models,,, then I think this applies

The short answer is,,, NO,,, They are still refillable.
They are horizontal, and built before 1998, and cannot be refitted with a OPD
.... and are therefore EXEMPT from the new regs.

There are apparently some
 new regulations in the US
 that require upgrading of
 propane tanks with Overfill
 Prevention Valves. This may
 affect Canadian RVers who
 need to get their cylinders
 refilled in the US, as propane
 dealers will start refusing to
 fill tanks that are not to code.

 Most tanks will need
 upgrading. Some of the
 horizontal RV LPG tanks will
 not require OPD valves. See

 www.npga.org/public/articles/OPD_Consumer_QA.pdf
 page 3 for info regarding
 horizontal RV cylinders.
