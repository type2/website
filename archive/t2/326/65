Hey Phil,

Great pictures of the bus, it seems that you have a very nice friend to 
sell the bus that cheap.

It looked like the voltage regulator was disconnected or by-passed in 
your engine compartment - it's the black box on the back wall of the 
engine compartment, passenger's side.  Might want to check that out.

Did anyone notice the patch over the gas tank sending unit?  I had the 
same cuts made on mine when I bought it.  Seems to have been a very 
common repair or replacement.
