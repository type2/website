Subject: VW Trends

    I decided to give Trends a try when I got a "deal" on a subscription at 
the Real Source Funfest.
    I have now let my subscription run out due to the same things everyone 
else has already mentioned. 
     Wonder how many subscribers they will lose before they "shake up" the 
editing department.
