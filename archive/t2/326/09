"MR"? That's my Dad!!! <grin>

Yes I could meet with you maybe next week sometime. We still have only one 
car and the weather is not right for me and my motorcycle.

If the spark plugs were black then I doubt you were too lean. I think 
you've checked your well enough to know that that wasn't a problem.

I wonder if your rebuilders didn't have something too tight - not enough 
room for the oil to get between the crank and bearing to do it's job.

Do you have ALL of the tin in place and is it ALL real VW stuff (not the 
Taiwanese junk)? I had a Beetle that ran hot because of all the JC Whipme 
junk hung on it. I later found that the "experts" agreed that those fan 
shrouds did not have the proper baffles to direct the air to the right 
places. I knew from the get go that it wouldn't screw together and seal 
correctly.

I wonder if the rebuilder cleaned it properly after building it or if he 
checked ALL of the bearing clearances (sometimes bearing sets are not right 
or include different sizes). Has your engine block been align bored? That 
can open up ALOT more problems - especially if it was done incorrectly and 
the crank was no longer running parallel to the center of the engine case.

What about getting everything checked and measured by a different machine 
shop and then reassembling the case yourself? That way you could check all 
of the bearing clearances yourself.
