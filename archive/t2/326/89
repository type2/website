Subject: [T2] Re: Correct Tires vs Good Tires?

> The larger tires I chose to match the 26.1
diameter are Firestone Wilderness HT 205/75 14
with a load capacity of 1532 (per tire). 

Are these reinforced tires?  Max pressure 40psi
at least?

You guys know that I'm drawn into the tire FART
like a moth to an open flame.
 
Bentley says the specs for the early loaf busses
were reinforced tires (185R14R) with a max
pressure of 40 psi.  It says the specs for the
late loaf busses were commercial tires (185R14C)
with a max pressure of 50 psi.  I don't know why
VW spec'ed the tires that way.  

There is really no mention of the max load, but
we can interpolate from the max loads of the spec
tires in those sizes with those spec max
pressures.  Basically early loaf busses require a
load index of 94 or max load 1540 (may be lower
for LT rated tires), and late loaf busses require
a load index of 99 or so and a max load of 1600. 
I'd be surprised if the Wilderness HT's met those
specs and were as stiff as the stock spec tire.  

I've done the P radial tire thing on a bus. 
Newer p radials are better than old p radials,
and higher max load p radials are better than
those 1300 lb (YIKES!!!!) p radials tires lotsa
folks run.  But there really is no comparison to
the superior handling that the 185R14 Reinforced
or 184R14 Commercial tires give.  You'll just
have to trust me on this.  I'm a really, really
big cheapskate, but I won't make this mistake
again.    

The only 185R14 Reinforced tire widely available
is the Continentals CR21.   Tirerack.com has
them.  They have a nice all season tread.

.  

The only 185R14 Commercial tires with all season
tread widely available are the Cooper SRMII (and
price leader Mastercraft Courser RD) and the
pricey Michelin Agilis.  See here for Cooper:

My tire FART page is still up even though I know
there are errors on my tire FART page.  I have
not updated it for a while.  Just too busy--I
should be working right now.  :)
