Andy/Giles,

This is critically important. It is very possible to have the motor timed
perfectly at idle and be way too advanced at 3400 rpm. The mechanical and
vacuum advance can both wear such as to advance further than they were
designed to. It is pretty much essential to have a tach to set the full
advance, as once the engine gets up to this kind of speed it is difficult to
judge the rpm's by ear. But if you don9t have a tach, you can set the timing
so you are not in a danger zone, at least.

With the engine at idle, increase the engine speed and look at the timing
mark with the light. See how far the timing mark advances. Increase engine
speed until the mark will go no further. Do this test with the vacuum
advance attached, then also with it removed and plugged, and note both
numbers. Set the full advance to about 38 degrees and you should be safe.
Then re-check idle timing and re-adjust idle speed if required.
