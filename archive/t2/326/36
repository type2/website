You are right about that.

Sorry but I advocate it. I have seen way to many head failures on type 4 
engine, and have seen many folks drive thier busses 72 on with type 1 
engines with no problem.

Yes its hard on the engine, but it works

They dont?

Patially agree. I have been driving with a frind and my bus takes the hills 
better then his. In fact when he drove my bus he was very impressed by the 
power.

Nope. I have seen many type 4 engines die of head death. I have seen 
bearings go bad in them just as often. The only bus that has passed the test 
was very overbuilt from the start and it is a screamer. The 2 liter in it is 
running VERY strong, but thats because it was built that way. The amount of 
money he spent on it should make it that way. But when it comes to getting 
from point A to point B on a budget the type 1 wins hands down.

AGAIN: For a cheap engine and a reliable engine for at least 100,000 miles, 
the stock engine works. And a built right 1776 will do the job. I have only 
had one engine fail on me in a bus, and thats because it was a 1500 that I 
was pushing uphill at 75 mph. No I dont do that anymore.

I am not misinformed, I know that the type 1 can push a bus, and they can 
last. Why? Cause mine does. And I know that type 4 engines fail, because I 
have seen so many of them do so. And when they are rebuilt it costs a lot of 
money. Seems silly to even argue against it.
