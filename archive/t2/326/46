Greg-

I run the same distributor on an 1800 and it sounds like you aren't getting
any vacuum advance, since 24 degrees is about what I'd expect from the
centrifgal advance only. Check the vacuum port, the hose, and the vacuum
can. make sure the breaker plate is free to move when vacuum is applied.

Probably something simple. Good luck.
