Subject: SFBAYWINDWOS : big basin campout / site pics!

http://www.sfbaywindows.com/bigbasin/
www.sfbaywindows.com   (visit the link above, I haven't updated the main
page yet to point to these pictures. 

Just got back from checking out the group sites, they have 2 of them,
and there are a number of pros for each of them, it is hard to say
exactly which would be better, so I chose the one with better
bathrooms/showers - that way my wife will be happiest.

The site is really nice, check it out!

Best,
Christopher

Ps - again, pass this along to anyone you might think would be
interested. We are about halfway full as of right now, so email me or
call 415-781-6144 and let me know who else wants in. 

Any ideas on group activities, other than maybe a nice day hike on
Saturday afternoon and general cooking/drinking/shit-shooting/tomfoolery
? 

I know of a fantastic drive from San Francisco, going along the skyline
highway that takes you right to the main road into the park. It takes
barely any additional time over the main highway, so once I get all of
the details/directions ready to go, those that want to carabus with me
from San Francisco can do so, and check out an amazing drive on the way
there. 
I'll be taking this way home to, so others that just meet up with us
there can still check it out, provided you want to head north from the
Santa Cruz area.

It's about 70 miles from SF and 40 from San Jose. It took us about an
hour and 45 minutes on the skyline highway, FYI.
