Subject: New single Webber, no idle?

Hi again, still stuck in San Diego!!! problem after problem!!!
Tranny is fixed, exhaust is fixed!
New problem, all pushrod seals are leaking on head side, not a big thing! 
have new seals and i will use Locktite 518 this time.

Ok, i bought a used single progressive webber carb (has been used only once, 
bus was converted to type1)
(Spare me the speech on not buying duals, money is an issue...!)

I just installed the Webber this morning and was unable to have a decent 
idle, the best i could do was 1400rpm.

My distributor is a stock (J) 1973 VW model.  This distributor works ok with 
my dual solex and I can obtain a fair timing (8 BTDC- about 28-32 total 
advance at 2500rpm) but I can't set anything under 20deg with the Webber 
even at 1400rpm.

Do I have to buy a new distributor?  Or should my stock distributor work 
with the Webber?

Also,is the big vaccum port in front of the carburator used for the brake 
booster?  is the small vaccum port used for the "advance" on the 
distributor?  Where do you guys connect the crankcase breather?

What is your setting on the mixture screw? ( Leaner= clockwise?)

In other words, i want to know from guys who are running the webbber!!!
Many thanks!!

A very exasperated Ben!
