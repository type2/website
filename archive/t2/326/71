My drums do have one threaded hole - but not really enough to get it off. What
worked OK for me was to thread the lugnuts on and use a 3-arm puller centered
on the hub and grabing the lug nuts. You want to be VERY, VERY careful to
apply pressure steadily and make sure the arms are pulling straight. You don't
want to bend your studs.
