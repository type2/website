Bentley(ch. 8 p.24 sec 8.2)reccomends using a wheel puller. Any good tool 
rental place should have one. If there is an autozone close by you can rent one 
for free. Otherwise you can remove the castellated nut that holds the hub. For 
this you need a 45mm or a 1 13/16 socket, preferably attatched to 3/4 inch 
ratchet or flex bar(a long piece of pipe slipped over the end of the wrench 
increases leverage). Remove cotter pin. With all 4 wheels on the ground, have a 
helper apply maximum pressure to brake pedal. Now push the bar with all your 
might, stand on it if you must, Repeat for other side. Now jack your bus up and 
remove the hub nuts, teh hub and drum will follow. 
As Greg said, make sure the shoes are adjusted all the way in before attempting 
to remove drums.
good luck
