Subject: pullling the engine

Ok. so today, and some of yesterday, i pulled the 3-4 side head off of my 
1700 powered bus. Well even though some (read::all) of you had told me that 
i should just pull the engine and then take the head off. i didnt listen. So 
i left the engine in and took the head off. BIG MISTAKE!! It took soo long 
and was so difficult. I guess i didnt know what i was getting into. Oh well. 
Live and learn i guess. Anyways the question is, for future reference, where 
should i place the jack under the engine when I am removing it? Also, What 
is a good item to use when plugging the gas line to the carb? I have rubber 
lines on mine because I am using an electric fuel pump. Anyone else with 
that situation that can tell me what they use? Ok well,  Thanks for 
everyones help on the list for all the questions that they have answered and 
for all the advice and encouragment that they give. Every bit is appreciated

joey
