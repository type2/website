Please make sure you_also_stress that this same phenonenon occurrs with the 
same degree of regularity in 1500 and 1600 type 1 powered buses that have 
been driven hard and probably run hot at highway speeds.

Once this is established, you can then debate whats different about torque 
and hp curves, bearing size, oiling, case strength. etc.
