Subject: Finally got my bus home

Hello Volks,

Well, I finally got my '74 bus home. I bought it from a good friend of mine
about four weeks ago. It has been sitting in friends back yard for about six
years. We pulled it to my house, and now I have the task of going through it
and fixing it up. This is my first time owning a VW of any kind, except I used
to drive a '71 Beetle in highschool (loved it).

I have posted pictures on my website at http://www.vwbus.homestead.com if you
would like to see what I got. I paid $300.00 for the bus. The engine has about
six thousand miles on a rebuild before it was no longer driven.

Any suggestions on what I should start doing first would be greatly
appriciated.
