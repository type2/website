Subject: Re: [T2] Removing  rear brake drums

 To remove the drums on my 70, I take off the big 46mm nut, leaving the
wheel on the drum. Then, after backing off the brake adjusters, I hit the
tire sidewall on the inside on both sides alternately with a big sledge.
Even a stubborn drum like mine walks off the stub. I am careful not to hit
the rim. I don't hit that hard, but it does put a lot of pressure on that
drum to come off.  It works. If anyone thinks this is harmful to my tires,
please let me know. This info could work for composite later drums too, but
only to take the whole thing off, not just the drum. Then you could heat and
oil them at your leisure to get them apart.
