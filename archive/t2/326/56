Subject: Automotive propane in the US

So my wife and I are contemplating buying a motorhome that has been
converted to propane, which is common up here in Canada. Is it readily
available in the US? I did a quick search but couldn't come up with enough
info to be confident of driving stateside and finding fuel.
