There is a 5 arm puller especially made for the vw drums. well for the
wide5 drums for sure I dont know much about later ones.
hoover had a lot of discourse about it in one of his stories
lemme see.........
cant find it at the moment its the one when he went up to washington to
collect a bus and it had seized drums. he couldnt find the proper puller,
got a 3 arm, didnt do it ended up cutting the drum off
real classic hoover. fun and informative.
