The "frame" is a box of sheet metal.  The holes for the steering boxes
have tubes around the through-bolts welded to the sheet metal to carry the
compression loads of the bolts.  Not difficult, but harder than a "drill
and fit" process.

Still, if it can be done, it should!  I don't hear of many worm-and-roller
boxes failing.
