Subject: CA bus campout UPDATE!

Volks.......

Unfortunately, the date I originally wanted
is not actually available.
The Reserve America website said it was, but
after I inspected the ones
available this weekend and went to actually
reserve it, there was a
glitch, I called and the park has a
reservation already on that Saturday
night it turns out, and has for some time. 

Anyway, Big Basin gets booked, fast, and
there is literally nothing you
can do anytime within the next 7 months where
you can get a group site
for busses (that will work this well anyway)

Its about 70 miles from San Francisco, and 40 from 
San Jose, near the Santa Cruz mountains. 

- EXCEPT for the first
weekend of March! It's our only chance at
this absolutely amazing
location. 

Feb 28th - March 2nd, Rush to the Redwoods
with the SF Baywindows!!

www.sfbaywindows.com for more information. 

Basically, email me back and let me know, yay
or nay. 

Date: Feb28 - March 2nd 

Location: Big Basin Redwoods State Park 

Who: vw bus folk!

$$: 15

(ChristopherAW(-at-)vendio.com)
EMAIL me if you want in, and let me know the
following: 

1. Your name

2. Number of people coming with you

3. Year of your bus

4. Where you will be coming from

or call me if you have any
questions, or if it's just
easier that way. 

Please do so right away, as we only have a
total of 18 spots and 50
people max. 

If there is enough demand, we may get another
18 spots with another 50
people, as the adjacent group site to this one is
available.
