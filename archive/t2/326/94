A '71 does have the worm-and-peg steering box, but it _is_ blessed with
the late-model composite drums.  It is also the first year for disc brakes
and narrow-5 lug patterns.

One-year-only parts include the front engine tin, the intake manifold.
Two-year only parts include the front brake calipers, spindles, and hubs.
