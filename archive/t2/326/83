Subject: Bay parts source?

Hi-

I have been slowly restoring a 73 sunroof bus (and starting on a 73 panel!).
Fortunately, I have been able to get many of the parts I need from Bus Depot
- and have been happy with the service.

Having said that, does anybody know where I can get a headliner for a
sunroof bay bus?  Also, are there other good sources for bay parts?

Thanks in advance,

Dave Gillingham
