Subject: Propane Refills

I have a ?
Propane tanks, like the one I am sitting next to know are
now required to have an anit overfill valve installed.
This is denoted by the triangle type knob on top.
Refilling places wont let my refill the older type.

SO: Are the little propane tanks on the westys now no longer refillable?
