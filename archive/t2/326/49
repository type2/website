I am a firm believer in the theory that if it came with a type I put a
type I back in it and if it came with a type IV no matter what model, put
a 2liter type IV in it...

I've had both, and my old 60 23 window deluxe was the easiest to maintain
but my current 78 bay is by far the one I have kept the longest and drove
the furtherest.


but the bottom line for me, I live in a big city, and I can no longer
drive a stickshift, so it is real simple, only the type IV engine will
mate with the auto tranny (without more work than I want to do)  so

I'll keep my type IV running as long as I can, and as I have said before,
your bus, your decision

just keep em on the road
