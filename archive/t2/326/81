Subject: OXS light

 I saw a bus the other day and displayed in the instrument cluster on the fuel gauge were EGR and OXS lamps instead of an EGR and CAT lamp. I'm assuming this was a 79 model and OXS means oxygen sensor.

What does this light do? Is it like the EGR light than needs to be reset after 15,000 miles?
