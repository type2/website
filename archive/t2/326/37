Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!  You cannot use the puller pictured to just remove the drum. The drum fits over the
hub and studs. Turn back a page and look at the expolded pic of the rear brakes. #8 is the hub. All he wants
to do is remove the drum. The drum is just held on with the 2 11mm headed bolts, #6, and a LOT of rust around
the center circle. You need a real rust penetrent, i.e. Liquid Wrench, [NOT WD-40] and you need to soak the
inner circle. Then get a big hammer and hit the face of the drum flat between the studs. It will pop off. Do
not hit the studs!

Using a 46mm socket and pulling the hub and drum is a last resort. [yes you have to do it on the early bays
with one-piece hub and drum, but not 71 and up]
