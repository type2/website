Good point.  If the steering feels "crunchy" at the same wheel postion the
steering box is bad and replacement is the only route.

If the steering is otherwise smooth, but feels "loose" then you more
likely have problems downstream from the steering box.  Either the drag
link, swing lever, and/or tie rods might well be the culprits.
