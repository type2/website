I haven't done it yet, but plan to.  George Lyle says the frame has tubes
welded in to keep it from crushing when you tighten the bolts up, so... I'll
get a millwright buddy of mine to install it. If you machined two parts
shaped like a mushroom and welded the flange on the rear of the frame, it
would work. Bus Boys says everything else is the same except for a later
Pitman arm($5) One hole lines up, you have to make the other 2 holes. I
think it's worth it, I may buy a new TRW Brazilian box, never mind rebuilt.

Anymore info availible on this procedure?  My '71 box is feeling a little
sketchy, and I've replaced ball joints (helped!) and am going to do the
center pivot bushing as soon as it gets warmer, but I'd like to have 100%
solid steering, so this sounds like the hot tip.  Anyone? TIA!
