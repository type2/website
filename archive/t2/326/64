Since we're on the subject of using a T1 engine in a bus, what do you think
about the carrier problem? I guess we've all seen the little carrier bracket
adapter that goes over the oil pump cover, where you don't have a universal
case. This just seems like it is not a good thing to me.. the kind of thing
to make a good VW engineer cry. Since I've seen even the carrier brackets
split and fail, I hate to think about what that kind of torque could do,
focused on such a small and centered area, where the casting is really not
very thick.
I have seen tranny brackets (after market) used to support the tranny in
sand rails, etc.. Why would something like this not be helpful in helping to
support the transmission and to relieve stresses on the engine and carrier
systems?
