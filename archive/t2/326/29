Subject: Other sources for charcoal canisters

I discovered the round cylindrical charcoal canister (171 201 801A) that
first appeared on 78 models is available on a number of other late 70's and
80's Rabbits, Jettas, etc. It's located under the front fender on the
driver's side.

If you strike out at the junkyard, don't limit yourself to just busses and
vanagons.
