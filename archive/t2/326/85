Ah ha...

Is that what the strange little box is? The one that the speedometer cable
hooks to (runs through?), that sits just where the cable runs under the
flooring below the dash?

I couldn't find this box on any wiring diagrams in the Haynes Manual and
haven't been able to figure out what it does other than interrupt the
speedo's cable run.

Does it need any maintenance?
