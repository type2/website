Hi There,

loosen the adjusters off as much as possible. be sure to remove the two 
bolts on the face of the drum. Then I use a rubber mallet to drive the 
drum off, working my way around it until it breaks loose. Sometimes 
takes 10-15 minutes with a stubborn one.

A little WD-40 helps, but be sure to clean it off of everything before 
you reassemble.

Happy trails,
