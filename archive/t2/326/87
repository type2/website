Subject: procat heater smell

I have a question of all you folks who use catalytic heaters in your
bus...
As a temporary fix 'til I get my BN4 back up to speed I purchased a
procat heater from walmart.  Heat is great but how long does that nasty
smell last?
It is nauseating to say the least!!
I left it outside and ran a full can of fuel through it already.
Ugh
