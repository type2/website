I agree with Rick completely.

Of course, actually driving a properly tuned bus in the first place is a
tough thing to do.most of the ones i work on are hanging on by a thread,
coat-hanger and whatever else someone rigged to keep it pushing
along..........

The cost vs power equivalent is really not worth squabbling about.  The
hassle of adapting a bar, tin, etc to make it (type 1 engine)work in the
type 4 engine is, though.  Although many people probably just run this set
up with big gaps in the engine bay anyway, and figure it helps "cool " the
engine......................seen it myself many times as well as the likes
of any of us that have pulled wrenches over the years.
