Chris,

This is a t1 engine ...from reading closely...!!!!

My opinion....even a *bad* oil pump filter setup is better than
none at all.

I'll probably get seriously flamed for this , but have always had good 
luck with the standard aftermarket filter pump setup.....course I always
do it like the guys in "hot to hot rod your vw's " say to make sure it is 
good.

I would rather blow a filter(and have on a cold morning) than circulate 
garbage in my oil.

Chris, how can the crank be ok if the bearings were scored??
garbage in the oil passages on initial startup and breakin?

If you would'nt eat supper out of the inside of any part of your engine
when assemling, then it is *not* clean enough.

Carbon on the pistons...standard
black plugs with a 009....hmmmmm...too cold a range...obviously something 
*not right on the heat side if the pistons and cylinders were "bluish" and 
scored.

Chris, 28 degrees should be fine for the 009....too lean...<sigh> what bs.
How far do you drive it on a daily basis and in what kind of traffic/road?

Engine tin and all seals exact?
Are you *really* sure you want to deal again with the guy who rebuilt this 
last?????
How many miles?

Cheers, dave
