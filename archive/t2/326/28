I found an old Bosch filter in a box of parts and unlike the new filters
I've bought recently it has protective caps on the ends. One is marked 10
and the other 6. I assumed those numbers were OD of the filter ends measured
in mm but I measured 12mm and 8mm.

What do the numbers on the caps mean? Recommended fuel line size?
