Subject: Re: [T2] removing rear brake drums

Here's a good project for those talking about their welders a couple weeks
ago:

To pull a stubborn drum/hub, if you have another wheel laying around that
you can do without, weld a couple arms from the wheel to a large nut in the
center, kind of teepee style.  Bolt the wheel to the drum/hub and screw a
bolt through the nut onto the axle.  Makes a wonderful and cheap hub puller.
