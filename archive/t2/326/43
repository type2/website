Subject: quick timing question

74 single cab 1700  CB engine, SVDA distributor

hey list, I just checked my timing and noticed that at about 3000 rpm,
the timing is only advancing to about 24 total degrees according to the
scale.  I've checked the archives and see lots of talk about total
advance being 38-40 degrees.  At idle, it's timed at 7.5 degrees btdc.
Idles beautifully...do I have a problem?
