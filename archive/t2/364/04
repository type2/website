The knooks and crannies are clean and zero rust (ZR) may not be well known but 
it will put a very good layer down for rust prevention, the stuff was designed 
for offshore oil rigs, I will then apply a high build primer on top of once the 
shrinkage phase is complete. Go to the Autobodystore.com discussion page and 
ask about it (ZR). I've heard nothing but good things about it. I agree I do 
need some type of air gun to apply the stuff with though but like I said in the 
previous message I cannot spray it where I am at because of restrictions at the 
facility.
