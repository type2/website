Ask the Canadians who have the worst rust problems:

Jet-Hot is where many Porsche enthusiasts send their heat exchangers and
exhaust components. It's about $180 for a pair.

Old ones may not survive the cleaning process so it's probably best to have
new ones coated as you intend. If their rust claims can be verified they
will outlive your bus and your next bus.
