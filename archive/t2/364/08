Hi Dave,

If you're going this route, try this out before you carry all that 
stuff into a junkyard.  Body metal can be quite tough, and a small 
inverter (<600Watts) may not supply enough juice to keep a good power 
tool running at full capacity. Be sure to try a test at home before you 
load all that stuff in your bus.

Those little integrated units with the battery pack and 110V outlet are 
definitely way too weak for an angle grinder, AMHIK. And while my 
current   RYOBI 12V battery-powered drill is great, most of the cheaper 
kits I've seen will only drill metal for a few minutes.

The Jamie Rivers hatchet/chisel technique is a definite winner in my 
book.

Happy trails,
