I agree with the "chicken war" stuff.  Here in Arkansas where
1 in ever 12th person works for a poultry company, it must have been a big 
deal....sort of like the Russians screwing around with the import of
chicken parts now.

The deceased owner of the poultry company that I worked for appeared
on the cover of Life? magazine with a "bunch" of chickens.  They still
had the sign(in storage) that was made for the parking lot that said...

"No Volkswagons allowed"   Notice the misspelling!

The current(son and great grandson) owners both own German cars.  LOL

I understand that we can now import 25+ year vehicles without much 
problem...time to go to Canada and find what you want!

Cheers,dave
