VW stopped exporting the pickup to the U.S. in 1971, due to a steep
tarriff on imported trucks.  (They sidestepped it with the Bus by
officially calling it a "station wagon," whereas Japanese companies
sidestepped similar tarriffs by shipping partially-assembled pickups and
installing the beds here.)  So the only post-1971 pickups in the U.S.
(besides the Rabbit pickup) got here by way of other countries that VW
exported to at one time or another. My '78 crew cab cab got here by way
of  El Salvador.
