Subject: GL4 snipe hunt

Okay, I'm back here on Vancouver Is and life is great, if not wet. 'Course I
go to get gear oil for the trans and everyone I ask for GL-4 looks at me
like I have 2 heads. Two questions, only thing I could fine with a GL4
rateing is something for tractors called TDH- trans, diff, hyd but no weight
rateing. Will this stuff work? Second, does anyone on the Island know where
I can find Sta-lube? I know they still make GL4 80-95 wt.

Drove the 68westy for the first time since I got it two years ago, almost
forgot how many grins per mile it could be.
thanks
