Subject: revised...Looking for 2.0 L engine... location, SC

Hey folks,

This is the revised email. My current location is
South Carolina however I will be moving to Michigan
sometime this or next month. If you have an engine
between here and there let me know.


I know I've posted several time about finding a
replacement engine for my beloved bus Anya. (1978 with
2.0 FI).
	
So far I havnt really found anything so I'm just
throwing it out there again. Any help appreciated. If
you've seen one in a junkyard, heard of one somewhere,
have a perfectly running one that your willing to
donate (what you could be a saint...) or any of the
other possible scenarios, please shoot me an email.
	
Thanks
	
Giles, on behalf of one hurting little bus.
