You may well be right.  Gowesty said they had
them made, but they look just like the ones
listed my tirerack to me.  Who knows. I guess
Chris will have to let us know when he gets
around to making his setup a reality. 

Have they raised the price yet?  You have to
figure the core charge or price of shipping 4
core wheels to gowesty.  That has to be steep.

Bentley.  See page 8-42.  It lists only the size
(185R14 commercial or 185R14 reinforced) and max
tire pressure and not the max load.  I'm not
aware of a spec for max load, except that the max
load often quoted is the max load for the tire
that meets the max pressure given by Bentley.  

Is there a spec for max load somewhere?

No, that would be no problem, obviously.

Personally, I've never quibbled with any of the
28x7.5 tires and would probably purchase them for
my bus.  But then, I look at the max pressure
spec, which is the only spec I know of, and the
BFG meets it.  

If I am a tire nazi, it's because every bus I've
ever purchased and 95% of the buses I see at
campouts have passenger tires with 1300-1400 lbs
max load and 35 psi tires or worse...and they
wonder why their bus changes lanes on its own
everytime a semi passes them.

Agreed that this is also a problem.  It's just
that people don't get on the list and ask if they
can put balljoints or struts meant for a Geo
Metro on their bus.  People do commonly post
about their no set of Sloppyhandler P205/70/14s. 


No offense meant.
