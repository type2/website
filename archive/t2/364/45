I agree Dave, sometimes the arguments about tires, oil and gas get a little overboard.

Getting everybody running a little better is a more important list function than getting two people screaming "heil hitler" as they recheck their tire pressure semi-hourly. 

Me, I run 4 different passenger tires with my K-mart oil filter and a two-stroke mix in the tank.

I also enjoy smoking while changing my fuel filter.

Sock it to me!
