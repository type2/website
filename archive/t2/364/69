The fact that they don't do it speaks volumes for my position.

The fact that "economy" cars come with relatively narrow tires also makes 
sense, since narrow tires have less rolling resistance (as has been pointed

Check the total wins column...A narrow-tyred type 35 Bugatti still holds the
record...Not 'zactly an economy car... ;-)
