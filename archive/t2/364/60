so my request amounts to any of you guys that i have
seen with things in your sigunatures i need
to know where to put those wires back on to make it
work.  there is a single red wire with lots of
black stripes then there is a group of 3 wires one red
one black, and one red with a single black
stripe.  the block seems to have numbers and i don't
know where it goes if it goes onto the spades
and athe wires go into the block or what
the block has  germany with a number 30 below it and
the holes in clockwise order say : 50  75  x
su and p.
