Subject: unpadding dash

Hi,

Discussions of installing gauges, personal dissatisfaction with 
current gauge location and dash padding in poor  repair finds me 
contemplating removal of the dash padding on the 68 bus. I know that 
late 60s bays sold in Europe were delivered sans padding. Anyone done 
this to their bus or have pics of how theirs looks?

Thanks
