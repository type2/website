Almost "Dr." Dan,

Don't know for sure about either, but Bob Hoover...I think he got tired of 
answering...and defending his answers...I have seen him reply to some of 
my posts on the vintagvw list and have pmailed him on the Megasquirt list, 
but that is about it.

When he was? on the Megasquirt list, he was contemplating FI for the
1600 engine on his split...sounded pretty serious about it too!

Cheers, dave
