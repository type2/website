SO LONG AND THANKS FOR THE FISH:

As our poor hero Author Dent arrives back on Earth he is slightly
confused and very very wet and hating the rain god. After being back on
Earth for a bit he meets a very unique girl who floats on air (Author
already knows how to fly. Very simple trick but very hard to master -
throw yourself to the ground and miss). But after awhile he meets Wanko
The Sane and reveals the secret of the bowl. But the moral of this story
is why do they put directions on toothpick boxes? Hence the stupidness
of all states who impose smog testing.
