Subject: Installing VDO gauges in dash under radio

Does anyone know the best method to cut out three two inch holes to fit
three gauges below the radio using the Bus Boys very nice mounting plate?
This is on a 78 Bus and of course there is metal behind the dash padding.
Has any one done this and have any special tips?  Is there enough clearance
under the radio and does it have to be removed first?
