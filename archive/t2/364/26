Subject: Re: [T2] Installing VDO gauges in dash under radio

I guess I went the cheap route in not searching too hard for the 2 1/16
hole saw, figured I'd only use it once anyway. When I did mine I actually
left my radio in but it would have been easier with it out. Removing the
ash tray and its holder(1 screw) was the biggest help for me.
