Good point.  However I will say that there is not much clearance for chains on my bus either, around 3/4" clearance between the tire and the fender, but I cinched them down tightly and tied up the loose ends and it was no problem.

I agree with your reasoning but in my case the width actually does make it to the ground.

As someone who has raced with SCCA, I can't believe you would seriously make that statement.

To coin a phrase, you are right but width is not trivial.  :-)

But I bet you went faster through the corners and I bet your overall lap times decreased.  In a bus, it would also translate into more stability in crosswinds.
