Subject: Re: [T2] unpadding dash

Hello,

I have done such a task. The padding on my dash had
been rattle can painted several different colors at
several different times and there were several cracks
in the padding so I opted to remove the padding. I did
find several holes in the metal that were made to give
the padding something to anchor to when the padding 
was originally installed. I welded sheet metal into
the holes and hid the seams with a little body filler.
Here are a few pics that I took of it a while back. I
am going to re cover the impact strip with green plaid
westy material and reinstall it with the dash. I am
going to use Por 15 whitecote to paint the dash seeing
as I am going to paint the inside of the cab area with
that paint.

If you have a little experience with a welder and have
a angle grinder and  some free time, then it is not
difficult.

Here are the pics.

Oh, As you can tell by the pictures, I welded in a
piece of metal to block off the radio hole. I did this
because the hole that was there was mangled and I
figured I could always cut out a new hole to match any
new stereo if I chose to install one in the dash. 

Any way, it is up to you. It is a job to do but not
impossible.

Have a great day!
