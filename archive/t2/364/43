I don't think they are the same wheels.  The GoWesty wheels are actual bus centers that have been rewelded onto new 15x7 rims.  Do the stock hubcaps fit on the Audi wheels?

There is a VW spec for max tire pressure?  This is news to me.  And are you saying that this tire, which I mentioned in my previous post, does not meet these max load and tire pressures you refer to?

Continental LS 23 215/65-15 109/107R (that's 2149lbs reinforced)

It's awfully tiring fighting off the tire-spec n&zis on this list.  If I run a tire that is only 98% VW's max load rating such as the BFG All-Terrain TA/KO it's not going to make any difference on my bus which is only loaded to 75% of GVWR.  The BFG is a fantastic tire and many, many people run them on busses, especially syncros which are heavier and endure more abuse than a 2wd bus.  But it doesn't quite meet VW's spec, so it's a menace to public safety, right?

How many people are running around out there with worn ball joints, leaky shocks and bad alignment?  Which do you think is more dangerous?  How come nobody ever talks about that stuff?
