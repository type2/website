Subject: Any westy for sale in LA/SD???

Hi again,
Long story short:
My girlfriend brother is still in LA & San Diego (CA) or near, some of 
his friend did join him a few week ago, they are looking to buy (For 
me!!!) a 1974-79 (double bed up there is a must) Westy in fair shape so 
they can drive this one back in Montreal for me!
Fair shape=
-A good running engine that will be able to reach Montreal, Canada.
-Good rust free chassis (of what I've seen there, this is not an issue)
- If possible, full camper with stove! (weekender will do)
-good body with minimal or no rust (dent or scratch are OK)
-straight suspension

They don't know anything about mechanic!, when I say nothing, it's 
nothing!!!
This Westy will be for me!!!! For them, it's a "wheel/lift" back up here 
for them and a new project for me.  They have 7 days (flexible) left 
before they start coming back up.

I am looking for a GOOD deal, my price/budget is between $2000 & $4000 
USD, max.
If you are aware of a good camper Bus in those area (i know there is), 
or if you have one yourself, please contact me a soon as you can! I did 
check the Samba, http://www.westfalia.org and the type2 add.

They don't know anything about westy! I know a lot, please, be honest!!!

Many thanks, Ben
