I think 15 inch tires are different than 14 inch tires.  the wide part of the 
tire is further out and closer to arch.  My 15x6.5 rims might have slightly 
different offset too.  There is not much clearance with chains.

The width of the contact patch (part that touches the road) on my 205/70-15 
is 166mm.  The stated width is at the widest part and not at the contact 
patch.  Check to see if your actual contact patch is any wider with a 
27x8.5x14.  The lower section ratio of the 15 inch tire usually makes for a 
wider contact patch for a given width.  Also, some tires really have square 
corners and some have very rounded corners.  Generally, but not always, lower 
profile tires have more square corners and therefor have bigger contact 
patches.

In any case, it's really a myth that wider tires handle a lot better.  Tire 
compound, tire geometry and tread design have way more influence.

You are right that air resistance is by far the greatest force on a car, but 
rolling resistance is not trivial.  When I used to race street prepared cars 
in SCCA, wider tires would shave off a couple of miles an hour in straight 
line top speed.
