You forgot "skill of driver".  :-)

See my comment about driver skill above.

Kind of irrelevent since he's not comparing apples to apples.  I like the other answer on the same web page better:

"Friction is proportional to the normal force of the asphalt acting upon the car tires. This force is simply equal to the weight which is distributed to each tire when the car is on level ground. Force can be stated as Pressure X Area. For a wide tire, the area is large but the force per unit area is small and vice versa. The force of friction is therefore the same whether the tire is wide or not. However, asphalt is not a uniform surface. Even with steamrollers to flatten the asphalt, the surface is still somewhat irregular, especially over the with of a tire. Drag racers can therefore increase the probability or likelihood of making contact with the road by using a wider tire. In addition a secondary benefit is that the wider tire increased the support base and makes it hard to turn the car over in a turn or in a mishap."

I will also put forth the fact that performance car manufacturers such as Porsche, Ferrari, Viper (Dodge) and Corvette (GM) equip their cars with wide tires.  As with our beloved VW engineers, these guys are not stupid.  They know they could save money by putting smaller, narrow tires on their cars.  The fact that they don't do it speaks volumes for my position.

The fact that "economy" cars come with relatively narrow tires also makes sense, since narrow tires have less rolling resistance (as has been pointed out) and provide better... well, better economy.

Hey, I never made any claims about rain/snow.  I will agree that narrow tires are usually better in those conditions.  But for dry weather on asphalt, look at what the serious racers do.  Wide tires for my bus, please.
