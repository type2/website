ok....so I'll be tightening them up 'til I get .006
space....than tighten up One turn just to be paranoid...a
complete turn really screws things down a lot!  than after
determining it's ok, driving it around with a little
clatter for soome local driving, the next day will tightem
sown another .25 to .5 turn...depending on where that puts
things with the valve...right? makes more sense to be
carefull
