Subject: 72-79 Pickups' rarity

Hi,
     I hope this hasn't been discussed to death in the past. I couldn't find anything in the archives...

How come 72-79 pickups are so rare in the United States--or is it just me? I'd love to find a doublecab especially, but this seems impossible. I'd just like to know why these are so hard to find.

Thanks, and happy busing,
John Tracy

Ps. Anybody going to be at the Volksfolks show in Chattanooga, Tennessee on the 26th?
