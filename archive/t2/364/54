Subject: In Search of a decent Bus friendly FLAPS and VDO CYL Temp Guage

I live in Arlington, Va. Right down 395 about 2 miles from the Pentagon and
I have been trying to find a decent flaps for a while now with not much
luck. I was in a Pep Boys the other day looking for a tach dwell meter and
even the store manager looked at me like I was from outer space. I used to
live in Annapolis, MD and took for granted AA foreign PArts who stocked
(not even behind the counter) all sorts of aircooled parts, like gasket
strainer sets for oil changes, Mann filters, all sorts of Bosche... So I
have now been to a few Advance Auto Parts and a Pepboys but nothing really
good. I did find Olympic Auto Parts but their hours are not always
convenient. Please help!

Also:
 I'm looking for a VDO Cylinder Head Temp guage. I had one I was saving for
this bus and a spider made a nest inside it and then I broke the guage
trying to clean it out. I went through the trouble of ordering a sending
unit and wiring harness for the guage from Bus Boys and now need the guage.
It is much cheaper to buy this as a whole kit (guage, sender, harness) but
now that I have the other parts it may not be worth the savings to return
the stuff to Bus Boys (Cali) then order the kit from Bus Depot.
