Me too.  Owner's manual maybe?  As far as I know,
it's an interpolation... extrapolation? I cannot
remember the difference.

I agree this is a problem, but not as much as you
think.  If you stick within a certain tire size,
the numbers seem uniform.  However, I think it's
clear this is why many have logically concluded
you cannot rely solely on max pressure when
comparing a nonstock size tire.

The spec changed.  Some of the later busses
required the 185R14 Commercial tires that had the
max pressure of 50.  These have really high max
loads.  I don't recall exactly which ones
required the higher spec tire, maybe the cargo
vans and the passengers buses, but perhaps not
the camper.  I was something that didn't make a
lot of sense to me because my instinct would have
been the camper and cargo van.

Right.  An indicator of how reinforced the tires
is thus how stiff the sidewall is.  Sidewall
stiffness is very important for handling of our
tall, narrow, heavy buses.

I don't think you can find a 14 or 15" reinforced
(or LRC LRD) tire with a max pressure of 35 psi.

You do have to know, I think.  I have friend with
a longwheelbase 3/4 ton chevy truck.  He had a
mismatched "set" of 225/75/15s and 215/75/15s. 
None matched, I mean really mismatched.  I tried
to explain why getting a LT235/75/15 (the stock
tire for his truck) was important, over the
P235/75/15.  He seemed to nod his head and
understand, yet he went to FLATS and found out
they didn't have the LT's in stock and he
purchased P rated all terrains instead.  He said
the FLATS idiot said the max loads were actually
higher on the P rated tire (remember the 85%
rule).  That's sort of thing is why you need to
know.  I am sure the same thing has happened to
hundreds of bus owners who get told by the FLATs
idiot that there is no such things as a 185/0/14
LRC or LRD tire and that you should just put
these P195/75/14 or P205/70/14s all seasons on
your bus.

No doubt.  And this is why some say you cannot
rely on Load Range C for the smaller tires.

Max pressure is critical, but we're saying the
same thing.  Ybut you cannot find a load range C
or D or reinforced tire that does not have an
increased max pressure, though some point out
that LT195/75/14 LRC and some other 14 inch tires
have a lower max load than the stock tires.  (I
don't believe that reinforced tires are widely
available now that the 185R14 reinforced
continentals have disappeared from the tirerack
again.  That's ashame.)

Of course max load should never be exceeded, but
most of us don't exceed the max load of even very
small passenger tires.  Reliance on max load
however, led me to replace a suitable set of
tires (195R14C) with a set of all terrain
225/70/14 (max load 1600lbs but max pressure of
only 35 psi and standard load.  To be fair, I
thought they had a max pressure of 45, but didn't
notice the error until after I purchased them.) 
The tires handled ok around town but were quite a
handful on the interstate.  Replacing the tires
with something with appropriate max pressure (and
LRD) fixed the problems.  I know that you would
have flagged these tires on the standard load
alone.  I'll bet that someone who hasn't driven a
bus with LRC or LRD tires on a bus wouldn't have
noticed that the handling wasn't as good as a bus
could have.

Agreed but the problem remains that we don't have
modern specs for our old buses.  Stock sizes and
minimum tire pressures are all we have to work
with.  Max loads and/or Load Index codes would
make it so much easier, right?

Well, obviously I had you fired up a little
today.  I was not familiar with the specs on the
215/65/15 Continental you mentioned, but most
people out there will not buy the Agilis or the
Continental tires.  In fact, the tire package
sold by gowesty for the 15" aluminum rims comes
shod with standard load michelin x-one tires (max
pressure 35 and max load 1500).  Not even close
by your rule of thumb or bentley.  Clearly, not
everyone is getting the message.
