Subject: tri-square wrench

Hey folks.

I'm looking for a 6mm tri-square socket end so I can remove CV joints.
All I've found online so far is a set of four sizes for prices varying
from $50 to $90.

Nobody local seems to know what I'm talking about.

Anyone have a line on where to get just a 6mm?

Thanks.
