Subject: '79 sunroof bus - free (or parts)

'79 sunroof bus; 7-passenger; FI; missing tailgate glass; has 1 new heat exchanger, new muffler, 7 OEM brown headrests; has not been run in a number of years; borough says to get rid of it in 7 days; located in South-Central PA; was going to restore, but too many projects too little time; would rather see it going to a fellow busser than the recycle yard.

Or - tell me what small (shippable or U pick up) parts you want to buy, but you better be quick.

Dave E.
