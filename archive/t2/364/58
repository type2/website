Don,

Don't know about your 71, but on my 79 I could loosen the 2 bolts that 
hold the MC to the booster and remove the beam....don't forget about the 
vacuum line and the other line on the booster though.

I forget how it was exactly, but you should be able to do it...watch out 
for the brake fluid feed lines too.

Cheers, dave
