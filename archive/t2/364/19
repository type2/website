I called them and the bus hubcaps do fit.  The ones that don't fit are those plastic wheelcovers that some Vanagons had.  I can understand why those wouldn't fit since the wheels are 1" larger diameter!  They couldn't describe the change in offset to me which was a bit troubling, but they did say that with the 215/65-15 tires they fit baywindow busses with no issues.  Me want.
