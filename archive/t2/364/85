Subject: Heater box coatings

Has anyone here had their heater boxes ceramic coated?

I'm looking at using Jet-Hot on some new ones I'm going to buy --
it costs a bit more than exhaust tape but it should work a whole
lot better. As far as protecting the heater boxes it would be
best to have them coated inside and out, but it seems to me that
the heat exchangers would not work as well if the inside is coated.

I can have it done either way. Of course it would cost more to
have the insides coated, but not as much as another set of
heater boxes. 

Any thoughts on coating the insides? What about Jet-Hot vs. some other
vendor?
