Hi,

Much to-do is made of spit screen commercial transporters and rightly 
so but there is little talk of the the bay window generation. Keep on 
an eye on this European www.bbt4vw.com and check out the for sale 
page.

Specifically

http://www.bbt4vw.com/Car%20sales/Autoverkoop/bus/Commercial%20bus/commercial%20bus.php

where you will find detailed interior and exterior pics of bay 
window, fire trucks, hearses, ambulances,cherry pickers and tipper 
trucks.

Happy drooling
