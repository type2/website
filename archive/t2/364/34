I disagree.  My 27x8.5x14 tires are as wide if not wider than 215's and last month when we had 3" of sleet on the ground I put chains on all four wheels and spent some quality time outrunning Jeeps around town here in Dallas.  Point taken about rolling resistance but everything comes at a price and to me, the greater contact patch area is worth it.  Rolling resistance is trivial compared to wind resistance on the highway anyway, which is where my bus spends 90% of it's time.
