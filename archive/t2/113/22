You read my mind.  I like the non return valve trick.

I did this on my previous bus a '73. All that was required was to unscrew
the
stock valve from the switch. Fabricate a small bracket in which a "Radio
Shack" micro switch was mounted and screw the bracket back on to the
standard switch. All changes were within the switch housing so it looked
stock.

A neat 'trick' with my set up was to use aquarium air line non return valves
so the jets were always primed and would squirt as soon as the switch was
pressed.

I've posted about this before so it will be in the archives.

good luck

Dang!  I was hoping that someone had finally started to produce a
replacement wiper/washer switch that substitutes the washer "valve" part of
the switch with an electrical contact.  I can go to any FLAPS and get an
electric washer fluid pump, pushbutton switch and mounting bracket, and it
is relatively easy to mount the pump near the washer fluid reservoir and the
switch under the dash, which is what these people are talking about.  In
fact, that is what I have installed on my Beetle.  It works fine, but hidden
it is not.  IMHO, a truly hidden conversion requires a modified wiper washer
switch.

So, anyone have a '71 bus and/or 67 Beetle wiper washer switch I can buy to
experiment on?  I can imagine being able to do it, with just a little
creativity, and would gladly post the results if I manage to succeed.
