Subject: Camper Poptop Question

I'm doing a quick rehab of the poptop on my 71 westy.  I had to reglue =
one of the wooden ribs that is attached to the fibarglass shell.  Were =
these ribs also fiberglassed? Or were they only glued?  There was some =
really bad fiberglassing around the corner joint (at the back half of =
the poptop, where the bowed rib joins the wood slat that runs the length =
of the shell, and I'm not sure whether I should replace this (will it =
cause difficulty reattaching the tent) or if the epoxy will hold =
everything together.
