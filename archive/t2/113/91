<< I'm interested in any one elses "horror" stories. >>

 I have  some horror stories...  While, its not my bus that was 
jimmy-rigged... it was my 1967 type 3 fastback...  here are just some of the 
things that were rigged up:

1. throttle cable too short, electrical taped to a BENT COAT HANGER hooked 
throught carb linkage...
2. heater cables also taped to bend coat hangers...
3. engine case cracked, covered with liquid gasket sealer stuff around oil 
drain plate...
4. wires severly butchered, taped, crimped, capped, etc.. original fuse box 
missing, replaced by a piece of wood with wires and fuses screwed into it. A 
PIECE OF WOOD!! they werent even the same KIND of fuses that vw used... they 
were the cylindrical glass ones with the metal inside...
5. original ignition switch missing, replaced with universal type mounted by 
ZIP TIES to the steering column
6. fan shroud outlets capped with cut soda cans and clamps and duct tape...

....you can imagine how i was feeling when I discovered all this stuff... its 
a good thing I got it from a guy who was just "passing this on"   and only 
had it for about a month, because if I knew the person that did this kind of 
stuff....
