Subject: Re: [T2] Friday-Deadheads and busses

Okay... time for me to stop lurking and speak up  ;)

First off, I agree that there are quite a few T2's that have been
absolutely abused by Deadheads/hippies/stoners/etc. But being a
Deadhead/hippy/stoner/etc. myself, I would like to offer the "other"
side of the story.

I've come across many T2's owned by folks who've probably never
listened to a Dead tune, let alone followed them, whose buses were
*so* torn up it would make you cry. My previous bus (a '75) fell
into this category -- fuel injection converted to carbs, "new" wiring
that served no purpose at all except to create hard-to-trace shorts,
seats not bolted down, holes patched with old license plates, a toggle
switch on the dash to bypass the horn button -- you get the picture.
Thing is, the P.O. was a fairly well-off insurance salesman and the
bus was pretty much his daily driver until the clutch went.

My current bus (a '70) spent the better part of her life following
the Dead with her original owner and a small commune of semi-permanent
passengers. They actually took pretty good care of her, though I have
found some pretty creative repairs and patches here and there. I guess
my only real complaint is with the wiring -- why do people refuse to
use wire connectors?

Anyways, I'm most definitely not an "original condition, resto-fanatic"
-- my paint jobs would make that group's skin crawl. However, I firmly
believe VW (mostly) knew what they were doing when they designed these
things. So I say go ahead and do whatever you want to make your bus
your very own (and if the resto-folks don't like it, too damn bad), but
*please* try to keep the mechanical side as close to spec as you can --
your bus will be much better off, and you'll be a hero to the next owner!

Sean Fulkerson,
1970 Microbus - "Mimi" (my work in progress / daily driver)
