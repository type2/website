Subject: RE: what kind of battery (for auxillary)

	Hello Matt,

The car battery works fairly well as long as you don't have any long term
large current consumers , like a fridge or if you like to watch that 14
inch colour TV all night long (who does that on a camping trip?). However
it will have a shorter life span  than a marine battery or that big
scissors lift battery wich is a very good choise. You won't have to check
the water level after every "camping shift" unless the battery is
compleatly drained and recharged very often.
