Subject: Re: [T2] Celsius oil temp gauge but no Fahrenheit sender?

What the gauge is measuring is in fact the change in portion of the total voltage drop in the gauge - sender circuit due to the resistance of the gauge as the resistance of the sender changes with temperature.

So weather the markings on the gauge in Farenheit or Celcius doesn't matter but rather the ratio of the resistance of the gauge to the sender is what is critical.

Without knowing the resistance of the gauge and senders and the ratio of resistances that the gauge is expecting its not possible to suggest which is the best sender to use.

However the oil temp is likely to be in the range 190-240F or 85 - 120C depending on your individual engine, the resistance of the wires you use to connect everything up and your driving style.

As 150C = 302F I would use the 300F sender and calibrate the gauge by dipping the sender in boiling water (keep the electrical part dry) and see what it reads so that you know what the error is due to your possibly mismatched gauge and sender.

What ever it reads its all relative and you will soon get to know what to expect the gauge to read for the current driving conditions, and therefore only become alarmed when the reading is not 'normal' (ie too hot) for the current conditions

Good luck
