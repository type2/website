OK, I'm dating myself...on my 78 bus I have removed the stock heat system
and rely solely on the gas heater...well that left a hole in the engine
compartment tin about 3 inches in diameter on the left side..???  hm, I
bulk load my film and had a canister from the some film,  rolled over the
top and bottom a few times and had two matching flat round pieces of
steel, painted black and a couple bolts and I have a perfect patch to
close the hole...and it remains stock just by unbolting it and putting the
heat tube back in..guess that now qualifies me as a DPO
