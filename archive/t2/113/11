Subject: RE: [T2] Oils

Ray could be very correct on this point.  I honestly do not know the
underlying differences between the SL and SJ oils.  From my perspective I
just *assume* that the latest API rating will be of a better formulation
than the previous generation of oil due to a better stabilizer mix added to
the oil.

Granted in my opinion SL is much better than the older versions from the
70's no matter what.  The SJ could be better than the SL and it has become
what gasoline has these days, poorer.

As for this product:
>Very expensive, but damn - "...the lubricant service life is limited to 5
Years / 50,000 Miles 
or 1,000 Hours of Engine operation..."<

So is Mobil 1.  Big rigs go regular oil changes of 100,000+ miles.  BUT they
have dual filtrations systems with massive oil filters that can trap
particles down to 2-3 microns in size.  The key is not how long the oil
stays stable, but removing particles in the oil.

IF I ran a T4 motor I would strongly consider Mobil 1 15W-50 changed every
10,000 with oil filter changes every 5,000.  Granted I prefer Pennzoil dino
juice HD30 every 5,000 with filter change.

Heck VW in the 2.0L FI bus recommended dino juice changes every 7,500!
Trust the engineers.  Now all bets are off once the FI gets ripped out
because it is less efficient and leads to more oil contamination by the
unspent gases.

... We could go on for weeks with this subject... Who brought this up again
anyway? :)

>>Make sure the oil has an API "SL" rating (over
the cheaper oils having "SJ") since it is the
latest and greatest. 

You have said this before, and I cringed then
also.  SL oils are designed to lower emissions
and be more catalysmic convertor friendly, not to
protect your engine better.  In fact, most
manufacturers have to remove certain minerals
helpful to longlife of the engine.  There was a
recent thread on the vanagon.com list I
believe...  The upside is that most of the SL
oils are hydrocracked-- that is the pretend
synthetic made out of standard oil like Castrol
and all the others peddle.  

Cannot help you as to specifics.  Search
vanagon.com or maybe edmunds.com's townhall oil
section for folks that like oil far more than I
do.  

Unleaded gas is the latest and the greatest and
its pure hell on our engines.
