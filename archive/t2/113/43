Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning West roof


I used first a pressure washer with hot water to get the bulk of the moss
off. Next I soaked it down with water and then scrubbed with a brush using
softscrub w/bleach. I then wiped it down with a wet rag with 50/50 bleach
and water. It now looks presentable, but I'm going to sand it down and
spray it with Awlgrip System by U.S. Paints. Stuff is the best you can use
for fiberglass. I use it on boats with amazing results.

Dave says:  The plastic roof of my Westy is looking pretty shity. (Should
it
be green!)

What's the best stuff to clean it with?

Dave, UK

Barry says:  Yes, in the USA, the color 'shity' equates with 'green'.

Best stuff to clean it with might be toilet paper.
