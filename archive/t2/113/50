Subject: Re: [T2] Minnesota VW swap meet???

O.K.  After the meeting Wednesday night the only thing that was firm;y 
decided about the Spring Swap meet is that it will be 6 April.  Where is 
still to be determined since the plan of having it at the VW dealership in 
Saint Cloud fell through.  We may have it at the VW dealership in Rochester.  
Maybe.

I will post when the location has been announced.
