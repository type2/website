Steve,

I wited 20+years for the "shop" and 2 car garage(still unheated tho).  I
*know* that I am almost in heaven.  Now if I can just get it cleaned up so
I can work in it again<grin>.


And my girlfriend owns a 67 camper parked in the pole barn!

Life *is* good!
You will eventually get there!

Cheers, dave
