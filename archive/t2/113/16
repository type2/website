Hi Adam,

Any chance you can get a pair of vice-grips on there to "un-squash" the
tube?  If you can squeeze it carefully with vice grips set 90 degrees to the
"flattened" direction you may be able to squeeze back the shape of the tube
enough to get the threaded end of the cable through.

The other thing you could do is to cut the threaded end off the cable a
couple inches from the end, pass it through, then use a cable clamp to tie
it back together. You'll lose an inch of length this way. If the length is
critical, use two clamps and a short length of the old cable between them.
The downside to cutting the cable is that if the clamps ever let go you're
stranded again. Might want to stash a spare clamp in the glove compartment
along with a small length of cable, just in case.

This too is a "Fix things right" situation. The above is what I would do,
YMMV.


Happy trails,
