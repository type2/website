seriously? before i became a sociologist i'd done some un-scientific
studies too. results: i learned not to generalize people on any scale.
sometimes its good to park the bus and travel by foot. is that in the
charter? all sorts of good people make bad buses. cb'ers, sure. case in
point: last week, a feller and his companion taking pictures of eugene
buses http://www.geocities.com/eugenebuses/ drove over in his 71 deluxe
accident waiting to happen. huge oil puddles happened while he snapped
pictures; fuel filter a half inch above the coil - no clamps on the fuel
hoses; lots of valuable tools and parts, but no fire extinguisher. he had a
sticker on the bus that was from a univerisity, but it was cut to say just
"universe". we're everywhere.

i never had the luck of touring dead & jgb shows in a vw bus. even a beater
bus - that'd been a luxury. all young, jam band music makers come to
eugene. we will get parts, we will survive. almost certainly.   - steve
