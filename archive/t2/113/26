Dear Vintage Bus . com,

I am not sure this is the right place to ask but you seem to have alot of
insight when it comes to VW buses.

I am haveing a serious problem.
I have a 74 1/2 VW Van that has been completely and loveingly restored for
my Wife and daughter to drive around in. The original FI2.0l motor was blown
and I have replaced it with a 1978 FI2.0l engine. After much hardship with
the flywheel finally all the the parts mesh and rotate freely. My problem is
such.:
The loom and brain of the '78 motor is different than that on my '74.
Everything is hooked up as it should be but I have two small wire connectors
that are left over athat extend from the loom at the same spot as the coil
wire from the brain. They are both white and dont seem to have a home.
Although your wireing diagrams are excellent I dont know where these wires
go. This is also the only explanation I have that the darn motor will not
start. Alll the electronics have been tested and are perfect. The engine was
recently rebuilt and was working fine before the swap.

Also is there a way to jump the starter when working in the back without
useing the ignition key. Alot of the work is being done by myself after the
business shuts done and as you probably well know its good to look at whats
happening in the engine bay while shes turning over. There is a trick I used
to know but have forgotten.

I would be thankful for any insight into my delema.

Thank you in advance for your help

Micki
