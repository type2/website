and just to add to the fun,  the torsion arms not only have to be lined up
to the leaves to go on they have to be preloaded.   the trick that I used
to get the torsion arms on was to remove the rubber stop, and drove em on
with the rubber hammer while using a jack to get some preload on as I
went, then jacked the van up by the torsion arm to get it to compress
enough to get the rubber stop back in....wheeeeeeee!
