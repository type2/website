Good point!  There are two different kinds of meter and it makes a
difference!  My analog has only two wires and hooks to ground and terminal
1 (?+?) on the coil but if you have three wires, then the black and red go
to + and - on the battery (or other 12V source) and the sensor wire goes
to terminal 1.

Jeff,

It is barely  possible that your coil/condensor are so marginal that the
power take-off from the meter make the difference between starting and
not starting, but it is very unlikely.  If the bus will start w/o the
meter hooked up, start it and attach the leads while it is running.  If
that kills it, then fersure you are hooking the leads up wrong somehow.
