I'll second that...

My first bus was a '70 (the same one that I took to Inuvik) and the PO
was no deadhead-he was of hispanic nature is my guess, although I got the
bus from the junkyard so I dunno for sure(but he was clearly no
deadhead). Anyway, the ignition had been replaced with an old AMC switch,
the headlights had been rewired to a cheap toggle switch which was slowly
melting, the drivers side rear view mirror had been replaced by a mid-70s
era car mirror which blocked the vent wing from opening, judicious
amounts of bondo had been used in lieu of real body work... and the coup
de grace, #3 rod through the case. Don't have to be a deadhead to abuse a bus.
