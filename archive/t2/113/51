Hi All:

I just got a used Tach/Dwell meter from someone on ebay to do the points
on my 82 aircooled van. The dwell meter is electronic and works on my
Isuzu. When I connect it to the coil on the vanagon, I cannot start the
van. It seems to short or load down the signal.

What gives?  Is this an indication that the coil is going or that only
the older dwell meters can be used? Incompatibility with the AFC
L-Jetronic fuel injection system?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Regards,
