Subject: RE: [T2] Electric Windshield Washer

Dang!  I was hoping that someone had finally started to produce a
replacement wiper/washer switch that substitutes the washer "valve" part of
the switch with an electrical contact.  I can go to any FLAPS and get an
electric washer fluid pump, pushbutton switch and mounting bracket, and it
is relatively easy to mount the pump near the washer fluid reservoir and the
switch under the dash, which is what these people are talking about.  In
fact, that is what I have installed on my Beetle.  It works fine, but hidden
it is not.  IMHO, a truly hidden conversion requires a modified wiper washer
switch.

So, anyone have a '71 bus and/or 67 Beetle wiper washer switch I can buy to
experiment on?  I can imagine being able to do it, with just a little
creativity, and would gladly post the results if I manage to succeed.
