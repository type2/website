Subject: New VW tool

The new tool in my traveling tool box and on my work bench is a . . .

butter knife . . .


I reach for it about 10% of the times I reach for my screwdriver.

If it is there, I will usually find a condition during a work session where 
the butter knife would do as well, or better ('bitter butter make better 
batter', remember??) than other tools of choice.
