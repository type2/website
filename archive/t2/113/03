Subject: Friday-Deadheads and busses

I have been doing a very UN-scientific, informal sociologocal study over the last few years of Deadheads, bus owners, and other totally trivial stuff.  My findings are as follows:  1) Deadheads in general are NOT bad bus owners, but the younger the bus owner\deadhead, the worse shape they keep their bus in.  2)If you are considering buying a bus from a Deadhead, first ask them what their favorite Grateful Dead song is or which GD song first got them into the scene, If they answer "Touch of Grey", run away as fast as you possibly can and don't look back. 3)Don't buy a bus from someone with both Grateful Dead stickers AND PHISH stickers in the window, it will almost certainly not have been tuned up in the past year.  4)Don't buy a bus from a Deadhead (or anyone else for that matter) who has advertised the bus as either a "Shaggin Wagon" or a "Hippie Bus" or "Dead Sled", because they have obviously missed the point. 5) When buying a bus from a Deadhead, you can add five kharma po!
ints for every GD Show that the bus has been at, but take away 2 points for every PHISH concert which it has attended.  And lastly 6)When buying a bus from a Deadhead, ask them for a beer, if they offer you a mass produced domestic lite beer, be on your way.  If they give you a nice full bodied micro or good import, start talking about the bus, if they give you a nice Amber Ale that they home-brewed themselves, then take your new bus home and enjoy it for years!!
Just 2 cents worth from a rapidly approaching middle age tie-dye wearing deadhead who treats his buses right!!!
