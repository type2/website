Subject: 78 Auto wants to stall at low rpms

Hey guys and gals, I havce a new problem, and an old
one and they may interrelated.

First off, the old problem.  The bus is giving me a
little bit of idle problem.  It idles low enough that
it wants to shut off, and the oil light shows at such
a low idle.  Give it another 100 rpm via the gas
pedal, no problem.  Is there an idle adjustment on the
2L F.I. engine?

New Problem.  When stopped a ta a light, then trying
to leave the light, the bus wants to act like it can't
move.  Something like it is in too high a gear.  When
I put in Neutral, give it a litlle gas, then put in
drive while it hass a couple hundred more rpm, then it
gets going fine.

It acts like a manual in too high a gear, like 3 or
4th, and definitely does not act like a slip, like one
would be used to with a clutch.  Sooo, I am thinking
the torque concverter is fine, but there is maybe a
problem with it not getting enough rpm oomph at idle,
at a light to get it to shift down, but it does just
fine when given more rpm.  Makes me think that maybe
my fluid is bad?? or the trans fiilter (is there one?)
is giving a restriction to get the trans fluid moving
through to cause it to shift down.  But, at higher
rpm, it overcomes some restriction.

Anybody have any ideas?  Am I in the right frame of
thought?

Thanks and kindest Regards,

Mark
