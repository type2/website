My parents had a split-window that they sold when Dad got promoted to GS7 in
the Bureau of Public Roads and they could afford a car with heat. In West
Yellowstone, Wyoming, that's important. They're not hippies; they bought the
Bus because it was the cheapest thing they could get that would haul four
kids.

Later, my aunt & uncle bought a standard Loaf with the middle seat; they
bought it because it would hold seven kids.

I bought my Loaf because of all the Pink Floyd albums in my collection--it
is against the law for someone who owns "Piper at the Gates of Dawn" to buy
a Dodge Caravan. (It's in the NC General Statutes. Really it is.)
