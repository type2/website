Subject: Re: [T2] Why can't people fix things right?

This is the dumbest question I've ever heard. Not everyone is mechanically inclined or has the know how to fix every little problem. Not everyone has the time to fix things right, especially when your bus is your only mode of transportation. Their are some people who don't have a bus by choice, and don't cheerish it like you do, therefore don't care if they restore it back to original specs. If everyone could fix everything right why would this list be here?
