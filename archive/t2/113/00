Subject: where is the charging relay??

hello again,

i understand that the auxilery battery is charged by
the alternator which joins both batteries while the
ignition is on, but seperates the aux from main
battery after the key has been turned of. now what i
am wondering is, where is this relay located, and how
can i tell if it "relaying" properly? i apologise for
all these questions which must seem pretty dumb to all
you vets out there. thanks in advance.
