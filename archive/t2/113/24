Busses are different things to different people, but as for me, I agree with
you.  I'm not afraid to drill a new hole or make a modification that will
better adapt my bus to my particular needs.  I use my busses to the fullest,
as they were intended to be used.  I camp in my VW camper, and sometimes
something spills on the carpet when we're camping.  I haul with my Crew Cab,
and sometimes something dings the bed in the process.  So neither is a
museum piece.  But as far as I'm concerned, this is what they're for.  (Not
to put down anyone whose bus _is_ a museum piece; to each his own, and I
sure do sell 'em a lot of little nitpicky parts!  :-)
