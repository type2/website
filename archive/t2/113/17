Anyone out there live in the Inland Empire (California) area? I sure would love to come "help" with any projects to learn as much as I can about , well, everything. I am in Corona.

Also any resources in the area, repair shops, parts stores, body work etc... I realized recently that Wolfsburg West is in my towm as well as a couple others I found in the back of VW Trends. So I am hoping there are some Type 2 enthusiasts around who wouldn't mind an extra set of hands and a lot of questions.

I am a very NEWBIE Bus owner.

Thanks!
