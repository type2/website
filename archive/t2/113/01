>>Make sure the oil has an API "SL" rating (over
the cheaper oils having "SJ") since it is the
latest and greatest. 

You have said this before, and I cringed then
also.  SL oils are designed to lower emissions
and be more catalysmic convertor friendly, not to
protect your engine better.  In fact, most
manufacturers have to remove certain minerals
helpful to longlife of the engine.  There was a
recent thread on the vanagon.com list I
believe...  The upside is that most of the SL
oils are hydrocracked-- that is the pretend
synthetic made out of standard oil like Castrol
and all the others peddle.  

Cannot help you as to specifics.  Search
vanagon.com or maybe edmunds.com's townhall oil
section for folks that like oil far more than I
do.  

Unleaded gas is the latest and the greatest and
its pure hell on our engines.
