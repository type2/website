Subject: Weber choke

I just got my new dual Weber 40 IDF's and the Haynes Weber book. In the book
they refer to the "starter" or choke mechanism, but mine doesn't have this.
I looked into it at the place that knows, aircooled.net and they say these
carbs don't need it.

I am used to having a choke. Can someone elaborate? John?  Or does anyone
use the choke these came with? Mostly I am just curious.

Thanks and have a good friday!
