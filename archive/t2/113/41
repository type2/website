Subject: [T2] Front seat replacement 

Dave says:  Anyone in the UK know of a decent front seat with head rests 
that I could use in a type 2 to replace the original VW ones?

Dave, UK

Barry says:  Type 2's range from some year to some other year.  Seats could 
be specific to year and type type 2.

Since I am not in the UK, I hesitate to respond, but I do say that I know of 
no decent front seat with head rests (more than one head rest).
