Some shoddy wiring (around the radio only) is the one kludge I indulge 
myself in. Soldering proper connectors and so forth is just more work that I 
think the radio is worth, when twisting wires together and covering them up 
with masking tape does the job just fine. I keep telling myself "next time 
it's warm, I'll solder them proper."
