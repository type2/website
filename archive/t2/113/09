Subject: electric windshueld washer

Hello,
The other day I was looking at this VW resto place's
site and it mentioned an electric windhield washer
,ounted in a bus that only you will know is there.
Does anyone know anything about these and who else
might supply them.?
BTW the site is

Thanks,
Tyler
