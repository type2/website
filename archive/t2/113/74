It's still Friday here for a while so I thought I'd weigh in on this thread.
My wife and I were talking about it at dinner (she is great help on all
things automotive as well as just about anything else). The conclusion we
came to was that the 50,000 mile change interval just feels wrong. Even with
a good filter regularly changed, how can the oil not get overloaded with
acids and carbon and all sorts of other nasty stuff in a service life that
long? Maybe we're just old fogies, but I prefer short change intervals with
a quality straight weight dino oil. This after trying multi-vis of dino and
synthetic persuasions, and a variety of other oils. I haven't run the
numbers but I imagine that the cost of the 50,000 mile oil would work out to
be *roughly* equivalent to using regular oil at normal change intervals..

Anyhow, there is a more important factor to consider here. think of all the
other things you find while changing the oil! A loose wire, a missing tin
screw, a cracked CV boot.....how would you find these things if you're not
out there changing the oil? If you're going to roll under the bus every few
thousand miles to check out these other things, why not change the oil while
you're down there? It takes, what, 15 minutes? And it promotes a beneficial
intimacy with your vehicle.

Most important of all: How will your bus know you love her if you don't go
down and mess with her underside every once in a while??

Regards, and good weekending to all,
