Subject: fuel pressue gauge

I'd like to measure the pressure at the outlet of the fuel pump on my
carbureted engine.

The (rather expensive) gauge I bought last year to use on my FI engine pump
is 80 psi full scale. I'm not confident that it will read values like 3 psi
accurately.

Can anyone suggest a good quality gauge that is, say, 0 - 10 psi that would
be more appropriate for this application?

Thanks, Jack
