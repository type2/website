Subject: Brake Vacuum Line

I have heard a couple people talking about brake
vacuum lines that go to the engine. My 74 currrently
has a dp beetle motor and am wondering where to attach
the vacuum line would go to. I noticed that it is hard
to brake and figures that this might be the problem.
Thanks,
Tyler
