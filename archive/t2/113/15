Clutch tube problems!  Put new cable in bus,and back about a foot before =
it comes out at the bowden tube, there is a slight bend in the =
tube...looks like owner ran over something.  Sort of made it a bad day, =
for I was doing this to help someone out, and thus was not able to =
finish today.

Anyone have success in slipping something in there and bending it back?  =
the threaded end of the new cable can't make the bend.  Old cable broke =
in same spot.
