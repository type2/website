X-14 is really wonderful stuff.  It neatly killed all the mildew on
the tile and grout in my bath tub.  However the label does include a
warning that it reacts badly with metal.  I verified this, the ring
around the drain in the tub is now rusty.  So keep that in mind.
But it should really do the trick for your mildewy poptop.
