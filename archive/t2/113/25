HI Phil (and others),
	As someone who has looked in (generally in vain) the archives for
similar questions I was very pleased to see that you provided a reply as
well as saying "it's in the archives".  However, I wish that instead of
saying "it's in the archives" to FAQ's, the respondent(s) would take a
moment to send a post to the list admins and provide the necessary info to
the LIBRARY.  That is the MOST valuable, fantastic, superior,.. etc. etc.
resource the list members have provided for new bus owners AND it is SO
much easier to find information in.  IMHOP the archives are a real bear to
use.  jon
