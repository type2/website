I found that X-14 bleach base bathroom cleaner works real well for restoring old fiberglass poptop.  Put on some clothes that you can use for rags later, they will get bleached out.  Get the roof wet, spray on the X-14 let it sit for about 15 min and spray off.  Re-apply and scrub like hell on the bad spots.  This is a nice quick way to make a grungy pop-top look white again.  
However, if you are looking to do a little more, I have found a nice way to restore an old pop-top.  Remove the poptop seal (all three) Sand the entire roof down, working from 120 down to 400 grit paper on a random orbit sander. This in itself will make the poptop look clean and white, the only problem is that fiberglass is susceptible to UV light, and after 30 years all the protective gel coat has been lost, (not to mention that you have just sanded off any remaining elments of it) and re-gelcoating is a PITA best left to a pro (i.e. pricey).  What I have done in the alternative is use a chipguard or spray-in truck bedliner in white.  You can thin the heck out of this stuff and it will give a smooth UV protected finish that does not soak into the fiberglass like standard paint does (don't even think of just painitng an old pop-top, it will eat a gallon or two of paint before the coat looks half way even). The chipguard is durable, easy to apply with a run of the mill spray gun and cost about $40 plus thinner. The final product looks very smooth and clean. 
Good luck,

Rick
