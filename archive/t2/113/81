Subject: Re: [T2] [Fwd: Tach/Dwell Meter Usage Question?]

The Dwell meter is supposed to work on electronic ignition, so that is not a
problem. My vanagon is federal so still has the points. At some point I will
move to something like the Pertronix system, though I want to find out if the
igniter II is available for my year first.

Yes I hooked up the black lead to ground and the green lead to the negative
side of the coil (green wire running to the distributor). This is per how the
meter is supposed to be used. The van won't start with the meter installed in
this manner. Currently have it set to RPM mode as I just want to see what the
idle speed is. As the meter works on the newer Isuzu, I think something else
strange must be going on. The van has only 49,500 original miles (I have had
it for only 200 miles) and so I believe that the points, cap and condenser are
probable close to being 20 years old also. I have new parts on order and will
replace everything when they arrive. I just wanted to make sure everything
worked before I went into replacement mode.

Thanks for the advice.
