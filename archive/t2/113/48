Hi All,

Consider the simplest solution first.  I actually have
gotten by quite well in my Westy without an auxilliary
battery.  I've run lights and fans for many hours with
no problem.  The main battery seems to last close to 5
years, although for some reason Champios seem to do
better than others.  Come to think of it, this is an
advantage of vanagon Westies over EVCampers.  It seems
like everything on the EVC depends on the coach
battery.  There must be a rule that says if you have a
coach battery all appliances will be designed to use
it.
