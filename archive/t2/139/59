Subject: Re: [T2] Head Temp Sensor

Sorry for the confusion. I have a 74 Carburated bus on which I am installing
a VDO head temp sensor, the kind where the sending ring replaces the
compression washer under the #3 spark plug. My question is: How have others
routed the sender wire away from the plug and through the tin to continue
it's way under the bus to the front?

Up through the tin into the engine bay? Down past the pushrod tubes and
trough the lower tin? Just looking for suggestions.

Thanks,
Dave
