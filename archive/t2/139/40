Anyone have a good search word for that site?  I can't seem to get the
sound dampening material to come up that looks like Dynamat.

dynamat can be bought without the pretty dynamat stamp
on it from the mcmastercarr web site for much less
than dynamat sells it for.  same exact stuff including
the blue stuff that goes over the sticky part, it just
doesn't have the stamp on it.
