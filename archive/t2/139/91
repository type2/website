No, yopu probably had the corect hose.  The hose you want is ~3/4" in
diameter and runs from the S-hose to the rear right corner of the air dist
box. What bentley does not tell you that you *have* to plug the hole in
the S-duct!  or as Chris says, you have a major leak and hte engine will
not start/run.
