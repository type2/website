Subject: Re: [T2] restorations... (friday)

Okay, I'm an hour ahead of Friday here in Utah, but I thought I'd say 
something about this...

In his book The Fifth Elephant, Terry Pratchett says a few interesting 
things about the way heirlooms change over generations. Something like: 
"Some day, the wood will warp and this axe will need a new handle. And some 
day, the metal will tarnish and this axe will need a new blade. Maybe the 
design will change with the times. But when your great-great-great grandson 
inherits this axe from you, it will be exactly the same axe I'm giving you 
right today."

Why not the same thing for cars? Everything changes, but I believe with all 
my heart that my old bus is just as great as it was the day it came off the 
line. And it will be just as great when my great-great-great grandson 
inherits it.
