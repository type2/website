Subject: Re: [T2] '78 westy

my 2 cents.......

a 78 Westy for that money is alot of $$$$

but a 78 Westy that was driven 20 plus years will have many problems too.....

if money is not the object, buy the low milage one (after a mechanic checks 
it out) and replace all the fuel lines, brake lines and tires which  are 
probably hard or rotten.......

sure there will be a few more hiccups, but nothing like a bus that has 
200-300,000 miles on it.......

and its still half the price of a new minivan......
