Subject: Nikki's Bus, another question...

Art here,
 Nikki's off to the vet with her latest cat rescue and I've been futzing
with the engine in her absence. Found the idle cutoff valve loose in
it's socket, tightened it up, helped things a bit. Idle is still low and
adjustments to the idle screw don't seem to have much of an effect. I
turn it in until the rpms drop, turn back out and it comes back up to
roughly 800 rpm but will not rise any higher, i.e.: to the recommended
850 or so.
   On the timing issue, it seems the distributor drive gear might be 180
degrees out, because I can get the timing light to light up on the red
paint mark, but not on the notch which I've highlighted with chalk. It
is exactly 180 degrees from the red paint mark.
   Even at that, the timing mark seems to jump around a bit, won't hold
steady.
   On top of all that there's a weird noise, kinda like a medium high
pitched "whoocha-whoocha" semi metallic sound that seems to come from
the fan area. Is this an early symptom of a fan failure?
   1973 1700 dual carb Type IV engine.

Ideas?
