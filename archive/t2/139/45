Subject: Re: [T2] Further,Re: [T2] Nikki's Bus, another question...

First thing I'd check is the rubber boot at the base of the intake 
manifold toward the front of the bus. You should find an "L" shaped boot 
that routes vacuum to the brake servo at the front of the bus.  These 
things "pop off" from time to time (ie engine backfire) and the 
resultant vacuum leak causes the engine to miss at #3 and/or #1. 
(There's a boot on each side.)

Now if the boots are both intact and firmly in place you might want to 
check the rubber hoses along the route to the brake servo. Make sure 
these are in place and not leaking.

After ruling out these common spots for vacuum leaks, I dunno, go for 
the other usual suspects I guess. (Spark, Fuel, Compression? Earth, 
Wind, Fire?)
