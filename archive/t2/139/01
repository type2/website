It's Friday where I am for those type2.com listees even though this one may seem a little early to you.

My parents have been out from Sydney to visit for the last couple of days & so what would a guy in the middle of his holidays do on a nice Thursday night?

Why we headed into town for a top meal.

Full to the brim and a few wines under everyone's belt(except or my wife-she doesn't like wine & was the designated driver - safety first) we headed home.

We live on the outside of a small village and park our bus in the small paddock next to the house rather than leave it on the road & so we get her through the gate and close to a fence at the bottom of an embankment & then my wife goes to reverse.

Wet grass....I just knew what was going to happen - I heard the diff wind & knew the traction was gone.

My dad & I are sitting on the middle seat & we're not little guys - around 100kgs (200lbs)
 each - so I think no muddy feet & bogged bus for me.

So we climbed over the middle seat, folded down the back seat and sat above the engine like teddy bears on a shelf i.e. legs straight out & hands flat on the deck.

So then my wife tries again.......No problem this time.

Zoom! Up the embankment & nearly into the fence behind us :-)

I don't know if I was laughing so hard because of that or because of the way the bus was sagging under our combined weight & my was Dad trying to sit up!

:-)
