Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?

Ridiculous.  Yes he is nuts.  I would rather pay $16k for one restored to
mint condition even with a lot of miles on the body.  There are so many
potential problems he is looking at.  Actually I would not pay that much for
any of them.  Besides, it's just a '78.  Low mileage 70's Westfalias are not
uncommon due to their common use as weekend vehicles.  In terms of
investment an older, much older one would be better, and the moment he
starts driving this garage queen it goes way down in value.  There are a
surprising number of low milage cars of all types out there and they are not
worth paying much of a premium since most will immediately need a fair
amount of money spent replacing all the stuff that has gone bad.  The best
way to keep a vehicle in good shape is to maintain it well and use it
moderately and often.  Sitting around is bad for a machine.  People put too
muh of a premium on the number of miles.  GW
