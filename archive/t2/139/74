Subject: Re: [T2] RE:'78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?

I do not find the asking price out of line. A restored Westy sold on eBay
recently for just under $15,000. I saw a 76 a few years ago almost mint with
an ask of $12,000. Looking back now I almost regret not buying it.

Instead I did what most of us do, bought a pretty good bus for around $3000
and put another $3000 or $4000 plus labor into it making it look good and
run well.

Still that is not the same as an unmolested original.

Yet I have had to ask myself a question posed by an earlier
respondent--would I have been happy driving and camping in something that
looked like it should either be in a show room or a climate controlled
garage? and the truth is I do not know.

Part of the charm of owning a bus, for me anyway, is the gritty charm of
taking it on the road. Another charm is the personalization that finds its
way into a bus during the process of restoration--the homemade curtains, the
panels, sound system, the mechanical tweaks and fixes, etc.

I believe before making a decision one way or another on spending $16,000 on
an almost new Westy it is important to know why you want to own a bus and
for what purpose.

If it is to own and drive a classic that will not only hold but probably
increase its value if properly maintained, and you can afford it, then I
would say go for it. Better that than a Kia or Hyundai.

On the other hand, if part of the attraction of owning a bus is to go
puttering down the road, vent window open, radio on loud enough to be heard
over the engine, beer and sodas chilling in the ice box, and a
devil-may-care independent attitude making life a pleasure and worth living,
then I say welcome to the other club.

Most of us, I suspect, are somewhere in the middle.

To thine ownself be true.

Cheers,

John Rogers

selling my restored 71.  Needs the engine put back in and lack of garage and

atoz96(-at-)optonline.net if he is interested.  It is located on Long island in
NY.
