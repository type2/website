Subject: PSI vs. Weight Rating

I'm getting (finally!) some proper tires for Itch. Cheng Shin UE-168 
205R14C's:

http://www.maxxis-reifen.de/seiten/pkw/ue168.htm

I remember an old tire dude in town (since "retired", if you know what I 
mean...) once showed me a graph of how much PSI would give you how much load 
rating on a particular type of tire (passenger, SR rated, C/D rated, etc..).

As the grid shows, the 205's load rating at 69PSI is 2271 lbs - more than 
enough.

Q - What PSI gives me 1800 lbs? If anyone has a listing like the old tire 
dudes (bless his heart), can you publish it?

Thanks folks!
