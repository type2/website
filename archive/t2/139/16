Subject: Timing situation

Nikki here. I'm at Art's in TX. My bus was running a bit rough, stalling
at lights with some backfiring, not wanting to start back up. The choke
connection on the left carb had broken; Art resoldered it and reset the
choke. The spring on the back of that carb that hooks onto the choke
collar had broken at one end, so we bend the end around and hooked that
back up. The rubber elbow at the crossover pipe to the manifold had come
off; replacing that solved the backfire problem.

The latest issue is that we can't get the idle set higher than just
below 8,000. We checked the timing first, and according to the light
it's 180 out, we think (I'm trying to explain this with my meager
vocabulary and knowledge). The timing light flashes on the red mark on
the fan pulley.

Newly rebuilt engine; newly rebuilt carbs. The distributor is a newly
rebuilt vacuum adv/retard model. The hoses are hooked up correctly -- I
checked that first thing against an e-mail I'd printed out and stuck in
my Bentley.

We're baffled. Help!

Nikki
