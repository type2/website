Subject: thermostat question

This keeps being returned for some reason.

Can anyone give advice on how to check to see that my flaps are fully
opening. I am still dealing with a hot engine and am not sure I am adjusting
it correctly. No pressure, but need to know in a couple of hours after it
cools down, so I can attempt the run to Every Bus in the AM.
