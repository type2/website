Subject: Seat Belts

Greetings all,
    I know this is a bit late, but I'll give it a shot. I am looking for
some seatbelts to use on the rear seat of my 70 Westy. I tried some out of a
Beetle, but they are too short. If anyone has some and would like to sell
them, bring them to EBus. Pmail me with the cost and the other particulars.
Later,
Jim
