Seems to me it appears that way because of the position of
the steering wheel.  To reach the 10 and 2 position, I find myself
with my arms stretched forward (more so than on a typical new car) with
my arms resting on the steering wheel.  I suppose that orientation makes
you lean a bit forward, or at least appear that way.
