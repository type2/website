Well, were off now.  Its about 6:40am   Plans are to be in Linville, NC
by 9:00 to meet Doc Ric and the rest of the clan coming from Roan Mt.
So, keep your eyes peeled for a 78 Green Bay window with stapled fabric
as curtains.  LOL  had to make something up quick to cover the windows.
Hope to make it to Linville ok as I have suddenly lost about fifty
percent of my horsepower after change only spark plug wires.  Not sure
what I did.  Runs smooth, just to power.  So, good luck to everyone
heading to EB and hope to see ya soon.
