He's speaking about the "flapper" in the AFM.  In my experience, putting the
pedal to the floor on a Volkswagen when starting only helps when the mixture
is too rich since it introduces much more air into the engine which helps
burn the excess fuel.

The cold start system is completely independent of the ECU.  If the
thermo-time switch senses that it's cold enough it allows current to flow to
the cold start valve when the key is in the "start" position, opening up the
valve and giving the engine that extra "squirt" of fuel it needs on startup.
