Subject: Collapsed Lifter?

It appears I have suffered a collapsed lifter on my 78
2.l engine. The onset was sudden, loud pounding after
drief stop. It did not pump up on drive home of 7
miles. I found #3 exhaust with about 1/8 inch
clearance between rocker and valve stem. Can I adjust
like a solid lifter and drive 60 miles to VW mechanic
to have all replaced. Lifters have about 160K miles on
original set.

Thanks in advance,
