Nice bus to look at I'm sure but rest assured that the fuel system and 
anything made of rubber will require attention. Help educate him about how 
to rpevent engine fires!!! I'd be sick if I watched my 200K mile bus (with 
lot's of hours of work) burn - let alone a low mileage garage queen.

Just b/c it is a low mileage vehicle doesn't mean it will be no trouble.

Ask your friend if he REALLY wants it b/c this bus will sell to somebody. 
Too many people will think that low mileage equals new. Low mileage really 
just means it has low mileage - it's age has to be factored in and what 
that does to rubber.

At least he knows it's probably rust free and not had any probably 
collisions. I' be checking carefully to be sure this bus is as low mileage 
as the owner claims. Hate to find out 6 months later that this bus was 
really just a clean 200K mile bus for $16K.

I'd probably aim for a VERY well restored bus in the $10K range because all 
of the time related problems like dry rotted rubber will have been 
addressed IF it was restored properly.

If I had $16K I might jump on this bus too but I'd do it knowing that the 
low mileage figures don't guarantee anything.

Ask your friend what he wants to do with this bus b/c if he just wants 
something to knock around in and not worry about there are hundred and 
thousands of really nice busses that aren't perfect for less than $8K.

I'd hate to beatup a vintage $16K bus camping when I could have done the 
same with a $6K bus.
