Subject: Re: [T2] good anti-seize goop?

I remove the spark plug. If it was installed with antiseize, I clean the 
threads with a chaser to get all the gunk out. 2 or 3 drops of light 
machine oil (3in1, sewing machine oil, etc.) on the cleaned threads to 
reinstall. Turn them to their seat with fingers. If you can't do that, you 
have foul procedure somewhere in the history. Torque to just crush the 
washer. Antiseize will give false torque/stressed threads and will get 
gummy then hard with age. At least make sure it's designed to withstand 
high heat. Most aren't. Antiseize is for splines and slipping mechanisms, 
primarily. Use it on your clutch disk and input shaft splines (I prefer 
copper based to aluminum), not on spark plug threads in aluminum threads or 
lug nuts/bolts where false torque can stress you out.
