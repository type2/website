Subject: RE: [T2] will it go faster this way?

I personally find that in the 20-30 minutes that it takes me to reach
highway speeds I tend to get kinda tired and need something to lean on.
What better position for highway lounging than slumped over the wheel of
your beloved bus...

Seems to me it appears that way because of the position of
the steering wheel.  To reach the 10 and 2 position, I find myself
with my arms stretched forward (more so than on a typical new car) with
my arms resting on the steering wheel.  I suppose that orientation makes
you lean a bit forward, or at least appear that way.
