Hi John (et al)

Well I've been both sides of the fence.

Firstly I had a rough '73 which over a number of years I restored; enjoying=
 the work and personalisation involved. Then it died big time - the outer p=
art of rear torsion bar tube
became detached from the chassis - and my bus (minus all removable parts) w=
ent to the scrap yard.

Secondly I have my current bus, a 1998 T2 imported into the UK from Brazil =
(not legal for import to N. America) with a 1600 FI aircooled engine fitted=
.

If you buy a bus to use and enjoy then there is no difference between drivi=
ng and using a 150,000 mile 25 year old bus and a 0 miles bus. Yes the new =
64hp 1600 engine is faster than the old 49hp 1600 engine, but the quality o=
f the bodywork and interior has not changed my outlook on life one little b=
it, nor has it changed where I take the bus.

Is a $16000 westy worth it? In the end thats for the buyer to decide.=20

Over the six years I had my '73 it probably cost that much, to buy restore =
and maintain. The current bus (now with 30,000Km -18,000miles - on the cloc=
k) cost less than =A3600 ($1000USA) to maintain last year and that included=
 having a made to measure one off stainless steel exhaust system fitted.

My experience is that you can buy a tired bus and have your hand in your po=
cket all the time, or a pay a lot more up front and be able to enjoy your b=
us with out wondering when it will next need some work on it. Either way I =
suspect that the cost of ownership per year over a ten year period will wor=
k out the same on my new bus as the cost per year for the six years I had t=
he 'old' bus.

You pays your money, and takes your chance.

Good luck
