Hay everybody!

Bus Gypsy here again.  Wanted to thank everyone who responded to Friday's=
 question. Responses were interesting, and informative. Now to business! =
 I am selling a few interior pieces from a westie that I received in a tr=
ade. I also have a few mechanical as well.  I have the front cot, and har=
dware in very good shape. Also have the top shelf, slider panel, 2 front =
seats in fair cond., rear defroster glass, single port shroud, cooling fa=
n, flywheel (close to new), and a few other items including a good dual p=
ort case, and used hi perf. heads. All must go, as I am moving.  I have a=
 new motor from Bob Donalds which is going in my bus, and I need some mis=
c. pieces.  Most are engine parts. Trades are welcome as well. Best way t=
o get them is to come here to Vermont, as shipping on most items would pr=
obably be pretty high. Need to get Belle on the road, as she is very anxi=
ous to play again.            Thank You
