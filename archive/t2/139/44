Not in my experience.  For several months I traveled around with a defective
thermo-time switch that would allow the cold start valve to open if I tried
to start the engine when the engine was moderately warm, flooding the
engine.  If I put my foot to the floor and cranked a bit, I could usually
get the engine started.

I must admit I'm not really sure about that having never successfully
puzzled out that part of the wiring diagram.
