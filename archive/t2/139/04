Tyler,

Ummmmm...define wiggle....

The whole idea behind good linkage is that it moves both carb throttle 
plates at the same time and the same "distance".  Otherwise they can be 
somewhat "wiggly".  

If you pull back on the throttle linkage and one side moves 1/4" and the 
other side doesn't move at all, then you have a problem.  1/4" is not an 
absolute value, just an example.

IIRC the factory adjusters can take a lot of "wiggle" out, but just look 
at them....and read the manual...this is dificult to describe over e-mail.

The bentley did a good job of it though.

*Look* at the stock linkage, become one with it<grin>...is it loose 
someplace where it should not be? Are the heim joints(small ball joints) 
tight in the sockets or loose...are the greased or dry...are the "ball" 
ends still tightly attached to the arms?  Are the places where the linkage 
rotates in a carrier loose or tight, lubed or dry.....

Oh, and get yourself some thick foam to put your knees on as you kneel 
into the engine to do this...this is probably what the "mechanic" didn't 
like....

Cheers, dave
