Hi Rogelio,

I think thats true for a 1700/1800/2000 engine but not for a 1600. 
If you replace the drain plug with the sender then it would be necessary to remove the sender each time you drain the oil which you may not consider a good idea.
If you take the sump plate and oil strainer off you should be able to work out a position away from the centre which will have sufficient inside clearance for the sender whilst allowing clearance for spanners on the drain plug and securing nuts on the outside.
Remember to measure twice and cut once!

Good luck
