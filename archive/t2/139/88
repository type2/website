What I was trying to do was, what is prescribed in Bentley:

To test the auxiliary air  regulator, disconnect its fabriccoverd intake air
hose from the
large rubber S-shaped duct that joins the intake are sensor with the
throttle valve housing.
Then start the enginge (mine would not start - I probably have the wrong
hose). There
should be vacuum at the disconnected hose, if you cover the hose, the engine
should slow
down. After several minutes of operation, the vacumm should diminish and
eventually
dissapear almost completely.

I will instead try what Tom Young said and start the bus get it to operating
temp
shut the bus down, disconnect the hose (assuming that it is the longer of
the two hoses
on the aux air reg.) and see if I can blow into it with out turning red,
poping my ears, clearing my
sinuses etc.
