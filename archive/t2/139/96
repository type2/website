Subject: Unbelievable Happening---


So I'm at the Grocery / drug store the other day refilling a
script---and I have to unload  my bladder real bad, while i'm waiting
for the pharmaceutical engineer to get my stuff together---

I ask where the john is --he points over to behind the cash
register's---

I get there, unzip, and as I'm in front of the urinal, I hear the door
open---but I hear nothing else, and I know someone is in there--just
can't see them.

I look over my left shoulder, and I see this guy, with his pants, and
jockey's dropped down to his ankle's---

I ignore him--

Next thing is this guy starts talking------

"I'm gay"---

I think --Oh boy--hear we go---

" And I have a nicotine patch on my thing"

I say---"Oh great--- and I really appreciate you sharing that all with
me--but what in hell do I care?"
" I'm almost done unloading here junior--you can jump in here next"---

"Oh no--I just am very proud of myself, and wanted to share this with
someone"
 
"Well thanks for sharing this all with me--but I'm outa here jack---you
ain't sharing anything you got with me--"

He say's --

"Oh no--you don't seem to understand---
I want to share this with someone-- am so proud of myself, using this
nicotine patch on my thing-----I am down to two Butts a Day !!!"
