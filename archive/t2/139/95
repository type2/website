The exhaust valve is probably burned. Don't drive it like that, or the valve
can break, go through the piston and totally destroy the engine, including
the case. At the very least, pull the engine and take the heads to a
competent machine shop. Have them replace all exhaust valves, all exhaust
guides (maybe intake guides, too and check all the seats. Chances are the #2
exhaust seat is shot. While the heads are off, check the pistons and
cylinders per Bentley. Check the play between the crank and the rods. You
may be able to get by with just the heads and new pistons and cylinders for
another 20K to 50K. A P&C replacement and taking the heads to a machine shop
is well within the abilities of a novice. More than that, you will be better
off with a long block or taking the whole thing in to a mechanic.

Dunno, but FAT is the Type 4 mecca down there.

A complete motor is about $2k. Valve job about $300. to $400. P&C's check
the VW mag's. Whatever you do, get the valve job done by the best available
machine shop, even if it means shipping the heads to RIMCO or FAT. And don't
quibble about price for the valve job. A poorly done "cheap" job is far more
expensive than quality work. Bad things happen to heads like dropped seats,
etc.
