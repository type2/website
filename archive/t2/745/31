Subject: RE: [T2] Tank Crud - Alternatives?

Guys,

If this is old gasoline type "crud", neither alcohol or amonia is even 
going to get close.

Richard's web page has an excellent writeup someplace in there about what 
he found in his tank and how it looked when he finished.

My experience was with a tank that had been sitting for 8 years and must  
have been full when it was parked...we're talking *great* *big* junks of 
tar.

see picture #12 specifically

I ran paint thinner and all sort of other evil petroleum products thru 
this tank for two weeks before I bit the bullet and took it out.

Trust me, the only way to know for sure is to take it out and get it where 
you can see inside and get it *really* clean!

Somehow, all of us keep learning this lesson over and over and over again!

Cheers, dave
