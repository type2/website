Hi Volks,

The middle of next month my employer is sending me down to Tempe AZ  
(Near Phoenix) for a training course. I'll be flying in on a Monday  
and out again on the Friday. Don't know my flight times yet.

Anyone here with experience of the area?  Have any suggestions on  
what to do while I'm there? I'm a geography freak so I'll HAVE to  
visit the desert while I'm there.

Helpful advice gladly accepted.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
