Subject: '72 fuel tank help

Ok tough guys or gals,

I need a picture of a '72 only fuel tank. At least I think they are '72 
only. I know that there is something about the vent lines that are '72 only. 
If anyone has access to the top or rear of one please pmail me a pic. I just 
might hook you up with some parts.

Showing signs of weakness,

-Joe
