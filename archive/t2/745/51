Subject: Trip South, through Florida, back to Washington DC

Hello,   I am heading Sout, down I-95 from Springfield Virginia to spend a 
few weeks by myself in Florida.

I have the Florida AIRS list, but  I will not have a cell phone on my trip.  
I am planning to leave Friday midnight (less traffic) and go South until I 
get somewhere interesting.

I plan to spend a few days in St Augustine [Pirate Haus Inn & Hostel], some 
time in Coco Beach [Patrick AFB housing] and a day or so in Orlando [Palm 
Lakefront Resort & Hotel] then most of the time at Clearwater Beach [Hi 
Clearwater Beach Hostel] and Tampa [McDill AFB] area.

I will be driving a ''78 Sage Green westy that has seen better days and 
times, with a Virginia license plate    6PAC 2GO   .

PM me if anybody has any suggestions where to go or what to do.  I will be 
traveling light, with probably more tools than clothes.
