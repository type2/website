I noticed that, thought for a bit my guage might be that far off

I now run Mobil 1 15W50 year round...but right after my engine rebuild I
had some Sunoco straight weight in there for break in and just before I
made the last change I did a gas tank full run, on the interstate, on
surface roads on city streets... noted the results.  then switched to
Pennzoil 5W50 synthetic. drove the same route, same weather conditions
etc. and noted absolutely no difference in temps and presures.   no
differnce in fuel mileage either.

now I continue to run synthetic, mostly because of cold weather starting
but also because of it's resistance to break down at higher temps.

YMMV
