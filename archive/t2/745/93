huh. i just spent my 40th hiking the canyon... saw 6 people. spent 
hours and miles all by myself. phantom ranch was full, but not 
crowded.
the hike home up bright angel had more traffic... but it was fun 
watching all the tourists heading down from the 48 degree rim into 
the 92 degree (at 8 am) inner gorge, WITH winter gear on, but WITHOUT 
water. tourist TRAP is right; i had to find a ranger to go after 2 
sets of japanese tourists who were hiking w no water. personally, 
they oughta just let idiots like that lie where they fall for the 
condors.

bus content: there were 4 bays (2 immobile), 2 vanagons, i eurovan 
and no splitties at the south rim. saw a bay outside of montezuma's 
well on way up, saw lots in flagstaff.
