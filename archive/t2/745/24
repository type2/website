Subject: Californian people , bookmark this page for used part !

Hi guys ,

Just want to share this info with those Volks who are in California and 
more specifically in the Bay Area
I'd like to praise Tassi inc (www.tassiinc.com) which is a specialist 
for Volkswagen.
Not only he is a great mechanic but more interesting for us, he has A 
LOTS OF used parts. !!

Here what I got for $100 for my Vanagon 83
- A complete harness in great condition (not even one wire to fix)
- The entire fuel line , including the 4 injectors ( one was almost new !!)
- A thermostat (well this one was half dead , but I got the backet at 
least  !)
- Sun visors
- The entire dash board
- oops I forget , 2 exhaust pipes

Why I am praising those guys ? because they are really nice people 
always willing to help you and work the best they can if you are on budget.
They were really helpful giving me some free advises and sometime some 
missing pieces (which I was not aware of) so I can put my project van on 
the road again. You don't need to take my word for it, give it a try, 
call them, ask for Bruce  and check by yourself.
