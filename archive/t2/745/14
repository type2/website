Subject: Bus runs with key out of ignition switch

Either I never noticed it before or it's a new phenomenon, but when I
pull out the light switch to the first stop, the running lights
correctly come on but will also dim and brighten when the knob is
rotated.

Also, when the engine is running and the headlights are on I can
remove the key from the ignition switch and the engine continues to
run. When the light switch is pushed in to off, the engine stops.

Since everything works and it's been raining I haven't been able to
check it out. Any ideas on where to start or has anyone experienced
similar symptoms?

Rick, (BTW, about 260 VW's showed at the MVCC meet in Ypsilanti, MI on
Sunday)
