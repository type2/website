Subject: Re: [T2] Busses in Holland

Hi Todd,

I live in The Netherlands myself and must say that the splitties over here
are a minority. And the ones that are admitted to the roads mostly come out
for meetings or fundriving. In my neighbourhood is however a daily driver,
but it is indeed a seldom sight.

For the baywindow buses I can say that more and more they are used in a
similar way as i described for the splitties above. I see them drive along
although. Normally about once a week I see a bay driving or parked on the
roadside.

The road tax in Holland does not apply for vehicles over the age of 25
years. So that is not the reason. Most people have a modern daily driver and
just take the bus out on sunny days and for family outings.

The eurovans are very popular as deliveryvans over here. It is one of the
best selling vans on the market. The campers you have seen are most probably
Westfalia Campers. It is just not written in big lettering as they used to
do.

Greetz,

 Hey guys,

      Just thought I'd share something I learned and wanted to hear what you
guys think about it. I just got back from a trip to Holland. I always look
at the cars any time I leave the US and I noticed I didn't see very many VW
Busses at all. As a matter of fact, I believe i only saw two the entire time
I was there, and they were both Bay Busses.

 Anyone have any opinions on this?

 On a side note, I did see literally THOUSANDS of what we call "EuroVans".
In Holland however, they were all titled as "Transporter"... which I thought
was kind of cool. The EuroVan over there seemed to have been used just like
hte VW Bus was back in the day... there were some panel vans, some camper
vans, some pickup truck vans... etc...

 As someone else on here mentioned, the EuroVans that I saw which were
camper vans, were not done by Westfalia. If they were, it didn't say it on
there.
