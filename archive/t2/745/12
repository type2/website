OK, in this instance, forget Bentley.... it shows the
74/75 sensor location.

In your case, it is on the left cylinder head, just
forward of the #3 intake runner. On top. 

This is if the left head is still on the left side:)

Find the 3 and 4 injecter connecters. Follow the grey
sheath to the main loom. It will go left and right.
Left goes to the double relay and the injecter
resister pack. In between the injecters and the relays
is a single wire. Follow it to the sensor.

 I have been trying to figure out where the heck my
 cylinder head temp sender
 is? Clementine is 1977 FI Westy.  I have a wire
 coming out of the #3 spark
 plug hole that I figure is the CHT gauge wire. But
 okay don't laugh but how
 and where is the temp sensor II? I don't see where
 it would be inside the
 engine compartment. Is it accessed for under the
 bus? Good grief I feel dumb.
 I looked in Bentley but I still don't understand.
 Ugh just need a little help...
