Subject: Windshield Washer Pump?

Ok, let me start by saying that my 78 Transporter is a daily driver,
and as such i have need of certain things.  1 of which is a
windshield washer that works.

Has anyone found a good 12v pump that is compact enough and powerful
enough to do that job, and that can be easily mated to the resovior?

thanks,

David.
