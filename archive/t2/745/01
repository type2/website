Subject: Re: [T2] Intermittent oil light

Hi Mitch,

If the oil light has only been coming on at idle, then I wouldn't  
worry about the cooler. Changing to 20W50 will take care of that. If  
the oil pressure light has come on at speed, then you have other issues.

BTW, it might help to check the wiring on the oil pressure switch.  
The light on the dash is lit by the switch grounding it to the  
engine. If the wire to the oil pressure switch finds another path to  
ground it will trigger the dash light no matter what the oil pressure.

One step at a time is the only way to do troubleshooting if you want  
to know what solves the problem.


Happy trails,
