There is a small donut seal that goes around the injector tip and 
presses against the manifold.  That actually seals from outside air 
getting in with the fuel.  The seal, which isn't much if a seal, is a 
larger donut shaped rubber o-ring that goes around the injector and 
helps to keep it in place when you screw the injector holder in place.
