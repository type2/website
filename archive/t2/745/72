Your pics are excellent! I'm going back to the Canyon
end of september in my '74 Westy hardtop. Have been
there numerous times, hiked to the interior & along
the Tonto Plateau 3 times, did a cross-canyon hike in
2002 with my two bros. My fave place in the whole
world. what in the world would Death Valley have over
the Grand Canyon? To each there own, I guess.

I'm from Kansas City, MO, so it's not exactly a wekend
drive. I'm looking forward to making the trip in my
Westy, as I say. I made this trip back in '85 in a '73
Bus (not a camper), too ignorant to know how to
properly drive a Bus, floored it for most of the 1200+
miles. Made it OK, but I think that was a big factor
in the demise of that engine shortly thereafter. I'll
know better this time!
