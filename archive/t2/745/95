Like most national parks, the tourist routes are, well, full of tourists.

When I go by the Grand Canyon, I prefer the north rim, both for its view
and because of the drive east to the Vermillion Cliffs.

The only uncrowded national park I have visited is
Great Basin.  Nothing like 350 miles of 2-lane to the nearest population
center to cut even foreign tourists' zeal to visit.
