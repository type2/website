Hi Joe -

I don't have any pics, but this might make it easier to locate a tank
or to view what you need.

Here's the *official* break-down of Bay Window tanks:
211 201 075 D  68-71 (Original #, never superseded)

211 201 075 H  72-Early 73 (Original #, never superseded)
Note:  To Vin 2x3 2150 137

211 201 075 G  Late 73-74 (Calif 74 Man Trans w/Carb)
(Superseded to 211 201 075 L)

211 201 075 J  1974 Calif Auto Trans w/FI, 75-79 All
(Superseded to 211 201 075 M)

Why the change in January 1973?  The fuel gauge sender changed from a
5 screw tube style to a twist-on lever style.  Trivia note - The fuel
gauge changed at the same time to be compatible with the different
sender - they are NOT interchangeable (actually they won't read
correctly with the different sender).

It helps to have very old 1972/1973/1975 dated microfiche plates in
the library :-)
