Subject: Stock Muffler setup - parts required

Hi,

1600 DP in a '71 Westy. Trying to get back to stock setup.

I'm scrapping my aftermarket muffler. After less that a week of new
use it has developed a crack.

I've already purchased and received a stock style muffler (kadron,
purchased from a list member) and I'm trying to make sure I've got all
the parts I need on the way.

I've ordered from the Busdepot:

211 251 237B	Tail Pipe
211 298 055C	Tail Pipe Gasket Set
211 251 301A	Damper Bracket
211 298 009A	Muffler Gasket Set
147 251 157      Damper Pipe
211251269A 	Exhaust Pipe Clamp (2)

I'm looking at the Bentley and trying to make sure I didn't forget
anything, but I'm not sure exactly what parts are included in both the
Tailpipe gasket set and the Muffler gasket set. Will those include all
the clamps I need to mount the damper pipe?

Is it correct that I need one damper pipe and one tailpipe? Whats the
deal with that?

Did I forget anything important?

Also I noted an extra port on the new muffler on the left side where
it connects to the head and heat riser tube. Any idea what size this
is threaded so I can plug it? Or am I supposed to have something that
plugs in here?

Please bear with me, this is my first experience with the stock
exhaust system. Any help/tips are appreciated.

peace

sidenote: Passed by my first bus today while driving my bus. Not too
many around here in upstate NY. The passenger in the other bus was
just as glad to see me and was waving furiously. maybe a listmember in
a brown late bay was driving around albany today? Nice to see you!
