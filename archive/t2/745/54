Gene Berg sez:

"Another concern is the weight of the oil. Remember, the heavier the oil, 
the less it lubricates. We run 20 weight in our race engines and 10-30 
weight in all street engines. Only if the temperature is constantly above 
80-85 degrees would I consider 10-40 weight. 5-30 should be used when 
temperature falls to below 45 degrees. For freezing temperatures straight 10 
weight would be my choice."
