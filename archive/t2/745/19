With the engine out, it would be an excellent time to
pop open the firewall, gain access to the gasoline
tank, and replace all of the rubber connectors on the
fuel system vent lines.  Also replace, if you have not
done so already, the fuel filter, the fuel lines from
the tank to the filter, from the filter to the pump,
from the pump to the left or drivers-side fuel rail,
and replace the right or passengers-side fuel return
hose which connects to the tin-mounted fuel pressure
regulator.  Review the MB (Mercedes-Benz) type fuel
hose clamps extensively discussed in the T2 archives.
    
I painted my engine compartment white (not the body
color).  It's no longer dark and difficult to see
within the compartment.  Just an idea.  :D
