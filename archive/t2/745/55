I am not an expert on oil by any means, but I do have pressure gauges on
both my daily driven VW's.

There are few things I have noticed working on and driving:

If you are using a VDO dual post sender, the oil light will come on at a
much higher threshold than the stock switch, 11 psi for the VDO dual pole
unit versus 4-6 psi stock. What this means is that you are more likely to
see the flickering light with the VDO sender. If the Thing is on the highway
for 2 hours steady, then comes off for gas say, the light may flicker a bit
at IDLE, but disappear immediately with a few extra RPM. The pressure gauge
tells me the flicker is happening at about 10psi, which I know is perfectly
safe for idle pressure. If the light EVER flickers at road speed, you have a
different, more serious, problem. The only time I have seen an oil light at
road speed is in the bus at high speed on a sweeping left turn with low oil
level in the crankcase. People who roadrace 914's always over fill the
crankcase to combat this problem (or use a dry sump system).

I don't think you can compare the oil system of a VW with that of a modern
vehicle, so the fact that new cars use 5w or even 0w oil doesn't mean
anything to a 30- or 40- year vehicle owner.

I just use whatever oil I have around. I know that may sound crazy, but all
modern oil is pretty good in my book. In the bus I have used everything from
10w30 to 20w50, dino oil, full synthetic, whatever. I use rotella sometimes
because I have it around for my diesel volvo wagon. I even make my own
blends of oil if I don't have enough of something, like say I have 2 bottles
of 20w50 but it is winter so I add some 10w30 and it ends up in the middle
somewhere. I worked on a film 3 years ago and we got tons of free oil from
quaker state. I never buy that brand but I took it, about 7 cases worth. I
am down to my last case and it has been fine. I have tried lots of brands,
mobil 1 is very good and I like the idea of the wide range in a castrol
syntec 5w50, but it seems to be thinner than other 50w I have tried. Now I
mostlly use rotella t 15w40 or castrol 20w50. I don't notice much of a
difference in oil pressure between the two.

What is important is that the oil get changed regularly, and that is a
given, not so much what kind of oil. Thw oil weights are specified in the vw
manuals and shop books, and I follw that pretty much. 15w40 is good for
sping and fall. Hottest summer highway driving means 20w50 for me. 10w30 in
the winter, I don't drive it much, but I start it so the oil is needed.
