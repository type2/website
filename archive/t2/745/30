I hope that this your surprise here is not because the muffler you received
has two tailpipe outlets. If so, then you have purchased a Bug muffler, not
a Bus muffler. 

Here is a picture of what you need:

You can see in the picture where the second tailpipe outlet would have been
if this were a Bug muffler, but since it is a Bus muffler it only accepts
one tailpipe.
