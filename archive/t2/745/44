OK, I went and checked, the muffler I have is like the one in the
pictured above. It has two outlets in the rear. It has the following
part number: 113 251 053AQB Kadron, Brazil. So this probably is a bug
muffler? Will it work on my bus? Do I need 2 tailpipes and the
dampener?

If the muffler only had one tailpipe opening, would it still require a
tailpipe and a dampener? Where does the dampener hook up to the
muffler?

Did I order the right parts? I did order 2 tailpipes.

211 251 237B    Tail Pipe (2)
211 298 055C    Tail Pipe Gasket Set
211 251 301A    Damper Bracket
211 298 009A    Muffler Gasket Set
147 251 157      Damper Pipe
211251269A      Exhaust Pipe Clamp (2)

Thanks
peace
