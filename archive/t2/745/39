<Wait till after you've moved to TN and check out www.its-titles.com. Worked for me and took about a
month and a half for the process.>

Beware: the Alabama title dude got nailed.

Boyd Coddington (the TV hot rod fellow for you non-street rod fans) got nailed pretty good. Authorities prob were just out to make him a poster boy for their efforts. 

The title services prob work but are of dubious legality and why bother when the TN DMV is fairly easy to deal with.
