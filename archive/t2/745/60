Subject: bus sighting in Porsche promotional film

Hi all,



I just got this link from Porsche NA



http://ws.us.porsche.com/cayman/pcna.asp?



If you go to the video enhanced version and then click on "True
Origins", watch the film and within the first 10 seconds, there is a
nice white bay sitting next to the track.
