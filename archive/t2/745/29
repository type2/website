Subject: Busses in Holland

Hey guys,

     Just thought I'd share something I learned and wanted to hear what you guys think about it. I just got back from a trip to Holland. I was visiting some family I have there. I always look at the cars any time I leave the US and I noticed I didn't see very many VW Busses at all. As a matter of fact, I believe i only saw two the entire time I was there, and they were both Bay Busses. 

I saw a bright red one, and a two tone green and yellow one.

In any case, I asked some of my cousins there and they said that there used to be more, however a lot of the older cars get exported out to the US, in particular Cooper Minis and classic Volkswagens.

Anyone have any opinions on this?

On a typical day, it's not uncommon for me to see about 2 Bay busses a day here in South Florida.


On a side note, I did see literally THOUSANDS of what we call "EuroVans". In Holland however, they were all titled as "Transporter"... which I thought was kind of cool. The EuroVan over there seemed to have been used just like hte VW Bus was back in the day... there were some panel vans, some camper vans, some pickup truck vans... etc... 

As someone else on here mentioned, the EuroVans that I saw which were camper vans, were not done by Westfalia. If they were, it didn't say it on there.
