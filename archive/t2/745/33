In Holland however, they were all titled as "Transporter"... which I thought
was kind of cool. The EuroVan over there seemed to have been used just like
hte VW Bus was back in the day... there were some panel vans, some camper
vans, some pickup truck vans... etc...

Hello all,

the german post office used to have a huge fleet of "EuroVans" a.k.a.
"Transporters". They have 47hp diesel engines, are painted yellow and have a
special white hightop with a larger sliding door (the hightop cut out to fit
the larger door). In the last 4-5 years the post office sold them very cheap
(~1000-2000$). Some friends of mine own those Transporters and had a lot of
trouble with the small engines having been pushed very hard to get the bus
moving.
However, they are a good starting point to build a camper (lots of storage
space, a big auxiliary diesel heater, a sliding door where you can enter
without hitting your head, cheap insurance and tax due to stronger
suspension for carrying more load ("Bautruppfahrzeug") ). So if you see a
yellow/white EuroVan in Europe, it is very likely that it once belonged to
the german post office.

Baywindow busses are getting rare in Germany, because of high taxes for
vehicles without catalytic converters, high gas prices and lots of salt in
the winter. Especially in the last 2 years one sees less and less bays (not
to talk about splits). Sad but true.
