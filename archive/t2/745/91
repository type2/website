Arizona destinations outside Phoenix:

Arcosanti (arcosanti.org) is indeed a fascinating stop for anyone interested
in architecture, urban planning, or environmental design.  It's also a fun and
inexpensive place to stay overnight.

I really like Prescott and Jerome, too -- very fun places to visit.  Prescott
is up high (read: not as hot in summer) and is a greay place to walk around
and enjoy.  Jerome is a former ghost town in the hills that's more or less
been returned to non-ghost status -- be sure to have dinner at the former
insane asylum, as the food there is quite excellent.  The Inn at Jerome is a
neat B&B with plenty of character.

Isn't there some kind of annual Bus event in Jerome?  Must be a ton of fun.
