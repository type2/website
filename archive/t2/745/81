In my thermal accident last summer, my oil light came on at 280

Valvoline 20-50 SR-1 Racing Oil. Very hot day, probably over 100
degrees. I find the motor very resilient and have had no trouble with
it.

You are supposed to have 10 psi per 1000 rpm. The 20-50 oil gives me
this pressure perfectly when warmed up. I am still way to high when
cold.

True synthetic oil has less dependence on these molecules and in my
mind is the best answer to many of these problems. I will be switching
as soon as my current stocks are depleted.
