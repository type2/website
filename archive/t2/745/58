IMHO this demonstrates that Gene Berg has some pretty kooky ideas.

I haven't had a whole lot of respect for Mr. Berg's opinions since I first
read his take on gauges a few years ago.  He basically says that all gauges
under about $200 are useless due to poor and inconsistent calibration.  Now, I
buy the idea that a low-end gauge might not really mean 220 when it says 220
-- heck, new cars' factory-installed gauges usually have no calibration at
all, other than maybe a "normal" range -- but that's the point, which Mr. Berg
misses entirely!  The purpose of temperature and pressure gauges is to be able
to identify an abnormal operating condition *before* additional damage is
done.

"The heavier the oil, the less it lubricates" sounds every bit as stubbornly
reductionist as "gauges are inaccurate, therefore they are useless."  If it
really were true, then we'd all be filling our oil sumps with WD-40, and our
engines would be loving us for it.
