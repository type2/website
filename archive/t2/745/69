Subject: need ign. switch set screw

hello list.

i need the teeny-tiny set screw that holds the electrical side of the
ignition switch in the housing.

i am guessing they the same for all bays? the housing i have is part #
211905889, if that matters.

anyone have an extra or two they want to part with?

i would gladly make a donation to type2.com for your assistance.

TIA,
