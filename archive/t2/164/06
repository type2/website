Subject: Electric bus

And hey!  It's not about a Deadhead tour...

Do you folks remember Topher Waring?  He's the middle school shop teacher in
Vermont who rebuilds his electric loaf each year with new groups of
students, then they run it in the Tour de Sol.   Hoot all you like about
electric vehicles and buses in particular, you have to start somewhere and I
admire the guy.  Check out this new bus (not his).
