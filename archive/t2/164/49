Quick thoughts:
	- Perhaps they've got a stuck oil galley plug, causing the oil to 
by-pass the cooler and run super hot
	- a rag or something caught in the fan -- time to reach around and 
feel if anything's there

Have they noticed any trends when they're adjusting their valves?  Any 
valves generally loose or tight?
(hopefully they're adjusting them as often as they can...?)
