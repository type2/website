Subject: Re: [T2] heater cable stuck

One idea FWIW
Find out how far it is by using a probe cable.  Then do tube surgery
-slice the tube where some cable is where the end is (ie, dremyl tool
with cutoff FIBER disk)- you could cut just enough off the tube to
acccess the cable with a hemostat or needle nose vice grips.
Later, jbweld a piece over the tube cut, or if you cut the tube all the
way through, use a collar slipped over one side and then slid back to
hold both ends.
