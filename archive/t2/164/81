Hey Everybody!

Thanks for all the good ideas.  After checking all my connections, fuel =
delivery, and fuel pressure, I decided to check the voltages and =
resistance at the plug.  What I found was no signal coming from the =
starter.  In the process of checking everything I removed both of the =
double relays and the power source from the high voltage side of the =
coil.  When I put everything back on, it fired right up!!  I think that =
during the time the bus sat (approx 1.5 years), some corrosion built up =
at that connection which caused my problem. =20

As for the clutch, I feel like an idiot.  None of my 4 VWs had new =
clutches installed so I had no idea how smooth and effortless the clutch =
takeup should be.

Now if I could only quiet down these pesky lifters!!

Happy V-dubbing,
Erich Elmer
