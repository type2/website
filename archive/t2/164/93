The lights are not related so it appears that you have two different problems.

Both lights should be off when the key is off.

When you turn the key on - but before you crank the engine - both lights 
should come on to test their operation.

Once the engine is running both should go out.

The only reason the oil pressure light should come on is if the oil 
pressure gets too low or if the wire between the idiot light in the 
instrument cluster and the oil pressure switch grounds out (metal rubs 
through the wire insulation and making contact with the wire inside).

As for the charging light - I would inspect or test the voltage regulator 
regulator.

The question I ask is how does the ignition lock light these two idiot 
lights? Has that circuit failed in some way? These two lights are unrelated 
but this could cause them to act up together.

I can think of no reason that charging the battery would cause a problem. 
Was this bus operating right before the charging?

That's all I've got to offer right now - ideas. I don't have a wiring 
schematic at hand so I can't check and describe the circuit.

I do think they are online someplace.

Anybody else chime in here?
