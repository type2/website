Subject: Someone must know what tire pressure do use in Agilis 51 tires!

This is a repost because I harbly got any replies. I want to 
make sure I am running the correct tire pressure in my 215/65-
15 Agilis 51 tires on my westy. What are you Volks running? 
Anyone know the Eurovan or SA Bus pressures for comparison?

Thanks,
Chris
