I had this very same problem, in fact the header and muffler were sent
as a package from the same vendor. The muffler is a Bug Pack, but I
have no idea who made the header. Since this was the last part needed
to get me on the road, and I was not interested in waiting for another
shipment, I cut the flange off the muffler, turned it and welded it back on.
If you are not capable of this operation I would think that a local
muffler shop or mechanic would do it for 10 or 20 bucks.
