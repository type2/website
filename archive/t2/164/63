On speaker placement,,,

I chose to drill a few holes in my dash using the same pattern and size as the
factory speaker that is in the center of the dash,, 

I have loads of people tell me all the nit picky things that are "not right"
with my bus when at shows,,, but no one has spotted this as a "Hack"... so far!

In fact,, the people I have pointed this out to,, are sure it *IS* factory,,,,
<grin> 

I did this in my driveway when I replaced the windshield seal....

here is a picture of the passenger side of my dash, notice the grab handle for
reference,

I was able to fit roughly 11" x 4 " speaker with 2 little speakers inside
that... 
take out the glove box, and slip the gauge cluster out a bit to get access.

Hope that helps
