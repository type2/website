We just ordered an AVP engine through Bus Depot.  We've got a little
over two months to get the bus in shape for our drive back to Juneau, 
Alaska from DC.  We came in an '89 honda civic, so I imagine this trip
will be quite a lot different.  At least the dog will have more room.

Still to do before the engine gets here:
ball joints
check the cv joints
check the brakes


Got a lot to do before we leave.  It'd be nice to have a few more months
to get everything air tight (but not water-tight).
