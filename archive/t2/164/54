I have some Pioneer speakers in the lower front doors (5 or 6 inches) with
separate tweeters in the extreme top front corners of the door panels.  They
are surface mounted so I didn't have to cut the door and came with inline
crossovers.  I used extensive acreage of Dynamat as well.  Sounds great even
at high speed but I haven't got round to doing the rear yet.  I have seen
tweeters that can be angled in different directions - those may be even
better.  Try to make sure you have 'line of sight' to both tweeters when you
are in the driving position, i.e. not so one of them is obscured by the
passenger.
