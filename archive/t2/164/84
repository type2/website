Hey Karl,

I was waiting for someone to comment on that. I have
not seen his door mechanism. I was just relaying the
info that he told me. I looked around and the only
type that I could find had the square fitting. I am
glad to hear that this his his problem and not that he
was missing a peice of the mechanism. I am sure he
will be glad to. Thanks for the helpful correction!
