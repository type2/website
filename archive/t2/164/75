Actually Andy, it was the Krusty Bus Award, which I'm still not quite sure how to
take given that the rustiest part was covered up, and the freshly painted cab was
out front smiling at everybody that came by :-).

I used a Polk component setup with 4" midranges and 1" tweeters.  I placed the two
midranges up under the dash next to each other under the stock speaker grill in the
metal portion of the dash.  I mounted the tweeters outboard of the air vents, using
the included angled bases to aim them in towards the center of the cab.

To complete the setup, I used a 12" woofer donated by my buddy Roy.  It's powered
by a 200 watt Jensen amp and sits in a round speaker box I made to fit inside the
spare tire under the seat.

I'm very satisfied with the sound, the speaker box is undersized for  the 12"
woofer, but it still puts out enough low end to be heard at highway speeds without
being a "thumper".

The tweeters blend in very well (I drilled holes for the wires).  I have gauges
mounted in the radio location, so I mounted the radio in an ABS plastic under dash
housing (I picked it up at Best Buy for $15).

I can send some pics to anyone who's interested.
