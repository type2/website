Subject: another distributor question for type 2

Hi everyone!  I have a 70 Westy with a rebuilt 1600 dp with about 30k 
miles.  I have a 34 pict 3 and have used a 009 for some time.  I ran 
across 2 old distributors which I had rebuilt years ago- 010 and 019.  I 
am just curious, if I were to put the 010 or 019 in my Westy what would 
happen?  Also, would I static time both the 010 and 019 to 7.5?  Anyone 
have the specs on these two?  Thanks and happing camping to all!
Bruce
