Hmm. Ive been having the same sort of prob with #2E, SP head. now at 9000
miles from new. Im checking again this weekend.

Ive had this as well but didnt know how much but it was closed up.

I think this is backward. You set them open because they close when hot.
Im guessing they close to around .002 because one of the old specs was to
set the valves at .004. I think 006 is to be conservative and safe.
Anyone?

Interesting because I have had a similar problem and thought it was fuel
filter (no) or carb (no) and then perhaps coil (which I swapped) but I
also found the tight valve at the same time. I wonder if the tight valve,
expanded by heat, could be causing the bucking and lack of power above a
certain rpm.
Sheer speculation though.

So Mike are these new SP heads? Or which.
good luck
