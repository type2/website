Mick,

You might want to consider torque'ing your heads if you didn't at the 
300-1000 mile mark.

Generally, I wouldn't expect a tightening #3E to point towards a 
loosening head, but a head that's not torqued to spec can do weird 
things -- trust me.

Again, your assessment of "do a compression check" is probably the best 
first step, but after that you might want to torque the lower four nuts 
on each head (or all eight if you're feeling spry and like you want to 
do an engine pull), do your valves, then check the compression again.  
If you find that any of the lower eight (four on each side) nuts are 
loose and that torque'ing these bottom nuts makes a difference in your 
compression, you can then assess whether you want to pull the engine and 
torque all eight.

hope this helps,
