Subject: pre ignition cj block/gasoline consumption

anybody knows at how many degrees pre ignition a cj 2 liter block runs best 
[officialy mine is 7 degrees pre] , but i was reading some articles that 
with some more pre the igene runs better , the oil stays cooler , and it 
uses les gasoline  now i use 1 liter at 6 km with the dutch gasoline prices 
from more then a dollar  1 liter i wil love it use some less , so all your 
cj owners  howmany degree,s are your ignitions ? and wath is your gasoline 
use?[with double carburateurs 1 one each side cj 2000cc 1977 ]and for the 
real technisians on this list how does pre ignition influence the ingene and 
what are the risk of to much pre [i tryed 15degree and the ingene seemed 
more powerful]and the oil stayed cooler, ] but then i put it back to fabric 
spects 7 degree pre bij 750 rpm ] please let me know soon , cause i am 
preparing for a trip to spain , over the perineemountains, 6000km totaly , 
so i need a secure running ingene wich uses not to much gasoline,
thanks  co /amsterdam /holland t2b westy 1977
