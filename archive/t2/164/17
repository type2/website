Measure the deck height of the remaining good piston.
Remove the defective cylinder and note measurement
of any base shims, these need to be reinstalled.
Weigh the good piston, these need to match within 10
grams ( or less ). It is possible to remove material to
make a match, but not to add it.
Measure the volume displacement ( CC )of the good
head chamber, this will need to match closely when
exchanged. Balancing chamber volume is an art form.
Small variations in volume make big changes in CR.
Place straight-edge across the replaced barrels to
verify correct cylinder height. Piston deck height
should also match. Replace head gaskets if originally
installed, and don't if not.
