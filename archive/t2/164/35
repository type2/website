Subject: NEW Axle-Shafts w/CV's Installed - $114

I now have complete NEW bus rear axle shafts, fully assembled with new boots
and joints, and ready to install.  These are all brand new, U.S. made
components - not remanufactured.

The price of $114 is about the same as the joints and boots would cost by
themselves, and you save the hassle/mess of having to put everything
together. Just unbolt your old half-shaft, bolt this one in, and you're
done.  My part # 211 501 203. One shaft does one side of the bus, so you
need two if you want to do the whole bus.  Fits all  '68-79 with manual
transmission.  Price includes listmember discount, which you must request
when ordering.
