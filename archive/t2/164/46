Anyone have any suggestions as to configuring a shoulder belt for the
rear seats?


I'm thinking about this as I reconstruct my '79 deluxe sunroof. I'm thinking about 3 points for the middle seat, and I'm thinking some kind of bolt thru arrangement at the floor in two places (pipe flange or unistrut), two risers (pipe or strut) and a crosspiece on which to mount the shoulder harness. 

One issue, the risers would rely on the seat staying in place to hold them upright under load from the inertia of the body in the event of a crash. Unless some other longitudinal brace could be arranged.
