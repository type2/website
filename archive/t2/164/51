Subject: Proper child safety seat usage

Hi All.

Funny we should be discussing the child safety seat thing
because I just watched a video on line of the proper mounting 
procedure. Go to http://www.thebostonchannel.com/health/1466843/detail.html
and watch the video. I know I am going to locate my little metal "H" thing
and put it to use as soon as I get home. Please, if you have kids,
check this out. My 70 Westy has lap belts in the back, and they hold the
seat much firmer than the 3 points in my F(-at-)rd van. Now I know why.
