Will,
If they haven't left yet and they want to come hang out with some other
buses for the weekend. Or if anyone else would like to join us. The Full
Moon Bus Club is having a campout (Full Moon In Joon) near Asheville, NC in
Horseshoe,NC http://www.rodkraftstudio.com/fullmoonjoon/ is the website

Some people are arriving Thursday and you don't have to leave until Tues.
Price is $20 per adult for the whole weekend.

Beautiful, private campground, lots of space.
