John,

The quote that springs immediately to mind is from Dirty Harry... "Do you
feel lucky, punk?"  As Bob said, there are those who have replaced very
minimal numbers of parts and gone thousands of miles on them.  Then there
are those who didn't.  An awful lot depends on your financial condition.
If you have the bux ($2000 +core), then Boston Bob (www.bostonengine.com)
is close to you.  I have not bought one of his engines, but he has been
spoke well of on this list.  If you are a starving student, then replace
that head with a good used one (~$50-100)  and scrounge a piston and
cylinder from sopmeone with a broken set (~$50)  YOu *can* replace one
head or even one P&C, if you have to.
