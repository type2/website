They are hard to find in any decent shape at all.  As a point of
information, if you need this to get past safety inspection...  Go to any
truck stop.  The small marker lights that are sold for trucks have the
same fastener spacing as the VW lights.  They are anything but authentic
concours-level replacements, but they will get you an inspection sticker!
