Ok, that's done.... replaced the neg and pos cables from the main battery,
colors are correct and they fit snugly.

The extra positive line from the 2nd battery went to the breaker in the 110
plug outlet, the other from the main battery went to the charger,  a
positive line from the dual battery switch went to a strip next to the
charger, (forget what they're called "bus strip?" black plastic with screws
down both sides.)  the charger and the two dome lights over the rear bed
were the only things hooked up to this strip.  I pulled the charger
completely... not only did it look pretty sketchy once I got the lid off,
but the wires coming from the batteries were cracked, stripped and just
plain nasty looking.

The 110 outlet and breaker were in a totally separate unit which sticks out
from under the back seat, and is still connected to the connection for city
power on the exterior of the bus. If this still works I can use it to run
any 110 appliances I need to when hooked to city power, and since I don't
have a fridge, I didn't have the converter, just the aftermarket type
charger.

I also pulled the battery selector switch.  Hooked the main battery directly
to the 3 wires that were hooked into the switch (one of which was a lead to
the strip next to the charger, don't know what the other two were...
starter, solenoid... ???) So now I have one battery set up... no charger, no
switch... and I still drained my battery in under four hours... dead,
nothin, nada...

next in line is to remove the lead to that "bus strip"  and start checking
other possible problem areas...

still pluggin away... sigh...
