I'm fairly happy with mine.  I have a pair of 3.5" full range speakers in 
an overhead console and a 12" subwoofer box between the seats.  I built 
both from scratch.  There are a couple pictures of the overhead console 
here:  http://users2.ev1.net/~schwarze/vw/bluto/console/
I know it doesn't look very nice (yet) but I sure enjoy having it.  I 
really need some midrange to make the stereo sound good, but it's 
acceptable just as it is.  Plenty of oomph to drown out motor noise.  A 
quieter cab would be part of a better solution but for now it meets my needs.

Of course you can.  Your bus has a relatively modern alternator that is 
more than capable of a few extra sustained amperes for an amplifier.

I take it you are not charging the second battery while you drive.  Still, 
your second battery sounds like it might be a bit weak.

>Higher output alternator? (do they make those for busses)

You can have your 55 amp alternator rewound to produce around 70 amps, but 
its reliability is unproven (at least on this list).

>no amp?

If your head unit has enough power, maybe you don't need it?

>much lower output amp?

You didn't say how big your current amp is.

>deal with it, its a bus?

How much work do you want to do?  Anything is possible, including a quiet 
bus and a decent stereo with a stock alternator.
