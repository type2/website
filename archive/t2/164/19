And I still have them.  The rear side marker housing/bulb holder is $19.95
(part # 211 945 351A).  The lenses are available in either red (rear lense)
or orange (front), each with your choice of silver or black trim, for $9.95
each.  (Part numbers 211 945 363 for red or 211 945 119 for orange - add
either an "A" to the end of the number for silver trim, or a "B" for black
trim.)   Prices will be 5% cheaper if your order exceeds $50, as the
listmember discount kicks in.
