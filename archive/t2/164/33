In US units you are only getting 14.5 mpg which is very low.  You should be 
able to easily get 8-9km out of 1 liter.  How fast are you driving?  Your 
mileage will improve drastically if you stay between 90-100kph.  Also make 
sure your choke plates are fully open when the engine is warm - if not it 
will waste a lot of gas.

That's an easy one.  Too much ignition advance could cause the engine to 
knock (detonate) which would destroy your pistons and cylinder heads in a 
matter of minutes.  If you feel you must advance the timing, do it only a 
few degrees at a time and listen closely for detonation.  On hills or 
anywhere you need to use more than 1/2 throttle I would set it back to the 
stock settings to be safe.

Have a good trip,
