Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L AFM whistle

Right after I bought my 79 I had this same problem. It took me a while
to get around to finding/fixing the problem. I would suspect a vacuum
leak which would also explain the rough idle. After I found the leaks
& fixed them the strange whistle went away and it idled great. Here is
how I check for leaks. With the engine running spray small amounts of
starter fluid around at parts that look like they might not seal
correctly. When you happen across a leak the ether in the fluid will
richen up the mixture & cause the engine to temporarily increase
speed. Fix. Repeat. Good Luck.
