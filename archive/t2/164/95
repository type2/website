Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Light

it appears from looking at the schematic that the instrument panel is hot 
all the time when the key is turned on and when the oil switch comes on and 
grounds, it lights the light.  Likewise, when the generator is not charging 
enough, it the regulator grounds and that light comes on.  SO, it follows 
that the instrument panel must be staying hot all the time when the key is 
off, which would tell me that the electrical portion of the ignition switch 
has failed in someway.  Or is my logic all wrong?  Greg
