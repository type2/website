Howdy!

I just put the 2.0 liter back in my 82 Westy after rebuilding the heads, =
installing new rings, and a clutch.  When I go to turn the motor over, =
it drags like the battery is bad but it is a brand new one that tests =
fine.  I hope this is a function of the motor being tight after new =
rings....?

The motor fires right up and runs if I pour gas in manually but it seems =
that the injections system isn't supplying fuel.  I do, however, have =
fuel at the cold start valve.

My last problem is that the clutch doesn't have any resistance when I =
depress it. =20

I know these problems and symptoms aren't very specific but I've been up =
and till 2 am the past three nights getting everything back together and =
didn't have the energy to get super in depth last night when I tried to =
fire it up.

I'm looking for suggestions as to where I should start looking this =
evening.

Thanks in advance,
Erich Elmer

82 West
