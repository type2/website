Hi, I time my stock CJ engine to 7.5 degrees BTDC at idle with vacuum
advance disconnected, as per spec.  I don't have any problems with that and
average 20 English mpg overall or about 25-26 on a long run, cruising at
about 60 mph.  (95 octane.)  I think that equates to about 16/20 mpg US.
For litres/km you do the math, it's late :)
