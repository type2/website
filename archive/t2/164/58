Subject: Re: [T2] bus stereos / how much power??

	I too wanted to avoid the dreaded door mangle, so I mounted my 
tweets(Boston Pro) on the top of the dashboard.  I mounted the surface mount 
brackets(included with the tweeter hardware) to the outermost(from center) 
defroster vent screw locale on both sides.  The tweeter is a bit 'off-axis', 
but the response doesn't suffer much at all.  You can barely see them, since 
they blend right into the black dash-top.  I ran the wires past the felt 
edge of the dash, and down below to their respective crossovers.  The 
midbass speakers are in the factory door location.  I have since, purchased 
shallow 8" woofers that will be mounted in the factory speaker location, and 
the mids will be moved higher in the doors.

	Eron


  Try to make sure you have 'line of sight' to both tweeters when you
