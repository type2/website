Subject: AIRS visitors


Robin and Peter from Chico found my name on the AIRS list and dropped by to
camp last night, in a very clean '71 westfakia.  They told me their engine
nightmares that I thought I would share with the list.  First of all, a
beetlemex engine that broke a camshaft after only 10k miles (in Roswell,
maybe it was the aliens).  They are very disappointed that the beetlemex
crapped out just after the warranty period.  The guy who fixed it for them
just put in a new cam, somehow they had metal shavings that ate up the rest
somewhere in Texas.  A German mechanic rebuilt everything properly but they
apparently were running super hot (~260 oil temp) on the breakin.  Properly
timed 009 dist. because his vac advance is worn-out, I offered him one out
of a few that I have but the numbers don't match (we will look on the dizzy
site).  Only other thing I can think of is lean running, from vac leak or
mixture.

Anyhow they are looking for a stock bus muffler in Atlanta today, and will
leave tomorrow to go to Chattanooga, the Smokies, Asheville, and on to
Quebec and return to CA eventually.  Nice volks.
