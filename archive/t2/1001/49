Subject: Fuel injection issue, no ground to the injectors any

Just got a 1978 bus, with a crank sunroof, those are neat.

The engine does not start on its own, but does kick over with starter fluid,
or when directly powering the injectors.

After troubleshooting the fuel injection system, the following is known

-good fuel pressure 35psi. the pump kicks on with the AFM arm, and while
cranking.
-the cold start wire on the starter gets to the double relay, and out
-point signal wire to ecm plug is good.
-grounds going to the ecm plug are good.
-temp sensor by #3 is about right, when read from the ecu plug.
-injectors are getting power with key on


The injectors don't get a ground during cranking, and I am confused as to what
else might cause the ECU to not ground the injectors, causing them to fire.
Anyone have the internal schematic on these ECU's

Is the ecu is shot? it is a california MT one, 022906021AE, got one at a fair
price?

Thanks in advance.
