Don't break the cables!!!! And make sure to keep the drain tubes
clear. They fill up with debris and clog letting water leak into the
bus.

Another thing to check is the connections at the AFM and ECU plugs for
straight clean pins/contacts, as well as the grounds under the black
slug (plenum). If you come down from the hatch and reach around the
left/rear of the plenum you can feel 'em. There should be at least 2
plugs and 3 wires.
