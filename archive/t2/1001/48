"If the Up! is approved, Hallmark said he has told Volkswagen in Germany
the American subsidiary is "highly interested" in the car."

They had _better_ be interested.  VW is moribund in the US and they need
something to bring people into the showrooms.

I'd like to see a utility version, but I have a feeling that a bus-sized
vehicle would demand a larger engine.
