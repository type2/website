Subject: LRD tire pressures

I'm trying to do a survey of tire pressures people prefer for 185R14C  
load range D tires.

These tires typically have a load rating of 1875 lbs at 65psi and  
Bentley has no recommended tire pressure for LRD and I was wondering  
what people are setting their tire pressures to.

If you have some data to share (brand, pressures, mileage) I'd  
appreciate it.
