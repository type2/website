do you have the Fuel Injection trouble shooting manual.  to test the
fuel injector use a test light. and put it accross the two terminals
in the plug that goes to the injectors. when cranking the light
should flicker weakly. but it should flicker off and on.

ECU's are usually the last thing that goes, in almost 20 years with
fuel injected VW's I have yet to have one go bad.

if after going thru the ENTIRE Fuel Injected trouble shooting manual
and still find it is the ECU, I probably have one in the garage.  but
go to R, Atwells page and get the info on trouble shooting the
injectors first.

lot cheaper and faster to find the real problem,
