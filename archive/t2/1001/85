Subject: Re: [T2] What is this?

Sorry, I am slow.  The back side is connected to the manifold vacuum and always has vacuum.  The other side has equal vacuum, until the brakes are applied, then the valves in the booster de-equilize, allows air in the front side, and the pressure difference helps to drive the master cylinder shaft.
