In one of the newly written books on tranporters the author says that 
the 16oo upright (bug) engine was
an option after vw went with the type 4 in 1972. I never saw or knew 
this till recently at a shop here in fl there
was a post 72 bus with a "bug" engine in it.  It looked factory with 
the sheet metal and seals. That seems to be my
thought on the engine claim.
probably he just does not know his type 2 or may be much else
when is a splitie not a splittie?
