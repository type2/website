Jon,

I had similar problem, except during the winter the Fram filter actually rip to shreds.? 

I eventually stopped using Fram altogether and with a filter that was rated for Diesel engines which apparently have a greater oil pressure. After I did that everything seemed OK. 

Hope that helped,

Brian
