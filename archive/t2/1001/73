Oddly enough, the '68-'69 three sensor-system does work.

The light going on when the pedal is depressed means that one of the
circuits in master cylinder is bad. 

Soft brakes usually means the rear brakes aren't adjusted or one of the
wheel cylinders is leaking. BUT, coupled with a working warning system, it
points to the master cylinder.

If you want to double check the master cylinder is not bad, you can also try
new switches if one of them is not functioning correctly. Also pulling the
switches and cleaning them out is a good idea since they can gunk up with
rust and resin.

 This has a master
cylinder with (3) 2 terminal brake switches.? Looks like the master
cylinder may be ported in such a way as to detect pressure differences
between the front and rear portion of the master cylinder, thus turning
on the warning light by the third switch mounted in the center????
Could poorly adjusted brakes cause this?



Thanks

Hi, have you changed all the rubber brake lines?  Most of my rubber 
lines were bad (they looked great from the outside).  It cured my '69 
bus brake problems.  Not sure if that's your problem, but maybe??

Happy busing,?
