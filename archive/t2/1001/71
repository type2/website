 This has a master
cylinder with (3) 2 terminal brake switches.? Looks like the master
cylinder may be ported in such a way as to detect pressure differences
between the front and rear portion of the master cylinder, thus turning
on the warning light by the third switch mounted in the center????
Could poorly adjusted brakes cause this?



Thanks



Ray

Hi, have you changed all the rubber brake lines?  Most of my rubber 
lines were bad (they looked great from the outside).  It cured my '69 
bus brake problems.  Not sure if that's your problem, but maybe??

Happy busing,?
