This is where it goes:

First, disconnect the front and rear rod at the coupler by the master  
cylinder:

Then lube it up, fit it in the hole and slide the front shift rod  
through:

The kits includes a plastic part #19 for 68-73 models seen in this  
diagram:

The reproduction plastic bushings do not fit as well as the  
originals. I found the metal ring they give you for the front bushing  
is the wrong size.

Front style (w/ metal ring):

Rear style:

This is what it looks like assembled:

A 3rd middle bushing was added to 77 models at VIN 217 2 053 839.  
There is a tech bulletin that shows how and where to modify the  
earlier rods to improve shifting/support if you want to do this (not  
a big deal).

I don't know of an easy way to get the rear bushing on without having  
the engine out to pull the rear shift rod out.
