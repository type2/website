Tony,

My advice is probably the things your welder knows what to do.

1. Photograph the disassembly
2. Measure the cut outs and under-cut your waste material to be safe
3. Always allow the width of the blade of the cutting device in your
measurements
4. Try to drill out spot welds and tap them free with a hand-chisel (keep
the air chisel use down to a minimum. Sheet metal tears easily with a
pneumatic unit)
5. Clean the welding surface until it is shiny
6. Clean the grounding surface for the welder until it is shiny
7. Use a 1/8" or thicker piece of copper sheet cut into a 2"x2" square and
place it behind the weld area to absorb heat when welding sheet-metal (when
possible)
8. Treat newly welded areas with a good quick-drying (flat) anti-rust
coating and let cure before welding in another layer
9. Don't weld outside when it is below 70F or in a cool environment. Sheet
metal warps faster than the Enterprise in those conditions and nothing will
seem to fit right.
10. Use Clamps! Lots of them whenever possible. Leave them on until the weld
cools.
11. Take your time and be precise
12. Have fun. If you get frustrated walk away and chill for a while.
13. Don't look at the arc. :) Seriously many people forget to wear a shield
when someone else is welding or they are assisting. Oh, and have a bucket of
water and a fire extinguisher handy just in case.

Later!

Jon Stiles
