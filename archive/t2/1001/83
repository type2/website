Subject: What is this?

Sorry for the repost of this link gang, but until I get my brake situation
taken care of, I am a little sketch on driving Zoey around town. This is
where the breathing sound was coming from, Bentley doesn't show a picture of
it, and I guess rightfully so since it is enclosed within the frame. I just
happened to have access to it since I am doing some body repair and have the
dog-leg all cut up.

I think DurocShark is correct as well in that it is time for me to flush and
rejuice my brake lines.
