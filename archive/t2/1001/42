Subject: Re: [T2] LRD tire pressures

Richard

I run Sava 185R14 on  the front (due to unavailability of Hankook at
the time I needed to replace tyres) which I run at 32 psi normally &
34 loaded on a trip.

On the rear I have Hankook 195R14 RA08.  These I run at 42 psi normally
& 44 on a trip loaded.

The Sava have done about111000 kms and the Hankooks about 6000 kms.

Both brands have performed well though the Sava tend to move around in
the wet more than I would like.  The Hankook have never given me any
cause for concern even when entering a corner judged incorrectly.  The
van does'nt move around in normal conditions as much as it used to.

Hope this helps a little
