Subject: Buses By The Depot, Sat. Oct. 20 - DETAILS HERE

The second annual Buses By The Depot is a go, for Saturday October 20, in
Green Lane, PA.

You can come for the day, stay overnight, or stay all weekend.  It's free to
come for the day, and cheap to spend the night. If you're camping, I would
strongly urge you to reserve ASAP so I can make sure we're all together.
And I would appreciate an RSVP even if you plan on just making it a day
trip.

I have put up a web page with the info:

As with last year, there will be a caravan to the Bus Depot on Saturday.  We
have set up a room full of distressed merchandise (customer returns,
discontinued, one-of-a-kind, damaged, etc.) that will basically be sold to
BBD attendees for any reasonable offer.  In addition to touring the Depot
(if interested), you can also get a firsthand look at products you may be
curious about (or pick up any previously placed orders and save on
shipping).  There will also be a potluck dinner Saturday evening.

Email me if you need any more info, or to reserve a site or RSVP.  Hope to
see lots of familiar and new faces this year!
