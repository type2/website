Subject: Blowing Oil Filter Seals

I have a very non-stock motor question:



1914cc Type 1 Motor

Redline/Weber EFI

BMG serpentine pulley system

Hydraulic Lifters and Cam

Full Flow

3 Qt sump

Gene Berg Remote Oil filter pump cover for Type 1 motors (clearanced for
buses)

Generic CB Performance/EMPI Remote oil filter mount

250psi > oil line

Running a Fram HP1 Filter

Oil: Castrol 20-50W

PSI Cold at idle: 50-60 psi

PSI Hot at idle: 10-15 psi

Max Oil Temperature 190F



I have been having problems with Fram HP1 oil filters leaking badly. The
lines, and the filter mount have no leaks and the filter mounts sealing
surface is free of cracks and imperfections. I recently replaced the filter
mount just in case. The IN/OUT lines are plumbed correctly to the oil pump
cover and the case return.



The filters last only as long as the engine is cool and once it reaches OT
they begin to leak.



I installed a Thermostat bypass and it solved the problem by absorbing some
of the pressure, the down side is it made my oil pressure drop below 7psi
when the engine was hot so I removed it. Id like to fix this once and for
all.



Is there a filter that has a better sealing surface? Is there a better
filter mount designed for high pressures?



Thanks,



Jon Stiles
