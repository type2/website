I'm still here, but have shut the web site and phone down temporarily.  I 
have been in the hospital all summer, and am just now getting back on my 
feet and can do limited work.  Web site should be back up in a few weeks.  
Feel free to email at vwcarlocks(-at-)hotmail.com or use my home phone at 
936.291.6450.
