Subject: Replacement shifter bushings

I got one of those bushing replacement kits for my 75 Rivi from a place in
Hawaii while I was on vacation.

When I got it, the guy who sold it to me said the same thing that is listed
on the Bus Depot site about it in that not all parts in the kit will go to
my bus.

The question is, which ones do I need and which ones not?

Now I know that I need the big rubber donut, but I am honestly not sure how
that is even supposed to be installed.

I know that the two bushings that look like shuttlecocks are for the shift
rod, but there are also like 3 or 4 more pieces that I am not sure of.

If there is a good illustration that someone could turn me on to for this,
that would be wonderful as the Bentley diagram sucks.
