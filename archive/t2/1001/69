Subject: Brake Switches/Warning Switch

I think I am at the last hurdle to get the 68 camper back on the road.? When I press the brake pedal, the in dash warning light lights up.? I did have this unwired, but it lights when I push on the button so I feel certain it is wired up correctly.? The brake switches are all wired according to both a sketch I had drawn, as well as the Bentley schematic.? I am assuming that either a switch is bad or I have air in one of the lines?? The brake pedal is somewhat low but not mushy, so it doesn't feel like air.? Any ideas?? Thanks!!
