Subject: RE: [T2] What is this?

It is the outlet port for the vacuum booster. It exits into the dogleg to
keep dirt and grime out of the vacuum booster. The noise you are hearing is
probably due to the fact that you have the inside of the dogleg exposed (if
I am reading this right). It is totally normal.

My Jeep make a loud noise until the engine is warmed up. It Just varies from
manufacturer.

I have a '75 Riviera and this is coming from a line that follows inside the
wheel-well and down toward the brake booster. It only makes noise or
"breathes" when the brake pedal is pressed.
