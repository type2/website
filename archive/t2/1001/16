Subject: Re: [T2] ignition switch, ELECTRIC part

Bob,

My story started like yours, but turned into a worst case scenario.

Planning to replace mine I had on hand:

*bay-purchased used "bus" ignition housing w/ elec and mech switch and key

Busdepot new elec portion

Removed my elec part, installed Busdepot new one, no go.

Removed Busdepot part, installed used elec part from "bus" housing, no go.

Removed my housing and worked all combinations elec switches with my
mechanical and key, checking for results with my VOM, no go.

Mech switch had some wobble in the part that engages the elec switch,
so I decided to replace entirely with "bus" housing.  Pull out of box
and compare and... find out it's for a bug.

I took the gamble that the bus/bug mech/elec portions were the same
and taught myself how to pull the tamper'd mech portion from the bug
housing over the course of two hours.  Broke down my unit and did the
same with minimal help from Bentley.

I combined the "bus"(bug) mech switch and key with the Busdepot new
elec part and installed.  Put it back in and it cranked over
noticeably faster than I was accustomed to.  The bus and bug
mechanical parts had different part numbers, but appeared identical.

Since you didn't ask,
