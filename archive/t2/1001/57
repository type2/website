Subject: Re: [T2] Paint code needed for Yosemite Yellow

Thanks Ric and Steve.

I hadn't realized that Bali Yellow and Yosemite Yellow were the same  
colour. The presentation on my LCD monitor of the scan of the printed  
swatch was nowhere close to the actual colour. Go figure.

BTW Steve, was the PPG a good match for the original colour?

Happy Trails,
