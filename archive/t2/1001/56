Isn't that the equalizer hose on the non-vacuum side of the booster?
IIRC you *should* hear noise from that when the pedal is pressed and
released.

I'd be worried if it made noise all the time though.

(You didn't cut that open just to look at the hose, did you? You were
already in there fixing rust, right?)
