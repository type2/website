It was the other way around in Europe: bug engine by default and the  
Type 4 was an extra cost. In USA/Canada there were no engine options  
and the Type 4 was the defacto engine.

Either that bus came from Europe or the parts have been collected and  
the engine conversion has been well done. Check the export code on  
the m-plate if you seen that bus again.
