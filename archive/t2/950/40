Before you get to caught up in this, try dumping a
couple bottles of HEAT in the gas at next fillup or if
below half now, add one bottle. It does act like a bad
plu wire or a coil about to puke, but it also acts
like it could be getting a shot of water from time to
time. This is unusual for a FI engine with continuous
fuel flow as the return keeps fuel agitated in the
tank, so the most likely place it would become evident
IS on a hard pull. Though uncommon to notice the
symptoms, it is very common for late Bays to have the
problem of water in the gas due to the rubber elbow at
the filler breaking and allowing rainwater to flow in.
I am not familiar with the Vanagons. It is possible to
get water from gas stations though, albeit less of an
issue than years back.

All the HEAT (fuel line antifreeze) does is break the
water up more and hold it in suspension better. It's
alcohol. If you have a lot of water, it may take
awhile. -BaH
