Bravo!  You had me scared there for a minute!

I don't understand it when people say they want to preserve the resale 
value of their bus.  I could care less about resale value because I will 
not be selling my bus... ever.  Do some people really think of a bus as 
temporary transportation?

I only care about keeping my bus roadworthy so that it can be used for 
its intended purpose - putting smiles on people's faces (mostly my own).
