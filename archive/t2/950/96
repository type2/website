That sure would suck if it was a cam timing problem as the only way to
fix that is to break down the engine.  Let's hope it's not that... we
can kinda rule that out because he's getting good compression so at
least it's in good enough time to close the valves at the correct time.

Chandler,
you can verify fuel flow by pulling off the air filter, turn on the key
and stick and screwdriver into the intake to push the flapper vane.  The
fuel pump should start running.

Here's a test for you.  You can check that you're spark plugs are firing
by spraying a quick puff of starter fluid into the intake and then crank
over the car.  If you're getting spark, the car should kick over and run
for about a couple rotations.  This would be a nice confirmation that
you're ignition is working.  You might also want to try a spark plug
tester to see if the spark plugs are working, and/or take a plug out,
plug it into its wire, and hold it against a piece of metal and see if
it sparks..
