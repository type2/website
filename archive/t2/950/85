Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Question, not typical, I hope

On my '77, this valve is controlled by a cable that is controlled by
one of the red dash levers (can't remember which one right now).  You
have to remove the left kick panel (if you still have it) to access
this valve.  On my '77, the same lever also controls a cable that goes
to a valve underneath the middle of the bus that directs air to the
vent in the middle of the floor and the vent that's part of the
walk-through floor.  This ensures that passengers in the front, middle
and back of the bus all get a portion of the meager heat...

Neither of these cables seems to be available anymore.  You can cut
one of the available heater cables short and bend the end to suit,
which is what I've done since both of these cables were broken on my
bus.
