Even with having to jump thru the rear end looking for required smog & FI
stuff, 76-79 Type 2s are definitely holding their own in prices, at least in
Southern California.  I don't expect a decline, especially for Westy models
to fall anytime soon - they're in a fairly large demand locally.  Here in
Ventura, CA, they're getting decent to top dollar.
