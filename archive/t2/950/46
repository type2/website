Subject: Re: [T2] Timing off by 180??

The distributor is driven via a gear drive.  One end of the gear drive 
meshes with a big gear inside the engine and the other end of the gear drive 
meshes with the bottom on the distributor.  If this gear drive is placed in 
the engine incorrectly it's quite possible that the distributor timing could 
be off.  I've forgotten how many teeth are on the gear at the bottom of the 
gear drive (the one that meshes with another gear inside the engine) but 
it's quite possible whoever put the engine together got the gear off by 1 
tooth, 2 teeth, 3 teeth, etc.  It's not uncommon that the gear is inserted 
180 degrees off from its proper position, resulting in distributor timing 
that's also off by 180 degrees.

When the #1 cylinder is at Top Dead Center of its compression stroke the 
rotor inside the distributor should be pointing pretty much right at a small 
mark in the distributor's top rim.  If it's not, then the distributor timing 
is off.  Small misses is gear placement can sometimes be compensated for by 
rotating the distributor which gets the timing back to where it should be. 
If it's off by something like 180 degrees you can move the plug wires to get 
the timing correct.
