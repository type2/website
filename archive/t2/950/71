Subject: RE: [T2] 78 rear seat in a 70

Andy,

Sounds like it would work if I had a Westy model, but I have a '70 passenger
deluxe. The seat is a non-Westy fold down seat from a '78(ish), where the
seat folds down into a flat loading area for large items. I need to pop the
side panels off and see if there is an existing plug for the latch-pin, but
I may need to fabricate something. I currently have the seat temporarily in
place on the shoulder harness seatbelt holes, but they are way too high.

What is really weird is my '78 Westy doesn't have the threaded holes for the
latch-pins that later passenger models have. So it was no help in getting
the location of the latch-pin bolts. I wonder if Westfalia originally
started with an industrial chassis and modified it? I always thought they
took a passenger van and converted it to a camper.

Thanks anyway!

Jon Stiles

if you have the side cabinets from the 78 you are all set.
otherwise you will need to create a filler cabinet for the left side.
if i remember correctly 70s still have the tall suicide cabinet on the
right and the zbed mounts to the left wall, opposite a 78 setup.
