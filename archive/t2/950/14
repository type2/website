Hi Nathan,

Classic symptoms of coil failure. Happened to me on the way to the  
Outer Banks of NC on vacation in April last year. 10 minutes in an  
AutoZone parking lot and $25 later I was on the road trouble free.  
Jeff Stewart had the same issues on the way to EB2001; I learned the  
symptoms from his misfortune.

That was until the Auto Zone coil blew out completely in MD coming  
home from  John Brown's Buses in October. One minute it was fine, the  
next I was coasting to the side of the road. Luckily Dad was carrying  
a spare engine for me at the time; we pulled the coil off that one  
and were back under way within 5 minutes.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
