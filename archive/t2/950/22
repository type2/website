Courtney,

I have seen a huge jump in power and mileage in all my vehicles when the
cruddy spark plugs and dirty air cleaner were changed. I remember I did this
once in a '90 Suburban and my mileage doubled! The gap was so wide on the
plugs I'm sure there were only sporadic times when they fired correctly. The
air cleaner was f-to-the-ilty as well.
