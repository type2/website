Subject: Re: [T2] tuneups and gas mileage. - 77 Westy

Hi Courtney,

How heavy is your right foot? Driving 70-75 (120-130KPH) MPH uses a  
LOT more gas than 55-60MPH. (90-100KPH).Going to EveryBus each year   
I have seen 16MPG (US gallon) on the interstate heading to EveryBus  
one day and then 25MPG the next on the state highways.  That's a  
repeatable statistic, seen on more than one engine in my bus.

Happy Trails,

to see it worked out to 16mpg on a Canadian gallon, (about 12mpg on a US
gallon). I know it needs a tuneup, but all that can really change is the
plugs, since I have a Crane optical 700XL ignition system. The brakes  
are not
dragging, air pressure in tires is good, alignment is spot on. Timing  
is right
on the money. Engine is excellent shape. Can plugs themselves really  
cause
such a drop in mileage, (they DO have far too much mileage on them) ?  
I think
I usually get about 20mpg around town. Comments please?
