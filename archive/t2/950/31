Pete,

Nice work promoting this event. I think you are going to have a great turn
out.

Hello Volks:

Been getting some questions about the food for this Saturday.  The Crock Pot
Chili is just a suggestion.  I'm sure we will have more than enough.  (Have
you ever been to any bus event anywhere where there wasn't a crazy amount of
good food?)  You can bring whatever your specialty is but something warm
(and warming) would be great.  Had someone suggest a post roast. I have also
had some suggest warm desserts and spiced wine.  (be careful with the
alcohol in cold weather) The Sunday Brunch is at the Potawattomie Inn and
costs $12.50 per person.  We don't have any plans for breakfast burritos,
it's easier to roll out of the warm bunk and pack up than to try to make
breakfast.  


Just checked Accu-Weather:  High of 18, low of 7 for Saturday.  Might want
to bring a hat and gloves.  

Looking forward to seeing all those "Cool" buses huddled together again to
kick off the '07 VW Camping Season!
