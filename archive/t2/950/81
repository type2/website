Hi All -

I'm finally replacing the 28 year old Sun tach that's in my dash - to the right 
of the speedo, where otherwise might have been a clock (?).

The two candidates, from CIP, are:
  VDO-333-051 - VDO 3 1/8 7000 RPM

  VDO-333-055 - VDO 3 3/8 7000 RPM
http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VDO%2D333%2D055

So ... the question of the hour is - which size is correct?

Thanks, Nick.
