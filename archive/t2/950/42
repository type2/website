Hi BaH,

Good point. I had forgotten that Dad had that problem on one of his  
Vanagons this summer. The culprit wasn't the filler neck though, it  
was the expansion tanks in the front wheel wells.


Happy Trails,

couple bottles of HEAT in the gas at next fillup or if
below half now, add one bottle. It does act like a bad
plu wire or a coil about to puke, but it also acts
like it could be getting a shot of water from time to
time. This is unusual for a FI engine with continuous
fuel flow as the return keeps fuel agitated in the
tank, so the most likely place it would become evident
IS on a hard pull. Though uncommon to notice the
symptoms, it is very common for late Bays to have the
problem of water in the gas due to the rubber elbow at
the filler breaking and allowing rainwater to flow in.
I am not familiar with the Vanagons. It is possible to
get water from gas stations though, albeit less of an
issue than years back.
