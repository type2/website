Subject: Heater Question, not typical, I hope

I have been working to improve my heat little by little, I now have great defrost raging out of the dash vents, it feels so good on my finger tips.

I am ready to move on to the next level, I want heat on my feet.

The little clip that holds the cables in place (''77 Westy by the way) on the back of the heater controls is gone, it kept popping off because the PO had zip tied the heater valves wide open and every time somebody decides to teach me how to turn on my heater it forces the cable down and popped the clip off, and after so many times it has become lost, I plan to travel to Traftons here in Portland and ask for one very soon.

I do not understand the mechanics behind the system, obviously the heat is turned totally on defrost, possibly by zip tie by the PO, because I can't find heat, or even a breeze, coming from anywhere except the windshield vents.

If I had heat on my feet would it be coming from the 4 stamped louvers on the front wall?

Can somebody please give me a couple things to look at to get me started on this, or maybe explain how it works so I can start unraveling its mystery in my head?

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon

I am going to spend some time playing with my Z bed during lunch today, hopefully, if I am free, to try getting to the bottom of that issue.
