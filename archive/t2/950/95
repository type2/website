You say you have spark at the right time, but do you actually have spark?  Have you seen a spark at the end of a spark plug with your own eyes or are you assuming it is there when the plugs are installed?

At this point I would be so frustrated that I might hold the end of the plug in my mouth while somebody turned my engine over, but I don't recommend that, instead, hook up the plug to the plug wire and place the plug so the very end is touching something that is grounded but so you can still see the spark, making sure you are safely away from anything that could hurt you, like the fan, have somebody turn the engine over for about 20 seconds and watch for the spark.

I am sure that people can say that you can check many other things and deduce that you have an actual spark, but that won't be as good as knowing because you have seen it.
