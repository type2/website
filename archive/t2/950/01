jeremiah,

the 1.8 heads will work, but you should calculate the compression  
ratio by measuring the volume of the chamber. the chambers are  
different sizes and this will affect the comression ratio of your  
engine.

i actually prefer the 1.8l heads over the 2.0 on any engine. the  
ports (valves actually) are slightly larger on a 1.8 head than a 2.0.
