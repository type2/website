Don,

Maybe on the road your seeing 20 mpg--
I have a hard time swallowing 20 mpg in and around town, stop and go ,
for short blasts, and still seeing 20.

Generally speaking, and for the most part, even if you have a feather
foot, the mpg will drop off drastically when it's cold out, around town,
as the vehicle will never reach optimum operating temps for very long
and stay on the cold start enrichment.

Every vehicle I have suffer's from this winter poor fuel economy
phenomena, and they are all in perfect states of tune.

The gas the oil companies sell in the winter months sure isn't condusive
to maxed out mpg either.

The winter blend's are terrible .
