Do you have a timing scale?

It sounds like you do but I just thought I'd ask.

If you don't have a timing light, you should consider getting one to  
do your own maintenance.

Sears has a good one for $49. Search on 00921027000.

7.5 BTDC is right.

If the timing is too retarded the engine will never start.

Too advanced and the engine will 'ping' and you'll watch the fan kick  
backward just before it stops. Same ping can happen if the firing  
order is not right.

Did you check for spark? How?

Further things to confirm:

1) Power to the coil.

Turn on the key and check there is 12V at terminal 15. Terminal 1  
connects to ground (and there is also a white wire required for fuel  
injection).

2) Spark plug wires are in the right order.

1-4-3-2 is the order starting from the notch going clockwise.

3) Distributor is the right way around:

If this is backwards then you need to swap the spark plug wires  
around to compensate.

4) Fan notch is in the right position:
