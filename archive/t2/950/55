Subject: Reminder: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout is coming up

Hi Volks,

OK, we're now less than a week to go until the True Canadian Winter  
Bus Campout, held in Valens ON, just north of Hamilton; about a half- 
hour west of Toronto. If you missed out on Bus Brrrr, there's still  
plenty of opportunity to enjoy a bus campout in the winter.

The weather forecast looks PERFECT for a winter camp:

CAON0241.htm#longTerm


Why bother?  Glad you asked. TCWBC offers:

- Serviced campsites with 30A of electricity.
- Flush toilets and hot showers are located in a heated comfort  
station a short walk from your campsite.
- Ice fishing, XC Skiing, Skating & Toboganning.
- 2 Turkeys lined up at the deep fryer for dinner. Turkey-on-a-bun  
tastes great at the campfire.
- An after-dinner campfire treat -- deep-fried mars bars. "Smores"  
have got nothing on these!
- Breakfast Burritos to share on Sunday morning.
- No mosquitoes, black flies, deer flies, horseflies, bees, hornets,  
or ants to sting or pester you.
- No Cicadas, crickets, or bullfrogs to keep you awake at night.
- A post-campout excursion to check out the local waterfalls of the  
Niagara Escarpent area.

What to bring:

- Ice skates. The ice is over 9" thick on the lake. Skate free in the  
open air with no boards.
- Cross Country Skis. There are over 6 miles of groomed trails in the  
park.
- Fishing gear (And a fishing license). Ice fishing season is ON!
- $30/night for camping fees. The park staff let us double-up on  
campsites; the second vehicle pays only the $7 gate fee. You pay at  
the gate - I'm not involved with park fees.
- A couple bucks to chip in for the food.
- A contribution to add to the Breakfast Burritos on Sunday. If you  
don't know what to bring, email me for a recommendation.
- Snacks and beverages. Adults camping in winter consume 5,000  
calories per day. You gotta keep that fire stoked.
- Firewood. Your belly isn't the only thing that needs stoking. You  
can't build a campfire too big in winter. (But sometimes we come close)
- A camera. The trip to Webster's Falls will be worth taking pictures  
of.
