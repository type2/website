In addition to possible coil failure, be sure to check EVERY ground wire
connection and all other electrical connections (especially the coil
connections) in the engine compartment.  Having owned an 80 7 pass model a
dozen + years ago, I know from first hand experience mine was a combination
of both.

A similar situation on my 84 Wasser when I first got it running in
1997 turned up the same gremlins and and culprits.
