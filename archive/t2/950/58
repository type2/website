Subject: Re: [T2] Narrowest Wheel to fit late bus???

I don't know if this will help, but
<http://www.alliedracingwheels.com/patternref.html>
lists these as the same bolt pattern. It doesn't give the width of the
wheel, diameter, or the offset, though.

5 on 112mm (4.409")
Audi - 5000 Turbo, Quattro '86-'87
Mazda - RX7 GSL '86-'87
Mercedes - all '77-'89
VW - Transporter, Vanagon '71-'89

Hope this helps,
