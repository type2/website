Grab the shaft and give it a healthy shove forward.  It was designed to
break loose in a collision.  It will also break loose when pulled
backwards, but I think it takes more pressure in that direction.

If it's anything like mine, the mirror housing may not survive the sudden
shock when the spring releases it.  Be sure you want to do this before you
start!
