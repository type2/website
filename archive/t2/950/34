Im with Don as well.  Although, I'm running traditional points/condensor and
have 'no' thermostat.  I've tracked the last tank of in town driving right
around 19.  I try to manage my lead foot as much as possible, even off the
lights.  I would gather that I might do a bit better if I could actually
close my flaps a little to allow the engine to warm up a little quicker.  Im
roughly ten miles from Don, so carry over his outside temps.

Peace,
Troy
