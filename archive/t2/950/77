Subject: Re: [T2] Z-bed in center?

My original Z-bed was a split version - full width bed
but seat was split in two. There were 2 Z-mechanisms
under each seat section. I pulled it all apart and
replicated the Z mechanism using a single seat.

I don't remember if this was before or after building
the cabinets, so I don't know if it was 3/4 or full
width. It worked fine though.

It worked fine but was heavy and took up way too much
space under the seat that I needed for storage. I
switched to Westy style, like the set that BusDepot
has available, but I salvaged mine from wrecking yard
stock. It evolved through a few steps over years.

Currently I use the Westy style brackets on the seat
cushions (back and bottom) but added my own
connections directly to my cabinet structure which is
3/4" plywood. It works fine for me but if I was in the
habit of hauling people in the back seat I would need
to complete the installation with some sort of latch
to secure the seat-back. I haven't gotten around to it
cuz it's kinda nice to be able to recline at virtually
any angle and it does take some effort to do so - so
since I travel alone, I don't worry about it.

The most recent set of bed / seat cushions is approx
3/4 width to accomodate cabinets on both sides. Can't
sleep 2, but haven't had the need to.

If you have the Z-bed parts, you can just re-mount
them -which is a PITA! What exactly are you planning?
I may have done it in a previous configuration. -BaH

 Hi list,
 
 I've searched the archives, internet, etc. with no
 luck. Has anyone 
 heard/seen a fold-down 3/4 middle seat (like a
 modified Z-Bed)? Thanks.
