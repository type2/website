no but one thing that is happening is that the materials they make the
batteries from are becoming thinner and stronger so that more battery can
be packed into the same size package as before. no I don't think there is
a magic battery but I do think the usability will become more practical as
time goes by, incremental will eventually be sufficient.

I drew up plans for putting short range battery power into my van. since
more than half my trips are probably less than 25miles I figured I would
be able to use plug in power for the short hauls.  also might help in
acceleration considering electric motors have almost unlimited torque at
zero rpm.  and torque falls off with speed you would maybe be able to get
started faster easier. which would certainly help MPG.
