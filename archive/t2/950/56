Hi Volks,

One important thing I neglected to mention in the last post:  
PASSPORTS.   Americans DO NOT NEED A PASSPORT  to enter Canada if  
they are entering in a motor vehicle.

The legislation that recently took effect is in regards to air  
travel. American or Canadian citizens crossing the Canada/US border  
in a motor vehicle only require a birth certificate and a state- 
issued photo ID. (Children are exempt from the Photo ID  
requirement).  Pets require proof of rabies vaccination though I have  
never heard of that actually being requested.

Since there are a couple of American buses planning to attend TCWBC I  
thought this was worth mentioning. This is also true if you are  
planning on attending Buses Of the Corn, which will be held in  
Whitby, Ontario on the second weekend in August.


Happy Trails,
