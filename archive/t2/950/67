My install is going a bit longer than I had wanted, but I am learning along
the way.  Most of the time was spent trying calculate exactly where I wanted
to drill a hold in the floor for the exhaust.  A bit nerve racking.  I cut
it in the wrong spot the first time anyway.  I havn't been able to come
across many descent quality pics of these units, so I took some preliminary
shots.  Later I'll add shots of the install process and hopefully provide
somewhat of a relevant write up on it.  For now though,
