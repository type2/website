Subject: Fiber Washer with new points?

Hi Everyone,

I've just read all the very helpful posts regarding my timing/non-starting '74
bus problems... Wow, I've got some great leads and I really appreciate all the
advice!

When I replaced the points today, I was concerned there wasn't a fiber washer?
The old set didn't have this washer either, but I'm wondering if it should be
there?

I just read Bartnik's tech article on changing the points and nowhere does he
mention a fiber washer... Maybe the type 4 points have a built in feature to
keep the moving side of the points from grounding?

Thanks,

Tom
