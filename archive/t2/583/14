Subject: fuel/vent line question

I have a '78 bus with a Weber progressive Carb. When the DPO install it he
disconnected the charcoal filter by simply removing the hose to the filter,
(hose, 9 in this diagram, and everything after.;)

Now I'm no rocket scientist but I did not see it as promoting self
preservation to be venting gas fumes into my engine compartment. I have
since blocked this off by adding a short piece of hose with a plug in it to
the "T" connection.

I still have the canister but it has "nipples" on both ends.

Should I hook it back up??
If I do witch end is up???

And Yes I have replaces all the fuel hoses listed in this picture

Thanks
