Subject: Chrome Grille Surround

Hiya All,

I really need some ideas here.  Especially from any of you who have a metal 
working background or any experience with the chrome trim on a Bus.

The details.....had the Bus painted.  The chrome grille surround on the nose 
of the Bus no longer fits properly.  The "bead" is now too wide to fit in the 
space between the grille and the body.  I'm assuming that this is due to the 
new paint.  I did have the surround stripped, polished, and reanodized.

Well, I don't want to force it in and scrape the paint. So..............any 
ideas out there on how I might go about getting this surround to fit properly?  
All my thoughts lead me to somehow compressing the "bead" to make it a bit 
smaller.  But how would I do that?  What tool could I use?  Better yet, where 
could I go?

Scratching my head,

Mike
