Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 oil sender, what is best?? 

mike the guy that rebuilt my engine for me drilled a hole in the bottom of the plate at the end of the dipstick i cant think of the plate name right now but that is where my sender is located. i can take pics for you later after work if you still are interested... i am even sure he might do a plate for you and could probadly send it to you but not sure what he would charge for something like that. After doing my plate though he has done a couple more since. works great and i installed it when i changed my oil.
good luck and let me know if you need some pics i will take them for you this evening when i get home.
peace

I've found in the archives that the dipstick senders are best in "upright"
motors.



But what about T4 motors??

Any other suggestions on location???



Does greater resistance (like crimp connectors, extra wire) display higher
or lower temps??



Thanks
