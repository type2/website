Subject: Brian Powers

Greetings,

A gentleman by the name of Marc contacted me looking for a Brian Powers from 
the Syracuse, NY area who owns/used to own a '78 Westy.  I don't know Brian, 
so I told Marc that I would ask around.  Anyone who knows or is Brian, please 
contact me and I will get you Marc's e-mail address.

The Summer of Madness begins this weekend; if Phigment isn't roadworthy and 
dependable by the end of the summer I will have to be committed...

Happy 4th,

Tracy Hill
