Hiya Mike,

I'm not that familiar with late Bays, but the principles herein should 
apply..........

How to tell if you should rehook your emissions canister?  A wise observation 
by you, "I did not see it as promoting self preservation to be venting gas 
fumes into my engine compartment."  No kidding!  So, the short of it is, by all 
means hook up that canister.

Check the canister out by removing it and blowing through it.  Blow through 
the end with two outlets (one larger - one smaller), and cover the smaller 
outlet and blow through the larger.  You should be able to do this easily.  If you 
have to force it or it is just plugged then the canister should be either 
renewed or replaced.  175 201 801A (this a superceeded part) is available at your 
local VW dealer for about $65.

The larger outlet you blew through is connected to your fan shroud.  The 
smaller outlet is connected to your gas tank.  And the outlet on the other side 
runs to your air filter.

Hope that is of some help.
