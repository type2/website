Ok, second time around. I KNOW the list is gonna bounce that last reply
becoue I forgot to edit my quote. :) 


>>> Another last question, what about a better battery regulator, am in
need 
of a new one but i feel that the old style one doesn't fully charge my 
twin batteries....


Search in Google for "High Output Alternator". That's what your needing
to fully charge more than one battery and/or one with heavy drain. Or
just goto your local Car Audio shop, they should be able to tell you
LOTS about high output alternators, since their largely used for car
audio applications.
