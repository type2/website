Doh, I never saw a spring at all in mine. Did they still have use 'em in
'76? My bus didn't come with a dizzy, so at least I'm not at fault for
losing it. :) Is their much special about this spring? Should a FLAPS
carry it, or do I need to go junk yard shopping? Excactly what does this
spring do anyway? Does it just keep the shaft from rising?

>>>  Yes, you really need that spring.  Without it your dwell angle and
timing will wander as RPM changes.
