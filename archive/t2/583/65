Subject: This guy is stuck, any ideas? 

Hey guys, I can't find the solution to this in the archives. Anyone know
what it is? (just requested help on my local westie camping group)

I found several referances to people having the same type of problem on
the Vanagon section of the archives, but couldn't find any solutions to
their problems. 

Please respond to him at Gti_02(-at-)yahoo.com
I haven't asked, but I'm assuming he's 802.11 right now. 

Thanks a lot
Chris

I need help with my 1981 Westfalia.  The van will idle good but the
second I try to give it gas it starts sputtering, barely running.  RPMs
won't increase.

I changed the fuel pump with a good one and it's getting 11.5 volts.
We've looked for vacuum leaks with propane.  I can get fuel to leak just
before the injectors.  Changed the coil.  When I disconnected the
canister filter I got sprayed in the face (engine off) and it spewed
fuel easily so I'm assuming it is ok and there's pressure.  It looks
like the canister filter was manufactured in 2002.  Air filter is fine.
Messed with the AFM.  

Suggestions?   -John
