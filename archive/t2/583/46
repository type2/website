Bill,

Tried that method when I put my 78 back together.  I ended up splitting 
part of the rivet.

Here is what worked better for me...

I had a round punch that is actually pretty blunt nosed but still had 
a center point on it

Put the flat side of the rivet on the flat part of my vice, had the
wife hold everything upright and then just tapped the punch down into the 
rivet a couple of times with a hammer.

Looked like factory.

Cheers, dave
