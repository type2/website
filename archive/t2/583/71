Subject: RE: [T2] Oh no! Now Sparkin ain't Startin

Have you tried starting fluid????

I spent almost days trying to start my bus after a motor rebuild just to
have my uncle spray some starting fluid in the carp and it fired right
up....

It turns over great, timing is perfect, hot spark to the plugs, brand new
Weber system & fuel pump...but nothing.

Can someone lend me some advice?
