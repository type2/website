the real key is not the "exact" temp of the motor but rather trends or
changes,  any half decent sender can do that.

my motor may not be running at EXACTLY 210degrees sump oil temp, but if it
suddenly starts reading 280degrees I know I have a problem NOW......

does it really matter if that is 280 or 275 or 285 it screams PROBLEM!!
it helps you know your engine and when your engine is feeling ill
