Subject: Shifter problem

Hello all,
While running errands this morning my shift rod decided not to work
properly.
At first it was just 'squishy' going into 3rd. then it would work normally.
After some freeway driving it would not go into 1st or 3rd, as if something
is blocking the rod.

any ideas on this one?
77 2.0L FI, Manual
Thanks
