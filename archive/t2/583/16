Subject: Type 4 oil sender, what is best?? 

I've found in the archives that the dipstick senders are best in "upright"
motors.

 

But what about T4 motors??

Any other suggestions on location???

 

Does greater resistance (like crimp connectors, extra wire) display higher
or lower temps??

 

Thanks
