there are two of them. the one on Washington Blvd in Jessup is the one
that burned.  Barry was out there not too long ago and said there were a
few buses but he doesn't keep stuff around very long, maybe a month and
what's left gets crushed.

the one on Erdman Ave always seems to have one or two buses in varying
stages of disassembly every time I've been there

kinda hard to tell from the news copter film that I saw
