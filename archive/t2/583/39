Subject: phone dial wheels

 I've got a set of 4 Porshe phone dial wheels 15x6 from a late '80's 944 that I
would like to put on my 77 bay window. I was wondering if wheel adapters are
easy to come by for this application and are they recomended? Is a custom wheel
shop the best place to find the adapters? thanks for any and all comments
