Subject: Heat Exchanger Removal?

Now just to make sure I'm not being dumb again, the Heat Exchangers are
their ONLY for passenger comfort right? So taking them off, shouldn't
cause any problems for the engine right? 
 
See, I'm going to install electric heaters/blowers off my aux. battery.
So I'm thinking to remove the heat exhcangers, and have my headers
Ceramic coated (to keep heat down). Their ARE normal headers under the
heat exchangers right? Or if I take off the heat exchangers will I be
left needing to find some headers that fit. 
 
Also, I see a lot of headers and mufflers for Type-1's. Will those fit
onto a Type-4?
