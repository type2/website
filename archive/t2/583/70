Subject: How to find TDC to verify Distributor is not 180 degrees off?

Hi Guys,

My distributor only seems to engage in one position, so I am wondering how a
Type 4 engine could  be 180 degrees off?

Also, how could I verify 1 is TDC without the notch in the distributor?

Thanks,

Tom

PS: Why am I so stupid?
