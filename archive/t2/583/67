Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 oil sender, what is best??

This photo shows the sender mounted what I'd call perpendicular to the  
sump plate mounting screws.  That is... if the mounting screws are at  
12 and 6 o'clock, the sender is at 3 (or 9) o' clock.  The  
instructional diagram that came with my VDO sender suggested that I  
drill a hole at somewhere near 1:30 (exact measurements in millimeter  
were provided).  Would my having drilled the hole according to the  
instructions allow me to avoid "shaving a nut?"
