Vincent,

Physics/chemical guys can answer why, but I can answer "what to do".

Got to *any* flaps or wally world and buy the $1.00 package of two felt 
rings(one red and one green) that go under your battery clamps.  Don't 
remember what they are called, but everyone in the auto battery section 
will know what you are looking for.

Clean all terminals and connections with a wire brush and then put the red 
ring on the posit ive and the green on the negative...reinstall cables.

These things work great!

Cheers, dave
