Subject: Car transport - need help

Since it is Friday, I dare to post a non-type2 message. Please reply
off-list. There is some German car content, however.

I need to have a 59 Borgward Isabella Coupe transported from somehwere
around Whichita, KS, to the Washington, DC, area. I got a quote from
Intercity Lines for enclosed transport - $1400. That is more than $1 per
mile.

Since the car is a $900 project, I am looking for a cheaper way of
getting this car here. Problem is, that I MUST have it on the East Coast
by the end of July.

Does anyone have suggestions for affordable shipping? I am willing to
pay about half of what Intercity Lines wants - i.e. $700. If anyone
happens to travelling East with an empty trailer or an empty tow dolly -
this could be a good way to subsidize your trip.

Well, there actually is some bus content: I am getting two more
Isabellas and both a being brought home with a tow dolly towed by my 74
Camper - I just do not have the time for a 2400 miles roundtrip at this
point.

Thanks,
Marcus
