Subject: Re: CHT Gauge Accuracy

I have the same problem.  Brand new VDO CHT gage just installed on my bus.  
Used only the provided materials for the install (i.e., no extra wire length 
needed). Found that the wires in the harness were swapped such that the 
black wire needs to connect to the + terminal and the red to the - terminal. 
  On a short 10 minute drive to work at 35 mph, I'm getting 360 degree 
readings.  This on a newly rebuilt engine with a newly rebuilt and adjusted 
AFM.  Driving down the freeway yesterday at 60-65 MPH I was getting 400-425 
degree readings. Oil temps the whole time were about 180 degrees.

I plan to double check the accuracy of the gage by inserting a temp probe 
down near the #3 plug (where the CHT sender is).  If it reads alot lower, 
then it will help me get past the freak-out thing when I see my CHT gage zip 
past 400.

I have a brand new (not rebuilt) set of heads on my stock '79 2.0L
westy.  I took all precautions possible, setting compression ratio
properly, sealing up cooling tin, new engine compartment seal etc,
making sure there are no vacuum leaks, etc.  I also installed a VDO
cylinder head temp gauge with the sender under the #3 spark plug.

On the road at 60 mph, 75 degree ambient temperature, my CHT reads 475.
  If I increased speed to 65, the CHT would climb to over 500.  This
seemed high to me and freaks me out.  I don't want to burn up this new
set of heads.  Since the engine runs perfectly, hot or cold and
everything should be in order with the engine, timing, etc., I began to
question the validity/accuracy of the CHT gauge.

So yesterday I got my hands on one of those infrared laser pointed
remote thermometer devices.  This is not a cheapie, but a $300 Raytek
unit that is brand new.  When I point this at my head at the #3 spark
plug, it consistently reads 75 to 90 degrees lower than the VDO CHT.
Now I don't know whether these infrared devices are geometry dependent
to the extent that the surface of the head is irregular with vertical
fins and a spark plug sticking up, but I sure like the numbers that the
Raytek is giving me as opposed to the VDO gauge.  The Raytek numbers
seem normal (i.e. 400 - 425 F) as opposed to the VDO (475 to 500 F).

Can anyone think of any reasons that I shouldn't believe the Raytek
numbers over the VDO CHT gauge?
