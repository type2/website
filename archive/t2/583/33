-----Original Message-----From: Chris 
are you sure the end with the two nipples (one small, one big) 
is the end hooked to the shroud?  On my 73, it's the opposite.  Now, I'm 
wondering.  However, if mine was flip-flopped, it would not fit with 
the original factory configuration of the vent lines.  i.e. the shround 
HAS to connect to the side of the canister with the single large nipple.  
Anyone else?
