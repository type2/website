Subject: Re: [T2] Floppy vent wing- how to tighten? - also in bad haiku

From Al:
 Vent window flop in wind.
 Want to tighten top pivot.
 How will I do this?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Since you mention the top pivot, 
which is a rivet, I am assuming you are
referring to the front door vent windows?

If yes, remove the door panel and tighten the lower clamp bolt
on the pivot shaft. But make sure the pivot shaft is still attached
to the bottom of the vent window 1st.....  A lot of times, the clamp 
and shaft rust together and when the window is opened, the shaft shears off.
You can watch the shaft turn thru the same hole in the door where you see 
the 10mm clamp bolt.

The rear vent windows suffer the sheared shaft fate about 50% of the time.
