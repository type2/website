Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 oil sender, what is best?? 

mike the guy that rebuilt my engine for me drilled a hole in the bottom of the plate at the end of the dipstick i cant think of the plate name right now but that is where my sender is located. i can take pics for you later after work if you still are interested... i am even sure he might do a plate for you and could probadly send it to you but not sure what he would charge for something like that. After doing my plate though he has done a couple more since. works great and i installed it when i changed my oil.


good luck and let me know if you need some pics i will take them for you this evening when i get home.


peace

I've found in the archives that the dipstick senders are best in "upright"
motors.



But what about T4 motors??

Any other suggestions on location???



Does greater resistance (like crimp connectors, extra wire) display higher
or lower temps??



Thanks

this is the sort of el cheapo diagram i throwed together showing where the place is in the plate that the bolt had to be shaved on that side for it to work.

my vdo usually runs right at 220 or a little over that in extreme heat but it is only young in the summer and august in my area is usually the hottest so thats when i will really will try to I put a small line at the highest point on my gauge that it has been so far yet which was like maybe 240? guessing without going out to the bus.

i havent plastic shrunk my wire yet but plan to when i have the cash for the shrink tubeing so the wire will be protected.

hope these help my camera sucs....

as far as the engine builder goes he did superb work and i would reccomend him to anyone.

the fellow that done these plates and built my engine is more than likely out of town this weekend at sunshine daydreams campout for fmbc in north carolina. i look forward to attending as well this weekend if all goes well and things work out for us.
