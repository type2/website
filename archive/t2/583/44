BullyG,

Welcome to the list!

If you search thru the archives there is listed a place that will rebuild
your brake booster....obviously, rusty as in rusted through is no good, so 
your pick and pull item may be the better one....

If I remember correctly, "real" ones are NLA...and evil word that you will 
learn to hate, means "no longer available".

Cheers, dave
