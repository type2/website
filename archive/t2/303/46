Subject: RE: Starter doesn't work * CAUTION*

Been there done that. Word of caution - *** It you have someone trying to turn the key while you are under the vehicle banging on the starter - MAKE SURE THE PARKING BRAKE IS ON AND THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF
GEAR * We had someone from the list die not too long ago from this very same thing.
I am in the DC area and have an extra starter. If you make it this far, give me a call and you can borrow it to make your trip. Return
it when you get a new one. 
I am Howard: 301 928 8972
