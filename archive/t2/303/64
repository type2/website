I'm not old enough to know first hand but it's my understanding way back
when fords and chevys needed a warm up too.
My mothers family bought a new blue and white standard in 1965.  Only car
they could afford to buy new that they would all fit in. 9 seater for 11
people. My mom and her sister rode on the engine shelf in back. I think it's
still the only new car my granparents have ever bought. I remember my
grandpa explaining to me when I got my first bus that it didn't matter how
high you reved it because that made the fan spin faster, so the bus actually
ran cooler.(I knew better even at 15) He would just leave it in third gear
when driving on the high way with all the kids, ran better that way. Not
suprisingly this bus had  a few engines over the years until my uncle
finally rolled it into a ditch and destroyed it in the 80's. My grandpa did
say the first engine lasted longer than all the rebuilds he had afterward.


But what of the people who just drove
