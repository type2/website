I am reminded of what I read in the Idiot's Guide; paraphrased - if you 
want to drive fast, take corners at high speed, and just jump in the 
vehicle and drive away with no warm up - Don't buy a bus.

I think John suggested a Ford.  I personally would go with a Toyota for 
the least maintenance issues but that's my opinion.
