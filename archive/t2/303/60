When I tried to get the 75 bus going and traced the bad starting to
blocked injectors, I pulled some off a used core engine and put them in
the 75.  I watched the connections as it was turned over, and spotted
gas squirting out of a connection- then realized that the stock hose had
cracked by the crimp.  If you disconnect the injectors to watch the
spray or just replace the seals, this movement stresses the hose
terminals and brittle ones can crack.
