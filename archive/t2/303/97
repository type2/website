I don't mind the 58 MPH on the flat, but I live at 7500 feet, in the
mountains, and sometimes find myself in second gear up some of the hills...
I pull it onto the shoulder if anyone comes up behind me, as 25 in a 55 is a
little ridiculous for 2003.  Does anyone know where I can get one of those
"Never, ever, get behind a VW" bumper stickers?  : )
