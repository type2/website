Those metal crimp ends are easy to get off if you take a pair of wire
cutters and screw driver, cut/split the flange up as far as you can, then
take a razor knife and cut the rubber hose.  Pull the rubber hose off, then
the rest of the flange will come right off.  Be sure to put hose clamps back
on with the new hose.

No need to replace the entire injector (those things aren't cheap).
