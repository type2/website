Subject: Ignition switch will not turn off car

I tried a different switch with same result........................Starts
the car fine, but when i turn it off, it stays running.............I am
having a tough time deciphering the circuitry to determine exactly what
wires cut the motor off......................would be kinda nice to have
this fixed before I take it on its initial run.
