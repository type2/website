it is. but keep in mind this is in a bus.

One thing no one has touched on lately is how our busses really like
it when we drive slow. There are several people on the list who say
otherwise (not from heresay but acutual experience) but pushing a bus,
especially a T1 motor will really shorten the life of that motor. I
know of some people who drive their busses at 70-75 daily for long
distances & have no trouble. But, I also remember reading posts from
others which basically go "i'm having trouble with my bus, it lacks
power. I always drive it at 75 & have no problems, now this exhaust
valve has dropped & I lost power".

Even people who have recently got a worn motor rebuilt will push the
motor & then cause something bad from extra heat. Something to the
effect of "after the rebuild it would easily run 75-80 with no
problem. suddenly it lost power & now my mechanic is telling me
yadda,yadda yadda". There seems to be a good bit if difference between
what different engines can do, but they all seem a bit happier in the
right lane. I would suggest finding out how many campouts per year
your bus can make it to :)
