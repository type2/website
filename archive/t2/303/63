Subject: Got another Bus!

Hello list. Well I found a 72 bus about 6 months ago in a fenced yard for
containers . and yesterday I was finally able to get somewhere....I got the
owners name and number!!! yippy. Well I gave him a call and he was willing
to sell it, he said to make an offer . I asked a few standard questions
about the bus like how long had it been sitting why was it there....... then
I said I didn't know what to offer him as I don't have much cash he said how
does $100 should  I said hmm how bout $50 the we settled on $75. What my
plan is to take my motor and Kamper interior from my current daily driver a
74 hardtop Kamper 
and put it in this new 72 as the body on mine has more bondo than it should.
Are there any major differences between the 2? are the brake systems the
same? will the front axles swap? Anything else you all knowing list members
call share about this transplant.
Thanx 
Ian
