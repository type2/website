Subject: Stainless steel exhaust

I am looking for feedback from bus owners who have installed a stainless steel
exhaust system on their upright bus engine.  I am looking at purchasing one
from BusDepot for my 71 Westy.
Please only reply if you have actual experience with this product, I am NOT
interested in your story about the good or bad service you received, I simply
want to know about how the exhaust fit (ie. did all holes line up correctly
with all studs, etc.), and are you happy with the performance of the product.

Peace, John Baker
