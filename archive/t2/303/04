Subject: '78 Westy ECU

Hello Everyone,

        I am still working on several problems with my 2.0L motor.
Someway the fuel is still geting in the oil. I have good compression and
all FI components seem to test ok. I changed all injectors and the cold
start valve. The one part I do not know about is the ECU. I have the 022
906 021 AG which is a manual transmission unit, I should have the 022 906
021 AH for the automatic transmission. Is the injector pulse rate
different for these 2 units. I am still trying to locate a AH unit for
sale. Thanks for your answers and if anyone has a good AH ECU you will
part with please let me know.
