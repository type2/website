Subject: Re: [T2] Top speed

Thanks listees.
I occassionally go out on I-40 where the Speed limit is 70mph.
I didn't think that it should fly, but I keep hearing of people mentioning
speeds around 80
I guess thats with the later models.
Anyway, I don't usually go flying down the road, usually 60-65.
I just wanted to get an idea of how I was doing compared to others with the
same setup.
I think I right in there.
Also I was just seeing if something was out of whack on my bus.
Thanks again for all the responses
Later,
