Subject: Re: [T2] Flat cam/AVP quality? (longer)

The main problem here is not AVP, it is the BAD MECHANIC THAT TOLD HIM TO
SWAP LIFTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE.


It is not the Vw's fault that this "mechanic" told him bad gas ruined the
injectors, and told him to replace them, and then said "oh. I guess it was
the cam after all. NO SHIT, Sherlock!   He advised mismatching marts in the
engine, and should be liable for ruining the cam and the guys engine.  No
one else.  His advice his problem.

There are lots of mechanics out there that would tell you the same.  Look at
the type 4 forum, and Jake Raby's take on hydraulic lifters.  he puts solids
and everything, and never has a cam go flat, or worry about lifters that
have lost their pump.

Personally, after having several hydraulic lifter type 4 engines, I have
begun using solids all the time myself.  A little valve adjusting never hurt
anybody.
