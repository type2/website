When that day comes, I am going to frame that puppy and hang it on the wall.  
It will be worth going to traffic school for the lifetime of laughs it will 
bring.  I don't speed in town nor do I want to receive a citation for doing 
so, but I think it would be amusing to get a speeding ticket on the highway 
in an old VW bus.  Anyone ever gotten one?  Mike "Porsche-boy" Gensler need

Try movin' that fast in Joisey...Not only do we pay the highest initial 
insurance
rates in the country, but the "surcharge" for moving violations tacked on your
insurance bill is fast approaching mortgage proportions. And will probably get
lots worse as the state and municipalities scramble for "new" sources of
revenue to replace the lost revenue from investments...Unlike a marked 
state trooper or local cop car cruising the road to keep everybody "honest"
and safe (the reason for the laws in the first place),an unmarked car or 
radar-
trap is an invisible tax...;-(

Tony in NJ (NYC at least makes no bones about it and includes parking 
violations
                 in its general revenues and budgets accordingly...But no 
"quotas"...)
