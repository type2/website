Cresting a hill at 75 and coming upon stopped traffic?
How about a downhill with a stopsign hidden at the bottom- being a long
time cyclist, I'm very cautious of blind downhills.
I got a ticket near Cornell once doing 75 down Rt 81 hill (was 55
then)....I argued I had to go that fast to AVERAGE 55, as climbing up
the hill dropped me to about 35!
