Hello List,
 The exhaust leak is coming from the exhaust pipe connection on the left
head. I hope it is only the gasket  but I haven't removed the pipe to
see. With my luck the studs will break in the head when I try to remove
the nuts. Compression was good and heads are tight. Thanks for everyone's
advice.
