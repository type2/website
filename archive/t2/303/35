You must bridge the solenoid spade terminal to activate it.
Bypassing the solenoid will verify only the starter winding.
This is why the starter spins but doesn't engage the flywheel.
Resistance in the ignition circuit is eliminated when you go
directly from the battery hot input to either the solenoid or the starter
winding. This long ignition circuit electrical path can be suplemented
with a relay which uses the circuit for signal only.  That $2 relay has
solved a lot of starter headaches for many people.

The starter and solenoid may be disassembled for a tune-up.
Cleaning the electrical components will often restore proper function
for many more years. It's not very complicated. Is it worth an hour ?
