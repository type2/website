Hiya Jim,

70 mph (+/-) is pretty darn good for a 19701600cc bus loaded down with Westy 
furnishings.  Without Guesswork lists the top speed for a bus (without all 
the Westy stuff) at 66mph (4000rpm).  And that would be the 1600cc single 
port engine which was standard equipment during the 1970 production year.
