Sigh.  You know I can't resist a taunt like that...

On the maiden voyage in my 73 Westy with a nice, fresh, stock 914 2.0 FI
motor and 901 5-sp tranny I got stopped out in Eastern New Mexico.  Very
friendly cop came up to my window and told me he had clocked me at 87 MPH,
but that he wasn't going to write me a ticket since my old VW bus surely
wouldn't go that fast.  I didn't disagree.  Nor did I bother to tell him
that if that damned 20 MPH head-wind would die down that I would have been
doing a cool 100 :)
