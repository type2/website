Well, when the speed limit is 55, I drive about 58.

When the speed limit is 65, I drive about 58.

When the speed limit is 70, I drive about 58.

My '71 seems to like 58.  It will go a bit faster, but it doesn't seem as
happy.

A lot of folks have said that they feel intimidated by traffic passing
them.  I've never had any problem with it.  There are quite a few vehicles
going 55-60 even on roads posted higher.
