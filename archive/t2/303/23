GEX has probably driven more VW/people to give up on VW's than any single
group or person (rant off)  I would put the blame first on the folks at
GEX.  check the engine number if it is hyd I would bet GEX never swapped
the cam for a solid cam, so I would suspect (no proof) that the solid
lifters took off the top surface (hardened) of the cam and then it was
just a matter of time no matter what lifters were in there until the cam
died.

it's simple,  hyd cam/hyd lifters or  solid cam/solid lifters

I have AVP heads I got from Ron at Bus Depot and they seem fine, haven't
had them that long though

BTDT, bit the bullet and put $2500 into a decent rebuild,  40,000 miles
later (or so) the engine is giving me no trouble.  

I would not part out an otherwise good bus, 

good luck to your friend
