Hi David,

LOL... Cresting a hill at 75???  That I have trouble imagining.

I believe that another contributing factor to engine longevity is 
modern fuels. With 99% of the vehicles on the road being fuel injected 
and water-cooled, fuel manufacturers are moving to additives to help 
them run cleaner. My belief (unfrtunately not supported due to 
manufacturers "unavailable" data) is that these fuels burn hotter than 
the fuels of the 70's did.

Happy trails,
