Hopefully not.  You are violating Mark's "rule" but if you have a bad lifter, you really don't have much choice but to replace it.  You did the best thing you could have done by replacing it with a new, identical lifter.  Change your oil regularly and don't worry about it.

That's one nice thing about roller lifters (which were never fitted to VW aircooled engines AFAIK) is that you can mix your lifters up, or replace them as needed with no ill effect.  Love 'em.
