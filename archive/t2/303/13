> 2.   How is the quality on AVP? Surely someone on the list has been
running one for a while. I would love to hear from folks who have put some
miles on an AVP rebuild.

Brandt-

I currently have just over 25,000 miles on an AVP rebuild (1800 carburated)
and I haven't had any significant problems. This bus ['74 Riviera] is my
daily driver as well as my road trip war wagon and I have no qualms about
taking her on a 1200 mile trip next month. AVP is OK in my book.

Regards,
Dave
