For my 2 cents worth, about 10 years ago, before I had my own Bus, I drove a
friend's '71 cross-country from NM to WA, and was amazed at the power it had
when driven flat-out as I proceeded to do for 2000 miles.  I think we
exceeded 80 MPH at times.  Wrapping it out downhill, keeping it singing at
the redline (or what I guessed the redline might be, no tach of course..) we
made some good time!  Then, you guessed it, *crunch*.  Big hole in the
piston, metal all through the case, and my first lesson in air-cooled heat
and stress tolerance (or lack thereof).  I was young(er) and dumb(er) what
can I say?
    I've got 25,000 on a purring stock rebuilt 1600DP now, never exceed 62
MPH for more than a couple seconds, never lug, never rev, change oil, adjust
valves, warmitup, listen, look, feel, etc.  I think the Bus is one of the
greatest vehicles ever made on Earth, but we must respect its limits and
liabilities.  I do fantasize about dropping in a built 1776 with duals
someday, though.  But as has been pointed out, once you start modifying the
motor, then comes brakes, suspension, tranny, $$$....  For now I appreciate
the beauty, balance, and function of the original design!

> I would argue that if your bus *does* these speeds comfortably, you need
to check your speedometer.  :)  Or maybe our ideas of "comfortably" are
simply different?

> Comfortably to me means about 1/4 throttle, decent mileage, nice cool
temps and having extra power in reserve for passing, etc..
