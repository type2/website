Last year David received a parrot for Christmas. This parrot was fully 
grown with a bad attitude and worse vocabulary. Every other word was an 
expletive. Those that weren't expletives were, to say the least, rude.

David tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly saying 
polite words, playing soft music, and anything else that came to mind. 
Nothing worked. He yelled at the bird and the bird got worse. He shook 
the bird and the bird got madder and ruder.

Finally, in a moment of desperation, David put the parrot in the 
freezer. For a few moments he heard the bird squawking, kicking and 
screaming and then, suddenly, all was quiet.

David, frightened that he might have actually hurt the bird, quickly 
opened the freezer door. The parrot calmly stepped out onto David's 
extended arm and said, "I'm sorry that I offended you with my language 
and actions. I ask for your forgiveness."

David was astounded at the bird's change in attitude and was about to 
ask what changed him when the parrot continued, "May I ask what the 
chicken did?"
