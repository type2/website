You are ruthless!  I would buy just about any complete bus for $100 sight-unseen.

Yes.  Bumpers, marker lights, taillights are different.  Tranny is geared differently.  Engine is different displacement, clutch and flywheel are different (the '74 stuff is more desireable IMO).  There are differences in the heater controls.

No.  The '74 has different calipers and rotors.

Don't know for sure, but my guess is that they would.
