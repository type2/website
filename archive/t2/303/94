I'm a little confused by your question, but I'll gander a guess
anyway. The distributor is held onto the block by a flat piece of
metal. If you look at the engine from the fan side this metal should
go around the distributor with a nut that allows you to loosen it &
adjust the timing. The mount is held in place right to the left of
it by a stud in the engine case. If you see this this is all you need.
Pictures would help if you have any.
