Subject: paint scheme

Merry Christmas All,

Rather than simply repaint my bus white I've decided to go with a
combination color scheme color for my camper.

I'm curios how the vans were painted.  For example, when the top was white
and bottom chrome yellow in 1975, did VW paint the whole van white then
selectively paint parts of the doors and steps the second color?
