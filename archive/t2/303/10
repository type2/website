Are your plugs sooty and is the exhaust black? Is you CO tail pipe emission 
over 4%? All indicate an over rich air fuel mixture.

Is one plug more sooty than the others? Maybe a sticking injector.

Maybe a wrong ECU could cause a minor over rich condition. So could many 
other things such as excessive fuel pressure.

A leak in the vacuum can on the fuel pressure regulator could cause a double 
whammy by sucking fuel into the air manifold as well as failing to regulate 
fuel pressure correctly.

Are one or more of the plugs not firing (rough idle and running) leaving 
unburnt fuel?

Good luck and a Happy New Year!

Chuck
