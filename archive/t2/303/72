I got numerous speeding tickets in my 66 panel camper(camper guts gone), 66
13 window(front seat only), and 67 westy(camper guts in my garage at the
time) when I was a teen. I lost my license twice before 18 and then lost it
for a third time for several years at 18 or 19. guess you could say I was a
slow learner. No need to frame the tickets I got as reminder. Every 6 months
when insurance needed to be paid for, and later every time I had to walk to
work I could remember it pretty well. The beat up buses where really a cop
magnet in raleigh/durham NC. they'd get me for a little as 5 over. Anyone
from durham on the list?

I usually don't speed at all now, even in the toyota



was asked:

Sometimes I even speed up when I see a cop.  When that day comes, I am going
to frame that puppy and hang it on the wall.  It will be worth going to
traffic school for the lifetime of laughs it will bring.  I don't speed in
town nor do I want to receive a citation for doing so, but I think it would
be amusing to get a speeding ticket on the highway in an old VW bus.  Anyone
ever gotten one?
