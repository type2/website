Mmmmmmmm....
Do any of you guys know the old saying about the 2/3 rule!
Many very good old mechanics will tell you the following:

NEVER maintain speed over 2/3 of the redline (RPM) on freeway/highway on 
a long trip. (Engine longevity/ life)

This rule is not a legend! I first heard this rules from an old Kawasaki 
Motorcycle mechanic who was a specialist in "inline, 2 cycle, 3 cylinder 
engine (for those who remember this era), this guys is now 65 years old 
and still work part time in a big Honda Motorcycle dealer as a mechanic 
councillor.
Remember that all older bikes were air-cooled and they didn't have a 
housing fan that were cooling them off in traffic, they only depend on 
movement.
More than once I heard my old GPZ-1100 (sold 2 years ago) pinging in 
traffic or hot summer condition with head temp well over 450F!!!!!! 
Never on those 10000rpm bike's I pop up a valve seat!!!!!!!!! NEVER. 
Well, of course, the head design didn't have a removable valve seat!!!!!

So, I guess that ours 1600-2000cc VW engine have a 4000 redline 
(approx.), in 4th gear it should give us an approximate speed of 
55-60mph (could be wrong!).

Remember, more speed equal more energy, more energy equal more heat, 
more heat equal more friction, more friction equal more fuel 
consumption... and so on.
I often see engine overheat (on normal cars) problems at speed well over 
70mph, but no overheating symptom at idle in traffic, why? Overpressure, 
leaks in the water-cooled cooling system. And/or bad radiator.
I was not surprise to see my head temp needle (73 VW) go down on idle, 
almost no energy is produce by the engine, there is also no air restriction.

Many people think that the more you go fast the more you will have cool 
air entering the cooling system (air or water cooled) so the engine will 
have a cooler running temperature, WRONG. A bus like ours have a brick 
wall in the front, not very aerodynamic, the amount of energy/heat 
produce by our small flat-4 is enormous!!!!!!!!!! The colling fan will 
not compensate the surplus of energy over a certain ground speed, a 
water-cooled engine will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Made me laugh when I saw an old bus passing me at 75mph when I had my 
Vanagon 2.1L WATER COOLED (I was going 60). Go go go, drive at 75 and 
pop up some valve seat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Believe me, I now my way around cooling system.
Cheers, Ben (just so you know, Ive owned more than 13 air-cooled 
motorcycle)
