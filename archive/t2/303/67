well I owned a 60 that I bought used in 69 that I drove pretty rough, it
only had a 1300 but it ran with little to no care for several years until
caught in a garage fire (not buses fault)
I also had a 65 Westy that I bought about 5 years old and that engine
never made it to 100k
I also bought a 71 new (dealer demo) for $2,100 or there abouts.  drove it
for about 4 years until the engine dropped a rod at 114k

those are the ones that I just bought and drove...each one getting a
little better care than the previous....

my current 78 (all these were/are daily drivers) has just rolled over 311k
with the engine being rebuilt 1.5 times (top end at 184k, full rebuild at
250k) this one I drive carefully, first one with instruments that I keep
an eye on and regular maintanence.  I have this one on the road longer
than all the other ones I had put together so I guess there is something
to be said for regular care...now this 78 is not a garage queen, it lives
out doors I drive it year round and haul stuff in it and cram it full of
people on occasion.  but I try not to abuse it and I plan on getting at
least another 150k out of it if I cann stay ahead of the rust ;8*}

of course YMMV
