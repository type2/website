Subject: RE: [T2] Flat cam/AVP quality? (longer)

  Miss matched rods, cranks ground different sizes, exp; 20 rod/30 mains. I
have even tore GEX down with different size rod bearings, usually use Moresa
P/L (cheapest available), nothing is balanced or even close. reground cam
(not re heat treated, nitrated only) and cam followers, case alaigned bored
40/60 or sometimes I have seen up to 80 over with double cut thrust. Heads
welded with different CC's. Need I say more.
  All in all I feel I could build a better engine with used parts lying
around the shop.

engine parts, exp. broken sets of P/L, rings, cam followers, bearing sets
etc.

I had a free GEX engine some years ago (a mechanic friend got two shipped
to his address by a customer...) Lasted a month in my ol' '71...
Any spies out there who actually know the rebuild process at GEX ? I 
know there's no 'legal' definition of rebuild so they can get away with
practically anything, but I'm just curious if there is a process at
all...?-(
