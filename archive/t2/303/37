Subject: RE: [T2] volkswagen microbuses calendar

Nice calenders ... I tried ordering one and unfortunately, Amazon doesn't 
plan to ship these until the end of next month. Does anyone know of a faster 
(maybe direct from the designer) way to order one? I seem to recall 
exchanging email with a guy a while back who was working on one of these 
calenders for 2002. Is this Kimball guy the same dude? Any ideas?

Thanks,
