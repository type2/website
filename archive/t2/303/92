As I recall, VW stated that the top speed was 68MPH.

IMO, this is pretty good for ~50hp pushing a big square box.  Unless you
have spent some $$$ on balancing and strengthening the engine I don't
think that it's prudent to cruise at more than 62 with a stock 1600
engine.

If you want to cruise faster, the solution is a different engine, or the
application of much $$$ to build a fancy Type 1 engine.
