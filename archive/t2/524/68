>>Although not "officially" listed as being for a Bus, I have been told
that the  '68-70 Bug lock cylinder (mechanical side), part # 113905853,
fits the Bus as well. This would somewhat make sense in that it does
mate with the electrical portion that you listed above (which fits both
'68-70 Bug and Bus). Since it's cheap ($8), and returnable if
uninstalled anyway, it's probably worth trying. (If anyone can confirm
from experience that this does fit a bus, I'll add that info to my
website, which will help out other '68-70 owners.)<<

yes, if indeed someone can confirm i'll order a.s.a.p.!
