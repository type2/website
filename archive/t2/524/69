Subject: RE: [T2] 79 FI Transporter Runs all day then starts well and 

I was having trouble much like you with my 76.  It drove me nuts.  I
replaced everything that I could think of but it didn't seem to fix
this intermittant trouble.  Sometimes it ran fantastic,.. then other
times, horribly.

After many hours and dollars I discovered that my gap on my points
would periodically change.  A light bulb went on in my head at this
point(not the timing light, the other one).  Talked it over with my
mechanic and we started troubleshooting the distributer.  Turns out
that I needed to replace my distributer as the plate on the dizzy
was too old and too used.  So if it was a hot day, or if I hit a
bump or basically anything that would either heat the metal or jar
the motor in general, I would lose my setting on my points.  It was
accompanied with a heavy fuel smell when it was running poorly.

This problem that I was having exhibited every symptom that a vacuum
leak/temp II sensor issue exhibits.  The truth was in the gap on my
points.  I replaced my distributer since I had another handy.  Now I
have no troubles.  Something to think about anyway.
