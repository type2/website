Subject: copper nuts for exhaust

Hi,  Awhile back I thought i had heard someone mention a source for the 
correct metric
copper nuts for the exhaust (M8X1.25) I having no luck finding a source. 
I think it was an online
bolt/nut store but none of these stores seem to sell copper nuts. I've 
looked at boltdepot.com and
sent them an email but Ihaven't heard back yet.  Where have you bought 
these?

Alex
