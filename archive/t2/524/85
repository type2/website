mike,

this may or may not be normal behavior, depending on how long you
ran/cranked the engine for. it can take a while to get the oil everywhere in
a new engine. what kind of oil pressure switch do you have installed? it is
difficult to trip a VDO dual pole sender by cranking the engine only.

try this: remove the oil pressure sender and crank the engine (no plugs,
ignition disabled) until the oil comes out the sender hole. it is also a
good idea to pre-fill the oil filter on a new rebuild (i always fill the
filter on every oil change, in fact).

so long as you used lots of assembly lube, the engine is fine.
