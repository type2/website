Unfortunately it's not available. Only the ones you found at Wolfsburg
West (which we also sell) are currently repro'd. I have seen some people
use this one and patch it using pieces from their old one or a second
kit to make it look acceptable. Admittedly a rig job, but sometimes the
only alternative, given that it's hard to find a used one in better
shape than your own. :-(
