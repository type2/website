Subject: Door panels

I bought some door panel clips from one of the standard VW vendors and they
are too large for my '71 bus. The holes in my doors are 1/4" dia and did not
use rubber inserts. The clips that I received are larger and came with rubber
inserts and there is no way to make them fit. It appears that a larger hole of
about 11/32" would be required to accomodate these clips and inserts. Before I
go back to the vendor, I would like to find out what I really need. Does
anyone know if the buses changed the hole size and added the rubber insert and
in what year this took place?

Sincere Thanks,
