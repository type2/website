Subject: What dizzy to use??? Any suggestions? Karl?

HEllo List,

I have searched the archives to no avail. I am trying
to build a not-so-stock engine settup for my 68 bus. I
will be installing a factory new 1600cc DP engine with
new 34/32 sdpit dual carbs. I need to know what type
of ignition that I need to be looking at with this
engine. What type of advance/retard curve should I be
shooting for? What is the biggest factor in
determining the advance curve? The weight of the
vehicle? The gearing? The fuel system? I will be using
the stock 4 speed manual transmission. Would I just
use the 71 bus timing specs since this is a DP engine?
This bus has been camperized and is a bit heaver than
a standard bus No pop top but it does have a propane
fridge and stove with a wood interior and bed. Would
the distributor form a 72 standard bus work well on
this bus seeing as the 72 bus used a very similar carb
settup? Karl, any suggestions?

Thank you again List for all of the help. It is
comming along!
