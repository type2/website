Hi list,

I did something recently that I've never done before. I bought a vehicle
just because I liked it. It is a '74 Van, and it wasn't running. After
years of owning little British cars, I wasn't afraid of having to do a
little work. I rebuilt the carb, and it then it started. I was happy,
but then noticed that it was spraying huge amounts of gas out of the top
of the aftermarket Weber carb. It would continue to make a sort of
splurping sound even after the van was shut off. I decided to have a
non-dealership VW place look at the carb and tell me what is out of
adjustment. Instead I got a call late in the afternoon telling me that I
have no compression on my #2 cylinder. The compression on the other 3
was good. So, I asked how much I was looking at to get that fixed and
was told $1200. In the past I would just pull the head and replace the
bad valve, lapping it into place. Could this be done with my van? That
shouldn't cost anywhere near that to do. Am I out of line in thinking
this. Any thoughts, feelings or encouragement would go a long way right
now.

Thanks,

Mark
