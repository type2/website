Laura,

Rattling noise is not too descriptive<grin>, but here we go!

Compression check would be good to start with....mostly
because you get to see what the spark plugs look like and *then*
try the compression test.

Also pull the valve covers off and see what the valve train looks like...
got a valve so far off from the others that jumps out at you?

Broken valve spring?

Good luck, dave
