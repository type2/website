Joel.

Sorry you are still having problems. Maybe fuel delivery (not quality 
) is an issue. With the bus warmed up and stalling at idle I would 
strongly suspect one of two things. The cutoff solenoid or a vac 
leak. As the motor warms up things change position just a little and 
vac leaks can occur.

Grab a 17mm and make sure the solenoid is tightly seated in the carb. 
If it is not then it will stall the vehicle. Check for other vac 
leaks such as carb to the manifold.

You can get the lock side and the electric switch side from any 
vendor such as bus boys or bus depot. If you have not replaced the 
switch you might as well because the one that was in it when you 
bought it is a generic from NAPA. I seriously doubt you need or want 
the hassle of putting a new harness in the bus.

Good luck!
