Heh, I remember in the mid-80's my dad bought a 1973
Chrysler New Yorker with an 8-track player.  8-tracks
were pretty scarce by then (most record stores had
already stopped selling them).  The cassette adapters
were around $100 at the time, and he was way too cheap
for that... someone told him that Columbia House
Record Club still offered 8-tracks, so he signed up
himself and all three kids with a membership and let
us pick out our 12 free 8-tracks.  Wish I still had
those, I had Def Leppard, Quiet Riot, Ozzy osbourne,
etc. on 8-track... I wonder, do you think you could
get one of the CD player cassette adapters into the
8-track adapter?!?
