there are 3 ways. 

1. read a lot and work out all the systems in your head (this really
doesn't work all that well)

2. actually stumpled through fixing the same thing year ago (and
somehow seem to remember)

3. make up stuff that sounds good, but is not actually a fix :)

if you are kinda lost about the entire fix a bus thing the Muir book
is really a good place to get your feet wet. it's not very scary and
presents things as they are (fixable)
