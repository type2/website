"P.S.
Why is it that I never see any west coast camping get
togethers?  I
know for a fact that there are some bus oriented
camping groups here
in Oregon,.. dunno if they would accept the presence
of a lowly
standard non westy bus driver though.  I see meets and
cruises up in
Washington state, but nada in Oregon.  Go figure...
