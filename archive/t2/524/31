Subject: FS: 1971 Westy to good home!

I have find a new home for my westy! It's a great bus which is very close to
being complete on the restoration. Check out the pics at
http://velvet.ath.cx/vw/ 

Asking $3000 cash. I think it's a great deal and the bus is ready to drive! 

Things that it needs: 

Side window installed 

Exhaust to be remounted to fix leak and noise (very minor can drive as is
but the bus is louder than normal but then again VW's usually are) 

Eventually the engine will have to be dropped to fix a fume leak in the
filler neck. I just never fill the take much above 3/4 and it usually does
fine but this does need to be fixed eventually. 

It could use a new paint job but the current paint isn't bad. 

No rust except for some minor surface rust. (see pics) 

Email me at sdelic(-at-)sdelic.org if interested located in the southern part of
Dallas.
