Subject: Re: [T2] Removal of ignition lock?

Hi,
I looked at the situation. The 1977 has a plastic case around the 
steering wheel's base. It looks like maybe a Torx wrench or Allen 
wrench goes in there to undo something. Also, there are two mounting 
bolts that hold the assembly to the dash, not 4 from what I can see.

Anyone with more current information??

was on a '72,
so there might be some differences.

look underneath the ignition switch at the underside of the steering 
column.
there should be 4 screws that hold the steering column in its upright
position.

remove those 4 screws & pull the entire thing towards the driver's seat.
you'll see a push-button type mechanism & that is your steering lock. 
push
the button in to disengage the steering lock.

for safety, make sure the bus isn't going to roll or move during this
procedure!

good luck,
