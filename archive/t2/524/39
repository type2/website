Kurt,

Wondered about that<grin> as a speedo cable isn't that big a deal at all.

Accelerator cable is a different problem tho.  Metal accelerator cable
surrounded by a flexible plastic/metal "tube" surrounded further by a
hard metal guide tube.  The guide tube is welded in spots to the frame.
.  
The flexible cable and tube must be pulled
out of the second guide tube that runs the length of the bus.

Here is where the problems start...if that protective hard metal tube
has ever been crushed or bent, you will have a problem....you may have to
cut the guide tube to get everything out all the way and then reinstalled.

Do you *not* already have the replacement cable in hand?

Cheers, dave

I've looked in my Bently manual and can't seem to find anything.  Probably cause its such an easy thing to do, but those are usually the things that trip me up the most.
