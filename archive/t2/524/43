Subject: Tranny to engine bolt 78 engine

I was going camping this weekend and my tranny went bad about an hour out of
town.  73 bus with 78 2l engine., I am trying to use a spare tranny I had
(thinking it is also a 78) but the top tranny to engine bolt and the "D"
head starter bolt are too short.

Anybody know what size bolt is needed?  I have to get someone to take me to
the store as the bus is in pieces and I would like to call around to shop
instead of wasting people's time taking me around to stores that don't stock
what I need.  I know I will not find the correct starter bolt but I just
need something that will work.

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
