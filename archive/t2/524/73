Subject: Rubber Mats and the logic thereof

For awhile now I have been studying up on various methods of sound
and heat insulation options for my buses interiors.  I have seen bus
owners with experience and opinion discussing pros and cons of
various materials.

General consensus is that there are many materials that will provide
insulation for heat and sound, but fewer materials that 'should' be
used on the painted surface of the interior as they tend to trap
humidity and lead to rusting.

With this in mind I asked myself this question...
What was VW thinking when they decided to _glue_ rubber mats to the
paint under the forward seats on a standard passenger bus?

They allowed air to breathe everywhere else.  Panels allow air to
flow, even the large mats in the cab and passenger area allow air to
breathe with their celled structure on the underside of the mat
paired up with the already corrugated steel surface.

So why take the easy route and create a situation that will trap
moisture?  I don't get it.  Does anybody else?
