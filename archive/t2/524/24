Subject: Throttle sticking

Saturday is the day for bus repairs, right?  I
have a problem with the throttle sticking on my
70.  It does it when I hold it WOT.  The pedal
seems to move freely.  New Bocar 34 carb.  I
think someone mentioned that the springs weren't
strong enough for a bus.  Sound familiar?

Anyone care to give me quick heads up on how to
troubleshoot the problem?
