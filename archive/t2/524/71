Hi Snoopy,

I've done the opposite, installing a 73 tranny into the westfakia's 79 
body. The shift linkage came up about 5/8" short. This put first and 
third gear under the dashboard, which itself was only possible after 
the shift knob was removed. Third was still impossible to reach because 
the shifter ran into the emergency brake. I compensated for this by 
bending the shift lever.

My guess is that your linkage is now too long, and you can't get the 
lever back far enough to engage 2 and 4.

To run with the later transmission you are going to need to replace a 
linkage part with something shorter, or you can bend the shift lever.


Happy trails,
