Wow, 

First of all thanks for all of the encouragement and advice. Now that I
know how easy it is to drop the engine, and the fact that I have both
the Bentley and Muir manuals, I feel pretty confident about taking this
on. I just found an 1800 motor with the dellorto carbs, from the same
year of bus as mine. Should I be able to just bolt this up to my
existing tranny, or will it need some sort of adaptor plate?

Thanks,

Mark 

P.S. with the dual carbs I will be back in the happy land of one carb
per two cylinders.
