Hey Laura,

When did this rattling sound start?
did you die on the side of the road or did you make it home?
is the rattling sound coming from inside the engine?
when I broke a connecting rod on my last 72 it sounded
like a can being tossed around inside the engine.
can you turn the engine with a wrench with the van in neutral?
or is the engine siezed up?
the more info the better.

Darren
