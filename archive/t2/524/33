Subject: Re: [T2] lifting my type4

I'm not sure just what holes you're talking about but I'd be leery of
lifting an engine in a patently safe way.  (Safe for you and safe for the
engine.)  A long block can easily be lifted by two people so find a friend
that's willing to help (one of the best "tools" ever invented) and go that
route, if you can.  If you must use a block and tackle set up I'd try to
"sling" the engine somehow.   I've lifted a fully "dressed" engine with a
"come along" type hand winch with attachments to the ends of the engine
carrier and the lower case/transmission studs.  You might also try
"slinging" a sheet of plywood under the engine.
