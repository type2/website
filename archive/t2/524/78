Subject: no oil pressure on fresh rebuild

So, I cranked the car over for about 20 seconds without the plugs, and 
the oil light stayed on.  So I figured maybe it wasn't cranking enough 
to get pressure.  So then I hooked everything up, car started and still 
no light.  Turned off car immediately.  Checked oil level, perfect. 
Then I started it again and revved it a little too see if that would 
coax the pressure up and still no luck.  Then cranked (without spark or 
fuel) and still had the low-oil light.

Before I go and kill my new engine, I thought I'd check to see if anyone 
has some recommendations on things to check.  I did change out the 
pressure sensor with another known working one (from the engine I pulled 
out) so I know that's not the problem.  I understand that the oil has to 
"fill up" the empty engine, but I just want to check to see if anyone 
has any suggestions before I go and crank some more.

thanks!
Mike
