Hello Vincent,

I know what you mean. There are a many people on this
list who seem to know everything there is to know.
There are at least 1500 people subscribed on this
list. Chances are, if you are having a problem with
your bus there is at least one other person on the
list who has had to deal with that same problem even
if they know nothing else about a bus. Isn't having
the list great?! Take care and good luck with your
bus.

Regards,

The ever learning (usually the hard way) David Kelly
