Subject: looking for rheostat

On page Electrical System 16 of the bus Bentley manual, there is a
line drawing of a "Load regulating voltage test hook-up" (Fig. 6-2).
One of the devices is described as a "rheostat that can be loaded to 50 amps."

Would one of you electrical whizzes be so kind as to tell me where I could
obtain such a device?
