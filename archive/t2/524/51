Subject: Throwout bearing clip problems

Hello list members,

I recently completed a tranny rebuild on my 69 type 2. It was running great 
for about a month until I stopped at the store one day after a short drive. 
Upon returning to my Bus from the store, I found the starter wouldnt turn 
the engine.  I proceeded to try to compression start it, but the engine 
appeared seized. Just this weekend, I pulled the engine to diagnose the 
problem and found that the engine was fine (I hope). However, the clips that 
hold the throwout bearing in place had fallen off and were beaten to dust by 
the flywheel, except for a small piece that had been jamming the flywheel 
and thus causing it to appear seized.

I seek your expertise on 2 questions.

1. Because the clips were shredded, and my bell housing covered with metal 
shavings, should I worry that these shavings infiltrated the engine via the 
crank seal and thus I need to rebulid the whole engine, or can i just clean 
up the bell housing and feel comfortable that no particles have compromised 
the engine block?

2. How can i keep this from occuring again? I have had these clips fail on 
me twice now (this last time was the most disaterous) and I fear i may be 
doing something wrong on the install of these clips allowing/causing them to 
fall off.

Any help is much appreciated.

thanks,

John
