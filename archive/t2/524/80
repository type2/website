Laura,
Well, you can start off by checking your valves, just like you were 
going to adjust them.  If you find one that's waaaaay out of adjustment, 
you probably have a valve problem.  If you don't find anything wrong 
there, try a compression test, and that'll tell you which cylinder is 
the culprit.  I'd probably start with the valve because it's the least 
amount of potential "banging" that a compression test could do...
