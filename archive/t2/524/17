Subject: Re: [T2] How do you know all this

Or--Is my battery any good prior to ripping into the wiring, when the
Bus doesn't want to start.

Most all of any vehicle's problems can be solved with a common sense
approach.
  
BUT--there has to be some sort of mechanical aptitude that goes along
with the common sense--

My brother doesn't know he difference between a screw driver and a
hammer---
And because of this he has some road side problem's now and then--even
in his 2002 Chevy S-10 Blazer--
Thank God for cell phones and my help--

This is the kind of guy that would either become a victim of some
sheister garage, and some bad deal's in owning a Bus---or even a
Vanagon--

Ya have to like tools--and enjoy using them--and have some natural,
inbred knowledge of how things are supposed to work--
Then this Bus stuff is simple, and can be fun--(?)--:>)
