Subject: Tranny help

Ok after spending all day dropping engine and tranny on my 73, replacing
tranny with one from probably a 78, having to buy longer engine to tranny
bolts and starter bolt and a new starter.  Putting it all back together, she
started right up but won't shift into 2nd or 4th...  :(

Any ideas?  I am guessing I will have to at least drop the engine again, but
what then?

Thanks in advance for any assistance,
Snoopy
