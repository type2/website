Subject: I have pressure! - was Re: [T2] no oil pressure on fresh

Thanks for all of your input.  Pump primed, cranked some more, light 
turned off ;)

Ok, I now I gotta go creep the bus over to a parking lot and break in 
the engine for 20 mins.

After I do the 20 min run, I need to check the valves, right?  That 
means it needs to cool all the way down, huh?  solid valves..  yay ;)

thanks for your help!
