I was leaving though the Wurth catalog this morning and I noticed there is a

for painting road wheels. Can anyone confirm this?

I didn't see anyone reply to this, but I'm curious too, so I'll resurrect this
thread.

Could it be for the gray for the intake runners/heat risers for the type1
engines ??

I remember reading years ago that someone had found a decent match
(Krylon??)for the gray on the type1 engines, but I can't find a reference to it
in the archives. I *thought* it was a suggestion on Wolfburg West's webpage (or
one of the west coast shops), but after poking around, I couldn't find it.

I'll be dressing my engine (putting on the tin, etc) this week, and I'll be
cleaning up the FI system before reinstalling. I need to repaint the *gray* FI
intake runners, and I'm looking for paint that will match the original.
