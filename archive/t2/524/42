What dizzy to use??? Any suggestions? Karl?
 I have searched the archives to no avail. I am trying
 to build a not-so-stock engine settup for my 68 bus. I
 will be installing a factory new 1600cc DP engine with
 new 34/32 sdpit dual carbs. I need to know what type
 of ignition that I need to be looking at with this
 engine. What type of advance/retard curve should I be
 shooting for? What is the biggest factor in
 determining the advance curve? The weight of the
 vehicle? The gearing? The fuel system? I will be using
 the stock 4 speed manual transmission. Would I just
 use the 71 bus timing specs since this is a DP engine?
 This bus has been camperized and is a bit heaver than
 a standard bus No pop top but it does have a propane
 fridge and stove with a wood interior and bed. Would
 the distributor form a 72 standard bus work well on
 this bus seeing as the 72 bus used a very similar carb
 settup? Karl, any suggestions?

I would use a single vacuum dual advance distributor and set timing at 5 before. 
If you can find this one, it should work perfectly:

Beetle 1970 * 1600 Auto-Stick Trans 
Distributor: VW 113-905-205AD or AE, Bosch 0231 167 029 > 113 905 205AL, 0231 146 101
Can Use: VW 113-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 115 078
Vacuum Can: 07 138
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv; Centrifugal: 13-16deg (-at-) 2200rpm, 25-28deg (-at-) 3900rpm 

I would stay away from the dual vacuum unit ones unless you did not connect the retard.
