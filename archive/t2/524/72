Subject: Diagnosis...Murder!!! 

Does anyone know the order of diagnosing an engine problem.
Like how would you know if you burned a valve, or blew your transmission?
I've a 79 Westy FI automatic.
I tried taking it up to Yosemite. It was a hot day. I was downshifting on the 
hills. Lots of stress on the trans. and the engine.
Something broke.
There is a rattling noise when the engine turns over, and it does not start.
I'm not sure where to start trying to figure out what is wrong.
I suspect the head or the trans.
Would it help to do a compression check?
How do you figure out if a valve keeper or something on the head went bad?
What steps does one take to diagnose....Murder!!!!
I killed my bus!
