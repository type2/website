If your trying to determine if your charge system is working,, and the
system is still together and in the vehicle... here is an easy , roadside
test you can do with little to no tools.

quick and easy, when your in a tight spot, not the best

If you "full field" the alternator, it will put out as much as it can......
10 seconds duration here is usually plenty,

You need a jumper wire to go from the B+ battery positive post to the
regulator Df wire, which should be green.

Start the engine, connect the jumper to the B+ then the Df <note#1>
As soon as you connect the jumper wire, you should hear the engine RPM
drop off,,, this means the alternator is charging and pulling horsepower
from the engine to make that electricity.
Alternator and connections are working.  Suspect regulator.
If the engine RPM doesn't drop.. don't assume the alternator is bad,,
there is still the ground circuit and B+ circuit and the green wire at the
alternator to check.


Slightly better way to check charging system

Visual/touch
Inspect all connections by taking them apart, cleaning and reconnecting.
<note#2>
effected connections are, battery + / - ,both ends of cables, trans ground
strap, B+ wire on starter stud, 4 wires at the regulator plug
red,green,brown,blue,  same wires at the alt plug, B+ at the alt.
Do not over look the ground circuit. I recommend adding a ground strap
from the body to the engine.
Also, the dash light must be working.

Charge the battery

Check the battery voltage with a meter.  it should be around 13.5 volts

Test for "leaks" by connecting the battery positive cable, then placing a
test lamp between the battery negative and the body ground.  If you get
the lamp to light, you have a drain...

connect the ground strap

Test the battery
disconnect the ignition coil, place a voltmeter on_the_battery_posts, not
the cable terminals
have someone turn the key to engage the starter for a few revolutions
while you watch the voltmeter
It should not drop below 10 volts in about 30 seconds

Start the engine, connect the jumper to the B+ then the Df as above test
described

Now you should have a good idea what is wrong.... connections,, regulator,
alternator.....
remove and replace with a know good one.


Remember,, NEW doesn't mean it is known good or a guarantee that is works.


note #1
whenever a charging system is acting up,, and other times as well,,
explosive gases from the battery can be triggered to explode the battery
with a tiny spark.
Always make your last connection as far away from the battery as possible.

Note #2
disconnect the battery ground connection FIRST,, and reconnect it LAST.
