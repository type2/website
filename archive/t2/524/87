Easy.  Take some thin safety wire (stainless is best) and run it through
the loop in one clip, around the groove in the throwout bearing, through
the other loop and then back to the first clip through the groove.  Twist
the wire together.  It will prevent the clip from backing out of its hole.

Also, make sure that the throwout fork isn't worn where the throwout
bearing pivots on it.  This can cause headaches too.  If it is too worn,
replace the throwout shaft.  I have welded these up, but the new shafts
are relatively inexpensive.  Be sure to get the bus shaft!
