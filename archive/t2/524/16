Try <<  www.motorbooks.com  >> for an overview of some basic books
on auto systems...Luckily, air cooled VW's just touched the electronics
revolution in auto technology (FI...), so almost all the systems are mech-
canical and accessable to eyeballing...Once you break down the vehicle
to separate systems, the diagnoses and repair becomes "logical" in the
customary sense...Use a pyramid scheme to ferret out problems...
Start with the easiest (Do you really have gas?), before rebuilding the
carb... ;-)
