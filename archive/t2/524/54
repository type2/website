Thanks everyone,

I will look for these new clips.

Any thoughts on the possibility of the metal shavings sneaking past the 
flywheel seal and getting into the engine? I drained the oil and there did 
not appear to be an unusual amount of grit on the oil drain plate.
Im trying to be optimistic and figure that the seal is good or the dust from 
clutch wear could get into the engine as well. Its just that I'd hate to put 
it back together only to have it seize for real a few miles later.

Thanks again,

John
