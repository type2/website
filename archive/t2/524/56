"Never say 'never'" but the odds are very strongly against anything having
entered the crankcase and oil.  I would certainly do what you have done
and reinstall the engine without worrying.

On your throwout bearing...  since this has happened multiple times....
Have you checked the fork?  If the throwout fork is bent or cracked it can
allow this to happen.  Lay a straight edge across the bell housing and
measure the distance to the fork on each arm.  It is far better to use a
dial indicator, but even a steel rule is better than nothing.  The
distance from the straight edge to each of the arms on the fork MUST be
identical.  Also look for cracks on the weld where the arms attach to the
shaft.

                             OOK!
