Hello Joel,

This is just a thought. Have you tried swaping the
distributor for a known good one? Possibly an old 009
that you may have lying around? Your distributor may
have other issues not related to the condenser and
points. Try swaping it out and give it a test drive. I
am having a similar problem with my bus and I think
this may be my problem.

Good Luck!

Regards,
David Kelly
