Subject: RE: [T2] some questions from a beginner

Hi Andrew,

I have some information to offer in answer to your questions:

>-i need a dependable daily driver capable of sustained 70mph speeds - i 
>understand there are dual >carb options and special transmisions...where, 
>how, what?

A dependable daily driver can be found in the Bus world.  However, you need 
to do all maintenance yourself or find a good air-cooled VW mechanic.  You 
can buy a cheap Bus and replace/rebuild the engine, or you can buy a more 
expensive Bus that has the engine redone.  To run a 70 all day long, you 
will need a Bus with something other than the original engine.  More power, 
bigger displacement, better breathing, and better cooling are all required 
to accomplish this -- VW designed the Transporter to run around 60-65 for 
long periods of time.

>-i need heat and possibly a/c. - are there kits for this?

The best source of heat is a gasoline heater.  They are available as rebuilt 
original or aftermarket.  A/C is also available, but the compressor robs HP 
and will shorten your engine's life.

>-i understand that sway bars are a good idea - anything particular i am 
>looking for in a good sway >bar?

Sway bars are available, and they will improve handling.  Better tires, 
better shocks, and the understanding that you're driving a tall & narrow 
box-on-wheels will also improve handling.

>-if the mpg is less than 25mpg what can i do to improve this?

Bus engines get 15-20mpg, depending on how well they're running.  Not much 
can be done to improve, save for putting in a different engine.

>-about how much time a month am i looking at to keep it in daily driver and 
>highway speed shape?
>will i need any specialized tools?

I drive my Bus wherever I can, including on long road trips at 65-70mph.  I 
keep it tuned up, oil changed, tire pressure good, running gear good.  As 
payment for go-anywhere, do-anything performance, I spend the equivalent of 
1 full weekend just about every month.  Of course, my Bus has 145,000 miles 
on it, and I'm still replacing original parts as they wear or fail.  The 
best tools you can get are John Muir's "Idiot Book" and Bentley Publishing's 
repair manual.  In addition, a good set of metric sockets and open-end 
wrenches will help.

>-how safe is a bus in accident situation? rollover?

In a VW Bus, you are in the crumple zone if you're in a serious accident.  
You are sitting above the front wheels, and you have no engine in front of 
you.  I've seen pictures of Buses with the fronts caved in after an 
encounter with a deer or cow.  If you're going slowly and you hit something 
with the bumper, you probably won't be injured.  The Bus was built before 
the advent of serious safety measures, and I would not want to be involved 
in any rollover.

>-relatively how expensive is it to purchase parts for a bus '68 or up?

Small parts can be had for cheap, junkyard parts can be had for cheap as 
well.  New parts can cost a lot -- $150 for a new steering box up to $4,000 
for a new 2.2L powerplant.  Check out these sites for examples:

www.busdepot.com
www.bus-boys.com
www.thesamba.com

If any of the above answers to your questions does not sound like something 
you wanted to hear, perhaps a Bus is not for you.  However, if you're 
curious about exploring a different way of owning and driving a car, and you 
would enjoy becoming part of a unique community of people, then keep 
following this List, keep researching Buses, and keep looking for your own 
future Bus!

Good Luck!
