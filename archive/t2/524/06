Subject: speedo cable

Hey Y'All
 
Maybe someone could give me some advice.  I'm going to replace my speedo cable today in my 72 Westy as a preventitive measure and I've never done that before.  I'm kinda thinking that I can cut off the old one at the end by the accelerator pedal then use it to "fish" the new one through.  What do you think?
 
Thanks
