Too true. Most shops will say, "Yeah, fine, we can do it." But reality is, 
none of them have VW specific skills/experience.

This will fix the vehicle not more than half the time. It typically then 
becomes multiple parts replacement. Actual diagnosis, pin by pin, device by 
device, is outside the knowledge of the great majority.

My system with all the software and cable sets for all the current 
German/Swedish cars cost $7000. But my system doesn't just read codes. I 
can monitor dozens of real time parameters and individually activate most 
circuits to find the faults.

It isn't going to happen. In another 20 years, the inventory of parts for 
current production will be 3 or 5 times the number of current inventories. 
I can't image, at that point, that you will be able to find knowledgeable 
mechanics or part supplies. Use them up and throw them away is the current 
production MO.

Me too.
