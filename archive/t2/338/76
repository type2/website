??? OK I solved that problem by removing ALL of the heater boxes and using
bare pipes...moving air from driving will keep it cooler than the air flow
thru the heater boxes, and because the heater fan duct is sealed that
means more air for cooling..  I have temp guages and haven't noticed any
difference

I also have changed my 78 to the early 72-74 exhaust system too so there
is less piping to get hot
