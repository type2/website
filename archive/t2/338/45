Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel problem

If you run around town on empty any debris in the tank will be more likely to 
reach the strainers and filters causing fuel starvation.
If you run it full you will have less problems.
You should fill it up and calculate the mileage you are getting.
Was the sender showing the tank as empty when you ran "out of gas"?
Maybe you put in $5 not 5 Gal. and the way the fuel prices have been going up 
lately that would get you about 2.5 Gal. LOL :)
Good luck.
