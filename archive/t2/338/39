Sure sounds like when my AFM went south.

I believe so.

I bought a rebuild one from BD about 1/2 year ago. It didn't fix my
problems, actually made them much worse. BUT...after talking to BD &
then directly with their vendor it turns out I got a small batch of
AFM's that they said were calibrated on a bad test bench. I got
another a few days later & all the problems were gone.

Where in TN are you?
