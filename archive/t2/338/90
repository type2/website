Subject: Steve Dolan Sighting

>There's been mention on the list lately that
Steve Dolan hasn't been posting much of late.
Well, I caught sight of him this weekend 

I think protocol requires that you specify
whether you saw the anterior or posterior (or
both) of Steve.  Anterior sightings are far more
common.  Many of us have only seen his posterior
protruding from some happy moonie's bus.  

Like all things vintage VW, NOS anterior Dolan
sightings are very valuable and expected to
continue appreciating in value.
