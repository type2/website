At one point when I was driving in Folsom, I saw a huge caravan of VWs, 
and ended up making an illegal turn to follow them. They went up to 
Folsom Damn, and parked for awhile. I was told that it is a fairly 
regular thing on Saturday nights. They meet at a parking lot for some 
fast food place (I think Wendy's or DQ) at Antelope and 80, and then 
drive around for awhile. I have never seen them again, but I have not 
gone over there at the right time. I think they where meeting at 6:00, 
but that may have changed, or I may have forgotten.
