Subject: mini spare tire from an Audi

I saw in the archive that someone asked about using a mini spare tire from an 
Audi.  I picked one up from the junkyard last week.  The bolt pattern works, 
but the hole for the center hub has to be enlarged.  I used a cutting wheel 
and a half round file to make it the hole bigger.  I then mounted the wheel 
and checked for runout.

The rim offset is a little more to the inside, but it shouldn't matter.  The 
tire itself is about 1 inch small in diameter and the whole wheel weighs 
about half of a regular wheel.  I did it because I always use quality tires 
and I've never had a flat.  No sense lugging around all that weight if I 
don't have to.  The tire fits on the nose of my bus and is flush with the 
front edge of the bumper.
