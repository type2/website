talking about a type IV engine, how is the heater box part of the cooling
system, no air gets to the heater boxes until AFTER it is finished cooling
the engine. 
  just make sure the little piece of tin under the cyl but above the push
rod tubes stays on....been running mine without heater boxes for about 6
years and I have temp guages and it is the same as it was before, no
changes

YMMV
