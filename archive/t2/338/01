Yeah, well, what do expect, considering the source. Sometimes I really
wonder why someone would bother putting words down if they have nothing
helpful to say, or worse, use it as an opportunity to belittle another
member of our group. It pisses me off.

Jeff, you have every right to to be concerned about availability of quality
crankcases. I have seen, in three years of looking, exactly two NEW type IV
crankcases. Someone in my area had a bunch from when VW of Canada closed
their remanufacturing plant here, but those are all gone I think.

There are very few shops in the country who can line bore a type IV case
properly. The primitive boring bars used by most type I shops will not work
even though some shops will try! (as you found out the hard way)

Secondly, main bearings which are oversize on the case are nearly impossible
to source. I would expect the bearing manufacturers to address this in the
near future, as it is surely a world-wide scenario.

The notion that type IV cases don't distort because they are aluminum is a
myth. Or ancient history, at least. The aluminum material IS stronger than
mag, and resists main bearing saddle distortion better than a type I case,
but as you say, these crankcases are getting long in the tooth and most are
now in need of line boring.

It can be frustrating to find people who make their living with this stuff
and don't seem to care. You may need some new suppliers. Aircooled.net is an
awesome source for anything to do with your engine, they sell only the best
quality parts and have fabulous customer service. The principal of that
company is an enthusiast who cares about what he sells.

Good shops are out there, but their prices are out of reach for many people
for a complete engine. There are very few excellent machine shops. RIMCO for
general machine work and headflow masters for cylinder heads. Others have
used NW connecting rod, but I have experience with them.
