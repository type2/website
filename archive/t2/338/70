EXACTLY. The ones that do good work I cannot afford. I can spend alot of 
time though checking and rechecking my own work for "free".

As for the cost and durability questions for Type I vs. Type IV - if folks 
don't like the Type IV engines then do what feels right and send me your 
spare Type IV engines. I've got 4 right now and wouldn't mind have another 
2 or 3. So far I figure I've got enough to get past the 750K mile mark on 
my VW so I think I'm set so I don't worry about spare part availability. <grin>
