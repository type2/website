Subject: 78 Fuel Injection Air Flow Meter question

Greetings all,
      I have a bus that's been sitting about half a year now with the
following symptoms: I can get it to start after much coaxing and it will
actually idle all day long. When I try to drive more than five meters
(yes, meters) or put any strain on the engine at all, it bogs down and
dies. I've verified that timing is dead on, compression is good, and no
vacuum leaks exist. About five months ago I replaced the fuel pump with
a brand new Bosch unit, but the problem didn't change. I've also cleaned
the gas tank, and changed filters three times.
     So today I finally get the old Bentley out again, and start testing
componets one-by-one. It appears that the temperature sensor in the air
flow meter is dead. It reads no resistance at any temperature. All other
Fuel Injection componets test out okay.
     My two questions are as follows. Would such a failure cause my
symptoms? Second, if it's agreed that this is the cause, I've done some
searching about replacement units. Most places sell a remanufactured
unit for around $150, including my local FLAPS (which is a "Beck" world
part. Busdepot also sells them for this price. Considering a new one is
$300, and the original lasted 25 years, I'm willing to pay the extra
cash to have peace of mind. But does anybody have any experience with
the rebuilts? Are they just a good?

Thanks in advance, and happy bussing (soon warm spring days will return
here in Tennessee!),
John Tracy
