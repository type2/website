Contact a freight consolidation company that has a facility at an airport
terminal you can drive to. It takes longer this way, but you can save a lot
of money. You must have someone on the other end who is able and willing to
take the goods direct to their airport-area terminal. These are usually
located near, but not at, the airport.
