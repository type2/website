Subject: 68-69 REAR Brake  drums

VW Friends,
       I am rebuilding my 1968 Single Cab.  I have a 1969 Westy as a parts 
bus. Here is my question....The rear drums on the 68 SC are 211 501 615F. The 
drums on the 69 are 211 501 615G. These drums have a different design and 
diameter. Any suggests on which ones I should use?  The drums from the 69 
have a smaller diameter. 
       Thanks for any help.
