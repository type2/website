Subject: Hi all.

Ok, i guess im the new guy.  

i have a 68 Sundial conversion.  just got it, havent even seen it
yet.  my brother is a master mechanic and vw nut, he is fixing it up
to make the run from CA to MD.

he and i need to find some parts for it.  can anyone recomend
someplace?  im in the east so, web and/or mail order would be best.

im specifically looking for:

sliding door handle
turn signal assembly
ignition set up w/ keys

Thanks in advance.

david.
