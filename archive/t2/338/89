Chris,

Be careful recommending this solution, as the threads are not the right size
on a grease gun hose unless the case has been modified from stock.

Grease gun hose should be 1/8-27 and the oil pressure switch hole in the
crankcase is m10 x 1.0. It is possible to screw these two types of threads
together, but some damage will occur to one or both parts, as the threads
are slightly different in size and pitch.
