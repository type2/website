Interesting difference in philosophies here.  I run quality tires too
(Bridgestone 603s) and I always carry _two_ full size spares while on road
trips.  The reason is that I have had two flats on the same day and ended
up having to buy an "odd" tire when I couldn't find a match for the tires
I had.  Of course, I go off the beaten urban path and sometimes a long
way from pavement where a second spare is pretty much standard equipment
for everyone.
