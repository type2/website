Hi Jennifer,

Sam Dwiggens of Alternative Import (615.292.2401) is the man.  I've been 
using him for about 2 years on my VWs and he is excellent and best of all 
CHEAP!!!! He's great on both the aircooled and watercooled stuff.

Actually his brother does the engine work and he's great.

Tell him Daniel refered you, i could use the brownie points.
