Roberto,

Fuel starvation...did you really run diesel/fuel mix when things were bad 
there?

Something in the tank blocking the gas pick up tube?  
Did you pull the float valve out of the carb when cleaning?
This once happened to me and it was a piece of rubber from the
hose floating around in the float bowl.  Every once in awhile
if would cover the main jet and die....suction went away, and then
I could drive it again for awhile.

Cheers, dave
