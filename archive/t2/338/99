Thanks, Richard.  I've got one of these, but this particular one is about
6-7 inches long, mounted vertically, to the front of the battery
compartment, just to the right of the arm that use to hold the FI stuff (?).

Looks as if it has at least 15 to 30 (can't see both sides of the slot in
it) contacts, and seems to have a socket at the bottom to hold one end of a
connector, and a clip thing at the top to secure it.

I've seen one of these things somewhere years ago, but it may have been in
my first bus, about 20+ years ago.

Any ideas?
