Subject: Re: [T2] no heater boxes? safe?

Depending on the year of your engine (or heater system rather) it is part 
of the cooling system. If it is a Beetle powered bus the cooling system 
relies on the flappers in front of the heater boxes to limited cooling air 
flow through the boxes in hot weather - leaving more cooling air for the 
engine. If there was a big leak / hole in the box then you are loosing 
cooling air.

If you have a late baywindow some cooling air is always flowing through the 
heater box and it gets dumped outside through the flapper or sent up front 
to the cabin depending on how cold natured you and your passengers are.

The hot weather air flow is to keep the heater box and thus the head a bit 
cooler so basically you could be causing the heads to be a bit hotter.

FWIW.
