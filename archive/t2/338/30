  I personally removed the heater boxes and blocked off the fan 
discharge ports - this forces the all the air over the top of the engine 
for maximum cooling.  I used some sheet stainless, aluminum rivets and 
high temp (500+ "the red stuff") silicone to do the job.  I saw some pre 
made "plugs" for the heater box opening in the Rocky Mountain Motor 
works catalog.  I think it was them, but after you take the boxes off 
you will see the discharge ports and making your own covers is an easy task.

Best of luck,
