Subject: 72 WITH WEBBER CARB

Hi people,

I read a question with regards to fuel consumption.
I have a 72 van with a single webber carb. It seems to use quite abit of gas.
does anyone know what may be causing this carburator to eat all the gas.
Could it possibly be an intake leak (vacuum leak?)
While I'm on this subject is there someone with a single webber carb
that can help me find out where the air / fuel mixture screw is? and
help me find out more about this carb?

Thanks everyone,
Darren
