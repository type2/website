I can't speak for everyone but my engine case has 1/8 NPT (pipe thread) threads for the oil pressure sender.  This is a '72 case.  My VDO extension hose threads right in and gets tight just like it should.  Before this engine, I used this same hose in my original '73 case and it also worked as advertised.  When the VDO hose failed at one end, I cut the bad section off and replaced it with 1/8" NPT fitting with a barb on the end.

I've heard more than one person say that this thread is M10, so I'm not sure what is going on here.  The prudent thing to do would be to measure your old sender to determine what the actual thread is.  If you have a vernier caliper, use it.  Check the threads for taper (indicating pipe thread).  Mine are tapered.  If they weren't, I would have been in a world of trouble two years ago, when on the way to Busses Nowhere Near the Arch my VDO extension hose sprung a leak (it was 12 years old, looked fine but the rubber was weakened at the base from the heat of the motor over time).  I was able to repair the damage and proceed on the trip because I found the aforementioned NPT fittings at an Autozone that was within limping distance.  If it had been a M10 thread, I would have been screwed (ha ha, I can laugh about it now).
