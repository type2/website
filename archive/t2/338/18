Subject: Re: [T2] no heater boxes? safe?

Get a new mechanic. The heater boxes are part of the heating system. Not the 
cooling system. Busses run fine without heater boxes, as several folks on the 
list will point out. If, on the other hand, your exhaust system has a hole in 
it, and it in turn is leaking into the heater box, you've got a problem with 
gassing yourself.

Does this make sense to anyone out there?<
