Hi Volks,

I said the same thing about fuel leaks, but Susan mentioned in an 
off-list post that her bus is difficult to get into first gear, so 
she's been taking off in second. She also said that there have been no 
leaks detected.

This suggests a slipping or badly adjusted clutch, which would also 
account for poor gas milage.

Just goes to show you there's often more than one possible solution to 
a problem.

Susan, have the clutch cable adjustment checked ASAP, and be prepared 
to replace the clutch if required.

Happy trails,
