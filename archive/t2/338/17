Subject: 75-78 exhaust set up for sale.

This is the best set of these i have ever seen.

The flanges are perfect, not rusted out.  I had a customer this past week
month me to put on 72-74 boxes that he had which i did...............

The pipes that bolt to the heads are not included.

The C shaped pipe that connects to that pipe, the heat exchangers, muffler,
and tailpipe. ( The muffler and tailpipe are some sort of unit i had not
seen before)

  None of these parts have any holes, and are in perfect shape..They came
off an Arizona based bus.......................


I can send pics and pricing info to those that are interested.  P Mail.
