Subject: Engine stall erraticaly

Hello Volks
I had a problem with my bus 1977 1600cc upright engine H30/31 pic solex
carburetor and mechanical fuel pump.
I was driving on highway and after reach the 60mph the engine stall, I reduce
the speed and the engine runs ok, a few miles later the same problem, finally
up hills the engine almost die and recovery for a while stall badly again and
recovery.
When I arrive home the engine start but die immediately (the fuel pump I
thought) but when I checked, it was pumping, so I took out the carb and clean
everything and the bus runs smooth, I drove out for a few miles and everything
was ok.
This morning after a short ride the engine stall again up hills but runs in
idle whit no problems on a level surface.
Any clue ?

Thanks from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela

Roberto
