Subject: how do I access horn button

We just bought our first VW camper van (1983 air cooled)!  I drove it home 
and tried to blow the horn to let my wife know our new home-away-from-home 
was home.  The horn blew once, but never again.  I was able to get the 
steering column cover off, but cannot figure out how to get to the 
internals of the horn button.   Unlike in the Bentley manual that came with 
the van (original factory repair manual) the horn button goes clear across 
the diameter of the steering wheel.  Does anyone have advice on how to 
remove the horn button cover or know of other things I should look at?

I can't wait to get through the state inspection process and go 
camping!  Any advice would be much appreciated.

Marc
