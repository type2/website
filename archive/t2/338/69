Yes - just test the wiring where it come back into the engine compartment 
on it's way to the lights. Also don't test with the engine running, just 
key on.

Your safe. Block the wheels and put the E-brake on. If you want put a 
trusted friend in the cab with their foot on the brake and to be extra safe 
remove the wire from the coil to the dist.

Of course the torsion bars could break and the suspension could collapse 
dropping the bus on you. <grin>
