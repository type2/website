Subject: mini spare tire from an Audi

Neal,
I would be hesitant to use a smaller diameter wheel. Especially on the rear,
the different rotation speed will make your diff. do a lot of work it was
never designed to do. It can do damage to the diff. if used for a long trip
or at high speeds.
Also here in Australia it is illegal to drive with different diameter tyres
left to right on the same axle.
Is it possible to mount a tyre on that rim that is the same diameter as
original?
