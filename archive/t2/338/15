Subject: Re: [T2] no heater boxes? safe?

Hi Friends-
Our when our local VW mechanic inspected our bus, he told us that we had a
good-sized hole in the heater box. He said that this needed to be fixed
soon, and the bus definitely couldn't run without the heater box as it is
part of the cooling system, and this could damage the engine.
Does this make sense to anyone out there?
Thanks,
Matthew
