VDO makes a dual sensor for this application. One connection goes to
your regular idiot light for low oil pressure. the other to your vdo
gauge for oil pressure. This will allow one point of connection for
both of these. 

There are basically 2 types (hehe get it type 2) of methods to hook
this sensor up. One is to use an extention to move the sensor out of
the area the stock one mounts & mount it near. The other is to cut
away some of the sheet metal around the sensor area. this allows the
sensor to screw down in the same NPT hole that the stock sensor does.
I have done this & it works great. The only thing I haven't found is a
gasket of some sort to completely seal this area. I have some pics
around here someplace of what it looks like installed, but can't find
them right now.
