Terry,

Just an update.  Tried to buy the SEM Rust Shield at the local 
autobody/paint supplier and while they have SEM products, they couldn't
seem to get the Supplier to recognize the number that I gave them from the
SEM site.

Any hints?

I really want to try this stuff out since you think highly of it.

BTW, pmailed you about it and never heard back.

Cheers, dave
