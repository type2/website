Subject: Sandblasting and SVDA

 A good portion of the roof of my bus has surface rust. I was thinking that
sand or some kind of media blasting would be easier than sanding. What types
of media other than sand would work? Would I then need to use some type of
rust primer like POR 15?
 On another note, thanks to everyone who encouraged me to switch my 009
dizzy out to the SVDA. What a difference! Thanks Aircooled.net for the good
service. When I pulled my 009 I found that the PO had not put an O-ring on
it. I don't know what effect that was having. I had forgotten to order an
O-ring with my SVDA, but, I was in Shreveport over the holiday and got one
from an EMPI store there called Action Import Motors. One little thing that
I learned, I had to put the clamp on before the O-ring. Thanks.
