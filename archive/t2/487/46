I should have said that the bus is not running and hasn't been registered for
4 or 5 years.  I do have the title, but it's not in my name.  I bought the bus
last year from a local shop, I had high hopes to fix it up, but I just don't
have the time and place to work on it.  Bit off more than I could chew.
thanks
Peter
