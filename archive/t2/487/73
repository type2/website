I know I've got some accumulated silica already even using safety
equipment.

Not at all.....I use a mask no matter what I'm doing.....dust, vapor,
various kinds for various purposes.  What I'm saying is that safety
equipment limits exposure but doesn't eliminate it.

What the mask won't help with is the silica media that gets scattered
around my driveway and property...a quarter acre or so in an older 
development of houses (tracked into the house, kicked up when I mow the
lawn or dig in the flower beds).  Sometimes I feel its worth it to use
a less effective process depending on other potential issues.

An organic media will simply degrade...if it
blows around its less of a hazard.  Sure the silica media will wash/blow
away eventually but stuff tends to hang around the area it was used
for a while.

Thanks...I thought that's what you meant.
