Guess I just don't give the Bus enough credit! I've gotta get the new
steering components installed so I can really see what she's made of.
Right now, I don't drive it that much, and when I do, I don't ever go
above 50 miles an hour. I had to replace the steering dampener. With the
old one, the wheels would wiggle back and forth like crazy. I KNOW the
tie rods are COMPLETELY shot, and the balance and alignment is also
totally off. At least with the new dampener, it's driveable to the local
car show.
