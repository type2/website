Subject: window rust removal

Evening all; 

In the midst of replacing some of the rubber on my 74 Westfalia. Got the
rear hatch seal done no problem - the Dremel wire wheel + a couple of
touch-ups of Rust Killer primer did the trick nicely, I think. The rubber
from OEVeedub fit perfectly. 

Working on the rear hatch window right now. I spent a frustrating hour or
so cutting the seal away to remove the window, as per a couple of posts on
the archives. Unless there's a mysterious way to cut the seal that I
didn't know about, I found it fairly difficult. Of course, it's -4 degrees
C or so, and the seal is old and brittle, but it took me a long time to
get the window out. And I left at least two nice knife gouges in the paint
on the rear hatch for posterity's sake... ;) The knife slips when you've
got woolen gloves on. 

Anyway, as expected, there were a few spots of rust underneath the seal -
worst on the two lower corners. I have stripped off all the rust that the
Dremel wire wheel will remove, and it's bare grey metal where it used to
be rust, BUT it's not SMOOTH at all. Do I need to worry  about sanding it
smooth, etc., or is it ok to just coat over the bumpy bare metal with the
Rust Killer and then install the new seal? I'm hoping I don't have to get
every lump smooth again...that'll take a bit of grinding and leave more
gouges, to be sure. 

Thanks for the advice;
