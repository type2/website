Subject: Automatic with type 1 motor

Hi Folks,
This is an odd question.  I know there is tin to put in a type 1 engine 
into a late bus.  Is it possible to mate an automatic transmission to the 
type 1?  I understand a 1600 is underpowered, but I have a torque monster 
1904cc in my '71 now. Thanks.

Joy Thru Air,
