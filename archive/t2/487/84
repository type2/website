Take a VOM and turn it to low DC voltage checking. Check for 12V between
these terminals and the body of the bus:

terminal X on the ignition switch;

terminal X on the headlight switch;

terminal 56 on the headlight switch;

terminal 56 on the dimmer relay;

terminals 56a and 56b of the dimmer relay;

both ends of all terminals on your fuse box.  The most important
fuses/terminals here are the headlight fuses of course.  They will have a
solid white and solid yellow wire coming from the dimmer relay and will
have white and white with a black trace and yellow and yellow with a black
trace wires leading to the headlight plugs.  If you can find these fuses
you can limit your check to them;

the terminals containing the white and yellow wires in the plug at back of
the headlight bulbs.

Once you are sure that you have power to the bulbs then check that you
have ground from the bulb to the body of the bus. Switch the VOM from DC
volts to resistance (low range). In the headlight plug there will be a
brown wire.  This should have no resistance to the body of the bus.

Lastly check the bulb. There should be a small amount of resistance
between the terminal that the brown wire connected to and each of the
other two terminals.

                             OOK!
