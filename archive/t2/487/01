This wouldn't happen to be the I-81 that connects Virginia / DC Metro
area to the outskirts of West Virginia, would it?

I drove to West Virginia taking that road, from I-95 (up from Florida).
Grandparents own a cabin out in the middle of literally no where. I took
a 2002 Crown Vic through those roads and I must say, I don't know if a
Transporter can handle those mountain roads without blowing up the
engine! Maybe I'm just not schooled enough in the temperature changes and
hot spots of a VW Flat-4, but it seems about half the time, both ways,
the automatic kept down-shifting, I had to brake constantly... it would
be a road better suited for a Pontiac Fiero, or a Porsche or something.
