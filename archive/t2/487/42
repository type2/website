Subject: '78 westfalia

I currently don't have anywhere to work on my '78 westfalia, and would let it
go to anyone on the list for $400.00.  The bus is complete and needs a fuel
pump and some tlc.  I have an extra fuel pump that will go with it.  I also
have some misc. engine parts for sale if interested.  All of my engine parts
are for a '78 hydraulic type 4.  The bus is green, and the body is in really
good condition for the amount of time that it's been sitting.  Anyone
interested let me know.  I'm in Salt Lake City.  If you want it, you have to
come get it.
