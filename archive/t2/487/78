I agree- I posted to the list re having entire roof and front and
rockers done by pro-for the time it saved my fingers it was well worth
the 2 hrs of blasting.  He used a fine sand but was very careful as to
the angle the gun is held- BTW, sand does not hurt the rubber, but
restores it to a beautiful black!
