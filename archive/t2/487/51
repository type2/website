First, I am not a body man.  I am a mechanic.  That having been said,
careless sandblasting with silica-based media can deform sheet metal.

"Brown lung" (attained in cotton mills) is no better or worse than "black
lung" (attained in coal mines).  Your lungs are not designed to handle any
fibrous material or dust in large quantities for long periods of time.

In my ignorant opinion it would be best to use synthetic media to
sand-blast sheet metal.  Second best would be "organic media" (walnut
shells, etc.). Last would be abrasive grit.  The reasoning I use is that
the synthetic media has the lowest mass and is the least likely to distort
body panels.

I would very definitely use an approved breathing apparatus while using
any media.

                             OOK!
