FWIW, I have M-B 14's on my 79...Modifications needed are to hog out the
bolt holes by 1/16 to fit the VW studs (the M-B uses wheel bolts ala VW
wide five's) and I used a ball grinder to dish the steel insert to fit the VW
acorn nuts. The lug nuts "just" cover the stud threads so longer studs if
available would be better, but mine have been on for thousands of miles
and show no signs of loosening between checks. On the 79 the rear drums 
have a 10 mm bolt to locate them and I put a small relief in the back of the
rear wheels to clear it (a little paint mark on the front of the wheel makes
r an' r easier). 1/2 inch black PVC pipe caps make neat nut covers and cost
about five cents at the plumbing supply house...
I don't know if the M-B 16's are the same except for the extra two inches in 
diameter...The only problem might be in retaining the outside diameter of
the tires...Going up two inches in the wheel means going down two in the
sidewall height...Low profile tires are fine for a performance car with a com-
pliant suspension...I dunno how that would affect the VW ride...Remember,
it's your arse sittin' right atop the front wheels...If the ride is too harsh,
you'll know it right quick... ;-(
