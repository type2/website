  73 Westy...
  the electrical inlet on the driver side sticks out from the body with a
plate around it..
  should the inlet and plate be body color? white?
  what was stock?
  I'm taking her in for paint Monday and want to make sure they know what to
paint what colors for the dual color bus.
  thanks!
