Probably shouldn't say anything yet until the birth...but, I'm knee-deep
in doing this to my 78 Westy right now.  Got a Legacy for $600 bux and
gutted it for what I need.  Really looking forward to having A/C and
cruise!  Went the Kennedy Engineered Products route and am very pleased
with their workmanship and customer service.  Go here and search the
library for the engine conversion article "2.2 Subaru Engine in 1984 VW
Westfalia" for a good start on the road.

For the purists, don't worry I won't do anything this radical to my 62
or my 67 21-window!  They are each getting the love and attention they
deserve.  It's a long story that I plan to document, probably next
summer.  But the short story is, Sits 15" over stock (9" custom body
lift, 6" from the tires), running 33" BFG A/T's needs more hp than the
T4 can deliver (at least that I can afford to make it deliver!)

I am posting this question for my brother-in-law, who has an 81 Vanagon
Westy.  He want to replace the original engine with a Subaru engine, and
wants some feedback on the pros and cons of this.  Thanks!
