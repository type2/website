I use and carry Bloxygen in the individual aerosol cans.  It works well for
any liquid that you need to prevent oxygen contact.  A couple of shots in
the bottle or can, seal, and it should be good to go.  Though I haven't used
it specifically for POR-15 products.

I'm having connection problems, and have redirected my cfnson.com email
through my BellSouth account.  Here's hoping that it works...

We're getting geared back up after our power woes.  If you have an order
pending, it's in the works.  The heater levers are in production and will be
going out before Christmas.  I'm really sorry for the missed show, Dave.
