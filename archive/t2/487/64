Subject: sway bar set-up needed

I want to add front and rear sway bars (7/8" or 1") to my 1971 VW Westfalia.

Can anyone recommend a good set that:

1. has a close tight to the body fit, and not generic. I already have a rear 
ADDCO bar and it sucks !
2. Sway-a-way used to be good, but I haven't seen a set of them mounted. 
Again, I want tight and close to the body. Anyone have any pics ?
3. Any custom builders ?
