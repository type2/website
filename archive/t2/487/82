For dual carburetors you should use the thin metal gaskets, either #1 or
#3 on your list depending on whether you have a 1700 or 1800cc engine.
The diameter of the interior holes on these gaskets should differ to match
the different intake holes on the heads.

The "Lone Ranger mask" bakelite gaskets are for fuel-injected type 4
engines.  Do not use these on a dual-carb engine.

                             OOK!
