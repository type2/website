So What are you trying say here Wil---
Because you messed around with ceramics--your no longer going to Use a
Mask--Or What??

Or because your folks smoked your not going to wear a mask--I don't have
an iota of an idea where your going with this--
Buy a high end mask and use it--period.

Now--lets get to the definition of late model vehicles-

Your 80 Vanagon does not fit into this catagory--
Sand Blast it---get it over with--and paint it--

It isn't any way, shape, or form into the new millenum toilet paper
sheet metal syndrome--

It's not a 32 Ford--but it is plenty blastable--

 
E-mail message   

I'm working on an '80 Vanagon....so I'm thinking that qualifies as a
later model.

My concern is that in the past I've worked in ceramics...mixing clay
and glazes, firing kilns...I've got my share of silica already.
I've lived in houses with smoking parents, on and off, for decades.
My mom is now on oxygen for severe emphysema and now that I'm in my
40's I have to say my breathing isn't what it used to be.
The only mechanism your body has to remove dust from respiratory tract
is confounded by silica....its like tiny crystals with fish hooks that
it just can't move....once it gets in there it never comes out.
Organic material is less of a problem as long as your not exposed for
several hours a day for years until your body is overwhelmed.
Sincerely,
