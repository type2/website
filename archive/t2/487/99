nope the torque converter will not fit....on the type I engine,  type I
engines use the single large bolt to hold the flywhieel on, the type IV
and the automatic used the 5 bolt around the edge to hold it onto the
crankshaft...  to get it to work would require more work than it would be
worth....if you want automatic, get a type IV engine
