Subject: drag link, front end clunk, bushings?

Hi,

After having my gas tank replaced by a non-VW mechanic I noticed that 
I was hearing a clunk from time to time in my front end.

I looked under the other day to find the bushing that fits in the eye
of the drag link on the driver's side had come out.....just hanging on
the rod outside its home in the link.  Could just having it on the
lift and banging around getting the tank out and in have done this?

The link doesn't look bad.  Should this just fall out?  Can I just
jack it up and push it back in?  Will it fall out again?

Since it came out should I conclude the eye of the drag link is worn
too much?

I had the two lower ball joints replaced just after buying the Vanagon
to pass inspection.  Other than that there were no front end inspection
problems.

I'm thinking of buying some new shocks, front and rear, replacing some
front end bushings (on inspection they look a bit done in).
Also, there are two boots (right and left) on the rod that are busted
....what should I be worried about here?  I haven't had any experience with the front
end yet.


Sincerely,
