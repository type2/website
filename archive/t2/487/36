Subject: We Made It!  Yay!!

Whew!

  Well we awoke to the white world of winter in Baltimore this morning. 
The kids went berserk.  The bus was covered in snow.

  She started right up though, nice for a southern gal.

  The winter snow driving caused a bit of marital discord though.  My
teeth were on edge most of the morning.  Had to keep reminding my
husband that you don't ever let a vw lug.  When to down shift and all
that.  I freaked when some dude started blasting down the on ramp and
then began to spin out by us.

  The bus has surpassed all of our expectations for this trip.  Wow!  She
is not pinging in the least, is this the use of premium?  She was doing
that in SC on the low hills.

  A grand experiment!

  Oh yea, we came via Hwy 83 from Cockeysville Md, to Hwy 30, got off
track and had to take Hwy 10 back up to 222 and the parkway up to 81 etc
etc...  Had some slowdown for construction but not much.
