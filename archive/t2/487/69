OK, before I yoink the engine out of the project bus 50 miles from home
(slow day at work) I have a question.

Actually, yoinking the engine won't affect me much except for weight. My
question is actually about the axles. Will the bus still tow OK 4 wheels
down (with a towbar) with the engine/tranny/axles out? I drag it back and
forth to work with me in case I have a slow day and can mess with it (like
today).

Drained the last bit out of the fuel tank and have everything ready to drop
the engine/tranny now.

Thanks all.
