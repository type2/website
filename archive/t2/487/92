Subject: Jack

Hi all, hope everyone had a good weekend.

I have a jack I hope someone can help me identify.  It looks like a regular 
VW jack, has a round base, but it has a hex bolt head that a handle would go 
onto for cranking.  The only markings on it are "Bilstein" on the part that 
goes into the jackpad.

Is this for an older VW?  A Benz, maybe?  I found it in a Bus I used to own, 
along with an extra Bus jack.  Makes me go hmmmmm.

Thanks much.

Mike
