Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust install the right way!? no more leaks....

"A good friend with a good ear for these engines borrowed the bus and was 
convinced that a vaccum leak was to blame. we plugged all suspects and 
replaced clamps and hoses to no avail. I also checked the tube btwn the carb 
and heads and the rubber looks good on the couplers."

Did you check to make sure that your distributor's vacuum cannister was 
actually operational?  Is the vacuum line from the dizzy to carb connected 
to the correct port on the carb?  Is the carburaetor new or recently 
rebuilt?  You may want to change or replace the diaphragms(esp. the 
accelerator-pump's) because they can develop tears and holes.  In my 
experience, exhaust leaks don't become problems until you're actually 
driving awhile.  These manifest as pops and increased cylinder head  
temperatures.  Hesitation upon acceleration could also be caused by improper 
air-fuel mixtures.  Check/replace the carb's o-rings on the idle air bypass 
and mixture screws as well.
