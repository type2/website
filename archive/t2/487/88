Subject: 71 turn signals

I'm new to the list and have found lots of help in the archives for my
electrical problems.
Water in the dimmer switch relay and turn signal flasher sure screws
things up.
Everything seems to work now but the signal indicators flash at same
time.The wiring indicates that is the way it should operate.
Is that correct? I never worked on a bus before but am sure my 71 super
did not flash both indicators at same time.
