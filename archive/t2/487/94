Subject: Turn signal gone funky!!

Hey Y'all,
The other day the left turn siganl on my 71 Westy went
funky. When I put on the left signall the dash
indicator light flashes VERY fast, like it is supposed
to when a bulb is burnt. However, the bulb is fine, I
put a new one in and same thing. Both the front and
rear signals still flash at the bulb, but they also
flash VERY fast just like the dash indicator arrow.
Right turn signal flashes correctly as it always
has....So what's up with that?? Bad flasher relay maybe??
