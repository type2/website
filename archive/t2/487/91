Subject: 79 FI (Will) Start!!!!

Greetings all:

Well after a long battle I have the 79 running!  It turned out to be 
several problems at the same time and I'm sure that I have a couple 
more problems to deal with but it does run.

The main issue turned out to be the plugged fuel filter.  With that 
replaced I was able to get the bus started with a lot of difficulty.  
Then I had a broken wire from the starter (terminal 50 I think) to the 
double relay.  This cut power to the cold start valve etc.  Finally, 
the starter itself was on its last legs so it wasn't turning the engine 
over very well.  With a new starter it seems to be starting up just 
fine.

I'm sure I still have some vacuum leaks to chase - it doesn't have as 
much oomph as my 77 but it seems to be running pretty well.  The 
heating system is well sealed and it has a new set of heater boxes so I 
might be able to stay warm this winter.

Thanks to everyone that pitched in with suggestions - I feel like I 
know my way around the Fuel Injection a lot better now.

Bye until the next problem (or maybe the next chance to help!)
