On freshly balsted metal use Duponts Acid etch Zinc chromate Vari Prime,
followed up by Duponts Urethane 3 part Uro Prime---this combo will last
forever--

Unless of course there is some sort of budget restrictions--then go
ahead and use the hobbiest POR stuff.

  A good portion of the roof of my bus has surface rust. I was
thinking that sand or some kind of media blasting would be easier than
sanding. What types of media other than sand would work? Would I then
need to use some type of rust primer like POR 15?
