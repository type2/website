Subject: Copies of Ron Van Ness's BN4 Heater Articles

Am lucky enough to have 78 Westfalia and a newly aquired BN4 Heater (all
components intact).  Ron Van Ness's 4 BN4 heater articles are listed in the
Library but it appears the articles have been taken off the web site.  Does
anybody in the VW family have copies of those articles or a website where I
can get the articles?   We do not run the bus in the winter but in Minnesota
that heater is used in the spring, summer, and fall!   Want to be fully
informed and knowledgable before I start that project.  A torched sage green
Westfalia could be an ugly site.     Many Thanks!
