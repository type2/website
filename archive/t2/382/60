Subject: Converting Poptop into Non-Poptop

Does anyone have any experience or suggestions regarding converting a 71 Westy
into a non-poptop vehicle?  Basically I just need to fill in the hole in the
roof.

Or if there is someone in the Seattle area who has a standard bus that they'd
like to trade for a westy, I'd be open to discussion.  This is not the world's
most perfect westy, but it starts right up, and runs and drives well.
