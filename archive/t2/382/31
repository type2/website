Subject: Tape Deck for My 79

Hey All,
Beyond the garage sale circuit, can anyone recommend a starting point for
finding a good new or used cassette deck for my 79 bus?  I have a Sony in
there but the tape deck portion has since ceased to operate, and I'd rather
not replace it with another Sony due to the crappy luck I've had with that
brand's products.  I don't want to deal with any of the fancy newish
stereos, as they seem now to require more complicated multiple ground wiring
and no one seems to make straight simple tape decks anymore anyway.  I'm
assuming an older Blaupunkt might fit and work....does anyone know of any
other brands of tape decks that will go right into the stock radio hole for
a 79?

Thanks for any ideas!

Travis
