That is correct. 

In the U.S. Bosch only sells rebuilt SR87X starters. But they do still
build new ones for the international market - they just don't let us
have them here in the U.S.  The only difference, as you noted, is that
since many other countries didn't use fuel injection, the non-U.S.
version lacks the extra terminal (so you just connect both wires to the
same posiive terminal).  

We found these a couple of years ago and have have been selling them
ever since, with excellent response. After all, they are brand new. I
don't think we've ever had a defective one. In fact many list members
have them on their busses.

Of course it's anybody's guess when availability could end, as we have
to get them through "unofficial" channels since they are not sold to
U.S. dealers by Bosch.  Therefore, we are still using the "rebuilt" part
number, SR87X, so that we can easily go back to listing them as rebuilt
when supply dries up. However, as long as we have availability, you will
get a new Bosch instead of a rebuilt one when you order it from us.
Better yet, the price is LOWER than the rebuilt Bosch normally sells
for, which makes it a heck of a deal. 

The application is '76-up Bus, and '80-81 Vanagon thru chassis #
24B093611, manual trans only. Price is $99.95.
