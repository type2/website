Subject: Some interesting options

Folks,
 
I finally got out my digital camera to take some shots of a few interesting
options on my European market 74 Westy with a SO73 Offenbach interior. Just
check out the link below:

If you have any of these seats (or maybe even the heater I am missing) in
your parts stash, please let me know.
 
If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will see that I still need
advice on adjusting my dual Solex 36-40 PDSIT carbs. Any suggestions are
more than welcome ...
 
Marcus
