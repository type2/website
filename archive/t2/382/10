I was talking in terms of the construction of the battery, and the fact that the AGM construction of the Optima is in general more suited to high-current applications than lead-acid batteries.  Flooded lead-acid batteries are ideal for low-current applications and will have a greater amp-hour rating for a given size/weight than an Optima, be it red, yellow, blue or whatever.

That's what I recall seeing on the labels.

I built a frame out of wood, painted it and bolted it to the floor.  Then I strapped the batteries to the frame.  Not a great solution but it kept the batteries from moving around.

Then a single group 27 battery is probably your best bet.

>What is the rating on a group 27 and what are its dimensions?

The rating will vary by brand, but typically they will be 105 amp-hours (I looked this up - it was higher than I had remembered.  Group 24's are 85 amp-hours).  I wouldn't look at the rating, but would buy by brand name alone.  The only brands I would buy are those made by Johnson Controls, which include Interstate, Motocraft, and as of recently I'm told Autozone's house brand.  Dimensions should be easy to find on Google - I've performed my quota of searches for the day.  :-)
