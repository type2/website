Best Buy, Circuit City, K-mart, Pep Boys and the like.

www.partsexpress.com is VERY good - often with $5 speakers (new). I have 
done alot of business with them. I got a flyer the other day (in my e-mail) 
that listed 5" round speakers for $5!!! I bought 4 in-house stereo speakers 
for $25 last year. Decent rear channel speakers that originally came with a 
middle cost RCA stereo as found at the above retailers.
