The factory doesn't put much priority on the servicablity of the vehicle
after the warranty runs out.  If the vehicle makes the warranty period
without touching the plugs they'd weld them in place if it was cheaper!

Does the factory call for that "two drops of machine oil" that you apply?
I really see little difference between that and the small (emphasis on
small) dab of anti-sieze that I use.  I think that most anti-sieze
problems are caused by using too much or getting it in the wrong places.

I agree.  Honda put a 105K mile first service interval on their 2.4 litre
engines and a few of these engines are coming up with burnt valves at
60-80K.  Honda doesn't care, since 60K>36K, which is the warranty period.
The 10% of engines whose valves close up are a statistical fluke, but if
it is _my_ statistical fluke it's no laughing matter.  Honda is noted
for their engineering, so if they are pulling this sort of thing...
