Subject: growling while driving over 35mph

Hello fellow listee's!

I have a question: When driving over thirty five miles
per hour, I get this kind of continuous growling/low
rumbling noise. It is the same kind of noise one might
get if the steel belts on a tire were exposed (if you
can imagine that). This goes away under 35mph, and
therefore cannot tell if it is doing it going around
corners (would be an indication if it were front
bearings). My question is, has anyone else had this
happen to them? Where to start troubleshooting?
Thanks,
Matt    '78 Westy 'blue'
