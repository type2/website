Sorry to bring bad news, but the chances of finding a good used cassette
deck is just about nil.  They are usually removed because the cassette
drive stops working and the repair cost exceeds the cost of a new unit.
At that point, they go on the garage sale table.  Since you can't easily
test them, you don't know what you are getting.
