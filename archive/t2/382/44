tim, richard,

i am in the process of setting up an account to buy AMP terminals. i cannot
get them straight from AMP, but i have to go through a distributor. the
reason for getting the parts is so we can offer rebuild parts for the
harnesses of busses, especially the engine FI harness.

i am not sure if they still make this one, but i will try to find out.
