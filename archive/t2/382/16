Subject: Biggest Battry that will fit?

Theodore,
Not really answering your question, but giving you something to think about.
I'm planning an extended trip in my bus at the end of the year (6-12 months)
and what I will be setting up is slightly different. In the stock location
for the primary battery I plan to fit two batteries (yes they will fit). One
for the bus, one for aux. power. They will be a little small but adequate.
This does two things. Firstly reduces the load on the alternator and
secondly it frees the other side up to mount a small generator. Honda make
some very small very quiet 4 stroke generators (8 amp and 10 amp). This
combined with a solar panel should provide all my power needs, even it I
don't move for a few days/weeks in one spot.
Cheers,
