Yes, the Mexican heads use long reach plugs.  The probable reason is that
they wanted to get a handle on the common cracking problem of the dual
port heads so the made the crack-prone area thicker.  We'll find out more
when some of these heads get enough miles on them to be in the
"cracking zone".

I really don't see the Mexican design as inferior in any
way.  When VWAG abandoned aircooled designs in '79 or so the further
development of the engine fell to VW de Mexico and VW do Brasil.  I've
driven a late model Mexican beetle and the current development of the type
1 engine is much better than the last aircooleds sold in the US.  Easier
to start, idles right off the bat, and has more power even on poor
Mexican gas.

Yes, most vws came with Bosch plugs, though I seem to recall a few coming
with Beru plugs as well.  Manufacturers use the supplier that gives
the best price.  Similarly, you will see Japanese vehicles coming with NGK
or NipponDenso plugs.  All of these plugs are good conservative designs
and will serve well.  The major difference I've seen is in the quality of
the threads, not in the function of the plug.  I've seen Champions with
threads so poor that they could not be hand-threaded into the hole.
Needless to say, the next time the plug was removed, it brought some
aluminum with it.
