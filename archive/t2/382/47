Was there a Geo Metro hitched to the rearend???

I'm just being mean! <grin>

Hang in there. What kind of distributor? Webers have I think pretty 
elaborate jetting schemes. Maybe your carb is not jetted correctly. I'm a 
Dellorto man so I have no practical experience with Webers. Is your 
distributor advancing correctly?

Throttle opening all the way when you floor the gas pedal? Vacuum leaks? 
Very short air cleaner restricting air flow?
