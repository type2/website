Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

According to the Bosch and Beru sites, several manufacturers DO call for
non-iron electrode plugs as OEM.

Please provide us with a link to some information from Mercedes or ANY
other manufacturer on the Bosch list that shows us that they DO NOT
recommend platinum or something similar.  I have been unable to find any
such references and would be happy to be directed to some.

ditto for the BERU site

I doubt that Mercedes or Audi would tolerate this recommendation from the
plug manufacturers if it was detrimental to their cars.  IMHOP so far, you
are perpetuating an urban legend. jon


ps I believe the '100k with only a plug change at 50k' was part of the
early emission spec changes in the '70's.  Manufacturers had to guarantee
that their cars would make it to 100k with no adjustments, other than a
change of plugs at 50k, to keep the car in emissions spec.  That was the
start of breakerless ignitions and wide plug gaps on all cars sold in the
US, and of course sealed carb adjustments we so love to drill out.

I asked before and no one answered so I'll ask again. Which manufactures 
have designed an ignition system that calls for platinum Bosch, or any 
other brand platinum, as factory stock???? I only know the Euro designs 
don't. Any body know if the US or Asian cars come with platinum???? On the 
Euro marks, there are quite a few that require special plugs. If you don't 
use the correct Silver plugs for big Beemers, you got problems. There are 
the unique 2 and 3 tang specials for others, like some of the
WasserBoxers. 
Bosch makes also a 4 ground platinum sold after market only, and as far as 
I know they are like the original platinums, no manufacturer approves them 
or uses them.
