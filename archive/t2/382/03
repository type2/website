Theodore,

As David has also said, you can fit two G-S 24's sideways in the AUX 
location.  Yellow Optimas are roughly the same size.  Optima also makes 6 
volt optimas that only have three spiral cells.  I know of people who have 
bought multiples, and run them in series for a higher amperage supply.  I 
don't know how pricey this would be, but you could even stack them 
horizontally since they're leak-proof.
