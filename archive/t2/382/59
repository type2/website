Find some 17 year old hell-bent on his first $3,000 stereo system. Offer 
him or her $25 for the OEM radio that they are removing. Stereo installers 
might have cheap used OEM radios too. The Honda tape decks have always been 
good to me. I recently installed an-ex-Accord tape player on my Honda 
motorcycle to replace the analog manual tuning radio/tape deck. It's 
digital and has preset buttons so it is less likely to get me killed while 
trying to tune the radio to the next station. (also a lighted front).

Value? $15 tops I'd guess. In my case the Honda named stereo on my Honda 
motorcycle works out well.
