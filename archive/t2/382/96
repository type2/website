Thanks for the idea. That was my first thought too. A few weeks ago, I got
tired of those pesky boots popping off, and I replaced them and the
stainless tube that connects the two carbs with vacuum hose with a "T" in
the middle for the brake booster. I have triple checked the hose clamps, and
all seems well.

Next idea?

Cheers,
Matthew

 Vaccuum.

 You have probably popped a vacuum connection somewhere, or one of the
 lines has cracked.

 Happy trails,
