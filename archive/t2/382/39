Subject: Re: 091 Tranny Tools Whoopee

I too have spotted a set of tranny tools and am thinking about purchasing them. 
I am not nearly as adept at this as you seem to be but I plan on keeping my 
busses for a while and these tools could come in handy some day. I was 
wondering if you could snap a couple of photos of the set up you bought and e 
mail them to me so I can look at what I've found and make sure it's all there. 
There is something there that looks more like something I've seen advertised on 
epay as being a tool used to hold heads for assembly/work. I know that the 
backlash adj. tool #381/14 is there and several other tools I am unfamiliar 
with. 

PS: If you cannot do this is there any type of pub that might list these tools 
and there use.
