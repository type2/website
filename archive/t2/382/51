>What part of the lifter seals the push rod tubes?  Are your lifters longer
than
stock? Do they extend into the push rod tube?
If "no"... then your heads are vented.

I suppose the air and oil travel back to the crankcase through these holes
as the lifters move back and forth opening and closing the holes.

>Some things you can do to see about making your engine run cooler....
you say "Timing and dwell are on"
"Are on" to what?,,, a 20 year old manual spec that knew nothing about
TODAYS
fuel?

I have had pretty good luck trusting Bentley this far. Besides the lower
octane ratings and a host of detergent additives how different do you think
unleaded gas from 1978 is from today? Just curious I did not think there
was a big enough of a difference to void the timing instructions in
Bentley.

>You say "I'm running castrol 20W50."  and I think it was said before,,, a
fresh
engine may not need 20w50

I have always run this in my aircooled VWs but I agree with you here and
will probably be going to a synthetic lighter weight soon.

>Ok,, If I could suggest that as you already have the CHT gauge  AND the
oil temp
gauge,, you should add the oil pressure gauge.


Have the guage. I am still having problems getting the correct sender to
get it installed. I clearanced my tin using a dremel to avoid using the
hose style adapter but the sender I got from Bus Depot does not thread in
to my case. I think the threads in the case are tapered NPT and the sender
is 10 x 1.0 MM straight. This is just from looking at the sender that came
out. So I am going to order a new sender for Aircooled.net that has NPT
threads and hope it fits. I will need to remove the fan housing to be able
to get a wrench onto the sender to tighten it properly. In retrospect I am
wishing i had just bought the $20 adapter hose...

>Start by trying 10W30... as the T4 engine is *pressure* controlled oil
cooling,,
you want to have the least amount of oil pressure to allow the MOST oil to
travel through the cooler,, instead of bypassing it via the pressure
sensitive
oil pressure relief valve.

I was thinking of a 15W40 Synthetic at my next oil change, but I really
don't want to start that thread again...


Thanks for the tips,
