Subject: Re: [T2] Biggest Battry that will fit?

>You are not going to get a large amp-hour rating out of an Optima-style
battery.  They are designed for high-current applications, not
trickle-discharge like what your fridge will ask for.

Optima claims that their Yellow Top line is deep cycle the red tops are the
high current or starting batteries.

> A pair of group 24's would be a better fit and still give around 140
amp-hours.  They will last 2-3 years if you maintain them properly and
don't run them flat.

So group 24s put out about 70 amp hours? How about a battey tie-down? I
dont want these things bouncing around in there. I would like to use one
battery that fits and can be easily secured in place. If I can get 75 or
more amp hours out of one I think I would be set.

>For a long time I ran a pair of group 27's mounted sideways in that spot,
in parallel.
What is the rating on a group 27 and what are its dimensions?
