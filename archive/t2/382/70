Jack up your garage and add another round of cinder blocks... Might be 
easier... <grin>

Seriously - having built several hot rods which started life as a sedan 
with a soft top insert (see 30's Fords) we simply removed the rubber 
insert, went shopping for a station wagon or SUV roof that we liked with a 
nice rib pattern, trimmed the new steel to fit the opening, welded it in, 
dressed the welds, and then filled as necessary. Looks nice.

Can be done with stock VW roof, with a sunroof from a family sedan - whatever.

A visit to a street rod show will show some well built, tasteful creations.
