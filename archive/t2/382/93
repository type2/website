Subject: clutch cable again!

Second failure in three years. What's going wrong?

I'll be replacing tonight with cable from the local
Nazi VW flaps.

Caught them at 5:05 walking out of the door, me sweaty with broke down bus in red zone with expired tags asking to be ripped off.

"ten bucks"

Amazing, how they've factored in the tax and everything for an exact figure...NOT!

3.75 at the busboys.

211 721 335J by "Repro" the brand we know and trust.
3315MM I think from the busboys site, what's that in inches? I'm going to measure it, because the last one seemed too long. I had to tighten it throughout it's lifespan, all the way down the threaded rod to the max adjustment.

Anywayz,

Beer in hand, under the bus, check in with y'all later,

Billy
