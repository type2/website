Subject: Oil temperature

Oil Temp question.

I just moved my 75 Westie to PA from TX.
In Texas, I needed the oversize oil cooler the PO added.

It is not in the airflow, but cools the oil very well. In Texas.

In PA it cools it too well. I have not seen the oil over 200 degrees F
since I started driving it here (the past few cool days.) Mostly it runs
between 180 and 200 degrees F.

I think this may be a problem. Is there some thermostatically controlled
gate out there that will open when the oil gets hot enough?

Opinions. Advice? Thanks.
