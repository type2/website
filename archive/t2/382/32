Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

> I asked before and no one answered so I'll ask again. Which manufactures have designed an ignition system
that calls for platinum Bosch, or any
 other brand platinum, as factory stock????


Mercedes-Benz:  98 and up 112 [V6] and 113 [V8], factory Bosch Platinum with 100,000 mile lifespan.

The 111 engine in the 97 and up SLK230 with supercharger uses the 3 legged Bosch Platinum with a 30K change
interval.
The 111 engine, 98 and up C230 non-supercharged, is 3 legged Bosch platinum with a 45K change interval.

These are not standard Kettering ignition systems. The ignition is controlled by the ME control unit. The 112
and 113 engines have a coil for each cylinder and 2 spark plugs. One plug is fired postive to negative, the
other negative to positive. The 111 engine has 2 coils, one on top of #2 plug and #4 plug. When #2 fires, so
does #3. When #4 fires, so does #1.
[I will not even mention the 137 V12 engine that uses 270v step up transformers that read ion fields.....]

Platinum plugs are resister plugs. This has nothing to do with heat range.
Older Mercedes using old style ignition systems, same as type 1 or type IV engines, do not run worth a darn
with resister plugs. They cut out under load. The coil does not develope enough spark to fire the plug under a
load. MB NEVER specified a resister plug or platinum plug for any pre-97 car.
Sure, the Bosch or whatever plug catalog says the resister plug is recommended by the manufacturer but they
don't say which manufacturer! I will give you a hint: It is NOT the car manufacturer.

I really don't care what works in a two cycle motorcycle. I care about cars. I am a shop foreman at a Mercedes
only dealership for the past 24 years.
