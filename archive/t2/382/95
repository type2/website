> Hey Ho

> So - for those who missed it.  I found a 78 westy about 5 years ago in a
garage of a man who is the father of a childhood friend of my wife's.  He
bought the bus in 81 and drove it a bit for vacations with his two kids
etc.. But he always stored it in a garage and of course it was never winter
driven.  If fact when this bus wasn't on a trip it was inside of a heated
garage.  When I saw it 5 years ago my jaw dropped.  The paint looked like
new.  The interior looked like new - amazing.  Anyway,  the ol' fella died
and we mentioned as politely and in as disinterested a fashion as possible
that we would like to buy the bus - that was back in February.

> Very recently the childhood friend of my wife's called and said it is for
sale.  So my wife's father in Manitoba went to the ol' fella's house with a
body man to look at the bus - amazing they tell me.  So then they say lets
take it to a garage for a safety inspection to see what it needs - (this is
a small town in north central Manitoba - there is not a VW dealer for
probably 500 miles - I'm kinda torn up inside - damn - don't let a farmer
mechanic look at it)  - anyway, the bus was towed to the garage and a
mechanic lifted it up on a hoist and drained the 6 year old gas out of it.
He tried to start it but ... When I called him he said that there were
explosions coming out of the carburetor - (damn says I to myself - it
doesn't have a carburetor.)

> So they pulled one of the heads off and tell me that the a rocker arm or
something is loose.  I call again today and they say - everything is
excellent.  They tell me that the compression is good all around and the
brakes are good etc.. every thing is fine ... but for some exhaust issues to
be dealt with - maybe  a new muffler and a tail piece? I'm not sure? It will
be safetied.
>
> Now I have to find out if I have to re-safety it here in Ontario before I
get it licensed and insured?  My guess is yes - but my wife knows for a fact
that a Manitoba safety inspection is good for 30 days in Ontario - funny how
she knows things like that for a 'fact.'  Anyway, now I'll have to try and
get to semi-Northern Manitoba and travel back to Eastern Ontario in a 25
year old bus that hasn't been driven for 6 years (well it was recently
driven away from the garage but it wouldn't drive to the garage because the
gas in the gas tank was so bad - so I've been told.)  Kinda scary.  I think
I'll try and fly on a Thursday afternoon - to Winnipeg - then jump on a bus
to a point 6 hours North of Winnipeg.  Then jump in the 78 and drive back to
Kingston - yikes.  I think it is a 24 hour drive from Toronto to Winnipeg,
then 6 hours from Winnipeg to the 78, and 3 hours from Kingston to Toronto.
That is one lonely road between Kenora and Sault Ste. Marie.  I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.   Must make it to Bus Fusion in
the 78!

> Anyone know of any AIRS members on that road?  Maybe I ought to cross post
this message to the type 2 list, think I'll to that.

> jdd 60 standard, damn I love that bus, and just about ready for the
interior paint, can't wait to get the motor back in and see how it runs with
those NOS heads - and soon a 78 westy, time warp bus (wonder if that vanity
plate is available 'timewarp') - and a smokin' 89 diesel jetta that you
couldn't kill with a stick.
