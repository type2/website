No it's not! Look at the following. The idle jet is behind a brass
screw. See 35 in the following. Yes there are two "35s" as there are two
idle jets. The one that you are after is in the side of the larger of
the two throats. Mind you it would hurt to also spray carb cleaner where
the idle mixture screw goes but you would then have to note the number
of turns the idle mixture screw had been wound out in order to put it
back right.
