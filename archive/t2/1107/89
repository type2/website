Volks,
Tim shared his knowledge and beliefs in a straightforward and informative
way. Not sugarcoated, not nice (and not evil either), not tactful. But I see
grace in being helpful, concerned, and true to oneself. Do what you will
with that. ;-)

TP stated the facts with a heavy dose of self-righteous attitude in response
a dude just asking questions. Your attitude sucks TP, which more often than
not makes your presence unfortunate regardless of your knowledge base. Do
what you will with that.
