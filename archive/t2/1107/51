Subject: Re: [T2] compression

Well, I was just asking.  I'm not the expert here.  And I don't know if 
I checked it right or not.  The first time, I got 60 on one of the 
cylinders.  But I tried again and it went up to 110.  I'm just trying to 
get the durned thing to run right now and I don't think the compression 
is my main problem.  But thanks...KR
