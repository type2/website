Have you checked the carb float. I heard with newer fuels that they can break down the plastic float on the weber over time. Just what I heard though.

'Just out of curiosity, has it been sitting for some time?' 


That's the problem, it has been sitting for the best part of two years. 

Today, I pulled the carb and cleaned it up.   I thought that one of the 
barrels might not even be opening but it seemed to be okay after I 
worked it back and forth and cleaned it good.  But I put it back on and 
still have the same problem.  That's the easiest carb-pull I've ever 
seen.  One hose, accelerator cable, and four bolts. 

Part number on the carb:  32-36 DFAV.  Anybody got a diagram on that?  
The Weber book at Advance Auto Parts didn't show that number.  It also 
had another number, 23A4K/1 or I maybe.  Doubt that number will help 
anything.  Thanks for the help, guys...KR

Weber two-barrel carb
It used to run great....
