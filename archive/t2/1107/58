	Let's not panic a humble saxophonist in Chattanooga into 
premature action.
	He has yet to make sure the compression figures are correct. 
When he has done that, soon enough to consider rebuilding.
	Anyhow, those specs presumably have some margin built in so 
that the motor is expected to go a few thousand mi before giving any 
serious trouble, including serious power loss, when all cyls have 
sunk to 108 psi.
	I reckon the conservative line of action is:

warm up motor as best you can
slap approx 1/2 cc. oil into each cyl (felt pen on each spark plug 
lead to keep them identified to their home cyls!)
OPEN  THROTTLE
crank till compression gauge steady

record new figs for us

slap plugs back in, with their right leads

don't worry about blue smoke as that extra oil burns off

drive to sax gigs in Chattanoogah & environs, humming 'Pardon me 
bwah,  ...', and noting performance with ruthless honesty.

Don't panic!
