John, I am 63 and did a trip albeit not as prolonged as yours will become, and
went from BC Canada, to Everett Wa, then across America to the Atlantic, then
North to Canada, then Cape Breton, PEI, and then home.  The only companion I
had was my 2 year old Airedale Terrier, and "we' loved it...so many
curious.."I have not seen on of those around here for ages", (mine was an F!
2L Westy, and most rust to death back there), and the things I loved..were a
"new Video" through that great Bay window...everyday, and the independence of
the..as my brother called it...SDC...Sensory Deprevation Chamber...you are
"star ship" 1, and you are the commander, to just go out and ...see!  Wow my
wheels are turning, but wife still works, so will have to "weave' something
together.  Take care, totally enjoy,WRITE EVERYTHING down in a journal...and
get a dog..eh?  Remember Steinbachs  "Travel with Charlie"?
Cheers
Squid
