LOL, Robert!  God love you, my Kraut-Can-lovin' Kiwi brother.  Speaking 
of God, it's amazing how his timing works.  I just heard that song on 
the radio yesterday while I was working on the Bopmobile.  I'm a jazz 
musician and not a big fan of country music but me and the jazz cats 
around here have always loved trucker songs.  Just for the humor and the 
inherent, somewhat basal honesty in them.  Of course, as parsimonious as 
I am, I'm in Tennessee, not Georgia.  But the state line is about a mile 
from my house.  Now, If I can just get the Bopmobile running good enough 
to take me there I can parsimoniously save some money on gas.  :)  


Could somebody possibly fix the mailer daemon filter?  As little traffic 
as there is on the list, I should think we could have a little more 
lee-way.  The bandwidth has to be negligible.  Thanks, guys for all the 
advice....
