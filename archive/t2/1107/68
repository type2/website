Can you point us to the source of those specifications? I may be off because
I have an 81 Air Cooled Vanagon, 2.0 but Bentley says minimum is 73psi, and
max between cylinders is 44psi.

 I can't go along with a fixed number for max difference, as its a
percentage that you have to look at, not a number cast in stone.

I think those are absolute mins, but my van has run for years and years at
100psi +/- 10 and has no issues at all, great mileage, and moves along fine
for a big old Van.

None of those numbers indicates a dropped cylinder. When you drop a hole,
you will know it, and it will show rather obviously in the compression test.
The only way to really check, is with a leak down test. Otherwise, as was
stated, there are all kinds of variables that will have you chasing your
tail around and around. Ask me how I know <g>

90psi is a little low, but not that bad to cause they symptoms being talked
about.
