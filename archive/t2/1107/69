Subject: Re: [T2] compression

I didn't mess with the throttle at all.  I just turned the engine over 
and read the guage.  With the engine cold.  My bad for even mentioning 
those numbers.  Didn't mean to piss off T. P.  :)  I will do it right 
when I get it running again.  Now I'm curious to know how it is.  I've 
got to buy a guage.  Don't know why I haven't bought one already.  I 
guess that it has always run so good that I didn't want to mess it up.  
And T. P. is right, it never hurts to know the facts.  Ciao...KR
