I'd call it "Go Westy Thinking" 8-)
 
I agree with Greg, and Jeff's original thought.  $1000-1500 value IF that, and
from how the body is described, the free offer a year ago was probably fair to
haul the thing off.  Sure could it be worth $10-12k, yeah maybe if you put
$8-10k into it at commercial rates, though it might take you $14k to make it
worth $12k like Greg mentions.  AND it still would have started as a rusty
POS.  That said, you do see a lot of idiots looking for some major change on
Samba for crappy diesel Westies (things asking $4000-5000 I'd figure worth
$2500 max,) but they sit a darn long time looking...  Everyone wants to be one
of those syncro westy dreamers trying to follow the Go Westy path with their
"$50k" rigs sitting on *bay, time after time after time, then on samba forever
as well.  It spreads to diesels cause wannabe hippies think greasers are cool
and all, till the 3rd time they have that little NA 1.6 rebuilt because they
don't understand you can only drive
 em 45-50mph if you want em to live.
 
YMMV.

$12K from the machine your buddy described is wishful thinking, pure and
simple. If your buddy were to spend $5K in paint and another $5k in
mechanical work plus $2K in tires and interior and, and, and... then he
would have something you *might* get $12K for.
