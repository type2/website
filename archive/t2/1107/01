Subject: Re: [T2] Westy or Not?

I didn't see it mentioned anywhere in the thread, but is there an RV
(recreational vehicle)
ID plate behind the RIGHT (passenger) side door?  Every Riv I have ever seen
(mine included)
has this plate.  Westi's also have the plate, but it will say WESTFALIA and
probably be readable,
whereas the ASI plates all seem to be pretty much faded to oblivion by now.
It can also be said that generally, a Westi will have TWO manufacturing dates
on the ID
sticker at the drivers door post.  The earlier one will be for the "incomplete
vehicle" and
the other when it left the Westphalia works.  This can in some cases be
important when
accessing proper parts as sometimes there was a considerable delay between
manufacture
and shipping dates.
