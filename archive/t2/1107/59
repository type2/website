T.P. just stated the facts. Heavy, medium, light, no matter, facts is 
facts. The only alternative is to ignore the facts. It is perfectly 
OK if you do for you and your machine. No harm to others, no foul. 
But never expect me to shine people on with anything that resembles 
either ignorance or stupidity or blatantly obscures the facts by 
ommission. You don't need me for that. Lots of people out there 
looking to sell you solutions based upon that. Go to your local 
FLAPS. I guarantee you they got something in a can that will fix you. 
Tighten up those rings and cylinders and viloa, compression restored, 
says so right there on the can. Just ask the salesman. He'll fix you up.
