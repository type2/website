Subject: Dash lights

I've got a situation with a headlight switch in which the dash lights
come on at the first step when the parking lights come on, but then
the dash lights go off when you pull the switch all the way out for
the headlights to come on.

Is this an internal fault in the switch, or has a wire come off the switch?

Can this be compensated for by running a jumper wire between two of
the terminals on the switch?

Thanks,

John
