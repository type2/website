Subject: Re: [T2] '71 fuel tank line replacement

yeah that was clearly a bad idea on my part. I wasn't aware that the 
radiator hoses didn't have the flouroelastomers inside to protect them from 
the alcohol/ethanol in modern fuels. Doing a bunch of digging around it 
seems if you are in a hurry you can go to a marine store. they are more then 
likely to have fuel/diesel rated hose in all kinds of crazy diameters and 
that's what I will do on that bug. It still seems to be cheaper then buying 
from a VW supplier for the most part.

P.S. got the word from my 18 year old today, and seems I am destined for 
another bus project for him. Now that child support has gone down I might 
even be able to afford parts for the bus this time instead of getting fed up 
and sending the last two to the scrap yard heh. We are on the prowl for a 
decent 71 or older, or he would like a 78 but I refuse to get into another 
rone of those unless it is running and running WELL now that I know how 
ungodly expensive those parts are.
