Subject: Re: [T2] compression

It's just basic physics. We are trying to measure the ability of the
piston to push to build pressure. The push will be reduced if it (and
the other three cylinders) have to pull against manifold pressure from
a closed butterfly and push against pressure in the other cylinders if
the spark plugs are not removed.

Another factor in this equation is health of the starter motor. A
compression test is only a diagnostic tool, not an engineering
analysis.
