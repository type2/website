Hey, Kiwi Mann!  Great suggestion.  I have an old motorcycle glove that 
will be just the ticket for your rather unorthodox procedure.  Maybe I 
can shake something loose.  Worth a try anyway.  I should just pull and 
rebuild the carburetor but that might open a whole new can of worms.  
And I never did pick up that CO2 extinguisher but the old dry-powder 
unit will work if called for.  It's just a mess to clean up and 
expensive to recharge.  But I've had to do that before.  Almost burned 
myself up once trying to change a clogged fuel filter over a hot engine 
on the side of the road.  Learned my lesson well there.  Still counting 
my blessings.  Never pays to get in a hurry where fuel is involved.  
I'll let you know how it turns out.  I'm still kicking myself for not 
looking you up when I was in NZ.  I was distraught over a stolen lap-top 
at the time.  But I hope to make it there again some day.  Lovely 
country you've got there!  Ciao....KR
