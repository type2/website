Hi John,

What would be the hypothetical problem?

The worst thing I can think of is that some portion of the fuel would
recirculate and gradually get warmer as it takes extra trips through the
pump and fuel rail.

But even if this is the case, there is still "cold" fuel constantly
entering the line to replace the fuel consumed by the engine, and I have
never seen any problems with this, even when driving 16 hours of
consecutive highway travel on several occasions.

With the T placed below the tank there is no possibility for cavitation at
the pump unless the tank is actually empty, and that would be the same
case no matter how many outlets the tank has.

It might be worse if I lived in a climate where the fuel in the tank was
already at 110F, but I don't, and for me at least no problems have ever
come up. I could check my records but I believe I have probably put about
50,000 miles on the bus since the FI system was fitted.

But as they say, Your mileage may vary.

Happy Trails,
