There are quite a few specific requirements to do a correct 
compression test. Skipping any one will invalidate the results. 
Engine at operating temp. All plugs removed. Valve lash correct. Shut 
off fuel delivery. Open butterfly/s fully. And then watch the needle 
on every pulse. The way it jumps up every pulse is diagnostic and has 
significant meaning. If you don't do it right, the only result can be 
BAD DATA which guarantees BAD CONCLUSIONS and wasted TIME/MONEY on 
WRONG ACTIONS.
