Subject: Re: Value Of '82 Diesel Westy

Hi Jeff,

You and I know a guy who bought a running but crusty diesel vanagon
sitting in a scrapyard in VA for $700, who then flipped it to another guy
we know for a double cab without a motor. He then tarted it up a bit,
drove it for a while and flipped it to a third acquaintance of ours, who
then threw an buttload of coin at it before being forced to unload it at
an off-season loss at $5,200. He had it listed a long time and few people
were interested.

I can name the individuals off-list if desired.

Mind you, the last owner had it restored as original. If it'd been me, I
would have at least put a 1.6TD in it to get the power up over the 1.6NA
it came with.

For free, a diesel westy is a great deal. Parting it out you can get a
good buck just for the bell housing, bearer bar and oil pan, and sell them
to someone looking to do a diesel or inline VW gas engine conversion to
their WBX.

$12K from the machine your buddy described is wishful thinking, pure and
simple. If your buddy were to spend $5K in paint and another $5k in
mechanical work plus $2K in tires and interior and, and, and... then he
would have something you *might* get $12K for.


Happy Trails,
