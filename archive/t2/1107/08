I recently refreshed all the fuel lines in a bug, and what I did was pull 
the old hoses and go to AutoZone.
They let me behind the counter where they have all the radiator hoses and I 
was able to find the right size there for the filler neck and then the 
smaller recirculator lines off of the fuel neck was able to match up sizes 
in the hoses they sell by the foot for heater cores. it was WAY cheaper then 
the other options I looked at from the local aircooled shops especially when 
considering the autozone was 1/2 mile from home and the closest aircooled 
shop is a 30 minute drive.
