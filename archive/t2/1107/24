Since the original filler hose is NLA, me too, searched for other
sources of a similar hose. In Germany it is common to go to a
Mercedes-Benz repair shop and get a very similar hose that they use in
their "Sprinter" buses. In the US this buses are sold by Dodge, so you
can get that part probably there. It is also used for the filler, so
it has to be fuel resistant, Mercedes part number is 9014760026.
Don't get any radiator hoses or other stuff that's not explicitly
stated to be permanently fuel resistent or otherwise you'll have to
pull the tank in no time! I experienced a lot of problems with a
silicone hose:
