Not. I ran your M code through the decoder at alltheprettybuses.com
and it gives the following:

   It came across as a bus, probably a Kombi as you found in your
search. The things that clinch it in my mind are the arrival port
being Portland and the sliding windows, not jalousies. Rivieras were
converted in Portland Oregon using Kombis for the most part, and had
sliding middle side windows, not jalousies. If you have a pop top,
does it raise straight up, not hinged at the rear and open wide at
front? The interior is vinyl, not plaid cloth? You got a Rivi. Other
than those details they are pretty much the same inside as Westies, I
have read that there was a significant amount of idea
swapping/copycatting going on between the makers of both conversions.
I have a Riviera, and its a fine thing although seals etc for those
slider windows are hens teeth by now...
