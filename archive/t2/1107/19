Subject: Anyone got an early steering box?

Either in reasonable shape at reasonable cost, or unknown shape at dirt cheap
cost.  The SC is a lot worse than I expected, and it is mostly in the box on
inspection.  When I bought it I thought I had several good ones (which I do,
but they all end up late boxes, although I swear I had one from a '68 but it
has gotten away from me.)  Anyway perusing samba has a few leads but I figured
if I can get one from somebody I know, seems better.
