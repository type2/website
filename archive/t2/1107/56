Well, I pulled off the 19mm plug and there was no filter in it at all.  
And some junk in the bottom.  There's no telling what has gone through 
the carburetor.  Or what has plugged up the jets!  It looks just like 
the 32/36 DFEV diagram somebody sent me.  I have to try to reprint it as 
it prints in green and I can barely see some parts.  But the parts list 
looks good.  I may have to attempt a rebuild.  Anybody have 
recommendations for a replacement carb if I screw it up?  Or a used one 
that you know works that I could get cheap enough to talk me out of the 
rebuild.  Thanks, all....KR
