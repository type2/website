Subject: Re: [T2] compression

Also, I'm told that you can't accurately test compression unless all 
four plugs are out.  I first thought you could just check it one at a 
time.  The number was the same for the number one cylinder both ways.  
The numbers I gave were with all four out.  Thanks....KR
