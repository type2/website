Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Fittings

this is actually a complicated theory question,, and you havn't provided all
the data.
it depends on the dia of the piping,, the length, and the pressures
involved...
that said...  it will probably work just fine

I might guess that if you use the heater, and both burners at the same
time... the gas may be consumed by the first appliance on the line.. and the
other appliance[s] may not get adequate flow.

so, I 'd have to assume your regulator has adequate flow capabilities..
other wise you need a larger [volume] regulator.. same pressure...
and the length and ID of your tube, or hose is sufficient..
and the ID of the T doesn't cause a pressure drop.... due to internal
restrictions of most brass fittings the CV is a lot less

but basically you have the correct idea.

sorry,,  ... hopefully you will get some empirical data , and that will make
your quest much easier!
