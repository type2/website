Subject: Re: [T2] '71 fuel tank line replacement

I have a problem with encountering VWs (Buses, etc.,) with water-rated
heater hoses being used as Breather Hoses.  Sure, water rated heater hoses
are less expensive, but constant use and exposure to petroleum based
products (fuel vapors, oil vapors,) can destroy them from the inside and
they rot away in short order. I always recommend using the correctly rated
hoses:

3.5mm ID Vacuum Hose - VW # N203531
4.5mm ID Vacuum Hose - VW # N203751
Note: used w/Push-Pull Dist Vac Can (Retard Side)
5mm ID - Fuel Hose - VW # N203551 (Carb Models)
(Don't recommend the 3/16" American Fuel Rated Hose, because when they leak
its usually a split that will send out a stream - excellent way to start a
fire.  Conti hoses are safer because the cloth braiding allows fuel to
"weep" when they start to leak).
7mm ID - Fuel Hose - VW 203571 (Type 3 Carb Models)
7mm ID - Fuel Injection Pressure rated Hose - VW # N202811
(Gates & Goodyear have a 1/4" High Pressure Fuel Rated Hose - I've sold and
used this for many years)
9mm ID - Breather Hose - VW # N203761 (Mostly FI Models)
(Can use 3/8" American Fuel Rated Hose)
12mm ID - Breather Hose - VW # N203741
(Can use 1/2" American Emissions Rated Hose)
14mm ID - Breather Hose - VW # N203711 (Mostly FI Models)
(Can use 5/8" American Emissions Rated Hose)
Other Breather Hoses in 15mm ID, 17mm ID and 19mm ID can also be found
primarily on later Wasser Vanagon Models, but Continental no longer offers
these to the aftermarket at your favorite VW Parts house (except those with
New Old Stock supply), but they can be found at a FLAPS in Emission
(Fuel/Oil Vapor) Rated, such as a Carquest and perhaps an O'Reillys/Kragen
or NAPA in either Gates or Goodyear Brand.  Autozone/Advance Auto is a poor
choice for these, very little correct rated stock.

All hoses listed above are the best in original Continental, Cloth Braided
outside covered (except N202811 - these are smooth neoprene covered).

I would have driven the extra 30 minutes to get the right stuff IMHO. Ya get
what ya pay for :-)
