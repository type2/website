Subject: '71 fuel tank line replacement

Hi everyone,

I tried the archives with little success, lots of information for later bays
and the fuel tank, courtesy of Ratwell and several others, however I have a
'71. I will have my engine out this weekend or next and would like to
refresh the fuel lines that exist behind the firewall in my bus. According
to this diagram at the Bus Boys site,
http://www.bus-boys.com/fueltanks6879.html there are a few fuel lines on the
breather hoses and several gaskets that need to be replaced. Also, the hose
to filler neck hose is NLA, has anyone made a new one recently? What size
are the breather hose lines? I have replaced my fuel lines before too but
cannot remember the size of hose needed. Once I do this I will document it
and put it on my site for future reference.

Looking for list wisdom on this one, as always, much thanks.

Max
