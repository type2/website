Well, no, but you can get carried away with modification
to stock. It's fairly well documented you can fit hydraulic
lifters to a solid lifter cam and vise versa and not suffer.
There is some very small ( not visible to the human eye)
variation in camshaft design from hyd to solid.
It involves the ramp, or entry/exit to the lift function.
The VW FI system was also designed around emissions
requirements, and how much of that matters is up to you
and your local federal smog cop.
That's where the fuel delivery system, small valves and
camshaft come into play. It was not designed to be modified.
I would fit the FI system to what you have.
But you will still need the CHT.
