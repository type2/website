Subject: Re: Is my bus a Westy or not?

Thanks, Adam, John K and John A (who answered offline). Lots o' good
information!

Adam asked: If you have a pop top, does it raise straight up, not hinged at
the rear and open wide at
front?
  It opens wide just behind the front seats, hinged from the back over the
engine.

The interior is vinyl, not plaid cloth?
   Yes, vinyl, Canyon Brown, I believe.

You got a Rivi.
   Interesting!! This opens up a whole 'nother avenue of research! After I did
all that research on Westys now I want to learn more about Rivieras! Please
share links w/history, details, anything.

I will try to post some photos soon and and send a link, though I'm a tad
embarrassed about the state it's in right now. There are some photos in my
facebook page. But it will get better!

Thanks much,
