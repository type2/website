Subject: Re: [T2] compression

Thanks for the support, Robert.   T. P. just has no patience with 
amateurs like me.  And no, I did not do a proper compression check.  I 
was using a borrowed tester and just wanted to prove to him (my 
neighbor) that I did have compression in all four.  The engine was cold 
and it wasn't running worth a damn because of the carb problem.  I guess 
I shouldn't have even posted those numbers.  When I get it running I'll 
check it properly and post the numbers.  Then I'm fair game.  And if 
they're unacceptable, I'll consider my options.  But the bus ran like a 
top when I parked it.
 
Ciao...KR
