firmly strapped to a pallet then build a box around it.
small as possible but don't scrimp

I've had good results with yellow freight.  sorry haven't shipped an 
engine that far but would guess at least $200 with insurance etc.

now if you can find a bus jockey headed that way with some space I'm sure 
some gas money would work.  I've also shipped Amtrak package express but 
not sure about from Ontario might be worth driving to Buffalo to ship it.

YMMV
