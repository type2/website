It's out of spec, but I wouldn't worry about it until you solve your
other problems. Also the compression test is supposed to be run on a
hot engine. Then if you still get low readings, squirt oil into the
spark plug hole to see if the number comes up. If it does, it is the
rings. If it doesn't, it is a valve problem.
