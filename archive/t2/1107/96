Great stuff there.  Thanks for all you help, John.  I'm thinking about 
tearing into it and documenting it with my new digital camera.   'A jazz 
saxophone player rebuilds a Weber carb...'  Might be interesting.  
RAtwell might even be interested.  And think of the royalties...  :) 

About personalities, that's one thing I've always loved about this 
list.  You can ask a stupid question without being made to feel like a 
dumb*ss.  Even if you are a dumb*ass.  But it takes all types and I 
guess I don't mind feeling a little stupid as long as I can get the 
answers I need and get the bus moving again.  And I'm glad my stupid 
questions have re-energized the list.  Can't we all just be friends?  I 
hope to sing Kumbaya around a campfire with all of you guys some day.  
Ciao...KR
