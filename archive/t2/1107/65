	If I recall, Mike is (to put it mildly) a FI enthusiast.  I 
take it his results, summarised above, are from FI engines (probably 
MegaSquirt).   Don't FI engines let in more air than carb'd engines, 
at low power, and regulate the power by injecting less fuel?
	I think it's best to promulgate the simple rule 'throttle 
open while measuring compressions', as it is certainly needed (among 
other conditions) for correct readings on carb'd engines, to make 
sure they get enough air to compress!  If it is not needed for FI 
engines, surely it can't hurt?
