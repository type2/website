Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Fittings

I figured I'd get request for more details, ha.

I will not be using the grill
and the and the heater at the same time.  So from other's comments, it looks
like I'll be fine.

The Propex heater has a 8mm fitting for the gas.  So I
would think 8mm or 10mm copper tubing would suffice.

The install manual calls
for brass compression fittings.
I've seen some websites recommend using
Teflon/PTFE tape with the compression fittings to ensure a good seal, but I
thought this would be unnecessary since the brass olive (compression ring)
deforms the tubing into place and does
not rely on thread sealing.  


Using
some rough conservative numbers shows a pressure drop of 0.2 mbar from the 28
mbar regulator to the heater.
The heater expects 28 mbar so I would imagine
this drop is acceptable.
Or reference I've included the on-line pressure drop
calculator and the calculation for the final bend in the tubing below.

this is actually a complicated theory question,,
and you havn't provided all
the data....
