OK, that explains that. Going from stock dual carbs to FI requires 
some major items. Very small chance of saving any time/money on jury 
rigging a fix rather than just bitting the bullet and retro fit to stock.

Fuel tank return fuel line. Swap in an FI tank or remove and install 
(cut and fit) a return pipe.
Air filter/AFM mount, have to find an FI donar to cut out the mount 
then fit and weld into your van.
ECU mount, cut and fit in stock location. Again, perhaps cut out the 
panel from the donar and fit and weld into yours.

Frankly, I would not do this withour pulling the motor. Both the tank 
update and fliter mount will be much easier to do.

Really, it just takes no more than an hour to pull the motor. You 
will save far more than that in getting this swap done
by making access to the open engine compartment much much easier. And 
before going further, you really should find a stock FI Bus to look 
over very closely all the differences and take some good pix and keep 
notes, so you have a very good idea of just how you will address all 
the considerations.
