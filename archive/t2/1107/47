I'm looking to install a Propex heater in my bus.
The bus already has a stove/grill that runs from butane cylinder.
The fitting basically consists of a butane regulator (28mbar) going to a short length of hose and then to copper tubing leading to the grill.

My question is:
Can I use the existing fittings, but with a brass T-block inserted in the length of  copper tubing to split the gas feed between the grill and heater?  Or will I need a fancier setup?

Thanks,

Josh
