Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Fittings

That's what I did with my Propex, though I replaced the Bus tank with a
Vanagon tank right from the start, then with 2 Vanagon tanks.  Don't expect it
to last long if you got a stock little Bus sized tank for the heat and the
stove.  Best thought for practicality would be find a nice "big" Vanagon tank
and mount on the opposite (which would be the normal in a vanagon) side to run
the Propex.  But there is nothing wrong with a T after the regulator as long
as everything is proper gas compatible plumbing, or at least nothing in the US
with such, don't know anything about mobile gas codes across the ocean...

I'm looking to install a Propex heater in my bus.
The bus already has a stove/grill that runs from butane cylinder.
The fitting basically consists of a butane regulator (28mbar) going to a short
length of hose and then to copper tubing leading to the grill.

My question is:
Can I use the existing fittings, but with a brass T-block inserted in the
length of  copper tubing to split the gas feed between the grill and heater? 
Or will I need a fancier setup?
