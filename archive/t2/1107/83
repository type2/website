I remember seeing that in Bentley, and thinking how nice it was that
VW designed the engine to run at such a high state of wear/low
compression ratio.

I'm with you on the spread though. Being taught in auto shop that 10%
variance is allowed, 44psi variance makes me uncomfortable, but I
agree, the numbers are only something to make you feel bad because as
long as the engine runs passably, I'm not pulling it for a rebuild.

 Can you point us to the source of those specifications? I may be off because
 I have an 81 Air Cooled Vanagon, 2.0 but Bentley says minimum is 73psi, and
 max between cylinders is 44psi.

  I can't go along with a fixed number for max difference, as its a
 percentage that you have to look at, not a number cast in stone.

 I think those are absolute mins, but my van has run for years and years at
 100psi +/- 10 and has no issues at all, great mileage, and moves along fine
 for a big old Van.
