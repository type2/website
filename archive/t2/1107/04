Subject: Re: Is my bus a Westy or not?

On second thought, sorry to all of a sudden doubt myself, but I haven't had
the bus long and it hasn't had the top up all that many times since I've had
it, AND I've been staring at gazillions of photos of Westys so what I remember
could be confused, AND I didn't take any photos of it with the top up, soooo
-- I'm not SURE whether the top raises straight up or is hinged in the back! I
should wait until it's at least close to or above freezing before I try to
raise it again, I'm afraid of breaking things, but will do so soon as I can.

I think we're all pretty sure it's a Riviera, so if that's the case, and they
usually go straight up, mine probably does, too.

Again, thank you for speeding up my learning curve. Now if only I could get
the sliding door to stay in its track...

FYI, I'm not driving the bus yet. An aircooled VW in Alaska in the winter
doesn't make a lot of sense, specially since I have a Subaru to get around, so
it doesn't have a tag or insurance until the snow's gone. Planning to do all
that in April. Getting excited, though!
