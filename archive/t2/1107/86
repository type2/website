On the back cover of the Bentley for the 70's T-II's. I think that 
stops at 79 models. In the text it tells you exactly how to do a 
proper compression test. That is the only procedure that relates to 
the numbers given. Once you get to less than stated minimums, oil use 
goes up and gets dirtier faster, mileage goes down, spark plugs foul 
and give shorter life, and emmission go up, more and more and faster 
and faster, and if you ignore the facts long enough, unto ca-chunk. 
Now you have 3 times the cost to rebuild than if you would have done 
it within a year of reaching the numbers given by those who know more 
than this whole list about that engine.
