Subject: Re: [T2] FI system

No way as far as I'm concerned.  Bob Donalds did a little treatise in the day
on what came stock cam wise in VWoC 2L rebuilds sold to be used for late FI,
and darn near everything went, early cams reground, hydraulics on solid lifter
cams, solids on hydraulics, VWoC would toss anything in there.  I've put
L-jets onto stock 1800s and done just fine with them, and mixed any number of
combinations of stock cams into 2L engines.  It will likely handle it fine. 
This is a bit of a task to get right Timo, but don't lose the faith.  The main
thing you need to find in good shape is the wiring harness, that is the route
of all woes in aging L-jets.  Before install, I go so far as to dissasemble
every pin on every connector (my instructions for home made tool in the
archive) and clean each connector individually, if the components you bought
were running and sound, and you clean the harness and repair anything damaged,
you can get this working nice and
 seamlessly.  Of course you probably could have rolled a Megasquirt as well
for maybe less in Europe, and there is a lot of tuning experience out there
for them on T4s.

But do I really need to change the heads/valves and split the case and
drop in a different camshaft? I thought the FI system will just adapt
to the difference in (probably) volume and inject the proper amount of
fuel, or is this not so simple? If I have to do this, I'll stick to
those darn carbs...
