The specific numbers are somewhat irrelevant.  You can't tell 
compression-ratio from them so as long as they don't vary horribly and 
they're above the rated minimum, having the other plugs off or holding 
the throttle open while you do it really isn't that big of a deal (I 
never held the throttle open and got good readings).  Valves will have 
an affect on numbers and you probably don't want to squirt too much fuel 
into the cylinders to avoid flooding it.  You *will* get weird readings 
with it cold so either crank it for a little while to get some oil 
flowing or pour some oil in to seal the rings.  But if you're not 
getting huge variances, then don't sweat it.  A compression or leak-down 
test is a good diagnostic tool to tell you "hey, this cylinder's messed up".

What might prove helpful is a history of one compression check to 
another previous check - then you should really document the exact 
procedure you used each time.  But otherwise, don't sweat the exact 
numbers - if you didn't calculate your compression ratio at build time, 
the best you can do is take it apart and recalculate it :)
