As in most cases of compromise for convienience, it could well be a 
problem. The advantage of returning the fuel to the tank is, the fuel 
remains cool. With just a T, vapor lock becomes possible from heat 
retention. And as well it will work the fuel pump much more creating 
more heat from more amps used, and on the relay and terminals as 
well, shortening the life of all. Both fuel and electrical flow is affected.

Verify the injectors are producing an evenly atomized cone of fuel. I 
have seen a lot of injector very old and still function nominal. They 
are perhaps the most durable and reliable part in the whole system.

Now I'm confused. The 78 was stock injection. Would seem strange to 
be converting TO injection????
