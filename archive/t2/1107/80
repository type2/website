Good question! Can't find a definitive etymology on the net, but my
guess is a reference to rural poverty, sort of a hillbilly kind of
dig, though I though I think it is a bit too far south to be actual
hillbilly.

It might evoke imagery of a non-motorized cart with the implication
that going downhill is the only time them "po folks" get to move fast.

Interesting article on Truckmusic on the Wikipedia. Has a passing
reference to Georgia overdrive (of course, in driver's ed they told us
not to do that!):
