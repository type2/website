If you look about there are commercial alternatives to make this a little
better with little accumulators that you then T into the line.  Hypothetically
you could run into issues just with a T, but like Greg says, that may well be
more hypothetical than not, I've seen it done both ways.  Anyway little
pressure rated canisters for a dampening effect exist, and oddly I've noted
recently online that sometimes factory ones for FI Triumph TR5s and TR6s go on
*bay for less than commercial ones do, and I haven't looked for a commercial
one recently so my idea of prices are as usual several years back.  I don't
know specifically that those Triumph ones would work, but probably up to the
task, and more common in Europe where original poster is.

I really don't see a need for a fuel return line to the tank. In 2004 I
replaced my carbs with an FI setup and since I didn't have an FI tnk at
the time I spliced the return line into a T made from a spare piece of the
1-2 side fuel rail. This T fitting was installed about 6" from the tank
with fuel from the return line going into the 90 degree side of the T and
the tank and pump inlet are on the flat side of the T.

Fuel pressure is consistently within stock parameters, and it has stayed
that way in weather conditions from -35C to +35C.
