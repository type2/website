This was posted about a month ago on CraigsList. I don't know ANYTHING
about the vehicle and it is a LONG way from where you are. But Rivi's
really don't seem to pop up for sale that often. The ad text doesn't
mention that it's a Riviera so only those who click through would even
know.

Te ad does mention lower panel rust but I have no clue if it's
rust-through or just surface marking.

I'm copying you and the list on this message in case the list eats it
because of the link so you may get 2 copies.
