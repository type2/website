Me too. Though I always cut all text not relevant to my reply, I 
still sometimes get rejection due to excessive original content, and 
even when snipping 90% of the original. That never happened until 
about a week ago. Only happening on maybe 1 in 10 replies, just 
enough to be troubling and for certain some good info is getting 
blocked for no good reason.
