if you get an engine rebuilt, but otherwise the only thing you "really" 
need to do to get it better than what you have is that you will need to 
get the temp sensor II installed near the #3 cyl.  if you are lucky you 
will all ready have the tapped hole there for the sensor. if not it can be 
carefully drilled and tapped, having a head with the hole even if a dead 
one makes getting it right easier.

yes the cams etc are "slightly" different but I am sure a very large 
significant percentage of engine both FI and carb are running with the 
"Wrong" heads and cams it is a very slight difference.
