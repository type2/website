Subject: compression

I just checked my compression as my neighbor seemed to think that I had 
dropped a cylinder.  Here's what I got:

1: 100
2:  90
3: 110
4: 114

Not great but acceptable, if I remember correctly.  I'm going to check 
it again and try to make sure and use the same number of 
revolutions/cylinder. 

Same problem, starts easily but won't idle or take a load.  Seems like 
I'm confirming the carburetor is the problem.  I've poured some Sea Foam 
in the gas tank and let it run a bit then sit overnight.  Today, no 
help.  It must be getting enough gas through the filter by the fuel 
inlet or it wouldn't run like it does.  I'm sure it's a clogged idle 
jet.  Isn't that right behind the idle mixture screw?  Should I just 
squirt some carb cleaner up in that and let her sit a while and try it 
again?  I really don't want to rebuild a carburetor.  I'm going back out 
on ship on April 9th and she'll sit a few more months.  Might have to 
wait until I get back.  Thanks....KR
