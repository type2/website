Subject: Re: [T2] FI system

Hi Volks,

I really don't see a need for a fuel return line to the tank. In 2004 I
replaced my carbs with an FI setup and since I didn't have an FI tnk at
the time I spliced the return line into a T made from a spare piece of the
1-2 side fuel rail. This T fitting was installed about 6" from the tank
with fuel from the return line going into the 90 degree side of the T and
the tank and pump inlet are on the flat side of the T.

Fuel pressure is consistently within stock parameters, and it has stayed
that way in weather conditions from -35C to +35C.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
