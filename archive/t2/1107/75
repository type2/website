You're supposed to use compressed air to blow out the passages in your
carb. Go to FLAPS and get Berryman Chem tool carburetor soak, the one
gallon bucket with the basket for small parts. Don't soak more than a
few hours or it will attack the finish on the carb.

If you change to another carb, you will have to change your intake
too. You can pick up a spare Weber at Pick 'n Pull for $20. They are
common on many cars. Often available at the same price at VW swap
meets.

 the jet be removed that way?  I can't tell from the picture.  I'm sure I'd
 have to accurately count the screw turns in order to get it set back
 correctly.
