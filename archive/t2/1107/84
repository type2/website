	not from my viewpoint (even tho' my own posts don't come thru 
to my computer).  As they might say in a certain large decadent city 
that I don't care if I never visit again:  dead, schmed.

	Sorry, worthy Scott; I can't agree.  It is not all good.  The 
splendid cheerful good-humoured helpfulness characteristic of this 
eclectic bunch of T2 enthusiasts is good; stern humourless dogmatism 
is not good.  I can't stand idly by while T. P.  -  or anyone  - 
injects on this list unsympathetic reprimands to those less 
knowledgeable than himself.  I can behave as if I know more than 
HeyBopAReBopSax of Chattanooga, without condescending to him (that's 
why he's asking for help), let alone rubbishing anybody.  I dare say 
we all know less than T.P; that doesn't give him any right to get 
nasty.
	It is simply not true that any utterance is as good as any 
other.  Some are unpleasant, and I hope people will do their best to 
prevent unpleasantness.

	BTW your conclusion (which I'm disputing) is the wording of a 
road-sign as one enters Richmond, near the old cathedral city of 
Nelson (near Rutherford's birthplace).  This is an official slogan, 
in no context, of the Richmond town council.  I'm embarrassed that 
tourists have to see such a silly slogan.
