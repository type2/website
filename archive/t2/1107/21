Subject: FI system

Hi all,

after all my unsuccessful messing around with my (stock!) dual carb
setup to get acceptable CH temps I scored a deal on a complete (?) FI
system. This is really special here in Germany since buses here have
never been equipped with fuel injection. I guess it's from a US bus
and is apparently complete, besides the double relay.

Part numbers that I could identify (checked on the busboys website) were:
ECU: 022-906-021AE identifying it as a 1978 California manual
Cold Start Valve: 022-906-171B
Throttle Body: 022-133-067C
Rubber "Y" from Center Plenum to Plastic Tube & Power Brake Vacuum
Hose: 022-133-083D  1976-1979 Manual Trans
Auxiliary Air Valve: 022-906-045A  1974-1979
Pressure Regulator - Fuel - : 022-906-035  1974-1979
Resistor Unit: 022-906-079  1975-1978
Air Intake Elbow Boot: 022-129-967AC
Decelerator Valve: 022-133-551B  1976-1978 Manual Trans
Thermo-Time Switch: 043-906-163A  1976-1979
Fuel Injectors: 023-906-031  1974-1979
Fuel Injection Harness
Air Flow Meter: 022-906-301DX  1978-1979

I took a photo of all the stuff:

Am I right, that this is all I need to convert to the FI system
(besides the double relay)?
If I remember correctly, someone on the list used a T in the fuel line
instead of an additional line back to the tank. Is this possible? It
would be a lot easier to go this route.
Are there any schematic drawings or photos online that show all the
hoses and connections and where they go to?
Besides replacing all the rubber fuel lines, what should I do prior to
installing the stuff, e.g., get new injectors, ...?
What about the throttle linkage? Does it have to be re-routed?
Where is the fuel pump located and how are the lines routed through
the firewall?

Thank you very much in advance!
Cheers,
Timo
