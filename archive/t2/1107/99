Sorry, it is not going to be changed (at least not if I have anything to say about it).  The same filter has been in use for at least ten years and it has always performed its function admirably.

Maybe there is some confusion as to the purpose of the filter.  It's not about the bandwidth.  It is about clogging the archives with redundant information.  A big part of this list's usefulness is the contribution of information to the list archive.  If the archive contains ten quoted copies of every post, searching becomes cumbersome and frustrating.

If we want more list traffic, let's post more repair descriptions, trip reports and the like rather than posting more quoted material.

Why don't we start a thread similar to the one on theSamba about what you have done for your bus lately?  I'll start.
