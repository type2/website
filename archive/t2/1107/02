Subject: No propane at my stove??

So last summer all was well with my stock 77 Westy factory propane tank/stove setup. This year I went out to give it a test, opened up my tank valve, then went inside to turn on a stove ring. Nadda. Nothing at that end. My regulator has a knurled ring that is spring loaded (excuse my poor knowledge of this) that you can wind back a bit, and propane hissed out from here. I wound it back down, (this is NOT the on-off valve that closes the tank), to where it should be, so there is propane in the tank, yet it does not get up the hose to the burners inside. I'm assuming there is a problem with the regulator, but am too ignorant to know for sure. Does anyone know their way around these things? My local propane fellow wants a 100 dollars just to LOOK at it!!! but of course he's the man with the ticket. :-/ Maybe I should buy him an eye patch?? and teach him to say Arrrrhh!!!! :-)
