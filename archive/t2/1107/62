So, do you think I can get something up inside the idle jet (I have a 
long hat pin that might be useful) without even taking the carb off?  Or 
could the jet be removed that way?  I can't tell from the picture.  I'm 
sure I'd have to accurately count the screw turns in order to get it set 
back correctly.  Thanks, Tom...KR
