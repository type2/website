I'm glad you reminded us of that Kevin because that reminds me of
something I was told by a friend who is a long-time VW engine builder,
as well as builder of VW engines for aircraft, and an old Edelbrock
engineer who designed many of their carbs back in the day.

I had a bus in a similar situation as yours, and he told me that
because the engine had sat so long that the rings will have taken a
set and so the engine would have to be broken in again like a new
engine before the rings were right again.

Also, since the bus ran so well, it is not likely that there is
anything more serious than gummed up fuel in the carb and / or fuel
pump. Try a fuel pressure and volume test before you tear apart the
carb.
