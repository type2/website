Subject: Looking for a Riviera Camper Bus .::Salem, Oregon::.

Hello!

  A friend of mine recommended that I post to the mailing list looking for a
bus. I have had a classified want ad on Samba for about a month, but with no
leads as of yet.

I am looking for a rust free bus.
The condition of the paint is not an issue, neither is the color. (I will be
painting the bus in and out first thing)
I am looking for either a Riviera or a Westfalia. (Although I may take
interest in other camper models, Rivi is the most appealing at the moment.)

I am hoping that the wiring is clean.
As for the engine/transmission... If your bus is located out of state (WA,
CA, ID, NV, MT, or BC) it needs to be drive-able. If it is in Oregon and
within 100 miles, just a body is fine.

I prefer that the interior is mostly complete. Options are a plus.

Feel free to email me directly.
If you have ads up, links are welcome.
If not, some photos would be great!

Many thanks,
