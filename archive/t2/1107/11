	          One old arcane subtle trick, when you've got the 
engine running as fast as you can (tho' poorly), is to disconnect the 
aircleaner and then hold your palm over the carb air intake till the 
engine almost stalls; take your hand away; let it rev up again; and 
repeat the cycle.  Based not on any analysis or theory that I'm aware 
of, but on an 'olde mechanics myth', this procedure can sometimes 
somehow cough loose this or that  ...
	I've known this mystic caper to cause a long-stopped engine 
to settle down to smooth running.
	I suppose it couldn't hurt to have a CO2 extinguisher handy.
	Give it a go!

P.S  For some more safety, it could be good to wear a leather or 
other tough glove in case of burning blowback.
