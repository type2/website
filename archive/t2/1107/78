	I can assure you, from experience, that a carb motor with the 
throttle closed can give *drastically* low compression readings, 
which come right as soon as you open the throttle.  I've sold the 
Renault 10 (Solex carb) on which I had that briefly worrying 
experience, and along with it the annotated workshop manual in which 
I recorded the figures, but the first batch were in the region of 80 
psi or perhaps even worse, with worrying variance between them; and 
when an old hand put me right and I measured them again they were up 
around 130.
	So I reiterate: it can't hurt to build 'open throttle' into 
the rules for measuring compressions.  Can't hurt, can it?
