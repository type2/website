Okay, now I'm a bit worried:
Of course I need to drop the engine, since anything (except maybe
changing the oil) is easier with engine removed.
But do I really need to change the heads/valves and split the case and
drop in a different camshaft? I thought the FI system will just adapt
to the difference in (probably) volume and inject the proper amount of
fuel, or is this not so simple? If I have to do this, I'll stick to
those darn carbs...
Thanks for all the help,
Timo
