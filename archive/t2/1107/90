Hi all,
thanks for all the valuable input! Seems like I have some work ahead
of me, but nothing un-doable:
- get a FI tank or modify an exitsting one for a second outlet/inlet.
- I found the temp sensor, so I only have to tap a hole near #3.
- get a double relay
- get an Air filter/AFM mount
- cut an opening for the ECU
- modify the rear tin piece or get an FI tin piece to allow the
accelerator cable and fuel line to pass through
- change transmission carrier to an FI one to allow the accelerator
cable to pass through
- find a place to put the pump
Thank you again for your help, as always appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
