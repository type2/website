At no time was I emotional at all. I think when some people see facts 
they don't like, they interpret it as anger or some other emotion 
from their own mind. I'm cool with the facts, and if I see facts that 
make me angry, I know it's me, not the facts, that is angry.

What does tend to raise my irr is when some asshat thinks it is their 
duty to demand I agree with them, when I know clearly they have 
presented no facts at all, and their solution is contrary to both my 
experience and the Bentley. I don't let such crap go very far. I got 
a delete button solution for that kind of stink. Half second fixes 
are delovely. Put some blue paint on the delete key so it is easy to 
find with your rose colored glasses, and when you see my name on a 
post, zip/bam/boom, solve your problem in a heart beat.
