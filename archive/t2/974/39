Subject: Re: [T2] 1968-1971 Gas gauge sender - tech info

I am guessing that mine "works" but not well. When I fill up the tank, the needle goes to full. However, when I start to get toward 2/3 or 1/2 tank the needle then sinks down to empty - strange.


Anyone else have a gauge and sender that do this?

Oh, mine is a '75 Riv, but I don't know if that really makes a difference.
