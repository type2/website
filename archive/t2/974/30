Subject: Re: [T2] rpm and dwell meter

Do you need any dwell meter, really? Timing is WHEN the spark is (turn 
the distributor to time).  Dwell is HOW LONG-a function of the gap in 
the points at the highest point of the lobes.   So with a simple 
voltmeter set to continuity buzzer (or even a test light) and some 
knowledge of geometry of a circle, one can figure dwell either on a 
distributor or by marking 50 degrees on your crank fan (type 4 engine) 
or pulley wheel on an upright engine?!.
