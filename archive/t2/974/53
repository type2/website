Any vw parts store with a tool section should have one. This one is the most common:

It's a copy of the original tool that's been modified to fit both styles (one side 6V, one side 12V).

It's inexpensive ($7) but I find it doesn't work that great by itself as seen by the box wrench I used to keep it in place:

Sold by EMPI/Bugpack/etc:
