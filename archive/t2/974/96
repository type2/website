Subject: Thank You List Members!

Thanks to Ratwell, Jamie, Greg Potts and Karl for the advice on the Vanagon
Alloys!  This list never ceases to amaze me with it's collective knowledge.


Although I had to set aside 2 alloys that were out of round, I managed to
get 4 good ones for the bus.  I'll have to send those to get reworked.

Take a look:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/pnoceanwesty/

I found out sadly that Continental Vanco -8's (185 R14C's 102-100Q) won't
fit smoothly in the spare tire slot in the Westy.  Have to leave the bottom
hanging out.  Bummer!

Thanks again, guys!  Ready for thr trip to Buses by the Beach tommorrow!
