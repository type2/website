	I recently tried to close the net to similar effect.  Good

	and of other, normally slow-varying, influences (e.g shape of 
cam, state of fibre heel, etc)

	Recent archives tell all  --  well, much  -- on dwell.

	My favourite by far is the AM (pref battery) radio tuned 
off-station  -  that noise will be punctuated at contact-break by the 
same phenomenon exploited by Telefunken for the first U-boat 
transmitters.  A spark emanates radio, and your points will emit most 
freqs of radio when they break.  It's only a tiny spark (if your 
capacitor is OK) but can be picked up on any 'free' AM freq.
	Feeler gauges or similar concepts are stupid by comparison. 
Forget them.  Your Unca Robt, so rarely dogmatic, is getting totally 
imperious here.
