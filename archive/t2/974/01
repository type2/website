Subject: rear latch on sliding door

Lately the rear latch has been getting harder to close. the  latch just
doesn't seem to want to cooperate. By that I mean I have to give the handle a
"firm" yank to close the latch by pulling up on the handle after the door has
been closed.

The door lines up well , no gaps anywhere, it just seems that this might be a
maintenance issue.

Any ideas on adjusting this? is this an adjustment on the inside of the door?

Thanks,

Trey
