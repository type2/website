Ed, Better to reset your distributor drive gear to its correct position, then install the SVDA. Otherwise, you can run into an issue of not being able to time it due to your vac can hitting the crank case breather when it needs to go more counterclockwise.  Due to the wires being in the wrong position with John's method, you'll need to crank the dizzy just past where the vac can hits the crankcase, in order to time it well.  Do it the right way, just reset your drive gear and that way your wires can be on their correct spots and your distributor will be in the correct position with the vac can between the crankcase and shroud.  Better if someone else looks at your bus too. My 2 cents. As me how I know. See Bentley or Ratwell for positioning of the drive gear. Hope this help.  -Chris
