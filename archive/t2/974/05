Subject: Hitting the garage roof no more.

I just spent the night removing the Riviera pop-up from my van.  It  
was a lot easier than I thought it would be.   Now that it is off, I  
can see rust spots that were hidden by the top that need my  
attention.  Also there is a rip in the fiberglass that I can now fix.

So for the next few months, I'll have the worlds largest sun roof.   
I'm hoping that the weather holds, but if it doesn't, I can at least  
get the van in the garage now.
