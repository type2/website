Hi Maira,

Is that click coming from the starter? Check for voltage at the +  
terminal of the coil when the key is on. If there is none, then you  
have an ignition switch/wiring issue.

If you do have voltage at the coil, check for voltage at the starter  
terminals. If no voltage at the ignition wire connected to the  
starter then there is an issue with the ignition switch.

It shouldn't make any difference if the van was in gear when towed  
since the rear wheels would be off the ground the whole time.

At the base of the steering column is a rubber bushing. If it is torn  
or damaged it could account for the play in the steering.


Happy Trails,
