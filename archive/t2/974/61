If you're trying to get it in easier, it won't make a bit of difference. 
  If it does, then it's probably too loose of a fit anyways.  The 
easiest thing to do is take the old race (after you've hammered it out) 
and grind the OD down a bit so that you can use it as a mandrel to press 
the new one in (ungreased) with a vice.  Just make sure that you protect 
any exposed surfaces (with cardboard or a piece of wood or something) 
when pressing the races in or out.
