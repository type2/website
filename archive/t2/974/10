Subject: cold star valve query

on my FI 75 engine i'm running a little rich on start up and idle.
nose tester only, no real exhaust sniffer.  i will obviously adjust
the mixture incrementaly first, but i was wondering what harm would be
done if i bypassed the cold start valve by running a bit of fuel hose
from the fuel rail on the drivers side to the passenger side?  this
would eliminate the cold start valve altogether.  i would plug up the
plenums on the cold start injector in case it is leaking so air  would
not be sucked in.  the CS valve is just difficult to access and i'm
lazy.  will i be doing irreprible harm to anything?  should i just do
it right the first time and not mess w/ this?


temps are in the humid 60's-80's.  stupid stl weather.


TIA,
jeremiah
