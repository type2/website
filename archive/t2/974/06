Subject: [T2]sliding door lock 73

how do you get the door lock to work on a 73 westy?
  everything looks fine and by the bentley it should lock but it dont?
  what can i do to fix that?
  its easier to use the slding door for access than the drivers door but must be able to lock the slding door back behind me after i get in... cant lock it from inside just the outside with key???????????
