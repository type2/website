Subject: Van towed, now won't start

I have a '73 bus which was recently towed for some unpaid tickets. I have it back now, but it won't start despite many hours spent under the dashboard deciphering cryptic wiring diagrams... Help!

Here are some relevant details: 
*Just makes a "click" sound when key is turned
*Towers began towing from the front but then switched to a rear tow when a concerned "witness" told  them frontal tow was a bad idea.(I wasn't there or I would have jumped into my van and refused to get out like the crazy dame that I am. It worked once, anyway! :)
*Van was in gear when towed.
*Steering lock is no more since the tow and steering column seems somehow looser than before
*Turn signal switch was in a state of "mid-replacement" when the tow happened, so I was already a little confused on the wiring up there...

My mechanically inclined friends and I have tinkered with (actually replaced) the starter and the battery is new. I'm really suspecting a ignition switch problem. Could the towing trauma have caused this damage? What happens when a van like mine is towed from the rear while in gear?

I'm a "newbie" at this stuff. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!
