Subject: Oil Cooler nut torque

Related to the [T2] Vanagon Alloys on a Bay thread -
Last night, I was replacing the oil cooler seals on my '78 and I came up
against the 5 ft lbs torque specifications.  I just did not feel 5 ft lbs
was enough.  so I tried to increase the torque a bit at a time, and when I
got to 7.5 ft lbs, I got a bit worried.

I did have a bad experience with oil cooler seals on another bus.  I torqued
the nuts to 5 ft lbs and that was that.  Until I started the engine...

Well, it seems the oil cooler was slightly hung up somewhere, perhaps on the
threads of the three skinny studs, or what  ever..   but the oil cooler
seals were no where seated and there was blue sky (light) visibility when
you looked underneath and it was obvious.

This time I checked for a visible seating, which I could see on the bottom
seal (cooling tin was not removed, engine in bus), but I was not comfortable
with such a light torque.  I believe I did see a difference between 5 ft lbs
and 7.5 ft lbs in the bottom oil cooler seal's compression.

So, am I a bad person (related to this story, please...) or did I do some
damage I will regret later (as opposed to some damage which I will be joyous
about later, or some damage I will regret sooner, or ...)

PS.  Oh, yes, the wife appreciates that I was replacing the oil cooler seals
on Mother's Day instead of taking her out to dinner.  I was served cold rice
for dinner!!!!  For that, I accept that I am a 'bad  person'.  And she
wouldn't help me bleed the brakes, either..
