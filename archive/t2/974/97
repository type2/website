Chai:

I have a complete 73 sliding door latch assembly in my
hands and I have been playing with it to see why your
inside button does not move.

Try this: open your sliding door. Flip the rear latch
two clicks counter-clockwise. [like you are closing
the door and it is engaging the catch]

Now look at the front edge. You should only see the
lower piece sticking out. Try the button. It should
not move. Correct?

Now lift up the outer handle. Watch the front edge of
the door. The upper piece should come out when you
lift teh handle. Correct? 

If yes, push the button down. It will move now.
Correct?

If the upper piece is out and even with the lower, the
button moves. If it does not, your latch is bad.
