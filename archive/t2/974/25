Subject: rpm and dwell meter

Over the last few years I have used the Equess tack/dwell meters and found the 
meter barfs out almost every year.

This year my movement stuck high.

Wondering is anyone has a suggestion for a better one for a reasonable price.

I don't think i need shop grade for a yearly set up.
