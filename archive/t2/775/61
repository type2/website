Subject: Postmortem on my 73

Looking back I see EXACTLY what happened to my bus.

First 95 degree day that I actually drove anywhere but work and home.
That's when my Pertronix crapped out. Then a few days after switching
to points he starts bucking and acting like it's out of gas. Lots of
time swapping fuel lines, filters, switching to an electric pump, etc.
Nothing. Then I discover the stripped intake studs. So there's THAT
fiasco.

But the fix was simply supplying more juice to the coil.

What I think happened was there was LOTS of stuff being driven off
that + wire to the coil from the ignition switch. 2 chokes, 3
solenoids (one is capped off), the Mallory HyFire, and the Pertronix.
Not to mention the coil and spark.

It was enough to kill the 30 year old wiring.

The Pertronix probably died due to power spikes and brownouts on the
circuit. So it's not the fault of Pertronix. (I'm going to write them
and offer to pay for the replacement they sent.) The electric pump I
added certainly didn't help things since it's powered off the same
circuit.

Today I added a 30A relay and all 10 gauge wiring. When I replace my
ignition switch I'll replace the wiring so I can pull out the relay.
But it works for now. I'm also showing some fuel starvation symptoms
due to the Facet so that is going to get pulled out and I'll reconnect
the mechanical pump soon. That Facet can't keep up with dual Solex
carbs at 3400 rpm and WOT for more than 10 seconds or so, like when
climbing a hill or accellerating to get on the freeway.

The helicoil I used on the intake stud bosses is working beautifully.
The right angle drill attachment was outstanding. It worked so well
I'm half tempted to drill out the remaining bosses just to make sure.
LOL! (Not really.)

Thanks guys for the support and especially Tom for suggesting the
jumper. The GWB is clean and happy again!
