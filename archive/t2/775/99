Try looking in antique shops or flea markets for old VW ads from 
magazines. Preferably larger-format mags like Life. I have several of 
these framed and hanging in my house. You not only get a nice pic of a 
VW, you get a little slice of their excellent advertising style as 
well!
Good luck with your search!
