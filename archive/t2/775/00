Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

I'm with Dave. Get to know your neighbors. I work on my bus in the back 
alley. The guy who lives across the alley is an old Korean war vet and 
retired farmer. Whenever I work on Kermit he comes out and asks what I'm 
doing to "Hitler" this time. Then he settles down to watch and talk. He's a 
really great old fart. Even through all of my figuring out vacuum leaks and 
backfires (which were numerous!) there have been no complaints about the 
bus. And I think there are about 15 VWs, bugs and busses, in the whole 
county. We're out in Eastern Coloraado which is staunchly conservative. 
We're sort of a curiosity to most folks out here. So, Don, you can work on 
your bus out here any time! It's only about 90 miles from you.
