No, it's part of the fuel circuit, not sure what to call it, like a
jet or an emulsion tube. The fuel goes from the bowl through the main
jet into the carb body and goes through this long brass piece on its
way to the venturi. At the top side of the venturi you see just the
top of it, looks like a little brass disc with a tiny vent hole in the
middle of it.

 I'll go look though. I haven't paid much attention to that carb other
than checking for vacuum leaks and float level. Maybe it's time to
 tear it down.
