Subject: Re: [T2] Chirping exhaust

Hi,

Just removed the rocker arms on both sides and checked the 8
accessible bolts. All except the front most bolt on the drivers side
(near #3) were within spec. And that one was pretty darn close.

Just waiting for the engine to fully cool then a valve adjust and a
test drive. I'm doubtful that re torquing that one bolt will fix the
problem but I'm hopeful.

Still open to other suggestions.

Thanks
peace!
