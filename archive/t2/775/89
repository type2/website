Subject: [T2] 71 Westy Cheap

Volks,

Due to an unexpected change of assignment  (I'm in the Army) I need to move
to Texas in less than two weeks, I can't move my family and 3 vehicles
within that time, so my 71 Westy needs to go. I'm asking $1600, which is
less than what I paid for it when it wasn't running. The engine was rebuilt
about 2 years ago, and has approx 5k miles on it ( I went ot Iraq for a
year, so it sat that long). It drives great. Very little rust, cab floor was
fixed/replaced. New battery tray, new seals on all windows. Nice westy
interior. It does need a paint job and the pop-up canvas.The catch is, I
need to sell prior to the 5 of August, that is why I'm selling cheap. Photos
available. The bus is located in northern Virginia. Please email me off the
list for more information. Thanks

Victor
