Subject: Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

What a coincidence.  I have just returned from moving my
bus having been parked for less than two days, a hundred
yards up my street.  My condos are being painted, so to
avoid any overspray I parked well away from the complex.

I spoke with two of my neighbors, whom I've never met.
The bus was parked in front of their houses for a day or
two this week.  They recognized the bus from their walks
in the 'hood.  No problem.  One even offered to save me
a space on the street.

This afternoon I found a handwritten note taped well to
the driver's window.  It seems as though the third house
I've parked in front of didn't like that I blocked the
Friday morning street sweeping.  (There are no "street
sweeping-no parking" signs on our street, btw.)  In script
I wrote a friendly note on the back of my neighbor's
note explaining the painting work and how it won't last
but one more week.  I also offered to sweep the street
in front of their property w/my phone number.  Noone was
home, so I put it in the mail slot of their front door.
