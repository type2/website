Subject: ignition switch part #

List,

I have to wrench on my key to make the electrical connection to start the
bus.

Is this the part number I want to replace:

171-905-865(MY)

The MY is a manufacturer code on the B.D. website.  There is a one dollar
price difference between this part and the plain 9-digit number.  Any diff?

Billy
M'boro, TN
76 bus
