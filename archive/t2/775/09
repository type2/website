Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

I guess to put in my 2 cents on this whole neighborhood fiasco...
 My neighbor across the street has a bug, and a few houses down they have a
baja (this neighbor also has about 16 dirt bikes and his boys like to ride
them up and down the street all day)
BTW we live in Hillsboro, or about 20 minutes from downtown Portland, we
don't live in an expensive neighborhood/house and live 5 minutes from
downtown Hillsboro and 5 minutes from the country...that's not saying much
for Hillsboro though... :)
 Between my fiancee and I we own:
'71 vw Riviera - mine
'71 vw Super beetle - mine but will soon be going to the neighbor across the
street
'84 AMC Eagle station wagon - mine
'87 Toyota 4wd truck - ours
'88 Toyota 4wd truck - frame rusted - not running
'89 Mustang - his - not running
and our motorcycles:
'96 TW 200 - mine
'83 TT250R - mine - project not running
'91 KX 125 - his
'81 Suzuki GS550 - his
 We have the most vehicles per person on our block, and of course try to
keep it cleaned up and in the garage or at least in the backyard if needed.
We know and like all of our neighbors, heck between my other 2 vw neighbors
we help each other, whether its just a hand or a tool (heck i even borrowed
one of their dirt bikes one weekend).
  This is my funny little story regarding noise and neighbors:
 One day i was testing my air horn before I put it on the bus, and I
overheard the older couple next door talking. The woman was saying, "...what
is that noise?....is our VCR making noise?... ..Is that the Microwave?..."
I had to go over and apologize and explain what i was doing, they were
totally ok with it, but until I told them they had NO clue as to what it
was, and was checking all their appliances in the house :) Ooops
 But I always tell them to let me know if my music is too loud, or if I am
bothering them, and I think they appreciate the fact that I say that, even
though they have never had to say anything, and i play my favorite rock
station when working on the bus late in the evening, they don't mind :)
 So i guess my point is, is to get friendly with your neighbors, and offer
to turn it down if they ask you, or to let you know if you are making too
much noise. Also offering your expertise or assistance when they need it,
whether its car help, or even just a hand with something. We even hosted a
BBQ and invited all the neighbors, there is nothing like enticing them with
food :)
 Good luck!
