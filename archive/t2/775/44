Subject: Altrernator shorting out?

On my 74 Westy, the wire that goes between the alternator and the battery
keeps burning in two (second time)

I didn't know why the charging light came on, now I do.  When I soldered
the wire back together, the van started right up and the charging light
was not lit.

I shut it off, walked away to go work on the tractor and I saw loads of
smoke in the air.  I ran back to the van only to see the wire burnt in
two!

Is it possible that there is a short in the alternator when it is off? 
This is not indicative of the voltage regulator is it?

Any and all help would be most appreciated.

Mark
