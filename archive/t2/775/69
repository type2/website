No. The few things I saw were priced well but just didn't interest me. This
item caught me eye a while ago when they ran it for $140, and for that price
I passed. But for $99 I ordered one today, even though I don't have an
immediate need for it. I hesitated and almost cleared my shopping cart, but
ultimately couldn't resist the bargain. :-) For that price, if I can't find
a use for it sooner or later, I'll pass it on someone who can. Seems like a
really cheap way for someone to get into in-car MP3, without having to deal
with the tiny buttons on a portable unit while driving. These things are
really going down in price. I think CD is just about ready to go the way of
the 8-track as a car audio format.
