Hi Don,

Sounds like a fuel flow issue.

Is the fuel tank outlet blocked? Is the fuel tank vented to the  
atmosphere?  I used to have an outboard motor that ran fine at first  
and then started running rough just as you got a half-mile offshore.  
When I loosened the filler cap to check for debris in the tank I  
heard a definite whoosh as the vacuum was released. The engine  
restarted after that and ran perfectly for another half-mile.... All  
I needed was a new filler cap on the fuel tank.

Something else to think about...


Happy trails,
