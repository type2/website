Off the top of my head I'd say your solenoid is sticking (you found
that) and shorting or drawing too much current for that wire to
handle.

Replace the starter. Replace the wire.

Where in CO are you? There are a few of us scattered around Boulder
and Denver Metro (Aurora and I'm in Highlands Ranch).

Wait a minute... You wouldn't happen to have the red & white one would you?
