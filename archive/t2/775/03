Thanks George.

It's this Highlands Ranch mentality here I think. They're mostly
California expatriates. In fact the Colorado locals call the whole
city "Little California". Shoot, the developer of the city was the
Mission Viejo Company from Cali.

I should have known better than to move into this neighborhood. Sigh.
Can't wait until my lease is up...
