I think I can speak for a LOT of bus people who are VERY glad that you
did. Your subsequent contributions to the world of internet VW bus
information have been, and I'm sure will continue to be, very helpful to a
lot of us...
thanks!
(And thanks to Bus Depot as well - I've ordered a lot of stuff from them,
never had a problem, and always right on time)
And heck, while I'm gushing, thanks to the list all around - there are
some smart, helpful, and all around great folks out there that I've met in
my 11 years of internet bussing, dating all the way to the old
Vanagon(-at-)lenti list back in 1994...
Group hug!!!
