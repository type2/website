Oh well. The other thing that happened to mine that caused a similar
symptom was that the little brass disk you see in the middle of the
throat as you look down the right carb broke off and went through the
engine. Couldn't get the rest of the part out, so had to change carb
bodies. Too much of a fluke to be likely in your case too....

 Yes, I did. Thanks.

 And I forgot to mention that I also slathered black silicone on all
 the balance tube connections just to see. :-(
