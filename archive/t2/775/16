Subject: One Week to go until BOTC 2005

Hi Volks,

There's just seven more sleeps between now and BOTC 2005. I'm gonna  
be a very busy guy getting all the last minute details nailed down  
over the next week, but I will be on vacation so I hope to be able to  
stay on top of it. And there's also a first-rate committee backing me  
up on things this year so it'll run smoothly despite me. I hope.

Whassup? If you're planning on attending please take note of the  
following details:

**T-Shirt Orders are now closed. Adam got lots of orders and will  
distribute them at the event.

**Belle has several bookings for the "House of Pain", but if you're  
interested in some body art she can still fit you in.  Email  
raspbelle_AT_rogers.com and tell her what you're looking for.

**The Bus Driving Challenge will be limited to 20 participants this  
year. At the moment we do not have a "donor ride", unless this  
changes the event will be BYOB. P-mail me if you'd like to volunteer  
your ride for our convenience. Sign up for the challenge will open  
right after Adam finishes his Breakfast Burrito.

**If you're planning on enjoying the Tie-Dye workshop be sure to  
bring a Shirt or whatever. I will have a limited quantity of cheap  
white shirts available on-site for $5-7 (Cash Only). If you want to  
pre-order a specific size please p-mail.

**The Pan-Am Jam now has arranged enough gear to bring the volume to  
Eleven between 2 and 5 PM. Come prepared to Rock.

**Assistants to help with the Kids Activities are still needed... P- 
Mail me if you are interested.

**If you can bring some Firewood it would be appreciated. We've had  
some rain recently so a fire ban is very unlikely.
