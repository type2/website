Subject: Re: [T2] ignition switch part #

Richard,

Not to be dense, but this is the part, not the lock cylinder or anything else
labeled "ignition"

or,

This is what's being replaced on the web page you're mirroring from (D.
Schwarze?) somebody else on replacing the switch?

Is it the only thing I should replace while in there, beside the tamper proof
bolt?

Meyle is right, there's no pictures of the swithes on the BD site, is the
better one the one that is 6 bucks rather than 5?
