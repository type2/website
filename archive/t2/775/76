Subject: Re: [T2] Postmortem on my 73

Curious. We got the gold colored round one from Autozone. It failed on
our first trip. Our local VW mech told us to use facet instead. Had no
trouble with 70 mph on the freeway with our 2L equipped 72, with
occassional 80mph running when running late. Webber progressive on
that one.

due to the Facet so that is going to get pulled out and I'll reconnect
the mechanical pump soon. That Facet can't keep up with dual Solex
carbs at 3400 rpm and WOT for more than 10 seconds or so, like when
climbing a hill or accellerating to get on the freeway.

 Always knew it was junk but now I have a real reason to hate it.
