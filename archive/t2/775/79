Thanks for responding Jason and Don.Engine was at TDC #1 cylinder and rotor
pointing at notch in the distributer when I pulled the old distributer
out.Vacuum can on new one wont let it notch in distributer anywhere near to
having the rotor point at it at TDC #1.The whole thing just looks
backwards.It does run like it is though.Just when you are at TDC for the #1
cylinder  the rotor doesnt point to the notch on the dizzy.Its actually 180
degrees out.So are the guys at aircooled.net on vacation? Three days and two
emails to the customer service email address and no response.
