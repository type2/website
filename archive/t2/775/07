Subject: Dellorto up-date kit

CB Performance offers an update kit for the Dellorto DRLA's.  If I remember right it is a horizontal discharge kit which improves mid range performance and efficiency, also reduces the plugged idle jet problem.  They don't make the kit for the DRLA 36, only for the 40's and 45's-that blows, because most of us that run the Dellorto's use the 36's.  I have another set of 40's  and was thinking about installing them just for kicks and giggles....

Anyone install the update kit on their carbs and can rave about it or say it is not worth it?

 

Thanks, Paul.
