That is cerainly very interesting. Reading your posts one gets the
impression you have been doing this a very long time, and I sometimes
felt awkward stepping in to answer posts when I had only been doing
bay window buses for about 2 1/2 years (3 now). So it's interesting to
see you've only been at it a little longer than me. Of course the
really wonderful thing you have done is to photo document your work
and write up articles and establish a web site.
