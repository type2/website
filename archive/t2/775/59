I just pulled my three rears off my 72 to replace with 2 sliders and a
solid and took them up to bus boys. Walter was surprised they weren't
rusted out (how do you make a past tense out of a color? ;-)

I think it's more the lack of knowledge and finding support. Many are
building type 4's for a little over $1000, which is very reasonable
compared to engines for other kinds of vehicles. The trouble is people
don't know where to go. Everyone tells them they won't work on them,
or quote them a prohibitive price, so they feel abandoned as owners of
a vehicle which to them appears to be non-supported.
