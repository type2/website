Barry Burneskis and I went down to have a look at this bus and I have to
recommend it.  The body is very straight and it has very minimal rust.
It is beyond my needs (one person with four buses... do I qualify as a
"bus farmer" yet?), but I do recommend this bus.

The positives are:

Straight (nose is original and has never been hit)
Original paint color (bright red!)
Westfalia with all cabinets present
Runs, with current inspection sticker
The only rust that will need attention soon is in the sliding door track

The negatives:
Some minor lumps and bumps on the body
  rear engine hatch, lower drivers side has an odd ding in it
needs pop-top canvas

I did not evaluate the engine at all, but it's the standard 1600DP.

I suggested that I would be willing to drive it to TX for him if he'd fly
me back and if it does not sell, that may be what happens.

Barry took a bunch of pictures and I was going to post them but Bloody
Olympus has changed their card and cord formats in the last year or two
and we had no way to transfer them to my computer :-(  I may get over to
his place this afternoon and will pick them up and post them.
