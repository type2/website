Subject: Re: [T2] Chirping exhaust

Hi,

The sound is emanating from the tailpipe. If I put my hand in front of
the exiting exhaust the sound becomes a muffled chirp.

Retorquing the one very slightly loose head nut out of the 8 I could
easily get at did not resolve the chirp.

Also points, timing, valves all readjusted and verified, chirp still happens.

The engine runs great otherwise. I've already driven about 2000 miles
with the chirping and everything is still working great.

peace
jules
