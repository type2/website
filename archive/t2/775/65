 Hey, Karl, how big's your yard? I'd love to swap into a rust-free body!!

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
I just went junk-yarding...... 2 bays showed up.  The 76 was not too bad, body wise. Someone already snatched 
the transaxle. 2.0 FI...... early 76 with the 6 pin AFM etc.

The other yard has a very nice 74, still 100% complete. No rust, no dings, no dents. Has an 1800 with a center 
mount Weber. Next weekend is 1/2 price at that yard..... I am going to grab the engine if it is still there. 
Piece it out...... Even has the rock-n-roll rear seat.... they are getting very scarce.
Most people don't even know what a rock-n-roll seat is, no it is not the Westy bed seat or the Z-Bed seat.

No, my yard can't stand to have another vehicle in it ;(
Code enforcement is on my butt when I put my bus on jack stands!!!
