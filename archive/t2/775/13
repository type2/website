Remove and reinstall the shock bolts and nuts.

I had this exact same issue with the rear right upper shock mount. It
appeared tight, but a torque wrench told me otherwise. So I pulled it
apart, cleaned the threads, applied a bit of loctite, and reinstalled
with a torque wrench. I forget the spec, but Bentley should have it.

Thump went away.
