Subject: Re: [T2] Fried wire solenoid to alternator

I am in Colorado Springs.  And yes, I do have a red & white bus... But I
haven't been over to the Denver area recently.  How did you know??

OK.   If my starter motor is OK should I replace both starter & solenoid?
Or just the solenoid?  It seems if I'm going to go to all the trouble to
take it out I should replace both, but it's $$.  Maybe I can find somebody
to buy my old starter to rebuild...

Anyway, yeah, I will need to replace the wire and to do that (it definitely
leads down into the alternator and is fried all the way) do I need to remove
the alternator also?

Thanks!!
