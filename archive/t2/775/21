Subject: Question about Sodium Exhaust Valves on 1600's

Hi,

Can sodium filled exhaust valves be fitted on a 1600 engine? If so,
how could I know if a PO had made such a modification without
extensive engine teardown?

OK, this is a stupid question but I can't find the answer illustrated
in Bently. Which of the valves are the exhaust and which are the
intakes? I'm pretty sure the #1 and #3 exhaust valves are the ones
toward the front (front is front), correct? For #2 and #4 are they the
valves toward the read of the vehicle?

thanks
jules
