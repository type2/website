Subject: Re: Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

Thanks for the comments and support everybody!

Two things I should mention:
#1: I live in an apartment. This makes things sticky. Heck, I don't
even know where all the DOORS are around here! Everybody uses their
garages to get into the apartment.

#2: I felt bad for jumping down the cop's throat. But in my defence,
his first comment was, "you don't live here do you?" That right there
was enough to set me off. Heck, my salary is probably higher than 90%
of the tenants. The only reason I'm always broke is because my wife
can't work so my salary supports a family of 4.
