Subject: Camper Converter Issues

I have a 1977 Westfalia that I recently acquired and ran into some auxiliary
battery trouble on our 2nd camping trip. It appears to be a virtually stock,
though there is a hook-up for a trailer (..as if I could pull one here in
Colorado).
I ran the diagnostics that I could find from bBartno Tekb and may have
identified the problem, but I wanted run the voltages by folks and see what
anyone else thought.
The auxiliary battery in a Marine Deep Cycle battery. Herebs the various
voltages I recorded with a multimeter:

I plugged into 110V.

City Power on.
Fridge off.
Recharge Timer off.
Battery test shows Good (..multimeter across the terminals of auxillary
battery 13.8)
Converter breaker switch on.
------Voltage from red wire coming out of converter 14.4

Now turn on the charging timer and the same wire tested read 15.2

Keep the timer on and then turn on the fridge, the voltage drops to 11.8

These are all the voltages coming directly from the converter.

So though the manual says you can run the fridge and charge at the same time,
I think this was the root of my problem. The battery had a higher voltage than
what was coming from the converter, and so the current ran downhill and
actually drained the battery.

According to what I could find at bBartno Tekb, when running the fridge
and charging, I should have 16.5 coming from the converter and heading to the
battery, and 14.5 heading to the fridge.

So, am I to assume the converter is bad? By the way, I did replace that fuse
in the back of the coverter to be sure that wasnbt the problem.
