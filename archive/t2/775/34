Subject: Re: [T2] Steering box seals?

I had the same problem on my 78 T2.  But instead of
fooling around with the seal, I replaced the steering
gear with a new TRW brand from Brazil.  About $200,
and haven't had a stich of problems with it.  Fit
perfectly without modification.  www2.cip1.com for
part# VWC-211-415-049-H.  And when you replace the
steering gear, you should also replace the rubber
coupler VWC-211-415-417 (-at-) $20, as your current one is
probably both original, and worn out.   A cadillac
solution at a signifant cost.   To keep costs low
though, I'm sure you could find a the correct seal.
   
During the repair, our #1 problem was unseating the
drop arm from the original steering gear.  That took
several attempts, PB Blaster, and a torch to
accommplish.
