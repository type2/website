That's very true. I've seen very few that were so badly damaged that
they couldn't be put back onto the road easily. In keeping with the
spirit of the mission of rescuing distressed and endangered VW's, I've
found it very hard to say no to anyone who asks me to take a VW from
them. Unfortunately this has taken a big toll on me, and I'm going to
have to start keeping it to one vehicle at a time.
