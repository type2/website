When I began the process of raising my bus from the dead 3 1/2 years ago the very first part I ordered came from Bus Depot after finding Type2.com.

It was fortunate timing because I didn't know what a Bentley was, where to find good quality parts or even what the part numbers were. I spent a good deal of time learning the various part numbers just by surfing the BD website.

I'm not sure where my bus would be if I hadn't discovered the list and subsequently BD.
