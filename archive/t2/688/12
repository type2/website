Subject: Any installed/used Suburban Low-profile furnace in their bus?

I was looking at the Camping World site when I cam across this:
http://www.campingworld.com/browse/skus/index.cfm?skunum=17372

It is a low profile fully enclosed propane furnace.  It is only 7.5 inches
tall and has gas hookups on top or rear.

My question is, has anybody installed this furnace or something similar in
their bus?  It would fit in the space below the jumpseat rather nicely. 
It is kind of expensive, but likely cheaper than trying to get a Propex
and get it shipped over the pond.

I am just looking for comments.

Regards,
