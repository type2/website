Subject: Flange repair

Like a lot of buses, mine was disfigured in order to install AC long 
ago. Compressor (and everything else) are long gone, and here's how a 
PO repaired the cut in the flange that secures the engine seal:

Really ugly. Don't even know why he bothered, since there wasn't a seal 
(or front tin pieces -- front is back) installed.

Now I should probably weld a repair, but I'm not set up to do so. 
Anyway, this looks like a suitable candidate for a fiberglass repair. 
It will hardly be visible, and there's very little structural work it 
has to do except be stiff enough to be a flange. So what's a good way 
to get that stiffness? Fold a piece of steel the width of the part that 
folds back, cut to the radius, into the glass? Anyone have a better 
idea?
