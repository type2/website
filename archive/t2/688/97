Speaking strictly for myself, I'm not offended by your rambling (or 
anybody else's for that matter). But here is the complete text of what 
you wrote this morning:

This was still under the heading of Re: Split CV boots: Can they last 2 
weeks?.

At no point in yesterday's thread do I recall that you expanded your 
question about CV boots to include the CVs themselves.

This may have seemed like a ramble to you, but I read it as (to quote 
myself): rats got into my house and bit my toes off.

So I'll ask again. How do you want me (and others) to respond to this 
stuff?
