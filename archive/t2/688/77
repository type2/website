The condensor is more or less new. The flash on the camera is cruel.
Will be replacing points with Bosch. This is what the local VW parts
place had (not the dealer). Distributor was found in a junkyard after
two years of searching for the correct one (009 came with bus); had
some strange two-vacuum line distributor in between.

Nobody, that I recall, has ever posted a mini-essay on the difference
between "cheap" points and Bosch points. If they have, I missed it. But
why don't you, Mark?

You could do worse than to sound like Doktor Tim.
