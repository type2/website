FWIW,
The BusDepot kit for 9.95 DOES include bolts and grease so no further expense is needed.  Also, yes, it IS drop-shipped from L.A. area (at least the ones I got last week were) and I'm in L.A. area too.  Props to you, Mark, for stepping up.  I personally think it's retarded to consider any type of luxury before doing the boots, if that's the money option.  They'll take only a few hours to do and require no special tools (easier with certain tools but not required).  Good luck Don- if you need help to do it faster by someone who just did it, come on over- you know where I live.

Okay, Don, here's the deal. I'll pay for the CV boots (Bus Depot, 9.95 
each) if someone else will volunteer to pay for expedited shipping. (It 
might even be a drop ship from a California location).

Do you have the correct drive for the bolts? If not, I will mail you 
mine today and you'll have to mail it back to me.

Do you know whether your bolts can be reused? If not you'll need those 
too. Have you got a place nearby where you can get those?

I read the posts about how to use duct tape and baggies and whatnot, 
and that's fine and I am sure it would work. But there's a principle 
involved here. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it's there.

Now, this isn't charity. You're not a tsunami victim. So the deal is 
this: you have to promise to do three things:

1. Change the CV boots before you leave for Denver

2. When you have the money, donate the cost of the boots to the type2 
list (because I keep forgetting to do it)

3. Get straight about priorities. CV boots come before H4 lights


Maybe I'm being a jerk to insist on all this. If so, you and others can 
tell me.
