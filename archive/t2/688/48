doubt that the GEX heads are rebuildable.  would be surprised if they
didn't have cracks.   find a decent place to drop engine, take all the
"Stuff" off of it, send it off as a core to one of the better rebuilders
(check the archives, Boston Bob, AVP, NW Connecting rod seem to get good
reviews, I did my own with help of a local machinist, after my GEX seized
after 3,400 miles.)
