hello Mark  Well this will be a quick essay from somebody that has been 
working on VWs for 40 years and as a professional for over 25 years .   It is  well 
known that the bosch parts were what came on the older VWs and was for the 
longest time the best Quality parts.  lately even Bosch has been putting out 
some junk   Do not use the points that have the white rubbing block  the block 
will break.  the most common Bosch points are the 01 011    I use the 01 030 
instead cause the springs are better and they last longer ( These are the points 
of choice for the formula Vee drivers and those guys are going to use the best 
that they can get. Nothing worse than paying to race and a $5.00 parts leaves 
you sitting on the side of the track)   The second biggest problem being in 
the business of working on cars is the quality of parts that we get today.  Dr 
Tim would always stress the best way was the right way using the best stuff 
you can get /  Which I would agree with  . The only thing that we didnt agree on 
was the use of Snake oil remedies he thought all such was junk but I have 
seen some that amazed me , Latest being the Subura coolant treatment.   If you 
wish for more info then come to the High Country Bus campout   july 29-31  boone 
Nc  www.fullmoonbusclub.com  I give a tech class there every year and discuss 
things just like this  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
