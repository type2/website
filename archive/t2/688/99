Any way you like, or not at all, as you choose. 

I do appreciate the efforts all had made to give me advice. Some of
the responses got me thinking, some made me laugh. All good. =D

I thought I had made it clear that the boots were gone and had been
gone. I also said I wanted to buy the entire axle kits once I had
decided to go ahead and do the job right instead of a half-assed job
that I was considering. And even replacing the boots "properly"
wouldn't fix worn CV joints. And with years of being bootless, I
figured those CV's were probably shot. If I pull the axles to replace
the boots, then in a few months I'll have to pull the axles again to
replace the CV's as well as another set of boots. Seemed like a waste
of time when I could do it right. But no bonus = no CV joints. Also no
ignition upgrades or other miscellaneous stuff I WANTED to do but do
not NEED to do.

I think it's time to let this thread die. We've veered into discussing
the discussion instead of discussing the bus. But I thank everybody
for your efforts!!!
