For those who don't mind mail ordering, for the same price as these
off-brand tires, I have the Hankook RA08 tire, which is made by an OEM
supplier to Volkswagen. In a head-to-head comparison, the German magazine
ProMobil-Extra rated the RA08 above the Michelin Agilis in every performance
aspect - despite the fact that it's 40% cheaper than the Michelin.  I have
been using them personally for years and recommend them highly.
