Hey there Ron,

These tires look great. I don't see mention for offroad or mud use on these. 
I live in Texas and although it snowed here during Christmas near me, I 
don't need snow tires. I do however need something that is good in the mud 
and dirt. I do a lot of off road driving daily in my Vanagon going places 
that amaze the 4wheel driving construction workers I am going to see. Civil 
concstruction, lots of dirt sometimes lots of mud. I don't have a Syncro, 
just a GL. Got anything to fit my ride?
