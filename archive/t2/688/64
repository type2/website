Ok,

So you guys got me back to ancient history by asking about the VPC factory 
and A/C.

Try this one,  I worked for 15 years at one of those "chicken" companies
that was a target of the tariff problem.  

The guy that owned the company actually put up a sign that said 
"No Volkswagon's" parking(notice the spelling!)....they actually brought 
the sign out when we opened a new office building there in 1999.

There is a "Look" magazine from somewhere in that era that shows the owner 
of the company and a flock of chickens on the front cover and discusses 
the problem and the tariff.

IIRC, the Japanes got around the tariff by shipping truck beds and cabs 
separately and then joining them once they got into the states.

Cheers, dave
