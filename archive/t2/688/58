I actually can afford the boots... But thanks for the offer!

I'm going to splurge for it since I'll be needing it on the road and
in the future. There's a speciatly tool shop near my house that
actually knew what a "triple square" was. =D

That I don't know yet, but vwparts.net stocks them.

I appreciate the concern. (H4s were installed when I discovered both
of the sealed beams were horribly dim shortly after purchasing the
bus. The difference in price was like $25 between the H4 kits and
quality sealed beams... I figured the improved visibility was worth
the money.)

I was hoping to replace the entire CV joint. That's what I can't do
until after I get to Denver. Boots are cheap. I still have a couple
hundred to work with this weekend, and I already have most of the
brake parts I need. But I *DO* need to get tires and fix the exhaust.

My joints have always been bootless (since I got the bus). It was one
of those "I'll get aroundtoit" things since I was just driving back
and forth to work. They never made noise or anything, so I kept
forgetting about them.

CV test results: Rotational slop: less than 10 degrees. Lateral slop:
a buttload! I have no idea if that's normal, but it really made me
wonder when I checked them last night.

I'm going to pick up "real" boots tonight. I can buy tune-up stuff
(points and condensor) on the way out of town. Plus I have a spare 009
fully loaded. $20 is cheaper than the $60+ for a Pertronix type
system. I still need brake lines (mine are cracking) and exhaust studs
and helicoil/inserts.

I may hold off on tires until I leave too. That doesn't make me happy
though... We'll see...
