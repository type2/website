Don,

Most of the work involved in the CVs is labor.

If you have the tools and the bus is not your daily driver, you could 
spend your time pulling the CVs, cleaning them, and looking for any 
damage that might have already occured (i.e. seeing if you need new CVs).  

Then all you have to do is pack them and install them, which is probably 
only 25% of the job. 

If you can spare the $10 on grease and they check out to be "ok", then you 
can pack them too!
