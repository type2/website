Subject: Strange distributor configuration

My distributor is the correct one for my bus (Bosch 231 168 005, VW 021 
905 205 P), but it is configured like no other bus distributor I have 
seen. Have a look:

The vacuum looks like it's on the wrong side of the case; it would 
point straight toward the bus installed this way. Is that right? Why is 
the vaccum can about 90 degree clockwise on every other distributor?
