The other question is do they have the washer and do they have the clamp for 
the shaft side of the boot and do they come with a new snap-ring. That is a 
complete kit.

Let's be honest here, cv boots are a pain in the ars. A lot of people can't 
or won't do it. It is really really messy and tricky. Special tools are 
required, the twelve point socket head, is really hard to find.

You can run into all kinds of problems with this job that could leave you 
hanging.
Strip out a bolt and you have to cut it off. (need new bolt and hack saw)

You can have a hard time pulling off the snap-ring.

You can twist the bearing too far and all the balls fall out, then what do 
you do?

How are you going to clean all the old grease out?

I think its great that everyone is trying to help out. Take it from someone 
who does it for a living, you can always run into problems with these. One 
job is not like the other. I'd say 75% of the buses on the road have bad 
boots, even worse, more of them have bad ball joints.
