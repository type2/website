Don't know the year of your VW, but yes, from 68 to
79, use standard bulbs.  Know too that you should
first check your fuses.  One fuse protects the left
headlight, and another fuse protects the right. 
Rotate the fuses if they <appear> A-ok as corrosion
can interfere with successful electrical contact.  If
all fuses are a-ok then use a standard 7" sealed beam
headlight unit.  When installing the headlight bulb,
examine the condition of the connector.  Age and abuse
can cause contact problems.  If serious enough,
replacement connectors with 8" to 10" pigtail wires
for each of the 3 posts are readily available on the
Internet.
