Vise Grips have worked wonders for me here. Using a combination of the 12pt 
in a rachet and the visegrips on the outside of the head of the bolt.

>You can have a hard time pulling off the snap-ring.

Sit in comfortable chair and hold axle between the legs. Good SOLID snapring 
pliers are a must the kind with the changable heads don't cut it.

This can suck too. It might take a while to put back together it did for me. 
See Below.

>How are you going to clean all the old grease out?

I actually took all of them apart to ease cleaning, but I did them one at a 
time so I could use the others as models to compare to when putting them 
back together. The first one was the hardest they get easier after that. A 
pail with kerosene would work well or the fancy carb dip cans with the 
basket.

About $10  and an hour to clean them up.
