Not an answer to the exact question, but my '79 bus had AC and the hacked
part. I fixed it by cutting a piece out of a junkyard bus and carefully
patching it in. I braised it with my little portable torch. I remember being
at the junkyard and the guys there could not believe I was borrowing the
cutting torch and cutting a piece out of the engine bay of a junker, and
that was going to PAY for it. But it made the repair much easier to have the
right shaped steel piece.
