Yeah, me too. This is the real test of bus zen. First rule, though: if 
your waist size is bigger than a 36", don't try it. Or lay off the beer 
for six months.

Way back in the day, when I did this, I posted to the list about how 
peaceful and calm it was under my bus. I even thought about putting up 
Christmas lights under there.

All that was a ruse of course. This is a tough job, and a tough way to 
do it. Go to Lamaze with someone who's pregnant to get the knack. Then 
breath six times.

But it absolutely can be done.
