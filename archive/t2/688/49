Subject: furnace in VW 

I just bought a propex furnace for my bus. $600 this is the quickest link I
found for product info:
http://www.calormarineshop.co.uk/focus-on/propex-heatsource-1800.htm
high tech british unit.
half the btu's of that suburban unit, but 1/5 the size and very economical
on amperage and propane.  The Suburban SF-30 draws 6.5 amps vs. 1.8 amps for
the Propex HS-1800! I think the propex will be enough to keep my bus comfy.
Don't have it installed and hooked up yet, but SOON!!!

I bought it from Karl Mullandore of MD, he installs them too for a fee,
