A/C = Must have for Anton, the sweaty guy.

Power WIndows = I can live without!!!

That's just TOO high-tech for me!

Now if only I can find someone to show me how to put an OEM sunroof on
our new camper!

Speaking of which, we just got our OEM VW "Station Wagon" brochure for
1969. Interestingly enough, the VW literature consistently refers to
the bus as a "station wagon." Neat little brochure...complete with
Factory colours and all.

We found it on eBay, naturally!

Tomorrow is our big trip to North Carolina to pick our new "Karma" up.
290 miles each way, but coming straight from the VW guru's shop in
Winston-Salem.

AIRS list is printed out. Cell phones are charged. Metric Tools packed.

No need for A/C since the high tomorrow looks to be only 300 F or so.

Brrrrr...
