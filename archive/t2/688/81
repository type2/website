that sure was easier than the way I did it, I actually fabricated a
duplicate part, had to cut, bend and weld three different pieces of metal
to get the shape, took most of a day. what with cutting, fitting, welding,
grinding to get it to come out.  when I was done looked nice but hacking
from a junkyard bus would have been a lot easier
