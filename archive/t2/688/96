Eh? 

Just a running commentary on what I've got going on... 

Problem is lots of people don't read the entire post, so there is
often confusion as to what exactly I'm asking.

My disappointment financially was just that I wouldn't be able to
replace the joints as well as the boots. That's it. But some folks
read all kinds of crap into what I said. And a few hundred dollars to
spend RIGHT NOW. Not total before leaving. So I'm trying to manage
what I can buy/replace/fix the night before I leave instead of with a
2 week buffer as I had hoped. I don't like the idea of fixing
something and not having time to putter around town to test for a
while before driving.

That's it. 

I honestly think the bus would make it if I just drove it as is right
now. But I'd feel a whole lot better if I could get it as close to
perfect as possible.

If ya'll are offended by my rambling, just say so.
