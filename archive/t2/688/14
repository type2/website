Mark,

Can you see where mine was cut out?

http://www.shockwaverider.com/newengine/picture-003.html

The folks at Busted Bus cut a donor part a little larger than I needed out 
of a dead bus.  I trimmed it to fit and installed it with two sheet metal 
screws.

No one has ever noticed it and much more sheet metal was removed than on 
your bus.

If you must do fiberglass, go to Lowe's and look at the plastic rings that 
go around the base of trees in the garden section....beautiful curves.
As I have said before, I buy a lot of car parts at Lowe's...LOL!

As I have mentioned before, the new rotary compressor went "under" the 
stock sheet metal!

Cheers, dave
