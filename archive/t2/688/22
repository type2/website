Joe, for the moment I will just comment on your AC unit ;-), it is yet a 6th
variation on bus AC systems I have seen, yours is NOT the same behind
drivers seat versions the westy got, it has different ducting, is it
installed in a passenger bus?

Also while the AC may have been made by "VPC" it was most definately
advertised in the VW Accessories Borchures of the time (perhaps ads too) as
a "VW" dealer option.
