Mark,

You owe me!!!!

On Friday Jan 7th I sent....

Somewhere along the line you have spent way more time and energy on making 
the measurement than it was worth!<big grin>

I'm willing to wager a 6 pack of the finest German beer that your $19.95

Soooo, when can I get my six pack!!!...LOL!

Cheers, dave
