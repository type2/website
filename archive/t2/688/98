Actually, you're right, the Vredestein Snows would probably do a better job
in mud than the Hankooks because they are better in snow. I hadn't thought
much about this because Michael said he didn't want snows. But yes, the
designation for a "snow" tire is actually "M&S," which means "mud and snow,"
so a tire that's better in snow will also be better in mud. Perhaps the
Comtrac Winter (http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=COMTRACWIN) would
do the job for Michael, at least as well as any tire could that isn't
designed specifically as an all-terrain tire.

As an aside, it's perhaps worth noting that all-season tires (including the
Hankooks) are also designated "M&S," just as snows are  But this designation
should not be construed as meaning that they perform as well in snow as a
good snow tire. The reason is that U.S. standards for rating a tire "M&S"
are very lax.  I spoke at length to Vredestein about this a while ago. They
pointed out that many tire manufacturers take full advantage of the lax U.S.
standards, selling the identical tire as a "summer" tire in Europe and an
"all season" tire in the U.S.  To turn it into a U.S.-market "all season"
tire, they change nothing but the labeling on the sidewall!  As a company
that prides themselves on their snows, Vredestein is a big proponent of
using dedicated snows in the winter, not all-season tires. Having replaced
my rear Hankooks with a pair of Vredestein Snowtracs
(http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=SNOWTRAC) this winter for the
first time (previously I used the Hankook all-seasons year-round), I can
attest to the difference. While the Hankooks are better snow/ice tires than
most other "all-season" tires I've used, the Vredestein Snowtracs were still
far better when we got a foot of snow here last week.
