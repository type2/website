A mustang has its engine in front and draws air from the front grille,
where air is relatively clean.  A bus draws its air from the back, in its
own self-created dust cloud.  Even my well-sealed engine compartment gets
rather dusty if I drive a dirt road.  This tells me that a K&N isn't what
I would want on my bus.

No, but direct comparison of the filtering performance is.  K&N is good
with coarse particulate, but not so good with fine particulates, as has
been shown in several comparisons.  K&N talks about "filtering efficiency"
and they show up very good there because they measure the mass of the
particulate filtered.  Fine particulate has little mass, compared to
coarse particulate, so it doesn't show up in the advertising comparisons.

I empahsize that K&N makes an excellent filter for specific applications,
namely racing.  What works best for racing isn't always what is best for a
street vehicle

The best performing filters are 2-stage designs, with a centrifugal filter
for coarse particulates and a paper element for fine particulates.  You'll
find this sort of filter on farm and construction equipment, and hanging
off the side of over-the-road trucks.

They're a bit large for a bus, however.

There are tradeoffs everywhere.  Cleaning a K&N or foam filter produces a
quantity of oil-solvent waste that has to be considered.

Sound advice.
