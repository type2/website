Hehe

I hope you are kidding,

but if not, it is your thermostat. More than likely your flaps have been
wired open or just are open. The thermostat expands when the engine gets
warm and opens your cooling tin flaps. Some people like to keep them open
all the time.

It has come loose and you will need to read your Bentley or search the
archives (or email me back) and attach your thermostat cable.

It hasn't been so long ago that I wouldn't have known what that was either!!

If you need pics email me!
