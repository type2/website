its not that they are tight - they provide a strong squirt up and over the
roof if i wanted. seems like more in the switch. i lubriplated the water
button that sticks into the switch yet i get a trickle outside with the
slightest air pressure in the bottle res...after i push the button it never
100% fully releases. or something.  most of the washer questions have to do
with leaking inside. this is outside.
