Subject: ISO solex linkages

Does anyone have a spare set of linkage for a dual solex for an 1800 if it
matters.  I have all the rest of the pieces just need the last little bit
and I can get rid of my stinking Weber progressive...

I can pay or trade, let me know what your looking for and I'll see if I have
it.
