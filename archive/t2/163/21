Subject: Re: [T2] optima battery "blems"?

The battery that I origionally had was an Optimas
battery. This the battery that I melted a hole in the
side of by accident with the ground strap. I took it
back and told them it was bad. They tested and
confrimed my claim. Then they gave me another one.
They guy even put his finger in the melted hole but
didn't say anything. Whether or not they will do this
with yours, I doubt it. I was just having a lucky
streak that day. I think my battery had a 3 year
warrenty. I will just wait another 2 years before I
melt another hole in it. Maybe I will be as lucky. II
agree with George on them tough. They do have good
cranking amps but if your bus does not have any
unknown battery drains and if you run the bus often,
then you really don't need that many. Anyway, that was
my experience.

Have a great day!
