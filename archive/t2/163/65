Hey folks, has anyone ever heard of the above referenced business?  I 
bought an antenna from them for my single cab on Eb*y last week and can't 
get in touch with them.  Their phone number is 1-866-VW-MOTOR.  I've 
already paid for the item, sent 2 emails and left 3 phone messages and get 
absolutely no response whatsoever.  I don't know what part of the country 
they're located in.  Have I been taken?  tx, greg
