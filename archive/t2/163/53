--Paul, David et al.:

For David's sake, I think we should clarify a little. Heater 'boxes' and 'exchangers are usually refered to as the same thing. 

'Flapper boxes' is the usual term for what paul is calling heater boxes.

Basically, outside air is sucked thru the main fan, used to cool the engine, and the excess is sent thru the heater 'boxes' which have exhaust pipes inside them that the outside air blows around and is heated by.

The heated air then exits the heater boxes, thru the 'flapper' boxes (heat valves) which control the amount of heated air into your cabin via the levers on the dash. They then enter the plastic tubes you have shown on your picture, and continue to the cabin.

If you have a type IV, the outside air pressure is accentuated by the auxilliary heater blower, which adds pressure to the system when the engine is at idle, as I'm lead to understand.
