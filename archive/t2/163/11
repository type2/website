Well, Bishop California is at 4000 feet, and the pass above it pushes
8000, so that is a single 4000 foot climb.  If you want to stretch the
distance a bit, Death valley is below sea level, so you can easily do
8000 vertical feet on one tank of gas.

The other thing that western altitude saps is engine power.  At 8000 feet,
we all have 36hp buses!
