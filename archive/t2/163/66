Subject: FW: [T2] Removing Fuel Tank Panel

Thanks to everyone who responded. Found the 4 hidden bolts and wasted the
next two hours removing an absolutely clean tank....grrrr. I wanted to check
the tank since the engine was out. I guess I shouldn't be complaining. The
tank required no cleaning, recoating, or replacement. 

For those thinking of pulling their tank just to check its condition, I
would suggest that they drain the tank and rent a boroscope to view its
condition through the filler neck. Unless you know that there's a problem,
it may not be worth your time to remove it.

How do I remove the panel on my 69 bus. engine is out. Engine bay insulation
is in. I have removed all the screws that I could find, but the cover
doesn't want to budge. What am I missing?
