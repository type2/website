alright..my buddy has a type4engine thats in a 73transporter. through the lists advice, and of course common sense, we've realized that he needs new carbs. or the one's he has rebuilt. 
so i was wondering, what u experienced vw owners would recommend doing here? should he rebuild his old 34dual-carbs? or should he put out the green energy and buy some new lungs? 
now, if his best investment is goin with new ones, then what would be the cheapest but better route to go with here? and the catch is, he's lookin at only bein able to spend, probably at the most, 350$. 
thanks for your time and attention, and for any help that u can pass our way.
