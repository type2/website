Thanks for all the suggestions on the brakes.  I'll try replacing the =
rubber lines - keep you posted
=20
 Now I have another question.

Any one have experience with the roof racks sold by Tom Connor?  I found =
a
link to his web site on the Type2 web page library under roof racks. =
(http://www.thesamba.com/racks/)

Thinking of ordering one and just looking for words of wisdom and =
experience from the list.

Thanks,

Juan
