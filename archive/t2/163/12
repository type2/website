A 90 day warranty is horrible!  Any decent battery should have at least a
5-year warranty.  I've also heard of Optima having some rather draconian
warranty requirements such as sending the bad battery back to the
manufacturer for "inspection" before they will authorize a new battery.

Optimas are good for special applications where you need a sealed battery,
but for a bus you're better off with a conventional Pep Boys group 24
battery in a marine battery box.  No leakage problems with the box, and
the battery is easily servicable and will be repplaced under warranty
without arguement or hassle.
