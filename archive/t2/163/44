Hi there,

just bought a 69 with a newly rebuilt 1600  slow  runs
great other than a leaky solex which i plan to swap
out for a weber from my last bus.   
Anyway   when i bake she shakes and pulls right pretty
bad.   i also noticed when i had the wheels off that
the pass side drum/ hub did not spin as freely as the
drive side

any help would be gladly accepted 

thanks 

mick
