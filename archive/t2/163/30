The K&N filter discussion can become a religious argument, but here's my 2
cents.

I used and liked K&N filters when I was racing motorcycles off-road.  The
big selling point of these filters was that they wouldn't clog up, which
would lead to a DNF (and no $$$)  From that standpoint they worked great.

We were willing to allow a certain amount of fine particulate to pass
through the filter in return for the anti-clogging action.  The K&N media
is thin, has large pores, and vibrates, all of which means that it will
pass fine dust.  On the 2-stroke motorcycles we rode, we usually bought
pistons by the 6-pack anyway, so the wear didn't concern us too much.

Now, on my bus, I would not run the K&N.  I don't need the anti-clog
property, and I am concerned about fine particulates getting into the
engine.  Better to use a filter that does a better job on all particles,
and it's hard to improve on the stock item.
