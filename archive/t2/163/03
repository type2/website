I had symptoms similar to the adjustment of the clutch cable.  It turned out
that the end of the clutch cable was worn and it did eventually break
through.  The clevis pin is about 1/2 gone.

I also have a sound when the clutch is released.  I am certain that my sound
is the input shaft bearing.  Sort of a grinding, rattley sound that I can
just barely hear that goes away when the bus is warmed up.  My release
bearing makes sounds too.  That sound is more of a whiney singing that I
hear when I push in the clutch pedal.  At some point soon, all will get
replaced.
