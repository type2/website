Sorry there I neglected to read further and see that we are talking about a
'69, no rotors to warp on that  guy.(if stock) Blown wheel cylinder,
collapsed brake hose, warped drums all likely suspects. Also could be a
badly adjusted set of brakes if PO or mechanic was negligent.

Shakes are due to warped rotors which may or may not be able to be
resurfaced. Depends on how thin they are. Pulling is due to either a bad
caliper or collapsed brake hose. Good luck.  Check out the rear brakes
while you are in there...
