Subject: Re: [T2] 73' Carburator options?

I spent $260 to have my stock Solexes rebuilt, and they were NOT SCOTTISH 
(i.e., they were crrrrrrap)! I could've done better myself, tyro that I am,
  and for a lot less dinero.

As I learned the hard way, 73s were jetted differently than 74s (my carb guys 
did not know this). You can tell the 74s by the little plastic doo-dad on 
the accelerator pump (at the lower front of the carb--I knew this).

For $350, you oughta be able to find a pair of REALLY GOOD replacement Solexes.

Or you could get Webers or Dellortos. But then when something goes wrong, and 
you look it up in the Bentley, the pictures won't match (my excuse for going 
stock).
