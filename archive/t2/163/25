Your horn has an internal switch that switches a magnet on and off rapidly
to make the horn do its thing.  The switch makes electronic noise that
apparently is getting into the radio.

Possible solutions:

Big capacitor across the radio input leads to try and filter the noise.

Don't use the horn while trying to enjoy music! (personally, I'd go that
way!)
