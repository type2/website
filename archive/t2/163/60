Subject: Farewell for now

This is my final email for a while & I'm unsubscribing
simply because I don't have the time to read all of
the interesting stuff you guys send me.
I've learned stacks from the discussions & debates &
really enjoyed the insight into the U.S. bus scene.
So, as winter closes in Down Under, I wish you all a
good Summer & encourage you to check out our nice land
sometime & the die-hard VW addicts here.
Thanks for the patience, the advice & the fun.
:-)
Cheers & see ya' later!
