I stumbled on something that I like alot.  My bus came with a AC unit that
mounted just behind the front seats on the roof (inside).  I pulled out the
AC stuff and put both my CD unit and the speakers in there.  Plenty of room
and the speakers are up by my head and ears.  Doesn't eliminate all the road
noise problems but sure helps.  I put another set of speakers in the doors
just to thicken the sound and can fade between them.  You might look around
in some junk yards (or ask on the list) and see if you can find one of these
old AC units;  I'm sure there were other ones around.

Good luck.
