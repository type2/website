It sounds like the 1800 heads will fit according to David Schwarze. Make
sure you switch them both. Your engine should have oval port exhausts. I
think it was 79 when they went square. If the heads fit and are in good
shape you should be okay then. I have never done this so don't quote me. I
guess your exhaust should fit as long as both heads have the same exhaust
ports. What about the head temp sensor if you are running FI? You may need
to drill the new head out and tap it for this sensor, unless you are
running carbs.

This engine has not been dropped yet to find specific problem.
Diagnosed problem all day with Steve Dolan and others via IRC.  All
agree that head is probably cracked.  Some also think that valve could
be badly dropped.  I had plans on helping Jason Laster drop his engine
this weekend in.  If I could get set of heads for 1 & 3 I could possibly
drop mine with his and change them out.  I believe mine are oval.

Heads from other years will "fit" but I think you would have to put the
correct head on the other side to make it run right. Also I don't know
if your existing cylinders would fit in 1800 heads? Have you pulled the
head yet?

Anyone correct me if I am wrong, but I heard that certain earlier model
heads will fit the 2.0.  Although I cannot remember which ones will.  I
believe 1.8 will fit??  Steve Dolan??

Hello all,
            Well, after some help from some very nice people from the
list, it was determined that #3 head is cracked.  Valves are ok but
compression is about 10psi.  :-)  So, although I Steve Dolan may have
one that I can use, I was thinking of other options in case he doesn't.
As of now the plug and fuel injector are pulled from number three
because its not doing anything anyways.  No performance change in engine
from doing this.  Question, since the head is probably shot anyways, can
I try and use something to fix the crack temporarily??  Like epoxy or
JBWeld?  Or would these not be able to withstand the heat?  Right now I
can get by with three cylinders.  Would I be asking for more trouble to
push that cylinder right now?  For the record, this is a '78 bus with
Type 4 motor.  Fuel Injection.  This is a California model. Thanks for
you help.
