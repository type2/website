HAd the same problems (or similar) in my '71 westy.

It was the grounds connection in the engine compartment
near the tail lights.  If I remember correctly, I had
to cut and re-crimp spade connectors back on and then I
screwed in a new spade assembly (pep-boys should have
that) (both sides).  Fixed the whole darn thing in one
shot!
