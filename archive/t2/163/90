Subject: Re: [T2] Buggy World Vs. Save a Bug

Hi Sherri
I've used Save a Bug for parts-they normally have everything I need. Never
used either for service, you might try Car Craft in Riverside for service,
they diagnosed my girlfriends Type 3 FI problem and did it cheap and quick
and it also worked after she got it back. I've also had them rebuild heads
for me.
