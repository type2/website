Subject: Horn sound coming out of stereo system

------_=_NextPart_001_01C2003E.8454D680
Content-Type: text/plain

Installed new stereo in my bus this weekend, sounds good (no radio before) ,
except when I hit the horn I can hear the horn sound breaking up somewhat
coming through the speakers. Sounds like a piezo tweeter blowing if you know
what those horrible things were.


Any help would be appreciated,
