Subject: Re: [T2] optima battery "blems"?


Hi List,
     I currently have the Optima "red-top" battery, and I am nothing but 
satisfied with it.  They're designed to be VERY vibration resistant, and 
leak-free.  You can even mount them on their side(and are easily relocated 
under the back seat).  These weren't the primary reasons I bought it though. 
  My AC De**o battery was discharging quite rapidly where it sat, and I had 
no desire to keep the darned thing on a charger, so I did a little research 
on the Optima.  They claim the battery has a 'useable' shelf-life of 5 
years.  It'll take that long to discharge while not in use.  My bus sat for 
long periods without being driven, and the Optima performed where the 
standard lead-acid battery did not.  IMHO the Optima is well-suited to the 
air-cooled vehicles we love.  Optima's also have an 8 year warranty.  I 
grabbed mine from a place called Batteries Plus in Sacramento.

     Eron
