Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable just broke... Need help

Hey Jj  Now that everybody has told what how to do this I would do one  thing 
different, Cut the cable back at the trans and then you can hold it with  
vise grips while sitting there instead of trying to remove it while under the  
bus,  Also test the wing nut on the threaded end of the cable before  putting it 
in. Another thing is to compare the lenghts of the two cables   Later  mark 
Dearing
