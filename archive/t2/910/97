Subject: oil temp

OK, no more shennanigans from me (this week).  I got my shiny new  12" deep fry thermometer in yesterday.  It's the only thing I've  got that's...well never mind.  So I got out and ran my bus hard  until my improperly grounded (maybe) VDO oil temp guage with the sender  in the taco plate read 275F.  (Yeah, it used to scare me  too)  Got home, stuck the thermometer in (amazingly it's exactly  the same lenth as the dipstick) and...walla....220F!  So my  supsicions have been confirmed.  VDO guages (if not properly  grounded and I don't know how to properly ground them) suck.
  
  But I may have uncovered another problem.  I heard a gurgling  sound.  I was afraid my oil was boiling but the previously  mentioned test and my finger-on-the-dipstick test proved that that was  not the case.  It seems to be in the muffler.  What am I  hearing gurgling when the engine is hot (after shutoff)?  Should I  be concerned?  I fixed the dieseling by adjusting the idle and  mixture.  Is enough gas getting into the exhaust to gurgle but not  burn or cause a backfire?  At first I thought it was water before  I remembered what I was driving.  The only thing we use water for  is washing our dishes.
