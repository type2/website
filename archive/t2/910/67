Mike,

Hmmm.... I am going to assume on the back as water would love to run 
down the bowden cable.

Since the same type of "boot" goes on the back heater heater cables.

If you could actually get to it...and assuming it fit, I can't see why you 
wouldn't want one on the front as well.  

Those cable tubes can probably use all the sealing they can get.

Cheers, dave
