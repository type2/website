Subject: [T2] HIgh top skylight vent .......

does anyone have a pic of a skylight(ventb lifts up)  ..on top of hightop......

my skylight flaps when i go down the road....

the rod doesnt work right on it but i am sure it is just not on there right...thats the way it looks....

can someone please show me a pic of how it suppose to be so i can close it off...while driving./...

i like rolling it up when its hot outside but it flaps all the time while driving... when it rains its worse...  winter coming trying to think about that.... brrrrrrrrrrrr~!~

thanks
