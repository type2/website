Subject: worried about engine damage

Hi, just installed a rebuilt 2.0L FI engine into my '77 westy.Took it on a
1000m round trip and it went great! I was told that I need an airflow meter
because under 3000 rpm it doesn't have very much power and I have to feather
the gas to get it going.Also I noticed tonight that I have some bad exaust
leaks on both sides at the U pipes.I am concerned that driving it in this
condition will damage the engine.Will  it ??The reason I ask is that it is a
daily driver and I can't afford to fix it yet.
Thanks,any advice will be very much appreciated.
Bernard,
Fort Langley,B.C.
