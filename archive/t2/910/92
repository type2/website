Yup, sure enough... the lock is bad!!! There is absolutely no power going 
through the ignition wire when turned to the start position. However, if I 
take the lead directly before it goes into the lock harness (right under the 
dash) and short it with the massive orange wire under the dash, I hear the 
starter cranking.


Thanks,

Todd
