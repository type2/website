I would replace the cable, the clevis pin, and the bowden tube.  It's an 
easy job.  Just make sure you don't let the cable turn
as you tighten tighten the wing nut on the top of the transmission.  Two 
nuts on the frame where the pedal attaches.  It's obvious where to run 
it.  Ten minutes and you're back on the road.  Oh yeah.  One more 
think.  Pick up a spare while you're buying your replacement.  Spare 
cable and clevis pin (bowden tube too if you have a few extra dollars).
