Subject: RE: [T2] Second battery wiring location

Hi Folks,

Received some great ideas and even pictures from some very nice folks so
far on this subject, but....My Westy, being an aircooled Vanagon has the
battery under the passenger's seat and the Aux battery goes under the
driver's seat. I realize most people on this list have a Bay Window bus,
as I used to, but surely there must be a few of us air cooled vanagon
owners still on this list.
