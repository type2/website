Subject: Clutch cable just broke... Need help

I was coming home from lunch just now, and my clutch went to the floor
as I was downshifting for a stoplight. I was in a turn lane (of
course) in heavy traffic (of course), but I managed to hop out and
push the bus downhill into a shopping center parking lot. I crawled
underneath, and found a few threads of wire still connecting the cable
to the clutch lever arm on the trans, but not much else. So therein
lies the problem. Called and got a ride and left her there for now.

So. I called my FLIAPS, and they have new cables in stock for $9.
Cool. Question is, how hard is this to replace? I don't have a Bentley
manual (I know, I know...), and I figured there might be a trick or
two to getting this done quickly and efficiently. Any thoughts or
advice or whatever is much appreciated. I'm off to the parts store, so
I'll check in when I get back. TIA-

PS - Let's hope my trusty backup BMW 2002 doesn't decide to crap out
on the way to the parts store...
