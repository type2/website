Hi-  I've got a 78 Westy, 2000 cc FI, just recently did a valve job on the driver side of the engine.  Had a burnt intake on the #4 and little compression.  I've got he valves a little loose right now for 100 mi or so but am experiencing something unexpected -- at about 3500 rpm (maybe 3000 actually) in any given gear and under 1/2 throttle or so, not much load in the bus, I'll get an occasional 'hiccup' where there will be no power for about 2 seconds or less, like a bucking of sorts, and then once i give it more gas it seems fine.  By loss/lack of power I don't mean energy from the battery or whatever.  
   
  Any ideas?  Fuel delivery?  I'm running 89 octane in there.  Maybe once I tighten up the valves on next valve adjustment it may go away?  Hyd lifters by the way.
   
  I have not done a compression since the valve job.  It is running really nicely now though otherwise...
   
  Thanks,
  Greg
