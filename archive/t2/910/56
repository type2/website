Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable just broke... Need help

Youse guys all forgot something!

Since I just did this on my 78.....

The rubber boot seals to keep stuff out of the cable tube.

Also, once I pulled mine out, It took me a few minutes to figure out where 
the tube actually was, up at the front after I fed it back thru the 
frame.  And since my clevis pin was worn, it took more than a few minutes 
to work it out of the cable and pedal arm without destroying it....I 
didn't have a spare at the time.

Sure works better now!

Cheers, dave

 Hey Jj  Now that everybody has told what how to do this I would do one  thing 
 different, Cut the cable back at the trans and then you can hold it with  
 vise grips while sitting there instead of trying to remove it while under the  
 bus,  Also test the wing nut on the threaded end of the cable before  putting it
