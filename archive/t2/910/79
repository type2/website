Subject: Re: [T2] starter wire removal

Those wires are connected to your alternator. Disconnect the ones that you 
can see going through the engine tin, they are the smaller ones that are 
held on by a 13mm nut (put the nut back on the starter so you can find it 
later) and pull the wires through the engine tin.

The starter will stay behind, but the upper right (front is front) engine 
bolt goes through the starter and must be removed (it's one of four, that 
one and one on the other side and two on the bottom through the tranny). The 
bolt is an odd one as it has a flat area on it and the starter keeps it from 
turning if you are lucky. Very nice to have a helper when removing this 
bolt/nut combo.

While you are there might as well disconnect your fuel line now too. Tap it 
with a pencil or something like vise grips and pull it through the engine 
tin too. I have $5 that says you'll have gasoline in your armpit....it 
happens.
