Steve did this on his green bus. Looked pretty good IMHO.

Consider talking her into painting on some wood panelling instead. The noise
of an uncovered roof is horrible. Panelling would be easy, even if this
isn't a camper model.

WCM has the sunroof headliner: 241-502V-WH $175.40
At that price I think it's a full length headliner. They also have one for a
doublecab: 265-502V-WH $76.20 which sounds more like what you'll need.

Do you have the panels for the areas above the seat stands behind the seats?
