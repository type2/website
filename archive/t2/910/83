Subject: RE: [T2] Homeland Security Chief Warns of Bus-bomb Threat

This does raise a bell here in Saskatoon Saskatchewan.
We are having some 'how to maintain your VW workshops and how to
drive a VW bus in a crosswind class.  We have all of a sudden been
overrun with requests for more workshops by several non-vw-speaking
people.  What was a 4 person workshop has become a 40+ person
class with 2 more workshops scheduled this month.

Who should I call?

...Worried in Sasktoon....

   The department is advising VW bus enthusiasts to be on the lookout for  
any suspicious activity at upcoming events.  Things to look for  are 
suspicious-looking people who congregate to themselves and who  don't show 
interest in VW-specific activities. Be especially leery of  busses that have 
the tents and curtains closed at all times, even  during daylight hours.  
They will probably arrive at the events  early in order to achieve the most 
central parking spot, usually near a  pavilion or place where campers 
congregate for communal meals, games,  and seminars.  Mr. Chertoff did 
advise against focusing on  Arab-Americans or other people of Arab or Middle 
Eastern descent.   The recent events in England show us that this type of 
Islamo-fascist  terrorism has clearly crossed ethnic lines, he said.
