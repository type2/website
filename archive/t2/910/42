Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable just broke... Need help

I have done this on the parking log.  As I recall you need a 15mm or 
13mm socket to remove the clutch peddle cover.   The hard part is moving 
the wing nut on the trans clutch arm.

Be sure to also replace the clip/pin at the peddle.  This will need 
replacing very soon if is has not failed already.  If it turns out that 
there is no wear on this part it is good to have a spare.
