Kevin,

You're running a single carb with (probably non-stock) fuel pump right?

The stock filter for FI has 10mm inlet, 7.5mm outlet so it's not like the
upright/carbed/bug filters.

Only $6 at Napa??  I get those clear filters for $1 down here.  Haven't
needed to replace mine since the tank sealing job. But I do still have one
on each side of the fuel pump.  Cheers...KR
