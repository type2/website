I replaced the MC on my '75 last year, '73 shouldn't be much (if any) 
different.
I didn't take pictures 'cuz I was fully in "get it fixed so I can get 
to work" mode, but
here's the basic routine:

Unplug the connectors to the brake light switches.

Disconnect the metal lines --  spray penetrant on the fittings to help 
loosen them,
and use a flare-nut  wrench instead of a box-end or adjustable (trust 
me on this).

Put a tray underneath to catch the brake fluid that drains out (cat 
litter box works).

**CAREFULLY** pry the lower resevoir off the master cylinder.

Remove the nuts and washers holding the cylinder to the booster (13mm 
hex)

Wiggle master cylinder clear of the cables & etc., crawl out, wipe 
hands on pants,
drink beer, smoke if ya got 'em.

Installation is basically the same as removal, but you'll want new 
grommets where
the resevoir connects to the cylinder, and you might want to replace 
the switches
while they're easy to get at.  Also check to make sure that brake fluid 
didn't leak into
the booster -- if it did you'll need to clean it out, which is a whole 
'nother process.

Hope this helps.
