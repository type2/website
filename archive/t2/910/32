Subject: Second battery wiring location 

Hi All,



I recently purchased the second battery kit form Bus Depot for my 1981
Vanagon Westy. Wiring it up is no problem, but where do most people run
the wires? Do you run it underneath the Bus or inside but under the
carpet? Did you drill any holes? There was plenty about how to make the
connections in the archive but not where the actual wires were run.



Thank you All



Jeff
