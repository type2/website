Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable just broke... Need help UPDATE

I just got home from replacing the cable. Another "bus buddy" came
over to lend a hand, it was a nice cool evening and everything went
together like it was supposed to. It took us almost an hour, but we
were b.s.-ing and messing around with other stuff, too.

Luckily, the previous cable had been replaced fairly recently, and the
clevis pin, wingnut, bowden tube and tube boot were all in very good
shape. Just makes me wonder how long this one's gonna last! I guess
that's what spares are for. Anyway, thanks again for all the input and
advice!
