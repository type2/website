Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable just broke... Need help

JJ,

The project is not difficult. You may want to replace the clevis pin
(which attaches the cable to the pedal lever) because it is notorious
for wearing out and breaking, and you might want to check that you
didn't lose the wingnut on the clutch end of the cable. Running the
cable through the bowden tube can be the most difficult part of the
process, you may need to remove the tube and straighten it a bit to
get the cable end to run through it smoothly. Just make sure to bend
it back to its previous shape. Grease the new cable on installation
and use a dab of grease on the clevis pin to level connection too.

You should know for future reference, if you get stuck in traffic with
no clutch again, turn off the engine, put the bus in 1st gear and turn
the engine over with the bus in gear. You'll lurch a bit but you
should be able to start in gear and get yourself out of traffic
without needing to push. Also the bus can be shifted with no clutch
but it requires a bit of practice to get the RPMs just right.
