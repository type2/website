I used 10G from the battery to the fuse panels, with 12G 30A inline 
fuses placed close to the battery.  The accessory wiring is all 16G.  
All my 12v lighting came from Cherokee RV Salvage 
(http://www.cherokeervparts.com/).  They're about 10 minutes from my 
house.  Perhaps there is an RV salvage place near you.  It was honestly 
one of the coolest stores I've been in in a while.  I spent $30 on the 3 
lights.  The fuse panels came from Advanced Auto Parts for around $6 a 
piece.  I used two of them as I could only find a 6 fuse panel locally.


I happened to be in the middle of a small westfakia conversion at the 
same time (http://radom.org/gallery/vw/bus/interior/), so the 
opportunity was perfect to rewire everything.

Hope this helps.
