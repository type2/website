Subject: Bus Interior!

Hey guys,

    Well, I've decided to plunk down some money on a new interior. Basically,
my plans are to finish off the entire front area of the bus with stock looking
pieces. I'll have the original peble finish black matting that surrounds the
seat pedestals, original seats for the year, along with upholstery and proper
door panels. I also want a correct headliner for the Bus.

Here's the thing though, I promised my wife that I would let her do whatever
she wants in the rest of the inside of the Bus. She's decided that she wants
to put down astroturf on the floor instead of a mat (to simulate grass) and
she wants to paint the ceiling with clouds (on the bare metal). Hahah... So,
that said, I only will need (and want) headliner for the front. My question is
(sorry this is long winded), can I buy just the "Bus Truck" headliner for my
73 Bus if I only plan to install headliner for the front? Or will I still need
to get the entire full headliner kit for a complete Bus?


Thanks!!!

Todd
