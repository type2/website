Subject: distributor compatability

I've been attempting to put compu-fire in my bus, but
it wouldn't fit in my vacuum advance distributor.
Bosch 0231 137 035 (a round condenser plug goes in the
bottom.)

The parts guy says that compu-fire doesn't make a unit
to fit my distributor, the only one he had has a
square side plug and the unit itself won't sit flat in
my distributor.

If i have to go to another vacuum-advance distributor
to put electronic ignition in, what would be a good
choice?

The parts guy tried to sell me a 009. And I have a
friend with a used double-vacuum hose model.

OR--should I go to Pertronix--do they make a unit
compatible with my distributor?

(til i figure this out, i just put in new points,
condenser, cap, rotor.)
