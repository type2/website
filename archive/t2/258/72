For less than $20 you can get a diode + digital voltage display that
plugs into any cig. lighter outlet. Got it at local FLAPS (Napa) -has
green, orange, red diodes.  I took one and mounted it inside a project
box from Radioshack, first cutting out the box so the display is
visible.  The box includes my digital "meat thermometer" oil temp gauge
and a vdo oil prressure gauge.

I am wanting to duplicate (in function at least) something I saw in a

for 
boats, tractors, jet skis, RV's, etc. The catalog price is quite steep 
compared to my quick mental estimate of the parts.

It is a simple looking little thing that has three colored LED lights
that 
tell you that the charging system is GOOD, NOT SO GOOD, and SOL - - - - 
green, yellow, red.
