Subject: fast idle problem

68 Westy with a 30 Pict-1 carb...

My bus never goes to fast idle when I start it.
It runs fine once warmed up, but I have to keep
my foot on the gas to get it warmed up.  After
depressing the gas pedal for a cold startup, the
idle screw is only on the first tooth of the
fast idle cam.  Is this something I can adjust?
I don't know if this helps at all, but I checked
the butterfly when cold and it is in a nearly
vertical position, but not quite. 

Thanks,
Brad Baker
