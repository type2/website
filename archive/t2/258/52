Also:

24 mm for steering wheel nut on '78

1 1/16" for ball joint nut. (OK, but I don't have the metric equivalent) 
Also fits steering wheel nut on '72

1/2" socket & wrench for the stuff the d(-at-)*# PO put there.

7/8" wrench seems to work fine for turning the alternator nut to set the 
dwell.

The 15 mm wrench will be used for the lower bolt on the starter.

13 mm deep socket for the two hidden nuts when removing the fire wall panel 
to get at the gas tank. (should get a whole set of 1/4" drive deep sockets.) 
  Also, to R & R some plug sensor that would have a wire attached.  Need the 
extra space to shove the wire into.

Isn't the Vanagon wheel nut different from/than the bay wheel nut?

(Isn't Drew talking about a '83 Vanagon Westy.  If it's fair to give info 
that is not specific to that year and model, let's open the gates for the 
European brothers/sisters.  The 'down under' crowd will be sure to pop up 
with some exotic church key to open the brew cans.)
