Sounds like you need a new carb.  :(  If the crack is on the inside, you 
might be able to get away with disabling the central idling system (by 
turning the large screw all the way in) and turning both carb throttle stop 
screws in until the bus idles normally.  This would at least (hopefully) 
allow the bus to run until you get a new carb.
