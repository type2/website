Chris,

I'd try it too - I've powered my rotary A/C compressor by this method for 
three years now. :-) I may have posted once upon a time that my shroud was 
cracking, but upon closer examination I think the "crack" was an existing 
seam.  I am confident that there would be no problem with this method if a 
simple arm brace were added to the rear of the compressor to triangulate it 
against the engine block.  I have been too lazy to do this for the time 
being, and I leave the A/C belt very loose so as to not put too much strain 
on the shroud (after all, the penalty for a slipping belt is not very severe).

There are some significant pros and cons to this setup - I would love to 
post them someday when I have time, but for now I'm just proud of myself 
for getting the A/C drive repair page that Steve referenced back up.  It 
has been a busy, busy year.

By the way since that page was written I have switched from 134a to Freeze 
12 and under ideal conditions I can now achieve 39 degree temps at the 
evaporator.
