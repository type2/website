Benoit,
This may be a little late, but further to what Steve Dolan said, Photo #3
the 'looped' connection.
This controls the hot air intake to the air filter. From memory the left
tube connects to the central idle pipe (pipe between the carbies), there
should be a connecting point under the air filter box. The other side
connects to the diaphram at the air filter inlet (just behind the loop in
the photo). The diaphram controls a flap that allows hot air to be sucked
from the motor when it's cold.
Just confirm which side goes where in a manual.
