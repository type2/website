Subject: steering wheel

I would like to know what years interchange for a '72 bus steering wheel

I have one that is in need of repair,, only the hub is left .. it has
211-415-651D
And the spares I have are from a bus,, but have 111-415-651D
the first 3 numbers look like beetle ,,,,
apparently, they have different shaft sizes


Any one have a steering wheel to fit a 72, 211-415-651D let me know price and
shipping info
