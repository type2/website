Nothing out there will just slide on the tracks you have on the driver's side,
or mount to the passenger seat mounts.  You must either affix the new
seats by other means, or weld the bottom of the current seat mounts to
the new seats.  The problem is in finding seats with a bottom as low as
the factory seat (if you are even remotely tall).  I settled on leather Volvo
seats, with adjustable lumbar support, 12v heat, and the best general
anti-whiplash design I've seen.  I have a whiplash from a seat similar
to the stock seat, from an rear-ender ten years ago, so this is very important
to me.  I'm having to remove the bottom half of the Volvo adjustment
mechanism and weld them to the bottom of the stock slider mechanism.

It WILL be worth it, though.

I've got two sets--one for my bug--slightly used, rugrat scuffing on 
passenger seat,
  $175 pr.  Look unused (I saw the car.  It looked like the dipshit crashed 
into someone
while leaving the dealer's lot), $225 pr.
