Hello All,
I have just discovered a NOS BN4 heater in the boxes of parts I picked up at 
a sale.
Looks as though it's never been used.  Everything is brand spanking new.
Anyone out there interested.  Missing the bowden cable and the timer switch.
Make me an offer off the list.  I can send you photos if you so desire.
