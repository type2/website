Subject: A SHORT SURVEY

Surveys are allowed on Friday's right??

Could everyone do a 'short' survey and let me know p-mail, off line.

Please check your type 2 and let me know if you see a SHORT in your system, 
or if you have a SHORT-FREE type 2.

Now, is there any guru out there that wants to speak up and describe how 
someone would know if they have a short in one of their electrical circuits.
