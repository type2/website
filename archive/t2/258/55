Ah.  11mm would be the nut that secures the rear brake drum on 72-79 buses
(maybe 71's also?).  AFAIK that's the only 11mm on a bus.  

There was some speculation on 14mm too.  I can't remember, but either my bus
or my 914 has 14mm lock nuts on the valves.  Since they're both 74 914 2.0
motors you'd think they'd be the same...
