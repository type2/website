Hello List,

Well, recently my budget is been getting tight so I
thought I would list a few items for sale that have
been gathering dust.

1700cc refurbished piston rods with new bushings
pressed in.-$15.00

A good used mechanical fuel pump for a 72-74 carb'd
bus. IT comes with its push rod as soon as I find
it.-$17.00

TRW Sodium Exhaust Valves,Fits 2.0L 72-79, except for
1974 34mm valve, also 80-83 Vanagon. This is a NIB set
of 4, enough to do one complete engine. These are high
quality valves made in Germany. These valves are
normally priced around $60 A PIECE. Honest! Check out
pelicanparts.com I am selling this set for $40.00!!! 

Let me know if you are interested in anything! Each
item does not include shipping. Thanks!
