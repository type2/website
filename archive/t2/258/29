Subject: Re: [T2] A SHORT SURVEY

Barry,

A "short" would be described as any electrical connection that
goes where it shouldn't.  

For instance, a brake light wire that rubs on the chasis and blows
a fuse because the electricity tries to go straight back to the
ground wire on the battery rather than through the brake light bulb
first.

A "short" might be correctly diagnosed by blown fuses or melted wires!

Or warning lights coming on when they are not supposed to...as if your
oil pressure warning light wire had rubbed thru the coating and 
occasionally made a connection with the chasis.

Cheers, dave
