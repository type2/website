Subject: Pulley degree ring decals or replacement no's

My stock size aluminum pulley's no's around the edge have worn off due to
old age. Has anyone seen replacement decals or a no'd ring that you can put
back on to renew it? Bugpack sells one, but it's like 32 dollars Canuck, and
a new complete pulley is only 40!!!
