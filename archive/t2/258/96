Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 valve adjustment





> Ok so im here really to admit that i am not mechanically gifted. But here
is
the situation. I have a 72 westy with a 1700 pancake in it. Following muirs
procedures I have tried to adjust the valves but it doesnt make sense. I
dont have and marks on my crankshaft pulley<

I have a 72 1700cc engine also, it took me awhile to find the mark, BUT IT'S
THERE! You might need to get a VERY bright light and look for it.

> and when i turn my alternator
with a wrench my crankshaft does NOt turn.<

Make sure the Bus is in NUETRAL

> I have tried to tighted it up but
 it still does not good. The Belt is not too loose (about 1\2 inch
deflection)(I think that muir said something around that number). That is
also about as tight as i can get the belt. I am thinking that it might be
time for a new belt. Am i right?? And then when i do get the belt could
someone tell me if i have it right?<

You have it close, but I like to go alittle bit tighter than 1/2 inch of
play. You might have to take a LARGE blade flathead screw driver and push
down on the alternator while tightening the allen bolt. Its also very safe
to carry a spare belt with you at all times.


> I turn the alternator and watch the
rotor and when it gets to the little mark on the distributor then Its at the
firing position for #1 right?? Then i can just go 180* to do the next valve<

Yes thats the way your suppossed to do it.

>and so on. Sorry if the question is too lenghty or if you guys are laughing
 because you all think that this is such an easy thing

Hey somebody had to show me how to do it, not everyone is born knowing how
to adjust VW valves. :)
