I have a head that was ran loose and subsequently, it burned a hole in =
the piston.  The lower nuts were loose (the ones inside the valve cover =
or bottom ones.  Looking at the inside of the head on the "bottom", =
there is a 2" or so neat "burned" groove into the head that follows just =
inside of the circumferance of the cylinder mating surface about a 1/16" =
deep.  However, the piston cylinder mating surface is good.  My =
question, can the machine shop successfully tig? weld this groove to =
fill then machine it back flat?  There are no cracks that I see. =20

Also, the other head had used steel shims or gaskets between the head =
and the cylinder.  The gasket was not positioned on center or looks to =
had warped in.  Now there is an uneven mating surface there dug into the =
aluminum for when I put it back together with a "new" shim and I am =
afraid this side will now leak. It was OK before with sealing, no =
problems this side even tho the shim warped.  Question:  Can I have the =
machine shop machine this surface back flat?  The contact surface is a =
little higher where the cylinder sits from the inside of the head so =
there is a little room there but I imagine they would machine it even =
with the head surface.  Do I need this lip?  Would this be OK?  I guess =
I can have both heads machined flat here so the head cc would match.  I =
noticed in the manual it said head gaskets not required, but this one =
side used them and the other side with the burned groove did not.  Do I =
need gaskets or shims on the head side?  I do know (I think) that you =
shim the cylinder barrel on the case side to change the head cc.

Thanks!  Gerald
