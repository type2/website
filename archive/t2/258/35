Subject: Help with distributor installation, seal question

Hi All:

I have a distributor installation question on an 82 aircooled vanagon. I
needed to get to the lower cold start injector screw to replace the
gasket so I removed the distributor to gain better access. According to
Bentleys, I am supposed to have an O-ring seal between the distributor
body and the drive gear. Looking in the hole, I see nothing. I have a
new O-ring here to replace the old one, but I am not sure where it
should go? Is the O-ring around the distributor drive, or is it just
missing. The PO may have just decide it did not need one. Anything I
should check for if the car has been driven for a while without the
seal?

Thank in advance for a quick replay as I want to get this back in during
the next hour.

Regards
