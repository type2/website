Hello , I have a 1979 VW camper for sale . It has a 2.0L fuel injected motor ,
new alternator , new fuel pump , new voltage regulator , new tires , new fuel
filter , new fuel delivery hoses . The motor has HIGH miles on it and the
rings are bad , causing the oil to leak from the front seal . The motor still
runs good but it's time to rebuild it , I don't have the time to do it . The
transmission is an automatic with a new pan gasket and filter , it shifts
perfectly and runs strong . I just don't have the time to do the work it needs
. The body has no rust , it was painted blue with a black stripe before I
bought it over 2 years ago . The sink works , and so does the interior camping
light , it is a pop top . I live in Atlanta Ga . , I just moved so I can be
reached by email or my roomates cell phone at 404-808-7448 . The price is
$700.00 .
