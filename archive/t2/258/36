Subject: Re: Help with distributor installation, seal question

Hi Matthew:
Thanks for the quick reply

There is a flat rubber washer on the distributor body that seals the sides of
the distributor, but according to Bentley's there is also a round O-ring seal
that goes between the distributor and the drive gear. Around the spacer
spring. That is missing on mine and I am not sure if I have to remove the
drive gear to replace it or if it just sits on top of the gear.
