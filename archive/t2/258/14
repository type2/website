Ralph,

Those are hot air "dumps" because with the heater flaps closed,
they dump hot air circulating thru the heater boxes to the outside.

I *think* the vw ones will fit, but didn't find out until I actually
took one off to take it to the flaps and hand fit some new tubing.

I decided to try it one more time and by carefully twisting and pushing, 
got it to go on ok. 

Once I was sure it would wotk, the other one was easier.

If that fails, take it to the flaps and go thru their selection(also in 
metric sizes).

Cheers, dave
