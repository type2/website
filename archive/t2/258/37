Maybe I am mistaken after all and this is not a problem. It seems that I had
the Bentley's open to the California page. No extra O-ring seal exists on the
Federal model.

I guess this is ignorance and a non problem. Sorry for the bother and thanks
for all the replies. Now I can put this back in and get on the road.
