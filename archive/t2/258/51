Well, on my bus the 12 is used on the flanged nuts that hold the
carburator on.  They are much easier to get at than the standard 13mm
nuts.  Flanged nuts are common on Japanese cars.

The 14?  I don't remember.  Probably some hardware that was replace by a
PO!  That's my story and I'm sticking with it!
