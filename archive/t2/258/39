Flexible exhaust pipe. Usually plated with something to retard the rusting 
process.

Commonly found at your FLAPS.

You can always make up some "sleeves" to make a bigger pipe fit a smaller 
one. Use set screws to keep it in place and high temp RTV to seal up the 
leaks. Much more durable than the paper or plastic varieties.
