Folks, not a week ago there was a warning about posting auctions to the
type 2 list, a practice that is expressly forbidden by the list charter.
Since then, at least two people have ignored that warning.

If you have something to sell, offer it to the list directly.

If you want to point out an "oddity" that pops up on an auction site, post
a link directly to a picture, not to the auction.  I realize that most
such incidents are benign, but "if you give an inch, they'll take a
mile."

My administrative tolerance is getting quite short on this.
