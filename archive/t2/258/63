Subject: american tent poles?

Did any american camper conversions come with poles made from electrical
conduit? I bought a bus a while back that came with a set of unidentified
tent poles made from it. I'm guessing they are just higher qulity home mades
(They required a tubing bender and welding.) but thought I would check to be
certain.
