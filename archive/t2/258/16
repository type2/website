Vented?  Where in Hades would I find these?  Porsche?

There is a Vanagon page where a guy does this very conversion. I don't 
remember where he sourced his parts but it was pretty simple. Mostly German 
junkyard parts like Mercedes, Audi, and maybe Porsche 944.

I plan to pursue that but it is way, way, way near the bottom of my list.

I used to drive in Naples, Italy on the Autostrada and would have a couple 
of panic stops a DAY. All I needed to do is think I are going to die b/c 
your brakes aren't good enough due to heat fade and my priorities changed 
from going fast to stopped fast. Still that way today though my local 
commute is MUCH slower (35-45 mph for 8 miles).

I like BIG brakes.
