That is NOT a AC pulley!
That is a 73/74 air injection pump [smog pump] pulley.

It is #51 in this pic. Belt #41 runs off of it to #21.

The AC [air conditioning] pulley goes behind the big fan on the end of the
crankshaft, instead of the spacer you have. The rubber block on #41 would
never stay together when you engaged the compressor clutch. It barely stays
together running the smog pump!
#7 in the lower drawing is the spacer. You either have it or a pulley if you
have AC.
