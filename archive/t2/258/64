Subject: Re [t2] 2.0L Heads, and Heater box questions

Hi Volks,
Well I found my valves have moved a seat and losened the others.  Now it's decision time,  do I go for avp rebuilt heads or do I go for the new AMC I also have found a pair (AMC)with low mileage for about the price of the new avp ones.  Is there a real big advantage to the amc heads? My understanding also is either way I'm going to have to reset the deck height? 
Pistons will be pulled soon anyway to check the rods.
Next My heater boxes don't look all that healthy to me.  the box part is loose from the pipes and there is a gap between the box and the front flange that goes to the muffler is this repairable?  TIA everyone 
Thanks and Happy Friday
