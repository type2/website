Let me second George's observation below and amplify on it a bit.

My first reaction to '70 seats, even after I repadded and reupholstered
them, was not good. I was used to bucket seats.  But time went by and now I
love the old seats and I wouldn't exchange them for anything.

At first the older bus seats seem primitive. But after driving a bus for a
while (or riding in one as a passenger) you begin to appreciate how
perfectly designed they are, the spring quality of the seat  matched to bus
suspension.

Besides they just look right.

Anyone else feel this way?

Cheers,

John
