Hopefully this will answer your questions.

*"It's not clear to me how this solves the problem.

One bolts a tire onto this plate and then this plate gets attached to the
balance machine? Is it for sure that the plate will fit most machines? "*

That's exactly how it works. Most tire shops do not have the old equipment
needed to balance the stock wide five rim. I've used mine several times and
never had a problem. I have also sold about 20 of these over the past year
and have never recieved a complaint. Here is a like to feedback one person
left on a forum.

*"Also, what is the diameter of the center hole, the diameter and weight of
the plate itself, and what is the bolt pattern for the 12mm and 14mm holes?"
*

The center hole is 90mm (3.54"). Thats the same diameter of the later 4 lug
rims. The plate is 280mm in diameter (11") and weight 2lbs 6ozs. The bolt
pattern is the same as the early VW, 5x205.

*"So if the 12mm and the 14mm were milled through an identical center punch
pattern, the bolt pattern measurement would be the same."*

That's right, both are the same bolt pattern. The early bugs, busses and
type 3's use the 12mm lugs and the early bay window busses and things use
the 14mm lugs. The reason I made two is so that someone who had one size
would not have to find (and keep from loosing) lugs to fit the adapter. Just
use the lugs from the tire you took off.

Hope this helps,
Corey

Hello again.

I caught this explaination of 'bolt pattern' from the web:

 *Bolt Patterns*
Each wheel has a different bolt pattern, and some wheels even have 2
different bolt patterns which allow it to be mounted on a wider range of
vehicles.

Most Bolt Patterns are represented in the following manner:
*4/100*

   - The "4" indicates the number of holes in the wheel for the bolts to
   enter and mount the wheel onto the car.
   - The "100" indicates the diameter of the bolt circle measured in
   millimeters or inches. 4 & 6 bolt wheels are measured from the center of one
   bolt hole to the center of the bolt hole directly across from it. On a 5
   bolt pattern, it is a bit trickier to measure without special tools. Imagine
   a circle running through the centers of each bolt hole. You would measure
   from the center of one bolt hole to the imaginary circle that lays between
   the opposite two bolt holes.



So if the 12mm and the 14mm were milled through an identical center punch
pattern, the bolt pattern measurement would be the same.\

Thanks
