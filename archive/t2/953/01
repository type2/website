  "going the speed limit (or slightly higher) does not grant you the 
right to camp there when traffic is moving faster"

that's true. But I disagree that one should be able to go faster than 
the speed limit. There are FAR TOO MANY accidents caused by speed. 
I-80 is a disaster anyway near the Sierras, and US 50 - well who can 
safely go fast on that road?

btw I do not hug the fast lanes and it was not me on the I-80, I can 
only reach 65 if I am lucky (or foolish)

and it is nice to know you would give me a chance to move right :-) 
Often needed when freeways merge and one finds oneself in the fast 
lanes of the merged roadway and need to exit in a mile!
