Hi Volks,

Why is it people on this list are afraid to drive their buses?  A  
5,000 mile trip is not that big a deal if your bus is in good shape.

I would do it tomorrow if I had the time and $$$ available.  
Unfortunately I have a day job and a family with kids in school. And  
of course 5,000 miles is only the race itself; Even if you lived  
right on the route itself you still need to get to the start point  
and home from the finish. So it's a 10,000 - 12,000 mile trip, really.

But what the heck: Team Pottsfamily.ca is now looking for sponsors. I  
need to raise about $15K for the trip. With any luck we'll be home in  
time for BOTC. Interested parties can P-mail me for the address to  
send that cheque; I'll make sure their logo is well advertised  
throughout the trip.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
