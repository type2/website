Subject: Re: [T2] Problems running after over-wintering

In our '65 split window (SP), this happens quite regularly. In our case,
it is caused by carburetor icing. The pre-heat system is missing (yes,
it's in the plans to reinstall).

On some cooler, damp days, you can see the ice build up on the outside of
the carb. I can only imagine how much is inside. It takes quite awhile for
the engine to warm up enough to stop the icing problem.

This may or may not be your problem, but take a look at and feel the carb.
(after you have it repaired ;().
