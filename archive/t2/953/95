Subject: RE: [T2] rear brake spring clip

Wes,

They frequently wear and rust away. You can use a piece of stainless wire
double or triple wrapped until you find another spring retainer. I have seen
generic ones at my area FLAPS that may fit or be modified to fit. Hopefully
another member knows where to find the correct ones, I haven't found one
yet. 
Also, remember Chris at BustedBus.com most likely has a bunch of used ones
stashed he could FedEx your way.

Please help. I'm in the middle of a complete rear brake job and missing the
clips that snap
  onto the brake shoe bar and spring. I really need these clips. If anyone
can help me I would be very greatful. I can send the cash to whoever could
help pronto. The bus is a 78. Thanks
