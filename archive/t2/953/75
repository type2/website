You can't adjust the mixture on a Southwind, it is set by the RPM of 
the combustion blower motor.  The best thing you can do is rebuild 
the heater.  Southwinds put out a lot of heat for their size, but 
they need to be running correctly.  Of course keeping a gas heater 
tuned up is a good safety measure anyway, the old fuel lines need to 
be replaced just like on the engine.
