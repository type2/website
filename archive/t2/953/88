There's a cone shaped hub that secures the wheels on the balancer to adjust
for opening size.

But I don't know if that particular one will fit just by looking at the

Will they fit standard wheel balancing machines??

Golly, I guess if I was going to tool a piece of metal for the specific
reason of balancing a wide five VW wheel on a standard wheel balancing
machine, and then selling them with that specific purpose, I would be very
neglectful if it wouldn't work!!

But then, I always assume too much...  Let me ask him....
