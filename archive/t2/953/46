Hi Rick,

The trick is to get the oil warmed up first. We had to keep the  
containers next to the fire for about an hour just to get it to pour.  
After that it only took about 30 minutes to heat the oil. The burners  
are rated at 85,000 BTUs.

I keep adding little refinements to the trailer as they occur to me.  
Next change will be the lighting... I will probably change from the  
fluorescent tube to a set of compact fluorescent bulbs. The tube has  
a habit of falling out of the holder on the highway. The other  
refinement I am planning is to build in a tap line and chiller for  
the keg. I'll probably have the lighting done by EveryBus, and the  
keg install is intended to be done in time for BusFusion.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
