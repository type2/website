Now all I need is an air cooled bus... lets see... Key West to 
Fairbanks, Alaska.
Rand McNally TripMaker 1997 edition says that's 91 hrs & 32 min of 
driving, 5279 miles.

5300 miles / 20mpg = 265 gallons of gas (-at-) $3ea = $795 gas money, $500 
entry fee. Plus chips & coffee money.

Let's take a look and see what craigslist has in my area for ac buses <g>.
