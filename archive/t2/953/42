Subject: Bus interchangeability

Hey all,
I'm going to need to hack a hunk of frame out of my new '68 single cab, and
there are a few buses around in local scrap yards, and I'm wondering what
years the frames are interchangeable? I need a piece at the very end, where
it goes around the tube that holds the torsion bars.
