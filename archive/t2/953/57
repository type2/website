I thought it was a great way to deflect! Nothing wrong with the VW 
water cooled, it's just different engineering from the air cooled. 
The Subaru is better engineering than the VW. It's not a good-bad 
thing it's just different.

It was your statement to prove, I know it's bs.

I did my last Subaru engine (with out labor) for $2109.87, here is a 
West from the 17 or so I found yesterday on craigslist 
<http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/car/283716303.html>http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/car/283716303.html 
for $3200, that takes it to a bit over $5300 for a Subaru powered 
West. That's all stock (sort of anyway, within the confines of 
putting a Subaru 2.2 into a VW), 130 hp of dependable motor that 
looks like it belongs in the back of a VW. Could do it for less with 
a better selection of Westies but it could cost a bit more with a 
poorer selection of Subaru donors. I guess the $5300 is as good a 
real life guess as any.

Most of my experience is with the ac motors and I never expected to 
get 300k out of one, I expect that with the Subaru.

A little shopping I'll bet you could get 10 ac Westies for that 
seventeen thousand dollars!

I suspect that we are arguing apples and oranges, both fruit but both 
different.
