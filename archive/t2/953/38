Subject: Am I outta my fricken mind?

Nathaniel,
           Lots of things can go wrong, and if something serious happens, you 
will have a bad taste in your mouth as long as you own the subject vehicle.

Breaking down on certain bridges or ferryboats can cost you bigtime, AMHIK.  
Why not invest a few bucks and have the vehicle brought to your home on a 
trailer or rollback?  Or get a buddy with a pickup to rent a tow dolly. That 
way you can invest the patient work* to get it running with little risk of 
damage. Think of it as an insurance policy.... just my 2" worth, wishing you 
good luck.

---------
* If the fuel smells like varnish, you'll need to drain the tank; otherwise   
  -pull the plugs, disconnect ignition coil primary, spray penetrating oil in 
cylinders, rev starter until you can read oil pressure;
  -reinstall plugs, reconnect ignition coil, prime the carb... try to start.
  -change the oil as soon as engine is warmed-up.

I guess I am 'cause I bought the damn thing. I pick it up on Thursday. Like
waiting for your first baby to come home from the hospital...

But I am pumped, and I need to start the learning curve for 40-year-old
trucks. First thing is of course safety.... What other things could possibly
leave me stranded on the ferry onramp?
