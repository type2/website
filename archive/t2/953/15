I've also had a lot of trouble with electric fuel pumps.  And mine is mounted in the engine compartment a little below carburator level.  I think I went through three that were the kind that clicked very loudly.  The one I have now I got at Autozone on a Sunday and it has outlasted the others.  It is larger and super quiet.  You can't even hear it in the cabin, you have to go back and listen to hear it.  And it had a lifetime warranty.  I'm wondering what that's going to be.  But the pusher/puller explanation is the first I've heard of the underlying problem.  I'm going to look into relocating mine now.  I also use two fuel filters!  I like to see what's going into and out of the pump.  Cheers....KR

  i did remount the fuel pump it a diffrent place than it was in but i was not aware of the gravity issue with these pumps till i read this from your reply.....
  i mounted it on the firewall(gastank wall) up top out of the way so the fuel is having to travel up top to the fuel pump and then around to the carb...
