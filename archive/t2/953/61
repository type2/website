Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race

Hi Rob,

Mapquest says my run is as follows:

Total Est. Time: 180 hours, 19 minutes
Total Est. Distance: 10,729 miles

With gas estimated at $3/gallon and milage at 20 MPG  that's over  
$1,500US in fuel.
Breaking the 180 hours into 10-hour days means 18 days travel. Might  
as well plan the trip for 25 days to allow a week of stopover days  
when you need to stop and smell the roses. Sure, it's a race; but is  
it worth missing the once-in-a-lifetime experiences just to win a set  
of tires, etc? Not in my book.

25 days of road tripping would require another $5,000 in expenses to  
cover camping fees and meals, etc. Wear and tear would also be a  
factor; my westy typically costs about $1,200CDN per year in upkeep  
and this trip would put that entire year's milage into one month.  
Since the trip would involve harsher-than-average conditions we'll  
double that estimate and call it $2,500 in maintenance.

It's a $10K trip, give or take. Given the success of Little Miss  
Sunshine,  I think I'll put the movie rights on the block for $200K,  
and see you in Alaska!


Happy Trails,
