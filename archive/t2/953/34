When I got my '64, the clutch pedal action seemed a little stiff.  After
some inspection, I found that the clutch cable didn't come straight out
of the back (FIF) end of the Bowden tube, and had been wearing a groove
or slot in the metal sleeve on the end of the Bowden tube.  For an inch
or so, the cable was running right down the middle of the slot it had
cut for itself.  A new Bowden tube and some grease seems to have fixed
it.

IIRC the slot was right on top of the Bowden tube - that is, closest to
the floor of the Bus - so you might need a strong light and a mirror to
see it.  Or, disconnect the clutch cable at the transmission so you can
get the Bowden tube down and look at it.
