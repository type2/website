Subject: front beam redux

I'm swapping out a front beam...Whilst it's on the bench
what's the consensus (if any) for rust treating (light sur-
face rust) and prevention so's I never hafta do this again.

BTW, the old beam was very rusted on the left ( LHD Bus)
but very not rusted on the right...Any theories... ?-(
