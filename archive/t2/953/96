Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake spring clip

As Jon Stiles said, Busted Bus may be your best bet in finding good used
ones.

However, a quick look at the Parts Fiche shows that this clip was used on
all Type 2 rear brakes from 1967 thru 1979, so even a local boneyard may
yield some results.  VW discontinued it on 7/31/1990 in their parts pipeline
according to ETKA 7.
