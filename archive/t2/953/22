it is Chapter 7, job 13.2 pg's 44&45  figures 13.6 & 13.7

this is a case where the Bentley manual is indespensible, if you don't
have one, beg, borrow or uh, beg you really need the manual for a lot of
settings on the Type 2  no other manual (except the rarer and more
expensive orange shop manual) will do the job.

the 76-79 tranny looks different but this adustment is done the  same
