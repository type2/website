My theory, and it's only that, is that the street/driver side gets
the splash from passing cars even while parked. My second guess
is that since the driver's side is the most used, the water from
rain/snow tracked into the cab tends to collect and seep thru
the driver's side floor and help that side of the beam to rust...
