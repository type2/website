Subject: Clutch Pedal Doesn't Return

You could be dealing with a number of problems, but pulling the clutch cable is 
a good place to start.  Since the pedal won't return without your assistance, 
you can check for binding/corrosion in the clutch pedal axis when you remove 
the cable.  You may also notice something about the cable such as fraying... 
but then you may choose to pull the engine and look for problems in the clutch 
release shaft axis or the clutch cover springing.  If one of the release forks 
has come un-welded, you would have different symptoms; but when you are 
underneath removing the clutch cable, why not soak the release bearing axis 
with plenty of penetrating oil.  Good luck!

...yesterday on my way into work it got significantly worse and  
when I depressed the clutch pedal, the pedal did NOT return (come  
up).  I could pull up the pedal with my toe and the clutch would  
disengage (allowing me to drive) but it wouldn't come up on its own.

  **-- you mean 'engage' here; you normally disengage the clutch by depressing 
the clutch pedal --**

I tightened the cable (it seemed loose even though the freeplay had  
seemed about right when checked before tightening) and now the  
freeplay seems "more right" but the clutch is hard to depress - it  
feels like it's binding.

I also verified that:
   (a) the spring on the throw-out bearing arm is in place and  
working, and
   (b) the bowden tube is tightly attached to its mount and has a  
bend in it.

My next step is to pull the clutch cable. I expect that I'm going to  
find it's frayed somewhere in the middle and as a result, binding in  
place.  Hopefully it'll come out without any major problems.
