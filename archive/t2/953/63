Hi Rob,

Meeting up in Key west is fine by me, as long as I have my  
sponsorship covered or the movie rights purchased.

BTW, should anyone on the list have connections to help sell my movie  
rights, I am sure we could negotiate a generous finder's fee.

We got our second snowfall of the year last night, and I am SO ready  
for a road-trip right now.

Only 48 sleeps 'til Everybus....

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
