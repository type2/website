Subject: Re: [T2] ragtop in a 77?

Gary asked:


 i've been wanting to remove the pop-up from my Riviera and replace it with something else.  I found some
rag-top kits at this website, but was wondering if anyone else has done this?

 At least this site has the instructions so you will know what you are getting into.

I really don't want to plunk down over $500.00 just to find out that won't work. I like the idea of a ragtop,
since I won't have a huge sheet of plexi to deal with.  I also have the bus in a lot of
 parades, and this will "let the sun in" while I'm driving 5mph.

Just about all the people that have installed them complain about water leaks.....

Or so I have heard.  I do not remember anyone saying theirs did not leak.
