Well, I screwed up.  Would the fellow that was asking about writing an article about the Great North American Extreme Bus Race please send the message again.  I meant to hit 'reply' and hit 'delete' instead.  Twice.  So I don't have the email or the address.  Some days I wonder if Alzheimer's is starting to set in.  Thanks...KR
