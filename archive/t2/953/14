ok so it is not the clutches, it could still be the govenor or sticky
valves, I think you may not have a "REAL" serious problem.

the spring goes towards the rear of the accelerator lever.


tranny  -----lever----(((adj nut)))||spring,(c-clip
                                   ||
                                   ||lever

hope that helps

also remember on the 010 tranny in the 77 the shift detents are located
inside the tranny so adjusting the linkage needs to be done EXACTLY as it
is step by step in the Bentley. it sounds weird but it is the only way
I've found to get it to work  right.

good luck
Bob
