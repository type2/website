Subject: wheels/tires again


Folks,

I am toying with the idea of going to 15" or 16" rims on my 78.

Has anyone ever seen 16" rims that will fit the bolt pattern?
I will not use wheel adapters.

Has anyone had any expierience with this particular combination...good or 
bad.

I'm not worried about the speedometer part right now, but whether the 
combination might actually fit and not rub.  I would like to use low 
profile tires.

For example

185r14      load=1600(c range)           revs/mile=811
195/75r14   load=1710(d range)           revs/mile=825

225/70HR15  load=1764lbs                 revs/mile=759

245/50HR16  load=1576                    revs/mile=809


Any comments?

Cheers,dave
