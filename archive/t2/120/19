has anyone actually approached VWoA about getting a license, what kind of
response have they gotten??

Manditory bus content,  my local VW dealer loves looking at my bus, but
still barely carries anything for it, and the one OLDER local dealer who
occasionally had a gem buried away in his storeroom recently had a fire
and it destroyed the shop/warehouse.  (we should learn from this
professional, he also does Mercedes and a MB gas tank caught fire while
being repaired)  most of the VWs in the shop were saved, but several
Mercedes were destroyed, fire started in the MB end of the shop
