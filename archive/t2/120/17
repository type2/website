Ummm... Glen, if you mistook a dead battery for a seized engine, maybe you
aren't the guy to deal with a Corvair conversion. I know I wouldn't attempt
such a task. Even thouhg my father's first new car was a Corvair and I'd
have more help than I wanted, there's a reason you don't see many of these
on the road.

Hmmmm... If the battery is dead and the engine is running - except for
smelling weird stuff from the battery, there is no way to tell. If your
headlights were dimming as you drove then your battery is fine. You need to
check your generator/alternator/whatever GM put on the Nadermobile...

Linkage! Linkage! Linkage! you've got at least four feet more linkage in the
bus than the Corvair originally had - and even then any linkage can suffer
bigtime from minor problems. New bushings, adjusting the linkage, etc, will
probably fix all your problems.
