Guys,

I can't imagine my 78 being any different....

I bought 2 4x8 3/4" at Lowe's and slid them right in thru the back 
hatch...

I didn't take out the center seats and just folded the back one down.

On mine, there is more than 48" between the back hatch sides...I didn't 
even scratch anything.

Cheers, dave
