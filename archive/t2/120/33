Subject: flywheel

I am trying to install the flywheel on my new rebuilt AVP engine. But I am
having some trouble.

My engine turns fine with the flywheel off. Once I put the flywheel on,
lining up the pin and lightly tightening the 5 bolts, the engine won't turn
anymore. Its as if the flywheel is fouling the case. I have not torqued the
bolts to 80ft lbs yet.

I thought maybe I needes some shims. After researching the archives I see
that there should be some shims for crankshaft endplay, and I am not sure
what they look like, but on my AVP engine the main seal was already
installed and there seem to be some "rings" there with an o-ring over them.
I assume these are the shims and that AVP has already taken care of this.

Why won't my engine turn with the flywheel on? Am I missing some shims or
something. I have been reading my Bentley but am at a loss.

I am reusing the flywheel, the correct 210mm for my 72 Westy and although I
haven't gotten that far a new 210 Sachs clutch.

Thanks!!
