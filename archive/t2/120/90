David -

I finally had to get mine in a self-supplied can from Steve's VW (or Steve's
Automotive?), west of Pontiac, a block south of M-59, I believe on Elizabeth
Lake Road.  Good shop.  Man that stuff is hard to find.

I have his card at work.  If you can't dig up his phone number, email me at
jhartranft(-at-)ssoe.com and I'll send it back to you.
