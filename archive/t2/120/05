I am in the process of redoing the interior of my 71 westy and have a =
question.  I removed all the interior wood and found a source for =
Russian Baltic birch.  1/8 in 5x5 (-at-) Woodstock Supply in Rapid City, =
South Dakota ( 35$ for 5 sheets near Mount Rushmore, I stayed out of the =
trip thread but suggest a pass on Wall Drug).  The panel on the drivers =
side cargo area is about 2 feet longer than the 5x5 sheets.  Was there a =
longer sheet used or was there a splice/ joint?
Steve
