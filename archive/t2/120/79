Hmmmm.  Maybe.  But they don't sell busses or
things, or aircooled parts.  I think you judge a
person by their actions.  VW could very easily
ship parts from vw brazil or mexico and sell them
at vw shops across the nation.  They could also
sell t shirts and mugs and whatever with
aircooled products stenciled on them.  At a large
profit.  But they do not.  In fact, they attempt
to preclude products of VW Brasil and Mexico from
being imported.  They don't want to sell us
parts.  And they don't want others to sell us
parts.  

Why?  

I have read many articles on vw's corporate
philosophy.  Essentially the current group
believe that the company held onto the aircooled
designs for too long and that was the cause of
their near demise (rather than the poor products
and quality control present in late 70's and 80's
models).  They are disassociating with the
aircooled past.  

They didn't want the New Beetle and still don't
sell it anywhere except here in North America. 
The New Beetle comes with boy racer engines,
instead of something simple and economical. 
There is plenty of marketing dollars spent to
show it as a little race car-- no effort to
portray it as economical, reliable, or easy to
work on.  I remember an article about the CEO
disliking the vehicle, but able to stomach it if
it included larger brakes and a taut suspension. 


VW is the European version of Pontiac. 
Everything today has body moldings and aluminum
rims and a little "zoom-zoom."  (Sorry Mazda.) 
They are working desperately to continue
dissassociating from the past.  They don't want
to stop Buswhatever.com so that they can take
over the business.  They want stop
buswhatever.com so that our busses must be
crushed.  So that the image of VW is a Golf GTI
instead of a bug or bus.  

/Rant off/
