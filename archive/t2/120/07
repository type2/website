Subject: Re: [T2] A Few Questions

Thanks to everyone who responded on the GL4 question. My local NAPA doesn't
have it. I'm going to be in the Detroit area the next couple weekends and
you can bet I'll be calling around to see if anyone has it up there! If I
strike out I'll call the Sta-Lube people and see if they have a distributor
nearby.

Second Question: Spark Plug Length.  I have a 1974 bus with an AVP 1800cc
long block. It was built on a GE code FI case...maybe '78 vintage? Anyhow, I
know the stock spark plug is a Bosch W8AC which is a short reach (1/2")
plug. The NGK recommended is a long reach (3/4") plug. Unobservent person
that I am, I went ahead and installed the NGK's. The engine leaps to life
when I even THINK about engaging the starter, she purrs like silk and runs
smooth as a kitten. The total absence of loud noises and catastophic failure
leads me to believe that even though the plugs are long, they're not hitting
anything. So the question is,    A) what is the correct length of plug for
this engine, and 2) is there any harm in running the longer plug in my
engine?

Just curious,
Dave
Thanks
