wheeeh,  wish I had a kept mine,  I had a 23 window 1960 deluxe microbus,
not a camper.  now it was only a few years old when I bought it, so these
are ancient memories

good.
.  it was kewl
.  it could carry a bunch of folks
.  1st gear was so low I could pull stumps, well not really but I moved
Railroad rail with it once!
.  easy to work on
.  yes it really does float (ask me how I know!)

bad
.  power was non existant
.  speed was equally non existant
.  dang sunroof leaked like sieve, never could get it tight
.  was about the worst handling bus I have ever owned, but since it
couldn't get out of it's own way going downhill with a tailwind that was
not that big a problem.  

I would imagine body parts are next to impossible to find nowdays and if
it is that nice, would you really want to drive it???
