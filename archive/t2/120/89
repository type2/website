HI,
I live in Denver and I noticed that you are
considering going through Santa Fe. I probably
wouldn't do this because you would probably have to
use I-25 to cross into NM. This means crossing Raton
Pass. This is not an easy going thing to do. If you do
do this I would make sure that the weather is good.
The trip down 25 to CO springs is not very fun so I go
up 285 to the pine Junction road. This will take you
to woodland park( home of Rocky Mountain Motorworks)
this is a great drive, there are some climbs but no
big deal. I drove a bus that a friend was buying( wich
was only running on three cylinders) with no problems.
I would say that this is a bueatiful drive and has
very little traffic. Once you get to woodland Park it
is a maybe ten minute drive to Colorado Springs. This
just adds some color. Past that there isn't much else
to see in colorado south of Denver along I-25 or east
of denver if you decide to go that way.
If you get to Denver and the bus needs anything
