 Hi all,
We sure do get away with murder down under :-)
If you want to see some pics of a really good Country Buggy check out these from my website.
This example belongs to a guy who lives in the same town as me & he picked the car up for AUD$3800........yep, about US$2000!
It's a 67 model(we think) in perfect condition & includes(here's the type2 content) a swingaxle bus gearbox, suspension & reduction gears for that low down torque ;-)
It runs the original 1200 engine & still has it's original spare tyre & hood.
I went out for a ride in it one day & all I can say is it was COOL!!
