Subject: Vanagon Bentley manual to trade

Hi. I have a Bentley manual for the Vanagon air and water-cooled models that I would like to trade for a bay window bus Bently manual. If anyone has a spare and is interested let me know and we can work out the details.
Regards to all.
Paul.
PS If a member of the Vanagon list could forward this message for me I would be most grateful:o)
