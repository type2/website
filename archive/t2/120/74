Guys,
You do not *need* to remove anything - wheels or otherwise to pull the ax=
les. =

Just get up in there with the right allen wrench and go to town.

You'll need her up on jack stands and you'll want to clean the heads of t=
he
bolts as well as you can, but you don't need to remove anything.

Granted - you could do it without the jack stands and it is much easier w=
ith
the engine out, but...
