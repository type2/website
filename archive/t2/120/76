Hi all,

I'm in the process of rebuilding my '78 2.0L.  I had some great VW (not
VWoA)
karma this weekend and managed to get the engine out.  Not a single problem

removing CV joint bolts even!  Wheeled the engine and tranny into the
garage to
begin teardown.

Unfortunately, my karma must have run out.  My roommate pulled her car into
the
garage to park and actually hit my engine!  Luckily no major damage, but
the
sheet metal that curves around the alternator (the dipstick plugs into this

piece) is bent and won't mate up with the rearmost tin that I'd already
removed!  ANYONE know where I could get this one piece of tin for the type
IV???

Also, have all tin screws removed but 1.  The little bugger's head is
stripped.

Other than these probs, all is good.

TIA for any help on the engine tin!

Beth in Houston
