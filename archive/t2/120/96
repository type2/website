As others have posted, this is a dial indicator.  With either a magnetic
base or a bolt-on base

Rob, you DO have the spacer washer or AC pulley under the fan, right? :-)
If you leave that washer out, it locks up your engine just as you describe
(ask me (and Sean) how I (we) know :-)

Bentley gives a procedure in Section 17.5 of the engine chapter.  Their
method specifically states to use 3 shims and to use two while measuring
and insert a third of appropriate thickness.  Their description is pretty
bare-bones, however. The (slightly) expanded method on this that I have
used is to

bolt the fan to the rear of the crank (*with* the washer in place!),

remove front main seal and one shim in place there,

bolt the flywheel to the front end of the crank,

place/bolt the dial indicator to the flywheel so that the measuring rod is
in contact with the case, zero the indicator,

push/pull the flywheel and read how much play there is.

insert a third shim of appropriate thickness.

The ideal end play is .07mm.  Bentley sez .07-.13 is OK, I say on a new
engine .07-.10  The new shim(s) is/are going to wear a bit as they break
in and if you measure a couple thousand miles down the road, you  will
find that the end play has opened up a bit.  Start at .13 and you may find
that you are past the .15mm wear limit in only those few thousand miles.

As I sit here, I am betting that you forgot to put that washer back under
the fan, however.  *most* rebuilders set the endplay before shipping a
rebuilt engine.
