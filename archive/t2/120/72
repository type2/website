They are called "dial indicators."  You will also want a "magnetic base" to 
hold it.
Sets of reasonable quality can be found at www.use-enco.com for around $25.

I doubt Sears has them in the store, and I really doubt you'll find one at 
a FLAPS.
Look in the yellow pages for stores catering to machine shops, if you must 
find one
locally.
