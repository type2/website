Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarket Tents

Anybody ever see a tent for the rear hatch for sale new? I think somebody on
this list pointed out a bed extender/tent for the rear of the bus that was
for sale on Ebay. According to the auction the top slid over the rear hatch
and the bottom board slid under the back cushion. It had some kind of
support that went under it.  This extended the sleeping area by about 3
feet. I thought that this may be of some interest to some people that are
looking for extra room via a small tent.

I bought an aftermarket tent several years ago made by Eureka.  We were 
traveling up the east coast to New Brunswick and stopped at LL Bean.  It was

apparently made for SUVs, bit fit nicely on Lurch!  It has a cowl that 
fastens onto the back of the vehicle.  It has a zip-up door on that side 
also.  It functions great as a stand-alone.  You just back up to it and 
attach the cowl onto the back, open the hatch, and your living space is
HUGE.
