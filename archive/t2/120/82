Subject: wheels/tires again

>>I would like to use low profile tires.

225/70HR15  load=1764lbs                 
revs/mile=759

245/50HR16  load=1576                    
revs/mile=809

Any comments?

Yes, it will look like sh*t and ride like sh*t. 
And people will laugh at you.  I assume you will
add thumper speakers and those kewl glowing blue
or red lights on the front?  Lower it?  Clear
rear lenses?  Aren't there any useless civics or
neons around you that you could do this to?  Must
you waste a bus?  

Darn, I'm in rant mode again.  

/Rant off/

Or maybe I'm just getting old....
