Subject: Re: [T2] Clicking Sound

I'm about to tear apart the rear wheels to explore and possibly replace
the CV joints as a result of some clicking noise on acceleration after
right turns.  I'm pretty sure it's the CV's because I've had a torn boot
on the outer for awhile.  One good thing is I have some good ones sitting
in the shed waiting.  As soon as time and weather permit...
