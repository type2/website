Subject: jealous parts man

I just wanted to list to know that I started this parts business because I
love working on my bus. All these great posts about fixing your buses is
making me really jealous. I mean I get to play with bus stuff all the time
it's just never my own. Well I guess I am just too busy and that is a good
thing. Used parts is a lot of work. It's not just knowing what's what, it's,
pulling cleaning fixing and cataloging. A never ending task, but I love it.
I just want everyone to know that we sell new parts as well. Quality
restoration rubber and mechanical parts such as brake, engine, transmission,
and suspension parts. This stuff is easier to sell for sure. While our used
parts will be our number one focus we just encourage you all to get new
parts from us as well.

Maybe if you all bought more new stuff from us it would make my job easier
and then I could work on my own buses and maybe make it out to a show or
two. Comments welcome
