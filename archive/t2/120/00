Subject: Re: [T2] Ronnie's Dyno

I second the motion that Ronnie brings the Dyno to BBB-VII to dyno the 
raffle (OBC) bus motor.

All in favor - Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye...
All Opposed - (awkward silence)

Motion passed. You listening Ronnie? While you're at it, construct a "rear 
wheel to input shaft" mechanism to measure "real" rear wheel Torque...
