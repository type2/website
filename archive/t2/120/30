Subject: Shocks

I am finally getting ready to replace the shocks on my '72 with KYB's.  I
plan on doing the work this weekend and have already started hitting all the
bolts with Liquid Wrench.  Are there any special tricks I need to know to do
this job?  Should I replace all the nuts & bolts, or should I just clean the
old hardware and reinstall if they appear structurally sound? 

	
Thanks in advance,
