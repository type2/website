>>Are there any special tricks I need to know to do
this job?<<

nah, its pretty easy.

>>Should I replace all the nuts & bolts, or should I just clean the
old hardware and reinstall if they appear structurally sound?<<

on the 2 busses that i have put shocks on, i have cleaned & reused the
original hardware with no apparent problems. i did grease the part
of the mounting bolt that slides through the mounting sleeve on
the shock. i've heard they can be a real bugger to remove once frozen up.

good luck.
