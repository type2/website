Another tangent: Phil Knight, the head honcho at Nike, is
often credited with taking "branding" to incredible eco-
nomic returns. Nike is sold at an incredible price - the
fact that there's a pair of sneakers to carry the logo
is secondary. Other corporations, and VW obviously,
are following suit. Often the "brand" is leased out to
ludicrous proportions - "Mack" work boots at K-Mart,
a "Johnny Walker" clothing line, etc. By grabbing as
many VW-related words/logos/whatever, the ad or
product dept. at VW are making sure they (and no-
one else) has control over them. Another good ex-
ample is Harley-Davidson...they've trademarked
just about everything even vaguely related to the
bike; most of the nicknames that the bike acquired
over the years are now H-D owned. I don't know how
"protective" H-D is about them...But H-D even tried
to trademark the sound of the engine!
VW (I'm sure) realizes the value of their "brand",
and wants to make sure they get full value for
it's use.
