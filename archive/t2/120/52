Jeremy,

There is a special tool to press in the bushings. However a large threaded
rod, the appropriate fender washers and nuts will do the job just fine. Get
a threaded rod with a diameter just bellow that of the spindle and a fender
washer whose outside diameter is just larger than outside diameter of the
bushing. The kit should have instructions.

'ello Volks,
The steering in my 77 westy got really bad over the last week, so i crawled
under there, per muir, and had my associate wiggle the steering wheel and
regular front wheels. the center pin (kingpin) had a lot of twist in the
side to side up down kind of way. So, i tried loosening the nut on the drag
link, compressing the pin, and retightening. I was unable to gain more than
about 2 mm of progress. So, i went to my local VW Auto Parts Place (HALSEY
AUTO in Portland OR, an excellent place) and explained my dilemna. The
counter dude said i need the swing arm repair kit, they will have it in
later today. Has anyone done this job before, any advice, warnings, special
tools? Thanks!
