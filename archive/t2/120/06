I have a great side tent. It is really a utility tent for the phone 
company. It is made to set up next
to equipment cabinets(about the size of  a bus). It has a lip with 
magnets sewn in and two suction cups that have a finger pump to secure 
them. The sides have panels that velcro off and can be replaced with 
screen panels. It comes in a nice heavy duty bag and the tent itself is 
really heavy duty.
I'll try and get some pictures of it.
