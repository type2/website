--Adam makes a good point here. The two VW only suppliers in my area, one of them being in all magazines, have the local reputation of being run by nazi-type thinkers. I can't validate this without asking them straightup, but everytime I go in there, I can't help but think about it, and everytime they treat me crappy, I get really goin'.

Which is why I love BustedBus! (get it Joe?)
