OK, where you are from was a stupid question, sorry I didn't read slower.

I wouldn't take I-70 through MO unless you really need to, it is a very
narrow four lane that has the traffic of a 6 lane day and night.  There are
some beautiful small 2 lane highways south of I70 that will take you through
some beautiful Ozark country.

Not much through KS unless you are into ultralights, RANS aircraft is in
Hays KS and is just 10 minutes off I70.

You could head north and pick up I80 which will take you through the Neb.
badlands, or head even further north into South Dakota and hit the Black
hills, they have a bunch to see.
