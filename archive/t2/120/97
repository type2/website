Subject: Re: crank end play measuring

I used a variation of the MUIR method-
I mounted a 3/8" bolt through an upper engine mount hole, and then
attached a giant washer to which is welded a nut that holds a valve
adjusting bolt (rounded head).  Preload the thrust bearing by turning
engine in direction it turns (clockwise from rear). Pull flywheel out. 
(You did remember to NOT have the o-ring flywheel seal installed yet??  
Makes it easier). Turn in bolt until it just touches flywheel. Push
flywheel in. Now you have the end play.  Measure it with a $3 feeler
gauge. If you can't measure it, take out one of the three shims, bolt on
the flywheel and check again.  The 3rd shim must be the thickness of
your measurement minus the endplay you want.  If it's too thin, you may
have to find a thinner version of one of the other 2 shims.
   If using new shims, use 2 new ones and do the above and figure out
the 3rd.  More accurate, as used shims can be cupped or thinner on one
edge vs the other.
