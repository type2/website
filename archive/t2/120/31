Ok here's another tangent. Some one mentioned that VW 
Trends trademark was dead. That reminded me of the last 
issue that I bought. One of the editors was complaining 
about his bad custmer service experiences when dealing 
with "large corporations". He went on to say that he 
much preferred to deal with the small businesses that 
support the acvw hobby. Oddly enough he had nothing to 
say about how VWoA hs been going after some of these 
samll businesses. Gee, you don't suppose he didn't 
mention VWoA on purpose do you. Maybe the editors at VWT 
just haven't heard about these beloved small businesses 
being threatened. Or maybe he didn't want to bite the 
hand that feeds his mag a fair amount of ad revenue.
