Don't bother pointing our fingers at each other too much. Read an article about an environmentalist who rallied against SUVs and flew from coast to coast on a private jet. 

Article said a hummer driven 15K miles would not burn as much fuel as the enivronmentalist did in the one flight.. <grin!> 

Link on request.
