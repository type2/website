On the 30/31, first set a clearence on the fast idle
screw, it must not touch the shaft when the choke is
off. Start the car then set 900 RPM with the air
volume screw, then go to the mixture screw and (from 3
turns out)turn in till a 50 RPM drop, then back up 1/2
turn, adjust the RPM with the volume screw to 950RPM
and you are done.
