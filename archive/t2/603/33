Subject: 1976 Transporter for sale, Mt Pleasant, SC

Hello,
$2500 obo.

I have had it for sale for a while, but at a higher price( $3500).

It is in great shape.  I daily drive it now.  Very little rust (there is
rust under the front window) other than that, no other rust of any
significance.

New motor, clutch, brakes, tons of other stuff i cannot think of in regards
to the fuel injection.............it runs like a top. Motor has maybe 5k
miles on it.

I must sell, though for i want to restore my single cab, and to do that,
something has to go.

Pmail vgonman(-at-)msn.com for more info and or pics.....but please, request the
pics only if truly serious.
