Oh, yeah.... I was wondering if anyone knew where to get the plastic strips to go between the pieces of panelling. I'm looking for some like the ones which go between the front, rear and middle sections of headliner, only longer. Both pieces of panelling would lock into the strip from either side. Thanks.                                     -Paul Deatherage
