The color of your exhaust hasn't anything to do with your exhaust 
pipes. Sounds like you are running rich.

Since the pipes aren't your current problem, you should make a point of 
replacing your exhaust at a leisurely pace. The only parts that you 
cannot get new are the headers and the crosspipe. These can usually be 
repaired by a competent welder. The rest are all available aftermarket.
