Subject: N part numbering

i'm pretty familiar with the volkswagen part numbering scheme of
xxx yyy zzz but, i don't understand how the N type part numbers work.  for
example the part number for 7mm fuel hose is N0202811.  is there a
methodology to this part numbering system like the other?  what does the N
stand for?  inquiring minds want to know :).  also can someone tell me the
specification difference between these two fuel hose types?

N0202811
N203571
