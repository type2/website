Yes.

Yes. You can compensate for dirty injectors or
slightly richen the mixture for a little more power
and better throttle response. However, here in the
Dallas/Fort Worth area we recently started a state
inspection program that utilizes an ASM II procedure.
Vehicles from '95 to '79 are run on a dyno with a
5-gas analyzer. I had to use an analyzer to get my AFM
back to stock adjustment. It still runs okay adjusted
lean enough to pass the state inspection.
