Subject: Weird starting problem - 71 Westy (with extra solenoid)

Hello List,

First thanks to all who replied to my plea a while
back for parts to get my bus through Mass. inspection,
I haven't fixed everything, but it has passed!!!

My problem now is that on turning the key, the gen and
oil lights dim, as if the solenoid is taking power,
but nothing happens..

My bus has a second "jumper" solenoid which has worked
great for years.. Maybe it's bad? What's weird is that
it started today when I accidentally nudged and put on
the turn signals, at which point it started turning
over.. Battery has a decent charge..

Has anyone had this problem, and knows which bit of
the electrical system to look at first??? Is is likely
to be a feed or ground problem?? Why would the turn
signals be involved?? Or is it just possessed?? :)

TIA,
Dave

'71 Westfalia :)
