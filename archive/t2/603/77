My '70 and '71 have the same differences. When I went to try to change it
on my '70 I found that the length of some of the wires will not allow it.
So, it must be that the change is supposed to be that way.

> I have both a '69 and '71 Westfalia.  On the '69 the switch that turns on the interior lights is on the left of the steering column. The switch for the headlights is on the right. On the '71 they are just the opposite. Is one correct and the other a leftover from someone's rewiring?  Are both right?  Just curious.
