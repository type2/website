Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

I don't believe in guesswork either, but the design of the AFM in the
air-cooled engines inevitably leads to this problem.  If you've troubleshot
all the rest of the mechanical, ignition and FI components and they've
checked out fine, if you've tried to lean out the basic mixture at the AFM
and can't get it lean enough, then the obvious answer is that the AFM is to
blame.  I've performed the "spring-tightening" procedure, monitoring the
results with the O2 sensor, and everything seems to have worked OK, as I've
driven many miles and many years with my "fixed" AFM.

That's not to say that buying a new or rebuilt AFM isn't a "better"
solution, but as far as I can tell my adjusted AFM is performing well.
