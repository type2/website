Subject: Re-calibrating AFM?

I'm wondering whether anyone has had any success re-calibrating the AFM 
on a fuel injected bus to obtain proper air/fuel mixture.  Is this 
simply a matter of moving the spring holder inside to increase or 
decrease spring tension.

BTW, I am aware that conventional wisdom suggests that the AFM is not 
adjustable, other than idle mixture, but it would appear that the means 
for adjustment are provided for in the design.
