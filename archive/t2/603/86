Subject: Re: [T2] Got the stripped oil plug

In my opinion, Id re-tap it.  There are chances you'd get some shavings,
yes.  Just dont tap it much bigger than it is, and you wont have much metal.
I dont remember if the plug is fine thread or coarse.  If its fine, you
might even be able to tap a coarse thread of the same diameter right across
it.  I think you should tap it and just make sure you clean it out as best
you can.  If you go slow, the shavings shouldn't be able to get far from the
hole.  Even then, you can just pour some oil in with the plug out and flush
the bottom of the pan.

Consider this.  You are weighing the work of flushing the system versus the
chance of JB weld giving out and you dropping your oil on the highway.  I
dont quite trust that stuff when its life-threatening.  (remember, the
surfaces are far from clean)  Good luck with whatever you choose to do.  Let
us know, too, because Im curious how this works out in case I end up in the
same situation one day.
