Subject: Pick and Pull report Woodland CA

Hi folks:

Finaly got into the local pick n pull, Merto Auto in Woodland to find 
parts for the F8rd truck I picked up for my business.

In the yard were three Vanagons and two Bays.  The Bays were both 
solid bodys but had been partially parted.  In the "hold lot" (10 
days left) was a 78 Westy automatic complete, with a few extra front 
seats from elsewhere in the yard.  A beetle or two as well and a 
wreck Vanagon might be only good for the motor.  Woodland is 10 
minutes north of Sacramento on Rt 5 Get off at the exit for the 
Sherrifs Detention Facility, take a left 1 mile on left.

Ben

PS Note my Westy didn't NEED any parts... <g>
