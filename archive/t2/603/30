A question not directed at me but I will answer regardless...

Yes, both on my 78 Bus and on my 74' Westie.

Your corrected...
Both mine get this sludge regardless if I'm driving my bus' in the winter or
summer. And I am sure that the flaps are operational as well as the
thermostat.
And I have put over 14,000 km (closer to 19-20,000) on my 78' this past year
(nice long trips and cold, in the winter) and around 3500 miles (it has a
mph speedo)
on the westie. (They are hot enough to supposably burn off any moisture)
