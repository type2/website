You are correct sir - my '69 had that nice amber look only varnish and
years of sun can give you.  From '70 or '71, they started using a
stain and the wood has a sort of whitewashed look to it.  IMHO, much
nicer than the fake brown stuff in the later Westies (but the later
Westy interiors are WAY more functional).
