Subject: Re: Re[2]: [T2] Engine/tranny install advice

When removing or installing engines in either my 75 bus or 80 Westy I drive it
up on some simple wooden ramps I built. Each ramp consists of a 2X8 with 2 2x6
stacked on top. Each 2x6 is screwed to the board underneath it. I think the
2x8 is about 31/2' ft long, the middle 2x6 about 2ft 10in and the top board is
about 2ft long. All three boards are cut at a 45 deg. angle across the end
grain at one end and 90  deg. on the other end. the 90 deg. ends all line up
flush. This makes for a gentle 123 bump to the top. I actually built these to
change oil in a native born sporty car I used to have but find they raise both
buses to exactly the right height for my F.I. engines. From your pics I am
sure you would need to remove those carbs or tilt the engine back and forth to
slip the carbs under the bus. Either way, I find this to be the most secure
way of raising the bus short of a professional 4 point lift. I am quite
cautious these days, had my wife's F**D slip off jack stands and punch me in
the chest. Glad all wheels were still bolted on!

If my words don't describe my ramps well enough let me know and I'll Pmail
some pics If my digi cam still works.
Be safe

  No heat exchangers to put the 2x10 under as the engine is sitting in the
  cargo bay.
