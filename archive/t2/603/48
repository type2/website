Subject: Westfalia Wood Stain- Solved!

I have been redoing the inside of my 73 westy for a while now. I just cut out new panelling from new 3mm baltic birch. I've been buying half-pint cans of stain, trying each one out and was growing very frustrated. I tried the following: Minwax Fast-Drying Polyurethane Clear Satin, Clear Semigloss and Clear Gloss. These stains took the fleshy colors out of the wood. It changed it to a gold/brown color which looked good, but wouldn't match my original headliner. I tried Minwax White Pine, which looked good, but obscured the grain. I tried pickled white wash and it looked like a dirty, dingy grey. Today, I finally found something that looks pretty darn close to, if not just like the original. It is Olympic Interior Water Based Polyurethane Crystal Clear Satin finish. This brought out the sort of fleshy pink color that the original had and that other stains obscured. I'll have pictures up as soon as I get them all stained and installed. For now you can see the original headliner color I
 was trying to match near the bottom of page 9 at www.cardomain.com/id/deathead777 I hope this information is helpful to someone.
