Subject: Re: '71 brake pressure regulator

I would love to find a repair kit for my brake
pressure regulator. Mine has a slow leak that requires
me to refill the brake fluid about twice a year. I
haven't taken it apart because I'm afraid I'll need
some parts to get it back together and I don't have
the slightest idea where to get them. My brakes seem
to work okay but I don't like the idea of the leak.
Does anyone know where to get a kit?
