Subject: exhaust problems

So my mom borrowed my bus 76 bus today since her chevroley van is in the shop. When she got home today she called me to tell me she called pulled over by the local police to tell her dark colored exhaust was coming out of the tail pipe. My european garage told me at one time i needed to replace a bunch of exhaust pipes due to rust problem but moneys issues but that on hold. Well it looks like i am going to have to replace the pipes the question is when i bought my bus i wanted to keep it stock from the front ot the back but now i am thinking they don't make new exhaust parts for the 76 bus anymore and i would have to buy them used from a junkyard. I did that ince and i don't want to do that again is there a more effective way of replacing my exhaust sytem so i don't have to go through it again aby information would  be more than grateful
