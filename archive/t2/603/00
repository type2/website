I don't argue for full throttle on a cold engine, but rather for warm-up
in traffic without being unnecessarily hard on the engine before it has
reached operating temperature.

If we go out of town we almost have to warm the engine up a bit int he drive way as the highway is 2 minutes from the house... In really cold weather (6 AM departure for Grandma's house) I HAVE to warm it up a bit or I will be running 75 mph on a cold engine... Not goood.
