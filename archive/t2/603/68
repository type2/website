Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

I got to disagree here.  People are "assuming" that their AFM is the problem
with their condition.  It may or may not be.  But when you mess with spring
tension on such a precision instrument, without any way of testing the
results other than seat of the pants, you could be running lean at speed and
burn up a motor.

I do not believe in guesswork.
