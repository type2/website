Subject: Re: [T2] Need a throttle linkage nut for an auto transmission

| I guess the question I wonder is, why was that nut ever removed in the
| first place?   I know that doesn't help now...I guess I would take various

| the tranny right??   the other two are a clevis pin and a ball and socket.

As to why it wasn't on there, who knows.
I bought the bus w/tranny, the OE engine, a spare and some other misc. parts
a while back.
The guy I bought it  from did the dissas'y and I bought it to re-assemble.
My thought is that the PO dropped the engine and then thought to remove the
throttle linkage.
I found a strange bent-up shaft with a flange and bolt in one end and a
broken stud in the other when unpacking the parts.
I just set it in the not-needed parts pile till I got the engine in and
couldn't see how the throttle cable was going to reach.
That is when I went back to find that weird bent-rod-looking thing.
I had to mill the rod end a bit and weld a cap screw to the end of it to get
it back to near OEM.
That all seems to be going well but now I am trying to replicate the factory
bends in the linkage.
After the bends the PO put in it I am not sure which ones are intentional.

As to the try another question...I tried everything that I could find from
my "nuts can" and nothing worked.
I will try the BD guys next I guess.
It is, as you said, the linkage on the side, same spot as the shift linkage
arm.
Seems to be on some sort of concentric shaft.
It sticks up while the shifter lever hangs down.

Any other input on the auto-tranny is appreciated.
Sometimes when you ain't got all the bread you get all the fun.
Lots of great experiences, just never seem to run into the same problems.
I guess when you see them again, they don't look like problems.

| Bus Depot may have one of the trouble shooting manuals left, Ron found
| some NOS manuals and he had a tranny one for the 010 auto tranny which is
| what your bus "should" have in it.
|
| the "orange" VW service manual has a little more on the trannies than the

| send me a private e-mail and maybe I can help you with the tranny pages.
