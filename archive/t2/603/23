Subject: Seek steering box- 1972 in Arizona

Greetings troops!
Seek steering box for a 1972

Have rejoined the list based upon recent purchase of a 1972 Sundial.

Bus is in good shape sporting clean, straight panels and proper glass. It is
powered by a strong 2.0L with DelOrttos. Have worked out most of the kinks,
wiggled through AZ State inspection/emissions/registration process. Front
suspension remains as an immediate concern. Ball joints and drag link seem fine
but the box is toast.

Within the past few years have sold off all of the bling-bling buses to include
the '63EZ camper, the '54 Barndoor, the '67 Westy, the '68 Puck and as of today
the '97 Eurovan Winnebago. The 72, yeah I know..., will suffice for now.

Please advise on availability and reputation of commonly available "rebuilt"
and "new aluminum" replacement units. Heck based on my budget, I'd go for a
good OG used one. Bus Depot and Wolfgang seem to offer some alternatives.
Feedback anyone?
