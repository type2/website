I guess I dont get why this guys post generated the
rather caustic replies. Why not just give your
viewpoint
based on some facts rather than these unpleasent
responses. If you want to pick away at me on this..
p-mail me. 
  Most of the time here I see patient, well thought
out answers... these aren't good examples of a
reasonable
response on a tech. list..

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
