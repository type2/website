Subject: Backfiring Going Up Hill & Shifting Early

Hey Guys,

I'm slowly working out all the kinks in the bus and trying to resist eb*ying
the evil thing :-)  I have it running really smoothly now with a new points
and condenser.  The distibutor was really nasty inside and the old points
virtually melted around the dizzy shaft.  I cleaned everything up and it now
looks like new. I lubed the nylon rider of the new points with provided
grease.  I tested the vacuum advance and it seems to be working also.  So here
is the problem:

If I shift a little early (for testing purposes only) the bus loses power and
backfires a few times before catching up to speed.  If I approach a hill and
try to keep a steady speed without reving the engine the bus starts to severly
backfire and I have to downshift to get the RPM's up.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Tom
