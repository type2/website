Subject: Got the stripped oil plug

I9ve posted a couple times about my striped head on my oil drain plug, and
got lots of good advice, but things did not turn out so well.  Vice-grips
didn9t work.  The first tap I tried broke off in the bolt- right in the
middle.  I got after it with the tap again, but drilled it with successively
larger drill bits until I got the biggest tap I had in the hole.  I cranked
on his sucker with a 6 ft cheater pipe and finally got it loosened.  The sad
part is that the tap screwed up my threads on the case ( I couldn9t tap the
exact center due to the remains of the first tap).  I fished with a magnet
and got all of the shavings out of the case (I hope).  My plan is to JB weld
a new bolt in there and just change the oil through the screen.  Sound good?
Probably not permanent but I wonder how long I can expect this to work.  Is
there another way?  I could re-tap the hole, but worry about non-magnetic
case shavings getting inside.  Very frustrating turn of events for what was
a very strong 2.0...
