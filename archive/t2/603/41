Subject: Upright engine install

I'm trying to get my 1776 back into my 1970 Westy. It seems like when I
get the support bar on the rear end( the bus's, not mine) high enough to
clear the mounts, the front is way too high. Right now my tranny is
still at the same height as when I removed the engine. Should I adjust??
Any tips from the list gurus would help
 
BTW I just wanted to say thanks. I never would have attempted a solo
engine pull a year ago before I joined the list. You all gave me the
courage to stay out in the driveway cussin all day long :)
 
Thanks
Zach
