I guess the question I wonder is, why was that nut ever removed in the
first place?   I know that doesn't help now...I guess I would take various
nuts from other things and try one until you find one that fits, then take
it to the shop to get another one.,  now this is the one on the side of
the tranny right??   the other two are a clevis pin and a ball and socket.

Bus Depot may have one of the trouble shooting manuals left, Ron found
some NOS manuals and he had a tranny one for the 010 auto tranny which is
what your bus "should" have in it.

the "orange" VW service manual has a little more on the trannies than the
"green" Bentley manuals but they are much harder to find...

send me a private e-mail and maybe I can help you with the tranny pages.
