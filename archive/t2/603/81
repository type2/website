Subject: crankcase breather questions

I have a 2.0L fuel injected air cooled Vanagon with a new oil leak. Only
happens when engine is running and it is getting spread throughout the
engine compartment by the fan. I thought it was the oil pressure sender, so
I gently tightened it a little. Still leaked. Then I thought it was the oil
cooler gaskets so I replaced them. Still leaked. I am now trying to decide
between replacing the oil pressure unit with a new one and some Teflon tape,
or looking into the crankcase breather as this black piece of plastic
appears to represent the epicenter of the leakage, based on the pattern of
oil splatter on the top of the engine compartment and the oil that is now
filling the nooks and crannies of the top of the block.  I have also
replaced the distributor drive O-ring because it had been leaking as well.
The drippage after driving is mainly contained to the driver's side of
the engine, onto the heaterbox.

So the question is: is this crankcase breather equipped with a one way valve?
It
connects a hole in the near center of the block back to the fuel intake system
after the air flow meter stuff and before the intake manifold, so common sense
would tell me that there should
be a valve so that air can exit the crankcase and enter the air flow, but
that air coming through the air flow meter (destined for combustion) would
not be able to enter the crank case. However some people say I lack common
sense. Incidentally I can blow on both ends of the breather to force air
through it.

Anyone have an answer?
