Subject: camper wiring

I have a 72 bus that I am turning into a camper. I got the camper interior 
from a mid 80s van. It has the fridge and stove setup. Proble is I did not take 
it out and I have the wiring harness and can match up 2 plugs at the back of 
the fridge but there a few loose ends. 
As they appear:
green with female end, and a black with female end. these 2 are together 
coming out of one end of the harness. The black runs through to a plastic plug 
with a male end.
This plastic plug has one other male end which connects to the water pump,but 
what connects to these 2 ends.
How does the pump get turned on.
Then there are 2 black wires which tie together with a round connecter, this 
looks like it would bolt to the body as ground.
Then there are 2 wires just cut, one red and one white.
Does anyone have some wiring diagram for this or can help, thanks.

The fridge is a model rm182a and then westfalia type is listed on a tag on 
the bench as r27.
thanks Dylan
