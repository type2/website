Subject: '71 brake pressure regulator

Im renewing the entire brake system on my 71, except for steel lines, 
rotors, drums (hopefully), and pressure regulator.
Had intended to replace the pressure regulator while Im doing everything 
else, but dont find it readily available and not much about it in the 
archives.
Most relevant comment I found was Steven Dolans:
Probably the reason we have not had much traffic on the subject of the 
proportioning valve is that those puppies are pretty bulletproof. I've never 
seen a bad one and would have no idea how to go inside one. Another factor 
may be that they are all broken and we just ain't noticed :-)

Reckon Ill just let it be, but thought Id throw this out for input or 
suggestions.
Thanks




Best wishes
Denny Johnson
