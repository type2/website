 Scott Solomon AKA "VW Addict", are you still on the list?

I was searching through the archives regarding the SO-69
interior and read your posts from 2001.  I am looking for some
info.

Or if anyone on the list has an 1969 European SO-69
layout:  closet behind the driver, sink and stove, non-
walkthrough, full Z-Bed, etc, please give a holler.
