Joe and Zach -- For access reasons I've always pulled the rear wheels and 
supported the vehicle on jackstands.  AYMK this pretty well takes the rear 
suspension out of the equation; so I never had the problem you are talking 
about.  It seems to me that Joe's comments are right on the mark:  changing the 
weight on the rear suspension would make a difference in elevation of the 
transmission relative to the chassis, when the trans is supported rigidly from 
the floor!  Glenn

Zach, I've had the same problem.  I think what happens is that when the 
engine weight comes off the springs, the body rises -- but if your 
tranny is sitting on a bottle jack or something it hasn't moved 
relative to the ground, but the body has moved higher.
