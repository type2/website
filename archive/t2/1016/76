Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Stud Removal

Jason,

Putting it mildly, your spinning your wheels trying to get that stud
outa that head without heating the area around it.

The best suggestion would be to get the vehicle somewhere that can do
the job right.

Why even take the chance of screwing it  up any more than it already is?

The payoff here is, if you mess up that hole--your going to be yanking
the head to get it fixed.

The rolling snowball routine--
