Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Stud Removal

My set up is pretty primitive. At this time, I do not have an O&A set-up, so
the notion of heating it is really not an option for me. I was hoping there
was a tool that someone might know of that would hold the little fu$ker
tight enough that I could turn it out. Also, Dave told me about this stuff
called Kroil... My only concern with all this "loosens rusted parts" lubes
is that they are ALL susceptible to gravity. I need the stuff to go UP and
loosen the part.

Thanks for all the advice so far. Does anyone have another idea that might
work with what I have access to?
