Subject: RE: Emissions

Speaking of emissions, I passed a lot last year, too...

I also had to change out a lot of 'things' because they were 'dirty' , but
not clogged.  They were changed the last Spring or Summer (I forget - who
checks those things) and the leak I had last year is still not completely
fixed, but a lot better...

With my health insurance, I can get another 2 free inspections, but I don't
know if I can stand the cold hands.  I would try for an appointment with the
guru, but he is still in India.
