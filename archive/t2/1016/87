Subject: sliding door RnR

Hello list!Just looking for some verification..I need to find and purchase the
bearing/bumber assembly for the sliding door on a '78. Is the part number 211
843 342B for the entire assembly? the leg with the bumber on it has broken off
and the bearing is shot too.thanks in advance..
