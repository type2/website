Subject: 81 van air cooled, Califorina model(wont start)

This is a 81 Westy, air cooled, California model, 2.0L
Fuel injected. electronic distributor. Was bought in
NC, made it thirty miles south before being shut down
and towed to Liberty, SC. for a oil leak, has not been
started in two months. Now that I am looking at it it
wont start,it did run, why wont it run now. There is
fire at the distributor, coming in from the coil, and
going out the wires to the cylinders, has fuel
pressure (pump runs)Engine turns over good, just wont
start. Have tried starting fluid(no pop or anything),
throw me some ideas of what to check. Phil
