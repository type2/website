if the engine runs well it probably will not be hampered by the 010
tranny, BUT remember the auto tranny is no where near as robust as the
manual tranny.

hyd lifters were not stock in a 77 anyway so you already in non stock
territory.

I have been driving a 78 auto tranny bus for over 15 years and I'm on
my 4th tranny and I'm not that hard on transmisisons (348k miles) but
I've pretty much kept it stock...
