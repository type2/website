Subject: auto trans. and #107i compatibility

does anyone know where i can find out or if the weber camshaft #107i
is compatible with the 010 nf automatic transmission?  i read on page
59 of the engine and clutch section of the bentley's manual that the
camshaft for the manual transmissions are different from those used on
the automatic.  then again the cams used for hydraulic lifters are
different and have no bands cast into them.

if i put the #107i w/ hydraulic lifters into my 75 FI engine w/ a 77
010nf transmission will i be doing any harm or sacrificing engine
longevity?


thanks,

jeremiah
