Subject: Removing stock "heat exchangers"

Hi, On my '74 Westy, 1.8, I am going to remove the stock 'exhaust/ heater"
assembly, and was curious how Porsche handled the stock  "airfarce" in their
914, granted, there is a lot more 'Cabin" area in the Westy, but small
increments from the "parent company", might be buildable upon, eh?  Also I
have seen 'pics' of a local Vw Van, that went 12's in the quarter, but had a,
to me unique, top shroud air blower system, with a big fan, similar to
Porsche!  Has any one seen someone use this, or has used it, and what besides
'cosmetics", is bad about this system.  Yes I know ' If the factory built it
that way, it is Gospel", but divergence can sometimes equal 'creativy", eh?
