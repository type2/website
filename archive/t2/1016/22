Hey Kevin, I think I described my daughter's 75 bus as having the woofer 
as a tabletop between the seats, with folding drink holders fastened to 
the front.
    Back in 72 I extended the rear-facing seat behind the driver so 4 
could sit comfortably around the flipdown table.  The stock arraignment 
had a 4 legged stool that could be used for this function. Later busses 
gave up a lot of camaraderie space by removing that sinkcabinet by the 
door!  I made a custom  padded back hinged to the sink cabinet so one 
could sit comfortably but still could get from front to back.  A slide 
bolt held it in place.  The original stool top and material from the 
tire cover was taken for this.  Using my knack for pullable pins and 
slide bolts, a portapotti sat under the stool cover in a box created by 
(1-2) the sink cabinet and rear-facidng seat side, (3)a wall running 
from the fridge cabinet to the backside of the stock rear-facing seat. 
(4) The other side the box was removable by push bolts so the potty 
could be slid out for cleaning.  The seat was removable to use the potty 
by sliding a bolt in a front lip under the seat front, and lifting it up 
to allow two tabs in the back to release. In front of all this I had a 
liftop box that held a CB, drink holders, cassette tapes, etc. One could 
step on the liftup part to gewt over the seat.

  And to think I wasted money on a subwoofer and a box that fit there.
I was going to use the wood laminate for the sides and seating material
  to make a seat that looked like the original except for the fact that it
  sits on legs.  Hinged of course, with a shallow compartment underneath
to hold my minidisk player, switches, wiring, etc to easily switch between
  the stereo, ham radio,  video, or whatever else.
