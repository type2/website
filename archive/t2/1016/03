Subject: Re: [T2] small portable toilet to fit between bay window front 

Thanks to all for the input on a portable toilet for my 77 Westy. I'll be 
looking into buying one before I head out camping again. Sounds like it is 
possible to put it between the front seats to act as a seat/hassock , then 
pulling it back for use, when the bed is down and it's night time.
