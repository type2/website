We picked up a 2007 diesel passenger model about 4 weeks ago and so  
far, we like it.  It does remind me of a modern day type2 in its  
simplicity.  Cab space is huge, the seats can be moved around or  
taken out easily, and modifying the inside would be fairly simple.   
It even came with a smaller version of the Espar Airtronic 2 for  
instant heat in the mornings.  I may look for a magnetic emblem too.
