Subject: Anyone bought the BusDepot dish set with vans on it?

BusDepot sells a cool looking dish set that has pics of vans all around the
edges. However, it is made out of plastic based on the description. Has anyone
purchased this, and how is it holding up to knife and fork use?? I'm thinking
it could get scratched up pretty quick, judging by the way some of my family
attack their dinner. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
