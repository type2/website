Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint removal

Somewhere on the web there is or was a report on removing the ball joints. 
The main point was heating the torsion arm around the ball joint to a bright 
red and using a large hammer (BFH) on the side of the torsion arm portion 
encompassing the ball joint. I'm pretty sure the 20T press wont do it - at 
least mine won't. I finally bought 4 torsion arms with joints from Bus Boy's 
on sale.

I have the torsion arms off of my '77, and I need to press out the ball 
joints.? I have a 20 ton press, but the way the ball joint fits in the arm I 
am unable to use the arbors to hold the arm.
 The arm has two 'notches' opposite each other that appear to be the only 
way to hold the arm.?
 The local VW dealer said that they do have some of the tools left from that 
era and?if they had it I could use it, but he didn't hold out much hope.? I 
don't either.
 Does anyone have a pic?of the fixture that the dealers used to press these 
out???Or better yet, the number of the tool???
 Or has anyone made such a tool, or figured out a better way to press these 
ball joints out????
 I have heat if needed.
Any and all help appreciated.
 I looked in the archives, but pretty much all it said was 'take it to the 
local VW shop', and we haven't had one of those around here for many years.
