'atta boy Don - I added the optional second barometric sensor in my 
Megasquirt last spring.  This allows for continual adjustment of the 
mixture to compensate for changes in air density due to altitude (or any 
other) factors.  I ran it back and forth over the rockies in October and 
I didn't notice anything but the altitude delta was less than 2000 ft.  
Next time I hit the coast will be a better test.
