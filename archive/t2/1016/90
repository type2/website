Jason -

I would leave the the jetting alone as the jetting on the 32's is way too
lean and the chambering on the 34's are different enough that they would be
incompatible.  And re-jetting the former 32's with the 34's jets is really
out of the question here as well.  Both carbs, while basically the same have
enormous differences internally.  The venturis and throttle bores are
different sizes too and not recommended for changeover as well.

 Sounds like the idle bypass cut-off valve (that big one on the left carb)
is faulty (not grounding properly) and should be replaced (VW 049 129 412
C).  Fits 34PICT series carburetors and the Brosol H30/31PICT series out of
Brazil as well as the Left 34PDSIT-2.  Should be common enough to pick one
up at a FLAPS.  NOTE:  The size of the solenoid on the newer replacement is
smaller than the original, but still has the correct plunger assembly for
proper operation.

And BTW, what you are running are 32-34 PDSIT series carbs, not 32-34PICT -
no such animal and such a designation would confuse some out there.  Having
sold and used these over the years I have become quite familiar with some of
their workings.

And I have a NOS pair for a 72 Bus for sale if anyone's interested (please
Pmail).
