Subject: Out go the lights!

Every time it rains out here, the turn signals in my 78 California Bus 
stop working.  I can sometimes get them back if I wait long enough, but 
now that I live in the inner city, it means I can't drive my Bus as much 
as I'd like in the Winter.  to troubleshoot I've done the following:

Removed all bulbs and checked the conditions of the sockets including 
looking for water. 
Replaced the flasher relay with a German one per Bentley.
Checked area around fusebox for water entry.
Checked all fuses
Checked for open hot wires uncapped.

It will sometimes work if I replace the flasher relay after I let it dry 
out but once the rain falls out it goes.  I feel water is getting into 
the system somehow but I do not know where.  I am going to pop off the 
front mounted spare and check out the air vents.

Any other good ideas would be appreciated.  I need to go get it smogged 
in a couple of weeks and they do check the flashers.

Thanks,

BEN
