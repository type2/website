Subject: anyone have a towbar i can use to tow my new westy home ..

Anyone by chance have a tow bar in the Denver area that I could borrow
to tow home my new westy?  She's (he's?) a pretty nice looking yellow 76
standard.  The interior is in very nice shape.  The PO took it in to
have a head replaced and was screwed by the mechanic.  The top end is
off.  One dropped valve and the rest looks pretty good.  The price was
sure right...
