Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone bought the BusDepot dish set with vans on it?

I got the complete set for my birthday from a close friend. THEY ARE VERY
COOL!! One of my most prized Westy accessories. 

I am glad to report my 1 1/2 year old son eats off of them every single
meal. He won't eat off of anything else. He says "buzs???" if he doesn't see
them. They have held up extremely well to toddler abuse. Just don't
microwave them and be sure to hand wash them. 

Totally worth it!

BusDepot sells a cool looking dish set that has pics of vans all around the
edges. However, it is made out of plastic based on the description. Has
anyone
purchased this, and how is it holding up to knife and fork use?? I'm
thinking
it could get scratched up pretty quick, judging by the way some of my family
attack their dinner. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
