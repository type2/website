Subject: 70 bug gas heater fan stays on???

Hey experts, in the past 6 months, my B2 gas heater run just fine, EXCEPT that
the fan keeps blowing after you've pushed the dash knob in. I know it's
supposed to stay on for up to five minutes then shut off; I expect that.
Lately though it's been staying on for a couple of hours until I've noticed
it. A sharp smack on top of the heater (under the front hood)  turns it off.
I'm suspecting there are points somewhere sticking???? The sharp rap shuts it
off immediately. Any help would be great, I love this thing, but don't want
the battery dead when I need it!
Thanks
Courtney
