Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Anyone bought the BusDepot dish set with vans

Best set up for dishes is Solo color coded plates , small bowl's, and
cups.
Wash & reuse them till they wear out and toss them.

Inexpensive , light in weight, and available almost anywhere.

The no tears , who cares if they scratch dishes.
