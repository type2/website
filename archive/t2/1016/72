Speaking of that, we augment our Bus plates with similar very thin plastic
plates we received while on Amtrak (these are "room service" plates). They
have they stylish Amtrak logo, and last for about a year's worth of camping. ;)

Paper plates also work well. After use, they have a second life as a
firestarter.
