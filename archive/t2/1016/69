Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Stud Removal

Somehow, Someway get some Heat on the surrounding area of that stud to
eliminate the chances of snpping it flush--or even watching the aluminum
threads in the head walk out with the stud.

Then you really have some BIG problems.

Go rent a torch.
Pull, push, trailer, dolly, hook, the Bus to a muffler shop .
Let them remove it.

You'd be all done with this already.
