Subject: sitting in the bus thinking

Well, I suspect Peter and Troy are not the only ones that have spent time in their buses thinking - parked right at home.  I've done the same.  There's something about the coziness of the bus.  It feels like a safe, comfortable place to be.  And to contemplate life, future plans for the bus, etc.  

I used to have a really nice jazz gig at the nicest hotel in town.  They offered us a room to use to hang in on breaks.  I learned a long time ago, from a great musician I used to work for, that in a four hour gig, it's best to do three 1-hour shows and take two 30-minute breaks in between.  So I've always done that with my band.  But I fell into a routine of spending my breaks in my bus instead of the hotel room.  I could even have a friend or two out there, flip the seat around, and listen to some tunes, talk, watch TV, or whatever.  And the bar was always open.  (I've since given up the booze.)  Some of my friends who came to visit the club used to ask me where I always disappeared to on the breaks.  If I'd said, 'sitting out in my car,'  they'd have thought I was crazy.  But I always said, 'just relaxing in my den.'  They knew what I was talking about.  

Ah, the benefits of being a bus-owner!  I guess we could never really be homeless.  That's an encouraging thought.   Cheers....KR
