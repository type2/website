Subject: Personal history, with engine and welding questions

Kinda long- you can skip to the bottom for the questions part.

I've been lurking on the list for quite some time without posting much (once
or twice)- All the questions I have had were answered in the archives. So I
figured I give a brief intro of myself (air-cooled wise).

My first VW is a '69 Ghia that has been garaged in Kentucky for the past
couple of years and I'm not sure if it will ever leave there. (Anyone
interested? :) )

My wife and I bought a '76 Westy in North Carolina (paid too much) and used
it to move from Richmond, VA to the East Bay CA. We had a great time on our
9 day journey across America via Hwy. 50 with our 3 dogs and one of our
cats. With only a couple of mechanical hiccups, the bus was great. **Note:
Thanks goes out to all the AIRS people in: VA, WV, KY, IN, IL, MO, KS, CO,
UT, NV, and CA. I never needed your assistance, but it was nice to know that
help was available.**

After our move out to CA, I found out that my bus would not pass smog
because it has a '74 1600cc Type1 engige in it. What to do? For the time,
keep it registered in VA. Well, a month later, the engine seemed to drop in
power. I suspected a pressure issue. Sure I could have tested it, but with
needing a new engine, I decided just to pull it and check it out. (I've ever
attempted this before- engines have  always been a 'black box' that makes
the auto go). I spent a hundred bucks or so getting a few parts, cleaned it
up, checked pistons and cylinders, re-assembled, and got it back in. 

IT ACTUALLY RUNS!!

Now for some comments and questions.

Comments:

1st if you've never attempted to drop your engine, and you have the space
and time, it's not that hard. The most annoying part for me was getting all
the engine tin back on. I'm sure that you can find plenty of help on the
list. Oh, and take LOTS of pictures. 

I used a motorcycle/ATV jack to raise/lower the engine- worked great.

Now that I've tackled this job, I'm thinking about teaching myself welding
and taking care of the rust.

Questions:

The engine now seems to smell funny. Is this just because of oil/ cleaning
chemicals burning off? I've only driven it a couple of miles since the
operation? 

How should I break it in?

Next oil change?

Any other advise? 

Welding- The majority of the rust is on the body panels, so I figured that I
don't need a ultra powerful welder for sheet metal. Any suggestions on what
type and maybe some good books? 

Thanks for everyones help- I've been having a great time working on my
Westy.
