Subject: NEED perfect front doors (NOS ideally)

Subject says it all, ideally if anyone obtained a set of the NOS ones Bus Depot had maybe 3-4 years? back and wants to sell them.  I would take a PERFECT set of used late bay fronts for a '77, but I do mean PERFECT.  Anyone who has seen my '77 understands, it is about as clean, low mile, rust free as they come, but it had a few tiny bubbles along the weather strip at the overlap of the inside and outside metal that actually went a bit further than I realized leaving it less than perfect and next summer it will get a repaint and I want it back to factory.  I doubt any used will be better than the ones on it frankly, so mostly I'm looking for NOS and I will pay top dollar for the set.  I will be driving across country with it next spring from WV to AK and will stop to pick up a set nearly anywhere along the way, otherwise I'll have them freighted to WV.  The drive will probably be April or so but I've been plotting things out and figured I'd start looking now.
