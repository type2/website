Subject: Re: [T2] Stepped exhaust studs for sale?

Hi Volks,

Is there any good reason we couldn't just use straight 9 mm studs of  
a similar length??  Maybe buy a chunk of 9mm threaded rod and cut  
sections to length?

just buy some matching nuts and hog out the ears on the heat  
exchangers a bit and you're good to go. I "rolled my own" 8mm studs  
for a 1700cc engine, and they work fine.

Happy Trails,
