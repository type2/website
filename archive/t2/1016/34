You're saying:

1. You're sure you have fire at the plugs.

2. Nothing happens when you use starter fluid.

Questions:

1. Could it be the timing? Static time it if you're not sure.

2. When was the last time that you checked compression?

3. Are the valves opening and closing? It could be that the lifters 
have lost pressure?
