Looks great, Troy. Add an Autohome Columbus (http:// 
www.autohomeus.com/products/columbus.php) for about $2000, and you've  
got a weekender.

I'd love it if someone managed to devise a hybrid powerplant, with  
braking, from a DP 1600, and put it into a carbon fiber-bodied Type  
2, as a kit. But short of that, the Sprinter makes sense if you want  
up-to-date.
