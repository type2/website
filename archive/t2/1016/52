Yeah, I read the posting. But I was inquiring about a place that I could get
some from locally! I called my local VW dealership and they wanted $35 per
stud!!!

I understand that I can get them from Scott, but I am trying to avoid having
to pay shipping and waiting a week to get them.

I have a few folks I can get them from here, but Rob, I would suggest
talking to Chris as Busted Bus. I would be shocked if he did not have any.
