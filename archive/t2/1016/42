Subject: Audi Alloys for Sale

Hello, Volks:

Just had a deal fall through with the owner of a '04 A6.  I know these will
fit on a Vanagon or Bay with spacers and some modification.  They were from
my A6 that got totalled in June of this year.  The Blizzaks are already off
and mounted on BMW wheels for my 325xi.  (Got to keep it German) I have a
picture of a Mexico Biege Bay with Audi Alloys. looks pretty cool.
