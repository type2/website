<<Terry, I'm not familiar with the Solo plates, are these like
disposable grocery store items?>>

Yea Courtney.
They come in Red, Blue, White, Yellow, and can be washed several times.
The cups are 16 oz. the plates are good sized, and the cereal bowls are
nice sized.
They are all stout, look good pack well, very light weight, and above
all else are not expensive.

I have them in all 3 of my Camper's, and use them in my boat too.

K-Mart, Wal Mart, Winn Dixie, Publix, Jewel-Osco, Pigley Wigley, Kroger,
Safeway, Centralia, Dominicks, Red Owl, IGA, you name it--they'll have
them in the paper goods isle. 

A good value in dining accoudiments.
