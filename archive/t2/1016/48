Subject: Re: [T2] Stepped exhaust studs for sale?

Lesse here....Jason Meyer since Friday and Rob today are both looking for
these and Scott Lyons has posted here that he's got some.  Doesn't anybody
read the list postings?

I was gonna reply earlier about Jason's plight, but with Scott's post, I
figured he'd be taken care of (and anyone else for that matter).  Bus Boys
(530-244-1616 - Walter) should still be carrying them because I put 'em in
their stock plan over 13 years ago and they were a good mover back then
- anybody call them yet?

The reason I'm replying now was that this past weekend while rummaging
through the old Sherwood/Old Volks Home inventory in my storage facility for
something else for someone else I ran across a baggy of maybe 10(?) of these
studs, grade 10.9 just like they should be.  Like Scott's (or BB) they're
not the genuine article, but what's available on the market today.
$6.50/each stud (these aren't cheep to buy - even for me) plus Priority Mail
(I take Paypal).  Pmail if interested and yes I can probably get more (I'll
have to call Tuesday), but not sure if the cost is the same on the next
batch.
