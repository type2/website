Subject: Re: [T2] What is VW Thinking?

The Sprinter should be filling the niche for a new generation bus  
from VW. How are they going to compete with it? If I were in the  
market for a new bus, I'd get a Sprinter and put a magnetic VW badge  
on it on days that I feel nostalgic.

But I'd still rather have a baywindow. The "fun" of the way-forward  
driving position is never going to come back.
