Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Emissions

Good idea about the plugs.  It's probably time, though the Bopmobile is still running like a top.  I did get a good look at the old air filter.  It was pretty greasy.   I had soaked my old one in dish-washing liquid the last time I replaced it and put that one back in.  I'll go for plugs and try again.  The last health check I had, they decided I didn't need the cold finger test.  And they still didn't find lung cancer.  If I don't quit soon, they will.  Next on my list.  After plugs.  :) Cheers...KR

I also had to change out a lot of 'things' because they were 'dirty' , but
not clogged.  They were changed the last Spring or Summer (I forget - who
checks those things) and the leak I had last year is still not completely
fixed, but a lot better...

With my health insurance, I can get another 2 free inspections, but I don't
know if I can stand the cold hands.  I would try for an appointment with the
guru, but he is still in India.
