Subject: Carb questions...

Hey guys, I just picked up some stock carbs from what looks to be a  
73-74 bus to put on my bus.. I am running  type 3 carbs in it now..  
but i also got the vacum advance/retard dizzy.. i am missing a few  
parts from my setup though. I am missing the mixture distributor  
pipe..  so no.. i cant even run them yet.. also i am missing the rear  
solenoid on the drivers side.. for the mixture?? so i dont think they  
will run right now.. but i have a question.. my type 3 carbs dont have  
a retard port.. will the plate from the type 2 carb fit under the type  
3 carb so i can use the retard port and put this distributor in for  
now instead of my crappy 009 dizzy?? also.. does anyone have those  
parts for sale?? oh and the top left pipe from the air mixture pipe,  
on the carb there should be a brass pipe fitting there, its gone from  
my carb too.. any help would be appreciated.. I am in Ogden Utah

Thanks
           Jason
