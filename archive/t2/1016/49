Subject: What are the odds?

I had a guy coming by to pick up some tires. He came from downtown
Denver in his 77 bus that he just purchased. That bus had a relatively
fresh engine, doors and lights all worked, needed a crappy paint job
stripped off to expose the nice blue underneath, and DESPERATELY
needed tires to replace the squirrely P tires on there. Which is why
he came here.

He made it as far as the Ace Hardware on the corner by my place before
the bus conked out. I headed out and spent an hour with him
troubleshooting. (I forgot my camera, arrrgghhh!!)

The symptom was loss of power during acceleration.

He said he had to replace the fuel pump when he bought it because it
sat for a year or two. Ok, so I ignored the fuel system for the
moment. Points, plugs, etc, all good. Needs new coil and wires but
that can come later. (He knows of NuVintage, so he can get the right
parts. No Autozone worries.) The points and condenser were fishy in my
mind. Off brand. And the condenser had a spade sticking out of the
side of the distributor instead of a wire. WTF? That spade caused
sparks against the fan shroud!!! I bent the stupid thing way back
toward the dist but that wasn't his problem.

Of course, the problem really was fuel. A fuel line between the filter
and pump had kinked.

Sigh.

Anyway, we have a new family member. Matthew. I turned him on to this
list and a few other places, so we'll see if he shows up. He's in
Denver for another week, then he's moving to New Orleans. (He asked if
I had any floatation tires.. heehee) I'm glad he broke down at my
place instead of having to be towed to a shop. An hour of my time is
nothing. An hour of shop time...
