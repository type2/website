Subject: Ball joint removal

I have the torsion arms off of my '77, and I need to press out the ball joints.? I have a 20 ton press, but the way the ball joint fits in the arm I am unable to use the arbors to hold the arm.
The arm has two 'notches' opposite each other that appear to be the only way to hold the arm.? 
The local VW dealer said that they do have some of the tools left from that era and?if they had it I could use it, but he didn't hold out much hope.? I don't either.
Does anyone have a pic?of the fixture that the dealers used to press these out???Or better yet, the number of the tool???
Or has anyone made such a tool, or figured out a better way to press these ball joints out????
I have heat if needed.
Any and all help appreciated.
I looked in the archives, but pretty much all it said was 'take it to the local VW shop', and we haven't had one of those around here for many years.
