Hi guys!

I'm excited to get our bus back within the next week or so - then I can return
to doing my best thinking while sitting behind that wheel, or cleaning the bus
out, washing it. It's been since mid to late September since we've had the
bus, and the NEW MOTOR arrives tomorrow.(sigh) my heart's a-fluttering at the
sounds I imagine the new motor will make.

Content-related question: We're ditching the '79 EFI system for a dual-carb,
and we now live at about 3,800 ft. elevation. We will occasionally travel
above 5,000 ft. elevation. I have heard that we will, AND will not have to
adjust the timing at certain elevations - what's your experience? Anything
particular to look out for?Stephanie Butler
