Subject: Stepped exhaust studs for sale?

I'm looking for the stepped exhaust studs for an aircooled 2.0 
engine, I just need 4 of them. 9mm x 8mm x 56mm 1.25 thread
I have tried everything in the Olympia, WA area, the guy at Northwest 
can't find any, the dealer doesn't 'do' air cooled parts but did 
refer me to a place in Tacoma (52 miles away) Mousemeat (I have not 
called yet). The foreign car/VW shop in my town didn't have any. Napa 
was no help. I have not tried Tacoma Screw yet.

If I have to make a 100+ mile round trip to get four stepped exhaust 
studs with gas being well over $3 a gallon.... Anyway that sounds nuts.
Any west coast vendors have some? Does anyone have some to sell and 
mail to me? Suggestions for finding some in the Olympia area?

It's often the small things....

Feel free to p-mail me.
