Here's a quick way to test (and fix?) that water getting to your relay
is causing the problems.

Get a 2 liter bottle or something similar. Cut out the bottom. Cut it
in half lengthwise. Maybe a little less than half. Stick the larger
"half" with silicone or double sided tape to protect the fuseblock (or
relay if it is in a different location due to PO mods, etc).

Next time it rains, if the signals don't go out, you've provided a
quick "fix" and isolated the problem with certainty. Then you can
figure out how to keep the water from coming in while still enjoying
your bus. :)

I did this with a friend's 69 Caddy many moons ago. Worked like a
charm! When he sold the thing for big bux a few years later my 2 liter
bottle was still under the dash. :)
