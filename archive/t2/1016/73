Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Stud Removal

If there is still a stub, a "stud remover" will often work, even in the confines of the little pocket up there by the exhaust manifold.  Problem is you need a good quality one, american made ideally, KD or Snap-On etc, the Chinese HF ones may or may not be OK and this isn't where/when you want to find out.  They have a little eccentric cammed thing that tightens tighter as you turn it counterclockwise with a socket extension driver.
   
  A couple other good ideas, HEAT, the "blue wrench" is always your friend with steel into aluminum, ideally with at least an acetylene plumbers torch, MAP in a regular hardware store torch is probably OK.  Next, AND I ALWAYS DO THIS, after heat hit the head of the stud with a good 16oz hammer 50 times squarely, and I mean count em out, 50 times good solid whacks.  Then heat again.  I always do the hammer trick, even to brake bleeder screws where heat can't be applied, even though it mushrooms them a bit, cause it allows me to never break one off.  So heat, tap, heat, PB blast, heat again, then the stud remover is my suggestion.  If you do shear it flush, then it is drill and EZ out time, which is a real PITA on the car.
