Subject: Thanks! Re: Anyone bought the BusDepot dish set with vans on

Many thanks to all the quick responses, wow! The key word is melamine!, 
which gives me something I know about. As a kid my mom had a set of dishes 
she used that were child-proof, called MelMac. Anyone remember those? Ours 
were a greenish-turquoise with square sided teacups and saucers. Man those 
would be considered really retro now, and probably a collectors item!
Thanks all,
Courtney
