Subject: RE: Broken stud removel

Hello all, I haven't seen this mentioned yet. Sears
has these new easy off sockets. Which I have used a
lot. They are a socket that you place over a stripped
out nut or bolts, I have even used it for studs, but
the tighter you twist the tighter they grip. I have
the complete set of 10 different sizes. At sears they
come in a 5 pack for $20, so its $40 for the complete
set, which it was well worth it the first time I used
them. But I have seen them advertised lately for
christmas for $10 each set. The only bad thing about
them is you have to use a bigger socket over them,
they don't have a socket hole in the bottom to just
use a wrench.

Or I have seen them at napa for the same prices, that
does take a socket wrench. Which is better. I believe
that brand is Irwin tools. I saw these after I already
bought my set from sears. 
Hope this helps.
