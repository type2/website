Well, I passed with flying colors the last two years but failed this year.  

Last year:  

HC:   61ppm, Limit: 500, Pass
CO:   3.44 %, Limit: 5%, Pass
CO2:  5.58%

This Year:  

HC:  129ppm, Limit: 500, Pass
CO:  7.51%, Limit: 5%, Fail
Co2: 8.5%

On the back it says:

Common causes for high carbon monoxide (CO):

Dirty, clogged air cleaner, choke or carburator malfunction, fuel injection yada, yada, yada, (don't have that), air injection system failure, carburetor float level maladjusted, incorrect carburetor settings/adjustment, and catalytic, evaporative, etc. that I don't have.  

I changed out the air filter.  It was dirty but not clogged.  It was changed after the last Bugapalooza in the spring or summer, don't know when it had been changed before the passing inspections.  Probably not as recently.  

I had an exhaust leak that is not completely fixed but is a lot better.  So what is the most likely problem?  I get 2 more free inspections and can make an appointment with the guru.  I understand that it only has to idle long enough to pass the test then I can change it anyway I want to.  Any advice is appreciated.  1976 Westy, 1.7L, single weber, 009.  Thanks....KR
