Subject: Broken Stud Removal

I was lucky enough to find an older air-cooled shop here in town that I got
my replacement exhaust manifold studs. The problem I am having now is
removing the old ones... I put a set of vise-grips on them and tried to turn
them, but no luck. I sprayed them with PB Blaster and still haven't had any
luck.

I figure that if I could get a good angle on the crank, I could probably get
them to turn, but that seems near impossible without taking the head off.

Anyone broke a stud, had a hard time getting it off and then figured out a
way? I am so close  to having this done,it's killing me!
