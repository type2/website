Subject: Exhaust Manifold "sleeve"

Thanks to you all, I am rounding third and heading for home on this project.
It has certainly been a learning one for me.

With that said, I hope that I didn't do something I can't fix here...

When I took off the exhaust manifolds, there was a rusty sleeve around each
one that was filled with what I can one assume was asbestos. Since it looked
like hell and the substance was chipping out of it, I removed it. Don tells
me that it is a jacket that insulates the manifold to that the push-rod
tubes do not get cooked.

If that is in fact the case, what can I put back on the manifold to
re-insulate it (or do I even need to worry about it)?
