that might be a tough one. odd size metric fasteners are extremely  
difficult to find. m7 is not so bad, but m9, m11 forget it. the other  
substantial issue with all-thread is the fact that it is usually very  
soft steel, like grade 5. exhaust studs should be much harder,  
usually grade 10 or 12.
