Jason,

Header paint followed by header fiberglass wrap. It attaches with stainless
wire available at any hardware store. I have some if you want to test it
out. You can get the wrap at AAI performance in Arvada. You just have to
repaint every so often to keep the rust at "bay". :)

Give me a call tonight or tomorrow and we'll chat.

Thanks to you all, I am rounding third and heading for home on this project.
It has certainly been a learning one for me.

With that said, I hope that I didn't do something I can't fix here...

When I took off the exhaust manifolds, there was a rusty sleeve around each
one that was filled with what I can one assume was asbestos. Since it looked
like hell and the substance was chipping out of it, I removed it. Don tells
me that it is a jacket that insulates the manifold to that the push-rod
tubes do not get cooked.

If that is in fact the case, what can I put back on the manifold to
re-insulate it (or do I even need to worry about it)?
