Eddie,

Coincidentally I just ordered an "Auto Twirler" model for a Bus restoration
I am doing. I decided the cost was far less to buy one then design one. 

I'll get you and the list some photos and measurements. It will arrive in a
week or so.

Subject: [T2] calculating bus center of gravity for rotisseire

Hello list,

I am planning on building a bus rotisserie. I was wondering if anyone
had experience with this, and if so could you offer advice on
measurements for finding the center of gravity on a bay and split bus.

The bus should be able to rotate on an axis fairly well if the center
of gravity axis was accurate... if not, it will be a little lopsided
and a tad more dangerous.

My design allows for an adjustable axis line, I was just hoping to get
a feel for where it is on the bus. I've been doing a lot of research
and all the pics I've seen for splits indicate that the axis would go
through the middle of the front logo mounting holes and the center of
the engine door hanger panel.

I'm hoping to get exact measurements for both a split and a bay before
I start welding this thing together.

thanks

Eddie
