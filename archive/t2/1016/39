Subject: Hard Start Relay wiring

Having perused the ratwell and bartnek site and other info, I'm wondering how
to identify which wire is which for the relay. Even bartnek wasn't sure about
this. Apparently buses have two wires to the solenoid, one for F.I. and the
other for the ignition. Can someone identify which one is the ignition? Also,
does the F.I. wire just stay where it is on the solenoid? I did my Beetle, but
it doesn't have the F.I. wire, so it was easy.
Thanks,
Courtney
