Do you *have* to? No. A less than 2000ft elevation change shouldn't be
a problem.

FI is better at elevation changes than carbs though. Of course that's
up to you. I'm sure you've heard the arguments for stock FI. And you
could even go with a Megasquirt with a Lambda (oxygen sensor)
controlled mixture.

That is my ultimate goal. :)
