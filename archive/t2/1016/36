 Hence the reason from my question. Still I have to
 know though... is this
 the type of part you might find at a FLAPS or am I
 looking at another specialty item?

He was a Porsche mechanic???  What a dork. I think you
misunderstood him and he said porch. Ask him if he
means front or back porch......

The nice thing about the metric system is if it isn't
8 or 10, then it has to be 9. Unless a porch mechanic
put SAE nuts and bolts on your VW engine.

The 8 x 9 stud is standard equipment on 76 and up
heads. Go here:

If the link does not work, go to www.germansupply.com
and type 'stud' in the top right search box. Scroll
down til you see the 8 x 9 stud. But they are out of
stock.  You will see they are 10.9 hardness.
