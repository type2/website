Subject: carb help pleaze

Hey guys.. Well, I thought i had my stock setup working... then i  
didnt. my stock setup on th e72 westy is a set of 32-34 pict 2 and  
3's.. as you all know i have been runnin type 3 carbs on there they  
are 32 pict 2 and 3.. The issue with my drivers side carb on the stock  
setup is now the idle bypass air circuit.. the solenoid i have is  
messed i think, it wont work unless i tap it.. even out of the carb i  
can put power to it and ground it and it will just sit there unless i  
tap it.. so i think thats my last issue there.. but i was wondering if  
any of u have one of these solenoids.. it was used on some of the  
single carbs.. near the bottom and is way bigger thana idle cutoff  
solenoid.. my other question is.. Can i re-jet the type 3 carbs to  
match the type 2 ones?? or is the venturi size the killer here?

Thanks in advance.

jason
