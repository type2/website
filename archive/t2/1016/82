Subject: Sears easy off sockets

"Hello all, I haven't seen this mentioned yet. Sears
has these new easy off sockets. Which I have used a
lot. They are a socket that you place over a stripped
out nut or bolts, I have even used it for studs, but
the tighter you twist the tighter they grip."


I used some of these once.? I was stripping some parts I needed from an old Chrysler Newport in the middle of nowhere and a friend had a set of these in his toolbox.? I would never have gotten what I needed off of that car without them.? 
I have a full set now.? They work.
