Alan,

The common rule of thumb is don't mix and match bottles outside of the
intended purpose. Green for oxygen and Red/Brown for Acetylene and white for
propane (most are stamped with their usage as well). Any upstanding propane
shop won't fill a non-standard propane bottle. Also, the shape of a
exchangeable propane tank is specific to give it stability and has the valve
protected by a welded ring/handle. The A&O bottles are meant for a chained
rack and are unprotected when the caps are off. Since propane is EXTREMELY
dangerous (even more than acetylene), I would advise against using a
unprotected tank.

If you are looking for a compact propane tank, head to your nearest RV or
marine store. They should have several options available that won't lead to
potential frustration when you go to fill the tank. Also, GoWesty! has brand
spanking new Westy tanks available complete with hoses, regulators and
fittings.

Hey Gang,

 

I have seen those tall oxy acetylene torch sets from Canadian Tire/ hardware
stores, what ever.

 

They look the same size as a standard propane bottle.

 

Are they any good or a danger?
