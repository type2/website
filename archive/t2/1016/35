Hi Jon,

I saw these online in the range of $800. I was hoping to spend a lot
less making my own, being that I already have most of the materials on
hand. Would you mind sharing what you got yours for and where?

I was also concerned that I wouldn't find one that didn't require a
lot of modification to work with a bus. I think mine is going to end
up using 1/2" plate steel that bolts to the bumper mounts of my split
bus on the front . The rear mount will bolt to the bumper mounts as
well as the apron mounts. I was originally hesitant to do it this way,
but I've seen several designs online that use those same mounting
points with success. I think they will allow the most access to the
underside of the bus, not to mention the ability to remove and replace
the front axle beam and rear axle/transmission while the rotisserie
mounts still attached.

I'd love to see pics when you get it all rigged up!

thanks
Eddie
