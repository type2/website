A propane torch might be enough.  The warmer it is the better, up to the
point where the aluminum melts.

Paraffin and Kroil might be helpful.

Before you destroy too badly, a trip to a machine shop might be in order.
They handle that sort of thing all the time and the cost is cheap compared
to what it would be if you take them a broken-off-flush stud.
