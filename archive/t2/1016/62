Hey Gang,

 

I have seen those tall oxy acetylene torch sets from Canadian Tire/ hardware
stores, what ever.

 

They look the same size as a standard propane bottle.

 

Are they any good or a danger?

 

Alan

The answer is oxy acetylene focused heat.

 

Heat up the area around the busted stud good and warm--twist the stud out
with the vice grips..

 

Your done with that project.
