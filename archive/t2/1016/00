Subject: Re: [T2] small portable toilet to fit between bay window front 

Made our own cover for the Pakapotti matching the blue green theme of 
the seat and bed, using an old seat cover and naugahyde; a board is 
glued to the original plastic cover to strengthen it.

  You could put it anywhere inside the Bus and never know what it was.
  Pretty nice, compact, very efficient, easy to use waste collector---and
  not bad looking when it's parked.
