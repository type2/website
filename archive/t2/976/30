Subject: Bleeding Brakes

I was told to put the wheel back on the vehicle, have someone pump up the
brakes and open the valve, the person pumping them up then  holds the pedal
to the bottom, I close the valve, they pump it up again and so on.

 

Also I need to monitor the brake fluid reservoir carefully as I could allow
air into the system.

 

So, why do you need the wheel on the vehicle again?

 

I also intend to use a clear hose to be able to see the fluid for air or
change in color for the old fluid.
