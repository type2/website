Subject: Steel Kadron Manifolds

I recently changed from Aluminum to steel manifolds due to a small accident
and now appear to be having all sorts of icing issues - are these manifolds
notorious for this ? They never seem to warm up - after a forty minute drive
in 85 degree weather the base of the carb was still very cold to the touch
