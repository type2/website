Subject: Speaking of rust repair - What procedure for this?

I have a dog leg that has one area that is bubbled. When sanded down it has 3-4 holes, one as large as 1/2" The metal all around these is solid, and shiny new when ground down. What procedure should I use to fix this? Should it be a metal patch over the holes, or is putting a patch on behind the holes with body adhesive,then filling them better? As you can tell, I'm fairly new at this. It seems silly to replace the whole dogleg when it only has one small 3" area that is rusted.
Thanks,
Courtney
