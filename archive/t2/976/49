Subject: rust repair...

I've got some (understatement...;-(
rust spots inder the paint...
What's the sequence to repair/halt/cover the spots?

Grind the paint off around the spots to bare clean metal...

Then what? Sand smooth and touch with rust converter;
clean the area and use a self-etching primer and then filler...?
(I prefer All Metal, BTW, or Evercoat's Metal-to-Metal...)
