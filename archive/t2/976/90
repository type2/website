Subject: "Burning Man" and Sacramento-area bus events

Hi all:

I am thinking of going to the "Burning Man" event in August this year 
and might be interested in going with a group of Bus people.  I am also 
interested in any CA, Nevada or Oregon Bus camping events.  I am likely 
limited to 8 hours from Sacramento in any direction.

Thanks,

BEN
