Subject: Re: [T2] Engine swap help (76 2.0L into a 74 bus)

Hi Mike,

There are no major problems. I have been there and done that swap.

You will want to re-jet the solexes with 132.5 main jets. I did this  
research a couple years ago and established that 132.5 is the size  
used by VW in europe and australia  when they offered a 2L/dual-carb  
engine setup. In comparison the 1.7L engine used a 127 jet and the  
1.8L used a 130. I think these would make the 2L run lean, which  
could lead to overheating. Swapping jets is a simple matter and the  
replacement jets can be sourced from any good Yamaha dealer;  just  
tell them you are looking for mikuni jets.

One other minor detail: you will need to swap the tranny studs over  
from the smaller engine to the 2L.

Other than that, it's pretty simple.


Happy Trails,
