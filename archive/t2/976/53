Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Steel Kadron Manifolds

Jim: As I understand it, icing is reduced if the manifold is hot. 
Heat is transferred to the manifolds via conduction from the head 
through the metal gasket. Is it the case that the thermal 
conductivity of aluminum is a lot worse than that of steel?

Or do I have this all wrong?

Thanks,
Jack
