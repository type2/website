Hmm,, are you going on a trip where the gas stations might be few and far 
between.... hmm,, I have seen chevvy trucks converted to float like a 
boat... but that is usually for the Cuba to Florida "road",,, last gas 
available at the beach....  :-) 

The tanks I have for late bay just fit into the hole ... with the seam, 
there isn't any spare room. 

Just a suggestion,, they used to take out the rear seat of a rabbit.. and 
make a tank to fit there,, for extra gas capacity,,, or there was a spare 
tire gas can ... the can fit inside the rim of the spare. 

my $.02 

if I add my thoughts,, I get $.02 but if am requested for my thoughts.. it 
is a penny...
