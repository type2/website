I have had the same experience.  I put new seals around my front doors
3 years ago.  When I pulled out the old PO carpet and rubber mat last
month, I discovered that I didn't have to slam the door anymore.  
Apparently, the carpet interfered with the lower edge of the seal.  I
guess what I'm saying is that the new-ish seal could be telling you
that something else is off, like the floor carpet, or the seat pedestal
cover, etc.
Good luck, and I hope that helps,
