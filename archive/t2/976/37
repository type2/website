So higher cc capacity means more sucked intake per stroke, which means 
more going by the Air Flow meter which will adjust mix accordingly?

  You'll have bigger valves which will make for slightly
  less low end grunt - maybe. If you are concerned about
  too much fuel (should not be a problem) I suppose you
  could put a T3 adjustable fuel pressure regulator on
  it and that would allow adjustment of fuel mixture
  across the board. The FI system doesn't know there is
  200cc difference - it only knows airflow and
  temperature. -BaH

   Can you put a '78 Federal EFI system on a 1800? What
