Subject: Type 4 Oil pump options

So, I buy a new Meyle oil pump: 111 115 107BK, ($22.97 from Bus Depot)
for my '82 Vanagon, while-I-am-in-there, but it is too deep and hits the 
cam.  If it was just the tab which drives it I could grind a mm off it 
but it is more than that.  The boss for the second gear goes in too deep 
as well.

The other option from Busdepot was $234.90, the Melling 021 115 109A, 
which is the original part number.   234.90 vs 22.97 hmmm ...

What are the other options?  Aircooled.net version which also takes some 
grinding and then uses a flat, type 1 cover plate?

BTW, I got my refurbed heads back with all new seats, shown here;

If anyone wants this new 111 105 107BK, I will send it to you at a minor 
loss for $20US plus shipping.  Otherwise it goes back to the supplier.

Thanks,
