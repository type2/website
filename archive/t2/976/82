Subject: RE: [T2] Getting the Bus back on the road...

Brakes and hoses as previously recommended, flush all old brake fluid, make
sure your e-brake grabs good, if you are on a hill at a light it can save you
from having a very bad day.  Repack bearings, you said you had new tie rods
but I didn't hear if you had new ball joints.  If the boots are torn they
should be slated for replacement if they arn't bad allready.  Drain and change
tranny oil, check for big pieces or lots of little flakes, generally some
little flakes are normal, but if you drive for a week or two and change again
and find lots of little flakes, you may have a problem.

Is the second gear problem just a problem of missing the shift and hitting
reverse?  There should be a spring in the shifter that has to be depressed
when you hook back into reverse.  Maybe broken?  If this isn't the problem,
you can try adjusting the shifter plate.  First check the freeplay on your
clutch pedal and adjust if out of spec.  Then make n index mark where it
currently sits so you know what direction you are going and can allways put it
back if necessary.  If the hockey stick in the nose cone isn't moving far
enough to shift smoothly into second, the shifter will need to move forward, I
would try 1/8th inch increments.  If it starts giving you problems going into
1st or 3rd and still won't go into second, you may have a problem.

One other thing that's lots of fun is repacking CV joints and replacing the
boots.  Do not submit to temptation and get split cv boots.  Also, the Ratwell
site has a good things to do to your bus link, as in easy upgrades for lights,
wipers, ect.
