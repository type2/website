Subject: Passed Smog

Passed CA smog again...still PO'ed that I even have to
do it, I thought 2005 would be the last time  >:0(

25 MPH
HC: 37 (Ave 49)
CO: .06 (Ave .27)
NO: 205 (Ave 205)

Pretty good numbers considering I didn't have time for
an in-depth tune-up.

Time to go pack up the EGR stuff...
