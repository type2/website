Subject: Re: [T2] I'm Confused! Bus vs. bug heater boxes

Originally, the relay lever style heater boxes that had the lower cable
connectors were used on Late 63-74 Bugs & Ghias, Late 63-67 Type 2.  The
heater boxes without the relay levers with the cable connectors higher
up were for 68-71 Type 2 only.
