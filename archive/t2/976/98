Whichever cam you choose, keep in mind that the profile will be
optimized for either FI or Carbs. So if you get a carb cam, decide the
carbs aren't what you want and switch back to FI.. Well, you get the
idea.

Build your new one for carbs the way you want. Then rebuild the old
engine! Set that one up for FI. Get a pair of stock heads, install the
FI, and you can swap between them whenever you want.
