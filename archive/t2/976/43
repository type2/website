Oh.. for the whole system.  I remember going through a whole container 
and it wasn't running totally clear.  I think I'm going to do it again 
soon.  You really should do it every few years, anyways.  Not a bad 
habit to get into, but not many people do it.

I'm not exactly sure which is the correct type.  I know that some are 
incompatible.  I think ours use either 3 or 4, but not 5?  I could be 
totally wrong on this so please verify this first!
