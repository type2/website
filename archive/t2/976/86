Thanks for the offer Peter. 

I am pretty sure the pre 74 seat foam is much thicker,, probably 4"... and 
the material on a 73 is yellow fabric.. and the 72 is yellow vinyl... 

I am getting fussy.. I have good 74 blue plaid material... I need the 
foam,,and the dimensions as my foam is sooo cruddy I can only guess it is 
about 2.5 inches and the other is 3" thick
