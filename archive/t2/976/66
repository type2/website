We bought new foam to make the cushions for our '56 westy.... they were
missing.
Called a local foam shop, but it turned out that the dimensions needed were
special, so mail ordered, and it came out to ~ $250 for foam for three pads (2
of one thickness, one of another)B and 2 wedge pillows.B  Though that is not
the same foam needs for a '74.
This was the heavy duty-ier foam suitable for using for sleeping so hopefully
it'll last somewhat.

If you want it like 99% perfect, buy new foam.

I have a 74 Westfalia with the Blue plaidB 
B 
I need the foam for the lower bed.... the over engine foam is ok. but the seat
is terrible!B 
B 
If someone could provide me with used foam,, foam with the fabric, and the
boards.. I'd go that way... or new! :)B 
B 
the only thing about going with used... I want basically 99 percent perfect...
if it is still fluffy.. no cigarette smells or mildew is acceptable... if the
material has a spot or 2 on it.. I am not really fussy about that.B 
B 
or.. I am looking for the depth dimension as mine is sooooo deteriated.. I can
measure the other dimensions..B 
and I am looking for the compression rate,, or density,, or how ever they rate
foam,, and a place to buy it from.B 
B 
Thanks for your help!B
