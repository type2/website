Subject: alligator clips/ignition switch

Hello All,
   
  I have a 1969 van that has just conked out on me.  It was my daily driver throughout summer of '06 and I took it on a 180 mile trip in December.  It sat from December to March, but after charging the battery, started right up in May.  However, when I turned the headlights on, the power cut out and the car would have to sit for about ten minutes before any dash lights would come back on.  I still drove it around (daytime only, of course) and would try to find the short, but no luck.  Recently, I attempted to turn the headlights on before starting the car, and the entire thing went dead.  It didn't turn on at all even after sitting.  So, I charged the battery and wah-lah - it runs.  But only when I have it hot wired.  Everything works, but only when the car is running with the hotwire.  Now I found a wire blowing fuse #2 - connected to the headlight switch, dash, ground, and fuse, but the wire is in fine condition.  Also, I traced the ignition switch wire under the car and
 see  no outside damage.  I changed the ignition switch, but still no go.  
   
  So I have two questions:
   
  *Any ideas on what else I need to look for?  Would the car start at all if the started was acting up?  Would my generator have anythig to do with the initial starting power?
   
  *If I do need to take it to a mechanic, would it be safe to drive with the alligator clips clamped and taped down?  I am weary thinking about the clips knocking off when I hit a bump and causing sparks near the fuel filter..or the car shutting off on the highway.  
   
  Thanks for taking the time to read this.
