Hi Trey,

Original pop-tops have no paint whatsoever, so if you want 100%  
stock, you're going to need to strip off the paint or swap in an  
unpainted top.

Personally, I think paint is a good idea... it helps protect the  
fibregass from UV deterioration. In 1971 they didn't paint it because  
no-one knew better. Or maybe the UV was less intense then.  I know I  
have seen some pretty crappy looking roofs after 30 years of harsh  
sunlight. And Westfalia must have figured this out as well, because  
they started painting the roofs on vanagons in the middle 1980's.


Happy Trails,
