Subject: Re: [T2] Interior Rear Panel Attachment Method

Andy,

The panels ahead of the rear seat on my 7-passenger are attached like
the front door panels, with hidden clips.  The panels behind the back
seat (rear hatch and the sides) are hardboard with a thin black vinyl
covering, no foam.  They are attached with sheet-metal screws that, if
I remember correctly, have black plastic caps on them.
