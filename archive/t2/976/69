I was just out, and found a fabric store that had 6 samples of foam.. 4 were
definitly tooo soft..
but the other 2 are difficult to chose between.  I would think the "rock" hard
one might be better
as it will deteriote over time and work in to what I want.. ?  But that might
mean 10 more bad
nights sleep.. or maybe 10 years of bad sleep till it works in...

ah,, so I think I'll go with a slightly lighter density,, they refer to it as
VF1975.

I am still wondering about the dimensions as mine is soooo pooched.

I guess the over the engine mattress is 3".. and the seat stuff is about a
1/2" less because of the
board thicknes....

Oh.. I just know I am going to find out the hard way,,, what the dimensions
are...

Thanks
Jamie
