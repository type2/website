I heard (from Mark Dearing?) that a 6 pin (76 and earlier) AFM plug will 
fit a later AFM, as one contact at end is not needed?

  Hi Mike,

  Correct. I have swapped 6-pin and 7-pin setups and not noticed any
  significant performance difference.

  In theory, there could be a problem at very high RPM on a 2L running
  1.8L ECU, because there is more airflow through the system than the ECU
  was programmed for. But with redline at 5400 RPMs, it isn't an issue for
  real life operation. No-one revs that high (intentionally) anyway.
