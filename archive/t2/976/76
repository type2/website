that is the wrong pump for a type 4 application.

you need to use a 111 115 107AK (not the BK) pump and modify it. this  
is a heavy duty type 1 pump for flat camshaft gear (3-bolt), and has  
26mm gears. slightly larger volume than the stock type 4 pump. you  
also need a type 1 oil pump cover and pump cover special nuts, and  
longer studs for the case since the type 1 pump and cover are deeper  
than the stock type 4 pump.

we also have the pumps already modified:
