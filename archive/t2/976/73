Subject: Fwd: Throttle Cable

OK, so I have a 70 Type2 1600single port
I put a new motor in, but damned if I can get the throttle cable to make it
all the way through the shroud, I'm missing something like 4"
the cable looks like it is routed where it should be, I blocked the pedal in
an upright position, and yanked on it, but I can't get enough length.
Is there a neat trick?

Cheers
