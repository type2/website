Not really, but not enough heat is conducted through the manifold to prevent
icing, especially if the head is being properly "cooled" relatively speaking
of course.  As an example, exhaust heat transmitted via the heat riser
tube(s) on an upright engine is considerably hotter than what the top of the
intake ports of a cylinder head will provide IMHO.
YMMV
