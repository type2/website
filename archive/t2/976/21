Subject: Engine swap help (76 2.0L into a 74 bus)

Hey Everyone,
My friend has a 74 bus with problems.  It's got bad compression so 
something needs to be done.  We're going to do a leakdown test to 
determine the problem, but ultimately, I have another idea that I'd like 
to try instead.

I believe he has a 1700 engine - I'll find out more when he gets me the 
engine code number (I think it was CB).  It has dual kadrons and 
hydraulic lifters so how much displacement this engine has or whatever 
mods have been made is really is beyond us as we don't know who rebuilt 
it.  Ultimately, it's got problems and we want to fix it!

Now, I have an extra '76 2.0L engine from a while back that I'd like to 
get out of my garage and put in his bus.  This way he gets an engine in 
better condition and more power, too.  I'm planning on actually doing a 
full teardown of the 2L engine and we'll get everything balanced and 
tweaked out nicely.

I'd like to find out what issues we're going to run into if I try and 
take the 76 engine and put it in a 74.  Will those carbs work on the 2L 
engine?  Do they just need to be rejetted?  Also, I noticed that they 
have different flywheels, but I figured I could just take the flywheel 
off his engine and put it on the 76.

Are there any other major problem areas that would make this transition 
problematic?

Thanks!
Mike
