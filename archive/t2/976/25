Subject: I'm Confused! Bus vs. bug heater boxes

Well, my excellent adventure in early bay window buses continues.

I had always thought that the heater boxes with the relay lever were for
buses and the boxes without the relay lever were for bugs.  This evening, I
pulled the exhaust off my (J-tube equipped) 1969 european westfalia and went
to put on (and did put on) the "bus" heater boxes I''ve been saving for
years.  Once they were on, I noticed that the stubs of the broken heater
control cables come out of their tubes to the outside and above the heater
boxea, not inside and below!

What gives???  have I been wrong all these years?  is the relay lever box
only for some years/models?m Is there a difference between bus and bug
heater boxes?

Marcus....  save those boxes!!!  I think I'm going to need them!

Steve
