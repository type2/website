If it's the stock '74 engine, it should be 1.8L (although as I recall CB
would denote a '72-73 1.7L). In either case, the swap to a 2.0L is fairly
straightforward. You can use the smaller flywheel on the 2.0L engine, and
the carbs will work.  You are best off sticking with the '74 heater boxes
and exhaust as well, as those replacement parts are more readliy available.
While the exhaust ports are just slightly different on the 2.0L heads, the
difference is small enough that the '74 heater boxes will still bolt on.
