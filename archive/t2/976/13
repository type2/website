       I installed a set of new door seals a couple of years ago. I think they've been on the car now for 2 years with the doors shut 99.9% of the time. I still have to SLAM the door HARD in orrder to make the door shut properly. I really REALLY hate doing this because I cannot imagine that this is good for my Bus. What do I need to do to fix this? I was told by many people that the new door seals would shrink after a couple of years...

 


New cars don't have this issue? Maybe the seals are a tad too thick. I can't imagine having to SLAM my doors for 2 years and being told that it is a natural thing to do! Even if rather than "slamming" you can "firmly" close the doors, it still seems like the wrong thing to do.
