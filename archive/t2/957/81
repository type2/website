That is awesome!

My local bike store has a '71 deluxe as a show piece for Yakima Bike racks.

My gallery insisted that I show my '68 Double Cab as an installation last
spring. http://misterstiles.multiply.com/photos/album/15 Hopefully more
folks start seeing the "art" in the Bay!

Tuning Update: The 68 is rockin'. I did a tuning session yesterday and we
were getting good numbers with an ambient temperature of 72 degrees at 5300
ft altitude. Several "load" sessions at 30mph-70mph on and off incline never
brought cyl head temps above 325 degrees F. Wideband stociometric[sic] was
pretty balanced at 20-100 percent throttle. I'll give a complete write-up
soon. More testing on Thursday and Friday.

My wife found out that there was a special "exhibit" at the Dallas 
arboretum, dressed up our two daughters and took them down for some 
pictures:

Those arboretum folks have more class than I thought!
