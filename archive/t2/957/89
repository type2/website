Subject: After 22 yrs

The inspection sticker on the windsheild of my wife's 72 westy expired this  
month 22 years ago in 1985. 
I pulled this bus out of the junkyard about 6 months back and as soon as my  
wife saw it she had to have it. 
Well now with a rebuilt 1800, 4 new tires,It will be getting a new one this  
week after I install the replacement windshield and rubber.
 
Over all the westy is in good shape, there has been body work on the rear  
right corner (crack shows !/4"thick bondo) and the rt rocker has rust thru, But  
I plan on doing the bare  repair work and showing it at some of the full  
moon bus camp outs before painting it.
 
I'm just happy that I have been able to drive it after its been sitting for  
the last 22 years.
