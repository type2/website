Subject: Re: [T2] Dry Fuel injection

If you mean you've run it out of fuel, then here's a
trick that works pretty well when working alone: Turn
the kewswitch to "ON". Disconnect the air cleaner -
the big section of it, and reach your finger down
inside the air flow sensor and hold the vane open.
That will cause the pump to run and you should hear
the fuel gurgling through the hoses.

If you have to remove the S-hose from the throttle
body in order to open the air cleaner housing, just
leave the airflow sensor plugged in and do as
described above. Is this what you were asking for?
