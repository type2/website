Subject: Re: [T2] Tires for T2

Hey, watch it, Tony.  Harold Coker is a friend of mine.  His tires work perfectly as long as you use them for their intended purpose.  They work great for driving onto and off of car haulers, around auto showrooms, auctions, hot rod shows, etc.  You just have to stay within the specs.  :)  KR

I'm sure there's something at an obscene price from Coker Tire...
Although, from what I've heard, you might be a little leery about
actually drivin' on 'em... ;-(
