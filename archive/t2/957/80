I verified L and R from TS switch against GROUND. When left (good side) turn signal switch is activated, low ohmage. When right (bad side) is activated, it spikes. Does this complete the test and verify that the R of the TS switch is bad and TS switch must be replaced?

I had the exact same problem on my 78 a few years ago. finally hooked an
ameter across the terminals of the fuse block so I could see exactly when
it blew, (mine  was left turn but same thing) turns out that there was a
bare spot on the wire in the steering column and when I turned the switch
and it was in the exact right position it created a dead short, took
months to find, ten minutes to fix.
