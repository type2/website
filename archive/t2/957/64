If you are in the Boston area, though probably that does
not actually matter, then these guys have *everything*

In reflooring my manure spreader I needed a fairly obscure
bolt that even the manufacturer (New Holland) no longer had,
but these guys did.  They even pointed out that what was in
the parts list from the manufacturer was incorrect (not
"self threading" but "thread cutting" with two options 
depending on the hardness of the underlying steel).  They
have the requisite number of hyperknowledgeable curmudgeons
on staff, as one would hope.
