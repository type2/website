That's too bad.  You know, I sleep so much better in my bus than I do at home that I've considered sleeping in it more often.  It'd be like camping out in the back yard when we were kids.    Well, that's true when it's cold anyway.  I'm so hot-natured that I will have trouble sleeping in the summers.  But boy, imagine how one could snooze!  Cold morning, sleeping bag rated at minus Judge Judy,  significant other to snuggle up next to, nice soft horsehair mattress...ZZZZZZZZZZ.
