Subject: Fuel door & Engine lid lock

Hello,
Does anyone have a a fuel hatch lock and an Engine lid lock both with keys,
that they would be willing to sell. I just moved to a new neighborhood which
is not the greatest and wanted to get them locked up. My engine lid lock is
stuck and the fuel hatch one is missing. Its for a '69.
