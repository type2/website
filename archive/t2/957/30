This is the way to hybridize. Hydrogen generator. A little water goes a long 
way and the units are easy to build. Easy to install. I put one into my 
4runner and increased gas milage by about 4-5 mpg. My brother in law is way 
into this. He says the way to go is to run two in a series. I will be 
installing in my bus this summer when I finish my rebuild. Dang thing's a 
basket case right now.
