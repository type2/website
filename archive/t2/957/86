Subject: Deck Height of .120 Stock?

Greetings -

I'm finally finishing up the 1915 bus motor. Time for compression &  
deck height!!

Deck Height: I put the CB Perf deck height tool on #1 with no  
gaskets, no nuthin', and I come up with .118" (3mm / 25.4) deck. This  
does not please me. Is it normal for that much deck on basically  
stock components? I'm running a 69mm (Demello, from CB) crank, and  
Mahle 94mm P&Cs from AC.net, stock rods. The only thing I can think  
of is that they are "B" pistons? The box sez:

K70401 STD

so I'm a bit confused. I've always had the opposite problem - little  
or no deck.

Does anyone have the dimensions from top-of-piston to middle-of-pin  
for "A" and "B" pistons?

Thanks -

Mike
