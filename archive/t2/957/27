1) Check all the wires to/from the coil and dizzy. 
Clean the connections, make sure the wires are well
attached to the connectors.

2) You should always replace points and condensor
together, but a mismatched set should not cause total
failure.

3) Make sure you have 12V going to the coil...there's
no hi-tech computer stuff here, if the ignition's on,
you should have 12V.



Did you try manually opening and closing the points
with the dizzy cap off and the spark wire from the
coil near a ground? I assume the gap on the points is
good.

This has to be a pretty simple problem...the computer
stuff has

Well thanx Guys, but I guess the real culprit is no
spark. I have zero spark
coming from the coil. I have tested a new out of the
box coil, as well as 4
other used suspect coils. No spark to the distributor.

I have new points. Suspect condenser, as it is used. I
have power to the
coil. No spark from the coil to the distributor. I did
a Muir test for the
condenser, and If I did it correctly, test shows
condenser ok. 78 FI 2.0 
Thoughts?
