There is lots of data about tires in the archives, and it is a bit of a
religious subject.  Availability is also an issue, with different brands
coming and going.  The current "hot" tire is the Hankook, but there are
also offerings from Bridgestone, Michelin, etc.  I'm using some
cheap-but-correctly-rated Chinese tires labeled "Westlake" that are
working well for me.

White walls?  Not likely!
