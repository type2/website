Subject: Re: [T2] hard starting.

78 FI with crane ignition, auto tranny, rest is basically stock 2L


ok just got back from two 400 mile round trips in my bus. ran like a top
when I got it up to speed but something just doesn't "feel" right and want
to get it right before Everybus.

.  power is off a little at low speed
.  have to crank for 45-60 seconds to get it to start.
.  runs a little rough at low rpm, but doesn't stall
.  MPG is low (but not lower than it has been) 15.2mpg for two trips, one
was in the Blue Ridge mtns of VA (remember, auto tranny and lots of gear
onboard, 18-19 is about the best I ever have gotten)
.  using oil but I know where the leaks are and am keeping it topped up
.  engine seems to flood easily when starting

however
.  at full rpm runs smooth and hard
.  will cruise at 65-70 all day and not get over 210-220F oil temp
.  oil presure stays way up, cruising is 60psi, hot idle 20-25psi
.  all the quick checks are right on,
.  it was cold (below freezing) during these trips
.  just passed emmisions test
.  no new noises

it's just gotten decent weather wise so I have the "desire" to phutz with
it.

I can't even say "X" is happening, just this gut feeling from knowing my
bus for a lot of years that something just isn't "right"


any ideas???

thanks

Bob
