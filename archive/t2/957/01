Subject: Side Panel Rubber Seal?

Still trying to track down all the rubber parts so I
can re-assemble pumpkin II after the paint job...

I can't find this one:  It's a rubber seal that goes
behind the two long curved metal panels that are right
below the rear-most side windows (The sliding door
track is underneath the one on the right). 

Anybody have a part number, or any idea where to find
this seal???

Thanks
