Subject: Rivets for the guide piece on my sliding door

This is on my 78. http://calivw78.com/wordpress/?p=30  My searching  
has not provided any clue on the size of the rivet, or if this is a  
rivet I can replace on my own.  Are these standard DIY store items or  
am I stuck with what I have done already?

Peace, Troy
