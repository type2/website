Hi Isaac,

If all you need is a key I would suggest you contact  
steveslockshop.com. Steve can provide a replacement key based on the  
code number on the existing lock. Or he could provide a replacement  
lock if that's what you want.

There is a lockable  Type 181 (Thing) gas cap that fits the early bay  
filler neck. IIRC Germansupply.com has them.


Happy Trails,
