Hi,

I was told by my local VW parts guy that the type IV thermostat is no longer
available. Then he showed me some spring-like contraption about the size of
a thermostat that he says replaces the type 1 thermostat because it is no
longer available. Is there a substitute thermostat that I won't have to
re-engineer/weld or do I run my bus without one?

 

Thanks,

Rob
