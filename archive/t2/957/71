I went to Sears at Clackamas Town Center and the guy selling batteries had his Bay parked just around the corner from the entrance, they had a small, medium, and large, $72.00, $82.00, and $92.00

I was feeling quite average so I went with the medium, it filled the available space quite well, the large would have been too big in my opinion.

I think I will be OK.

Usually I research things for a very long time, in this case I didn't think that would be neccessary and ended up rushing myself because of other dependent projects, when this battery goes south I will be prepared.

Thank you,

JM
