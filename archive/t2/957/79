Subject: RIGHT turn signal blows fuse

Bus: 79 Westy
  Problem: when RIGHT turn signal is activated, S12 fuse is blown. Consequently, when hazard switch is activated, it's S8 fuse is blown.
   
  LEFT turn signals, all lights, flasher relay, and hazard switch are all functional, for sure. No wires are grounding out and ALL wires are intact correctly and verified via Bentley.
  With right exterior turn signals disconnected (black/green wire at the source plug from turn signal switch) fuse still blows. So, it's not a wire going to the turn signal bulbs or the bulbholders themselves. 
   
  Question 1) Does this sound like the problem is the turn signal switch? Has anyone had the same experience and validated it by replacing the TS switch?
   
  Question 2) According to Bentley, in order to test the switch, you need to verify continuity using terminal 54BL against L and R of TS switch.  Where is 54BL? Ground? I verified L and R from TS switch against GROUND. When left (good side) turn signal switch is activated, low ohmage. When right (bad side) is activated, it spikes. Does this complete the test and verify that the R of the TS switch is bad and TS switch must be replaced?
  Thanks!  -Chris
