This guys has them for all air cooled engines.



Why do I need a thermostat? - $70 delivered What is a thermostat for? 

When your aircooled engine is warming up, the cooling fan is blowing
cold air on the cylinders. The cylinders are heating up from the inside,
the cold air is freezing them from the outside. Result- warped
cylinders. 
The thermostat holds the flaps closed while the engine warms up. This
allows the cylinders to heat up expand round before being cooled by air. 
This is why you need it. We have them on sale for this winter season.
