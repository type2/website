Subject: Silicone PRT Seals from CBPerformance

Hey, is anybody buying from CBPerformance in the next few weeks??

I would love to get a set of these silicone seals for the late bay 2.0, but
this is all I want at this time.

I would be happy to send you a SASE and $10 for a set of the 1949 seals...

I am just curious how they look and feel over the Viton seals

Thanks
