Subject: Re: [T2] RIGHT turn signal blows fuse

Answer to question 2:

Terminal 54BL exists only on Bay Windows thru 1971 (on the turn signal
switch) and is related to the switching of the Stop Light and the Turn
Signal Light circuits using the single tail/stop/turn bulb(s) in the rear.
The instruction is clearly for 68-71, but useless for 72-79 models.  This is
how the instruction for 72-79 Bay Windows should read and how I have tested
switches of this year period for over two decades:

Set your VOM to RX1K or RX2K.  Disconnect the Black/Green/White Wire from
the connector and attach to the + of the VOM.  Disconnect the Black/Green
(R) from the connector and attach to the - of the VOM.  Move the lever to
activate the RIGHT turn signals.  The VOM reading should go from 1K or 2K to
zero - a direct short indicating continuity to that circuit through the
switch.  Disconnect the Black/Green and then Connect the Black/White (L).
It should do the same when you move the lever to activate the LEFT turn
signals.  With the switch in the neutral position, there should be zero ohms
as well for either L or R circuit.  If there is any resistance (ohmage, for
lack of a better term,) in any of the switch's positions, it should be
replaced.
