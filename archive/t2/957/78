Subject: oil leaks in upright bus engine

hey folks, I've a friend with an upright type 1 DP 1600 in a bus.  The engine has excellent compression but severe oil leaks.  I would like to help pull the engine to fix the oil leaks.  It looks like the oil cooler is the main culprit however the pushrod tubes are leaking also.
   
  I remember years back there were these spring loaded cheesy replacement pushrod tubes that could be installed without pulling the heads.  I also remember that they didn't work very well and were prone to leak.  Has this technology been improved anywhere?  The bottom line is: I'd like to fix the pushrod tube leaks without pulling the heads.  Any thoughts or advice?  Thanks, Greg
