Subject: no spark..was dry fuel pump

Well thanx Guys, but I guess the real culprit is no spark. I have zero spark
coming from the coil. I have tested a new out of the box coil, as well as 4
other used suspect coils. No spark to the distributor. 
I have new points. Suspect condenser, as it is used. I have power to the
coil. No spark from the coil to the distributor. I did a Muir test for the
condenser, and If I did it correctly, test shows condenser ok. 78 FI 2.0 
Thoughts?
