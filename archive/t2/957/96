Subject: she PURRRRRRRRs like a kitten

I'd like to give a big public thanks to Troy and Jason (CaliVW78 and 
FasterLaster) for their help last night.  They guided me through 
adjusting my points and setting my timing.  She runs great and she and I 
both appreciate your help.

P.S.  stop by and say hi on EFNet IRC  in #type2
