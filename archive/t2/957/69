Subject: Re: [T2] When oh WHEN is somebody gonna repro the S-Boot?

It's such a bad design.

I think that someone should sit down and redesign the entire plenum/ 
throttle/runners/egr system and provide an aftermarket alternative.  
It's a little late, but better late than never.

Barring that, a welded-up steel S with pieces of hose at either end  
and with ports for hoses would be better than the stock S -- and  
probably better than a repro.
