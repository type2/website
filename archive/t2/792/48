Probably one of those "once in a lifetime" deals. Buys "old car" cheap only to find it is worth a cool $2M... 

<Neither am I, but '61 is the first year of production for the
Jaguar E-series (XK-E)... Might be a very rare D-type or an
even rarer XKSS, but both of those models were racers and
the surviving ones are "known". Might be a '59 XK-150, not
as rare but very pricy...Or, it might be an XKE, but the year
is wrong...>
