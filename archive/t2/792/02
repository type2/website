Subject: get what you pay for

Phil said..."Personally I have found the "get what you pay for" rule to be
often untrue. 
I have many expensive things that are very unsatisfactory (poor values) and
quite a few inexpensive things that I value much more than what I paid for
them."


It's been my experience that you pay for what you get, but you don't always
get what you pay for.
