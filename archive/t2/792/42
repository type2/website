Subject: Frustrated vent window installation...

I have a 71 VW bus that had non-existent seals for the front doors.  I have
replaced all the seals on the passenger side with a little tugging and
pulling.  Here is the sequence I followed from a stripped (and nicely
painted I might add) passenger door:

1.  put in the regulator
2.  put in the bottom seals (internal and external) with chrome around
3.  affixed clamps for to and side felt
4.  slide in window with bracket attached through the top
5.  from the inside of the door, slid glass all the way to the right to give
me room
6.  from the inside put the vent window right hand side in the hole pushing
it as far to the right as possible (in between the bottom seals) - this is
an incredibly tight fit
..

Now the fun part. tried the same on the drivers side and can't do step 6.
Does someone out there know of a better way of doing this?

Thanks,

Brian
