This is one of those, I am pretty sure I know the answer, but can
always hope for a cheaper fix than replacement ;)

Just recently the 1600 in my 66 seems a bit louder. I tracked down the
sound to the alternator shaft moving in/out a bit. This engine has an
alternator conversion kit on it w/ a Bosch alt. Does anyone know of a
way of adjustment, or if the unit is simply shot?
