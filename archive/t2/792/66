<I had the same sort of problem with a wonky display and a new battery
fixed it up fine.>

Mine got a new beattery and then got put away for several months. 

Do these digital calipers draw power even when off? Mine says it is ready for a new battery again... 

Otherwise good caliper for my needs. Checks out well against really good ones at work.
