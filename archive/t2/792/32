Well, friends, here I am, sitting in a KOA in Holbrook, AZ, after two days and 1000 miles on my '74 bus. I have full instrumentation, and I'm slightly concerned about CHT readings. Iknow, everyone who knows says you shouldn't trust 'em, and perhaps I'm being a bit anal, but at certain points (climbing tough grades, terrible headwind, etc.), my CHT would rise to almost 500! Now, if I let up and slow down, sure, it will go down. But I've got to believe there is nothing inherently wrong with driving at least 60mph. Mostly, the gauge would read about 425. Am I destroying things?
 
Also, my oil temp got up to nearly 280 degrees for a short bit. Is this killing things, too?
 
One other anomaly- a friend who should know told me to prop the engine door open to facilitate air flow and keep things cooler. I tried this today (400 miles), and after 200 miles shut the door because the temps were so high. Amazing, but it actually ran cooler with the door shut. I surmise perhaps the exhaust heat was being sucked in there rather than cool, fresh air.
 
Also had a scare yesterday, stopped at a campground after 620 miles, went in, registered, came out and the bus wouldn't start- no click, no nothing. I grabbed some insulated needle nose pliers and tested the solenoid, it sparked and whirred. So I turned the key and, whammo, started right up. Anybody have a case of stuck solenoid before? Hasn't hAPPENED since.
Well, I've downloaded tyhe AIRS site, so if I have a REAL problem, at least I can calls someone.
 
Later...
