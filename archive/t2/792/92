Subject: Alternator replacement questions

I am looking for some opinions on a replacement alternator for my 73. Does the
list have some opinions on brand, quality, size, etc?

I am looking at Bus Depot. They have several listed. One remanufactured with
no core charge, one Bosch, one high output version and one Bosch high output.
I have the auxiliary battery in my bus, should I save up the money and get the
high output model or is the stock version fine with the two batteries. Has
anyone used the remanufactured on with no core charge before? What did you
think of it?

Thanks,
Corbett
