Thanks for all your help!

To summarize the advise I received(and say thanks
specifically :-)....

Bob, in Leucadia
said to check for a clean connection between the brain
and it's connector
and to use a special solvent to make sure all is
clean.

Karl von Salzen and Chuck Notmeyer told me to check
for current on that black wire that runs up the
drivers side of the engine compartment. It is
responsible for giving +12 volts to the double relay
when the ignition is on.

Tom and Thanh relayed that the spring that I removed
may in fact have been
there for a reason.

Phil Cain told me to triple check for vacuum leaks.

I took the L-Jet troubleshooting manual with me and
went to work on the
bus. I checked for power on the black wire and it was
in fact live as it
should have been.

I removed the ECU connector to clean with solvent as
Bob had suggested. While I had it off, I noticed that
one of the air hoses was not connected
it was pressed close and looked like it was on, but in
the light of day I
could see that it was not. I put everything back
together and Wahoo!! back
running. I installed a new engine compartment seal and
drove home. So far
no oil leak either, so the bus is happy and I'm happy
:-)

Thanks again!
