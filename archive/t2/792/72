Subject: Another door part number

Let me start by thanking Richard for the microfiches...

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t207100.gif

The left door of my bus does not stay open on either the intermediate
position or full open. (It is quite irritating).

I believe part 54 or 54A on the microfiche above has been abused. Is "54"
the thing that holds my door open - can I just bolt a new one on ? By now
you know what I'm going to ask... What is the part number ?

Thanks - Arnaud
