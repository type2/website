Subject: Re: [T2] Another door part number

From: "< Arnaud >"
 I believe part 54 or 54A on the microfiche above has been abused. Is "54" the thing that holds my door open -
can I just bolt a new one on ? By now you know what I'm going to ask... What is the part number ?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, 54 and 54A are the check straps.
54 is early. 54A is late.  But you neglected to give the year of your bus!

54:    211 837 249     68/69
         211 837 249A  From 1970 to 2x7 2137 042
54A: 251 837 249     From 2x7 2137 043

Both 54's are NLA.

The 54A is at this dealership:

      BERT SMITH INTERNATIONAL     ST. PETERSBURG,FL   800-282-3516


Bus Depot lists it: http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=251837249

But Ron would need to order it.
