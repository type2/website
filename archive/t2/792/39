Subject: Wanted Jalousie Windows

Although i've already put an add at TheSamba.com, i though that it could be a
good idea if i made the same here.
Maybe, some of you already sent me replys, however i would like to get more
options...
I need a pair of jalousie windows for a bay window bus.
I will probably need you to send them to Portugal. Of course, i will pay
shipment. However, i've got a friend in North Carolina....that's another
possibilitie...
I would like to see some pictures of them (*)...
If anyone in this list, is reading this in any European country, and knows
where i can get them, please help.
I'm still open to any offer...
Thanks a lot to everyone...

Best regards from Lisbon, Portugal.
Joco

(*) Send them to jnar(-at-)netcabo.pt.
