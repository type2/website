Mine came with a 2nd battery but turned out it was also low. A 3rd battery 
from ACE fixed the problem,

 Mine got a new beattery and then got put away for several months.

 Do these digital calipers draw power even when off? Mine says it is ready 
for a new battery again...

Otherwise good caliper for my needs. Checks out well against really good 
ones at work.
