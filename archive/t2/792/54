Ok, that being said...

Is there a good source for new manifold center sections?  Mine are pretty
much on their last legs, corrosion-wise.  I don't really see a way to
repair them.

The one I really hate to see rust away is my (probably Mexican) center
section that accepts a 30PICT-1 carb without a adapter.  It was a chance
wrecking yard find before I even realized that there was a difference!
