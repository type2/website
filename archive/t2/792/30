 Neither am I, but '61 is the first year of production for the
Jaguar E-series (XK-E)... Might be a very rare D-type or an
even rarer XKSS, but both of those models were racers and
the surviving ones are "known". Might be a '59 XK-150, not
as rare but very pricy...Or, it might be an XKE, but the year
is wrong...
 BTW, have fun if you get the Mini...I've had a couple of them
over the years...Including a "Traveler" (You do know about
"Minimania" in California... ?-)
