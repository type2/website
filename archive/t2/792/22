Some starters it seem have an extra R terminal to allow 12V to bypass any ballast resistors inline with the ignition circuit to help the engine start. That's all I can figure it was...

Since Bosch solenoids all seem to be the same basic shape I wonder if the wrong solenoid was paired with a VW starter?
