This will work fine except for loss of drivability and icing on cool, high
humidity days.  There was a reason for those heat risers!

Most of the time, difficulty in mating the exhaust is due to cheap Mexican
mufflers, or a previous mating attempt with such mufflers.  The higher
quality Leistritz mufflers are well worth the money, both in ease of
installation, longevity, and in not screwing up your heat risers!
