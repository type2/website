I guess I don't need to say anything else.

There was a definite lack of power but since we really don't know what size
engine was installed (it's an SP but that's all I could tell by just looking
around) it could be a 40 horse for all I know. 50mph on a flat would be good
for that I suppose. ;) But without a valve adjustment recently it's
definitely not making maximum power.
