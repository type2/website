I spent a month or so looking for a VW bus or Vanagon (The Samba- WA 
& OR, craigslist.org- Seattle & Portland and all the papers want 
ads). I was not going to spend thousands on it either. I'm not a 
collector, I wasn't looking for an investment. I just wanted to drive 
a VW again.
I was truly amazed at what some people wanted for a 25+ year old 
vehicle that had not been started in years, had peeling paint, rust 
holes and "I" had to pull the mouse nests out of the engine 
compartment (the mouse used the insulation from the engine cover). I 
saw this 'type' of VW more than once. I stopped looking at those when 
I realized they were asking those prices because they honestly 
thought they would get that kind of money.

When you get past the investment/classic mentality we are talking 
about basic transportation. Classy transportation but a transporter 
none-the-less. <shrug>.
The '91 Grand Caravan I drove for over a year (over 200k miles and 
the engine gave out, I traded it for a tow to the wrecking yard) was 
more comfortable that my Vanagon, got better gas mileage too. I could 
camp in it or carry sheets of plywood or all the kids. It did not 
have the room the Vanagon has, the visibility or give "me" the good 
feeling I get from driving my VW.

Over the course of that year I had less money in the Caravan than I 
spent buying my Vanagon.
I wanted to buy an air-cooled VW, I tried to buy an '80 that had a 
bad head but the guy was too busy to find the time to take my money. 
I ended up spending $800 on an '87 with 216k miles on it. I drove it 
home and have been driving it since than. It's had some head work 
done and has a few other problems but it's a VW and it's basic 
transportation. It was a fair price (IMO) for what I got. I have had 
to do some minor work to it & have more to do still.

I took a look at the '78 in question. With the asking price of $4k I 
wouldn't have even bothered to send an e-mail. It's a 27 year old 
air-cooled VW Transporter.
At $1.5k I'd have written you, the 500 miles was not too far to go to 
get one but I wouldn't have gone past $1k. It's just not worth more 
than that to me for something to drive. Even if it is a VW.

But that's me... I suspect that if you wait long enough you'll get 
close to what you are asking. That's the same thing I said to the guy 
with the '79 that had orange paint showing where the blue peeled off 
and the mice nests in the engine compartment.

I've had the '87 for 3 weeks now and love driving a VW again!
