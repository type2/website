Subject: '78 engine into an early '76

The '76 FI USA version 2.0 California bus has a bad rod. bang, bang, bang

So much for the "It went tick-e-ty... tick-e-ty ... tick-e-ty... in a very 
fast and frightening manner."

I am going to have a '78 engine rebuilt and R&R the '76 setup with the '78 
engine setup.

I have a full wire harness for the '78, and an extra ECU for the '78.

Is there anything I should be aware of before I try this quick swap??\
