Steve's Lock Shoppe- he's excellent and knows our bus locks well. He can 
also make you a new key from code, unworn out.

Subject: [T2] help with my locks


so i have decided since i have owned my bus for 7
years that my key only locks and unlocks one door not
the passenger or slidding door. So i decided for the
winter that was my project can anyone  recommend a
service that i can send my driver,passenger and
slidding door locks out and have the key work for all
the locks any information would be grateful
