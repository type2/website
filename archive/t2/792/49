You bus looks nice, but 4k for a non Westy is high in my opinion. If it was a
westy and in that shape, I would pay it.

I do not look at a bus a just a form of transportation. I have 5 other
licensed and running vehicles just for that. Although I do drive my bus a lot,
it is a hobby/passion for me.

Hold out until spring and you might find someone looking for one with a
sunroof and in such good shape.
