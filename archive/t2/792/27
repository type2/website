You're seeing the effects of a thin market in operation.  Consider the VW
Bus market as being composed of several segments of identifiably different
types of owners:  adults those looking for cheap transportation; teenagers
looking for cheap transportation; "eccentrics" of both types; aficionados
with no money, no skills; aficionados with money; investors; those who are
hit with nostalgia...

Each one will react differently to a given bus.  An aficionado with money
may not be interested in beater, preferring to start with one in better
condition regardless of the price, whereas a nostalgic adult with no money
but skills might prefer a beater since he can't come up with the $8,000 for
a "nice" example.

Thing is, there are a limited number of people in this market and a fewer
number in any given segment at any given time.  Right now, it may be that
the market for "nice" Buses is satisfied because the 1,000 or so people who
want and can afford them bought last year.

This doesn't help you much, I know, but it shows how timing is everything.
An item is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it.  Our own
investment means nothing except to us (or someone exactly like us).

I spend money on my bus because, well, I don't really know.  It makes no
sense from an economic perspective.  I just like the beasts.

This time a year ago, we were trying to find a bus to buy and 
use on our cross country trip.  At that time, bay windows 
seemed to move fast on thesamba.com, and a really pristine 
non-Westy bay went for 8k.  Now, a bus like that won't sell for 
5k and nothing seems to be moving.

We felt fortunate to get our sunroof bus with freshly 
remanned engine and fully functional systems (but no show 
winner) for 5k.  We now have it on thesamba, though, and 
haven't had much interest even at 4k, despite the 1k of quality 
work we've put into it.  What gives in the bus market?  Is it 
fuel prices, economic conditions, or are the bays--as we 
found on our trip--just drifting out of the public 
conciousness?

After all of that, if anyone wants to buy our bus and take off 
camping the country, make us an offer, ANY offer :-)
