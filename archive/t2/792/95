Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator replacement questions

The best way is to have a local friend with a spare... ;) Thanks Troy!

The high output model uses a different air boot for some retarded reason.
And, of course, it's NLA.

Richard has one and can help out with that. Remember that higher amps = more
hp draw from the engine when under load. The 73 is the smallest of the Type
4 engines, so keep that in mind. Unless you have a massive stereo or
lighting that draws over 25 amps total, I wouldn't worry about a high output
alternator. The 55 amp one will be fine.

All else being equal, I'd prefer the Bosch rebuilt one. But if the few bucks
difference will affect you then get a local lifetime warranty one from
Autozone or Kragen or whatever. Cheaper and when it dies (and it will) you
have a local source to return it to.

Now, after all that.... What's wrong with your alt? If it just isn't
charging, try replacing the brushes. They're just a few bucks and it's worth
it if you can save your good quality alternator.
