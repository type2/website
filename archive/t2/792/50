A couple of years ago my buddy was lookin' to buy a sports car and found
one for sale in the local want ads. The seller claimed it was his son's, who
had started work on the MG but got distracted/lost interest and left it in
the father's garage...Since it was only a half hour away, we went to look
at it...The guy opened the garage door to reveal a collection of parts that
could only charitably be called a Triumph Spitfire...The old guy's comment
on the disparity..."They're all the same, aren't they...?"
