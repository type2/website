Subject: dome light

many thanks to all those who confirmed that i ain't crazy, and the 
two dome lights ARE different on 70+ deluxes. and while i had 
forgotten about joe jackson, the actual dome head reference was to an 
early 80s compilation from creation records 
http://www.twee.net/misc/release.htm?key=vaitsdifferentfor. tho this 
stupid page doesn't have a link to slaughter joe, who had the best 
track.

anyways, mine dome  is shot, as confirmed by testing (snort!). the 
wires work as advertised, but the light don't. so i hopefully will 
roust one from a listee; otherwise, vendors ho. btw, i found it 
interesting that the wiring changed something like 3 times in 4 years 
for the exact same function. prolly same light, too.
