Ray,

Thanks for the thoughtful advice.  I suppose we were a couple 
of those Samba buyers not so long ago.  After looking at a 
number of the heaps around here selling for $3k and up, the 
couple thousand more we paid seemed like a deal.

I guess the thing with these busses is that they're worth what 
you want them for, and we wanted a solid bus to camp in for a 
few months. Now that there's nothing quite like them on the 
market, it makes sense that pricing is a little whacky.

That said, it's worth a lot to us to see it go to an appreciative 
new owner who will keep it on the road and not strip it for 
sunroof cables or something (sheesh!).  Rachel and I have 
never had an experience quite like driving that bus around the 
country.  It brought out a lot of warmth and kindness in 
people from Washington to Iowa to Maine.

Maybe a better method would be to offer it to the list at a 
lower price and let the Samba sharks zone in on some other 
kill!

best and keep 'em on the road!
