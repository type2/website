1. My comments on wire colors are from a color schematic for 77 and 78 
models. My 79 model schematic does not show wire colors.

2. My 79 schematic does not show a "hot start relay" and does not appear to 
differ electrically from the 77/78 models in the area of the double relay.

3. I assume you are reading 8 volts at the coil in position #2.

4. 6 volts (in position 3)is not enough to dive the pump properly hence the 
low pressure.

5. 6 volts (in position 3) is most likely not enough to drive the ECU and 
electronic ignition as well hence no start even with pump working.

6.  I doubt that the pump, double relay, and ignition are bad. The problem 
is low voltage in pos #2 (8 volts) and lower voltage in pos #3(6 volts). 
Sounds like battery.

7.  You have non-stock wiring at and around the starter solenoid. Some one 
may have installed a "hot start relay" and it has failed.  I would restore 
to stock at this point. If the starter "needs" the hot start function there 
are better solutions (even better band aid solutions).

8.   Double relay 86a should be zero volts in ignition pos #1 and pos #2. It 
should go high in pos #3. This needs to be sorted out.

9. Hot start relays (loved by many) often mask a failing starter. They add 
extra load to the battery during start up. They also can fail and cause 
problems.

Hang in there.
