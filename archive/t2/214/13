Subject: Carpet glue removal

The PO glued carpet around the bases of both my drivers and passenger seats,
I removed the carpet, but am having a hell of a time getting the glue off...
Is there any easier/better way to remove it than sanding it off?  I'd like
to paint them to have them match the rest of the interior (as they are still
the gold/yellow color) or should I just recarpet them to match the new
carpet?

Thanks!
