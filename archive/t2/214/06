CB performance (www.cbperformance.com) sells a rotary 
electric fuel pump that they claim is much quieter than 
the little square ones and is internally regulated to 
3.5 psi. The price is $42.95, less than you'd pay for a 
pump and a quality pressure regulator. I bought one and 
plan to use it when I swap the engine from the "old" bus 
to the "new" one. The part # is 3193.
