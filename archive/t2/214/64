Sounds like a good start. Add leaky injector(s).

Try unplugging cold start valve (might be control circuit).

Might try injector cleaner.

A fuel pressure gauge (`$30) would be useful to establish that over pressure 
is not the problem.

Check injectors for drip.

I am no expert but for what it's worth here's what I came up with to check 
my injectors:

1. Pull injectors out of input manifold (leave hooked up to fuel manifold).

2. Place clear plastic bags over injectors. Tie bag end closed.

3. Disconnect +12 volt wire from + side of coil to kill spark and injector 
triggers. To be double sure injectors will not trigger disconnect electrical 
connectors at each injector.

4. Run starter briefly to build fuel pressure.

5. Check bags for fuel. No fuel no leak.



Good luck and change oil often until you sort out this problem.
