Subject: door handle


The handles on the 68-70 should all be the same.  There is a slight 
difference in the '71-'79 handle, and it is (as I recall) a length 
difference in the casting on the outer lock housing.  I have modified the 
longer one to toake the shorter plug, but not the other way.  I'm also 
wondering if you might be encountering an aftermarket handle using the X9 
symetrical key as opposed to the "L" profile key your '70 should use.  
That's about the only thing that obviously comes to mind.
