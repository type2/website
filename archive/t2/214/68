"The temperature can be as high as 3,000 degrees Celsius--more than twice 
that generated by a conventional explosive. The blast wave can travel at 
approximately 10,000 feet per second."

Awesome!!!  10,000 FPS is very close to 6,800 MPH...

Like, almost 10 times the speed of sound.

Say, my question is, if I could recreate that blast wave in my 2.0l, 
resulting in a similar speed in my pistons (10k FPS) in my type2, what would 
my over-the-ground speed be?? Of course, considering I would be in 4th gear, 
and the stroke of a 2.0l is . . .

Yes, of course I would have D load tires on, so no problem there.  And I 
would roll down the door windows to keep from sucking my doors off.

And I would need a special horn, or only the people behind me be would hear 
me because I would be past the people in front before my 'beep - beep' got 
to them.

Time for the synthetic lubricants, I think.
