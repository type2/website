Subject: cheap test meters


Hi all,

For what it's worth.

I used some different meters to measure the voltage of a tired 12 volt 
Interstate battery with the following results (ignition off):

Fluke 8050A        12.708                          $35 e-bay

Cen Tech (P30756)  12.68/12.67 (bounces between)   $15/? Harbor Freight

Cen Tech (P35761)   12.65/12.66 (bounces between)  $11.99 e-bay

Sun Pro (CP7676)    12.65                           $20.92 acron/sale

The Cen Techs use the same core IC as my HP 2336, and give pretty much the 
same readings.

I paid $5.50 (the only bidder)for a Cen Tech on e-bay but the guy failed to 
ship and gave me a neg feedback when I complained.  That's what I get for 
being such a tight wad.

Chuck
