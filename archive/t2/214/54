Subject: HCBF Caravan on Friday Evening

Hey folks,

Unfortunately, it looks as though I won't be able to leave Delaware 
until mid-afternoon or
early evening tomorrow for HCBF, but if anyone is heading down around 
that time -- or is
coming down I-95 and just wants to stop in for coffee along the way -- 
drop me a note.

	-71 bus with the big pine roof wreck
