Fri morning I'll be coming down 77 from 81 ( staying Thurs night t
either Claytor Lake St Pk or Pulaski Walmart depending on how late I
reach there) and may reach 421 about the same time you will cross 77?
I'm no speed demon now,  puttering along in the 236,000 mi 78 Westy! 
Got a cell phone #?  Mine is 609-731-4703; leaving NJ about 10 or 11
depending on OLN tour de France coverage.
