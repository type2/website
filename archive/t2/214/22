Lee,

There are way more than 8 possible sources for vacuum leaks, I am sorry to
say.

This is probably an incomplete set of things to check when tracking down a
vacuum leak on an FI T4 engine, but it is my best shot at 10:30 at night
:-)

Starting at the AFM going to the cylinder head you have:

big "S"-tube to AFM;

on the "S"-tube:
  hose to aux air valve, elbow on aux air valve, short hose from aux air
  to air dist manifold,

  hose to crankcase vent,

  hose to decel valve;

"S"-tube to throttle body;

on the throttle body:
  Vacuum advance port;

throttle body to air dist manifold;

on the air dist manifold:

  between cylinder ! & 2, vaccum source for vacuum retard and fuel
  pressure regulator,

  near cylinder 4, the take-off for the brake booster and the decel valve,

  on the brake booster line, the booster itself and the one-way valve;

the big hoses connecting the intake runners to the air dist manifold;

the small injector seals;

the intake runner to head gaskets.

I *think* that covers all the potential leaks sources :-)  but I am
forwarding this to the list for possible additions and corrections.
