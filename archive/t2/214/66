Subject: Trying but rain


I have taken the day off to prep the bus for HCBF. The punch list 
included the usual : valves, oil, points, timing etc. Also on the 
list in to finish up the install of the VDO oil temp and pressure 
gauges and senders. The oil temp sender was installed in the sump 
plate and required some re-engineering of it as well as the screen to 
make it fit. Everything is together now but I have not made the 
electrical connections. Our drought stricken land is receiving a 
goodly dose of badly needed rain! I tossed everything in the bus and 
went inside to wait it out. I am already behind schedule and I had 
hoped to take a 50 mile test drive on the highway this afternoon 
before I punish the poor bus with a drive up US 421 tomorrow. 
Experience has taught me that doing a lot of things to the bus at 
once usually is a bad idea the day before a big trip. Apparently I am 
not a good student :)

Two things keep crossing my mind. First, will my sump plate hold 
without leaking. I can only hope so. Second, the VDO oil pressure 
sender has a longer NPT fitted stud than the stock Hella OP switch. I 
turned it until it felt as tight as it should be but there are 
several threads showing. I dare not turn it anymore lest I strip the 
case. I will have to be vigilant and check for leaks.

The rain is slowing so I going to head back out and see if I can 
finish the work before the kids get home.

Thanks
