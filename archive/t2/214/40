Subject: So...   Which is the...   *right*   carburator for me?

Heh, heh... Sorry, my sense of humor is suffering at
this time. Due to unplanned expenses, etc, I can't do
the FI, like I wanted. There is no way I am putting up
with my Weber progressive this winter. Ebay has some
Weber 40 IDF dual carbs. Are these the right size for
my 1700? How do dual carbs do in the winter, anyway?
I've had horrible icing problems the past couple of
winters and the engine dies and everything. I finally
started planning 10 minutes to sit in the van and let
it run before going anywhere. Even then, it would try
to die on me. Are IDF's the right thing for me? Is
there a way to rig up a heat assist line to them? Do
duals ice as bad as a single? Please, someone tell me
the best carbs to use in the winter. I appreciate any
help.         
                              Thanks,
                              Paul Deatherage
