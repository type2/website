Subject: Door handle

Listees,
    I am trying to find out why my 70's passenger side door handle is so
hard to replace. I can't seem to find an exact match. The main difference is
the size of the tumbler cartridge. Mine is a bit larger than the ones I am
looking at in the local yards. There are some minor differences in the
shape, but not enough for me to worry about. I am trying to find the same
one so I can swap out the tumblers and still use my key.
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, especially since I have already
torn up one trying to make it work.
    I am also willing to hear from locksmith types on what my other options
are.
Later,
Jim
