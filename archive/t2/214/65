Start by reading the spark plugs. If you have one poor injector, that plug 
will show the evidence. If all the plugs look the same, then first verify 
fuel pressure and pressure regulator function. Then verify the cold start 
valve function, ie, not leaking. If all that seems good, then check the 
pulse width (dwell) signal from the ECU to the injectors. If it is holding 
them open too long, all plugs will show carbon fouling. At that point, 
check the sensors, throttle switch and AFM functions. Then reset the mixture.
