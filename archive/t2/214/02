Subject: Calling all carbd 2.0s

All-

Still putting the humptyDumptyVan back together ...

Need to know which fuel pump to use for a (single) carb'd 2.0 - I'm assuming
you can't use the FI pump (correct?). What are those of you running carbs
using on 2.0s?

And a big 'Mahalo nui loa' to Darren for answering my previous ...

Mahalo,
