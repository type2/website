Chris,

Could you vacuum it off.  Maybe even use a clean wire brush (lightly)
and hold a vacuum hose next to where you work to grab anything the
flakes off.

When my wife got her Kirby vacuum cleaner one of the attachments was a
sander that operated off of the vacuum hose.  Not only did it work
pretty good, the dust level was much lower than a regular orbital
sander.

Hope this is an idea that might work.
