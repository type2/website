But that is all you could use anyhow on a VW - the linkage and manifolds 
are OEM specific.

Of course if you could resell the unused parts then yes - you would be 
better off getting them too.

The Alfa 36mm DRLAs I pulled from the junkyard in Naples had no usable 
parts for my VW project beyond the carbs themselves.
