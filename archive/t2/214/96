Subject: speed screw/ported vac?

List,

1800, weber prog, dual vac dist.
I hope this makes sense...

I'm running at almost full vac advance at idle off the
carb vac port, which is ported vacuum if the throttle
valve is completely closed, which it never is. 

For the purposes of vacuum advance, 
Ported vacuum is supposed to be at almost zero at idle
(butterfly closed). The idle speed adjustment screw on
most carbs opens the butterfly valve to bring the idle
up. Are there carbs that idle with the throttle
totally closed? 
I know the 32/36 DFEV sure as hell doesn't. 

Another question: 
Is a dual vac can (Like on a stock 74 bus dizzy)
designed so that one side of it will require less
pressure to actuate if the other port is open and
vise/versa? 
Will the advance side of my dual can ignore minimal
vacuum (idle with the speed screw holding the valve
open)if the retard side of the can is plugged? 
I plan to port the manifold and hook it to the retard
port to try and balance it, but will plugging it help
for now?


TIA,
clark
74 transporter
