Subject: Rear mirror glue removal

All this talk about carpet glue remover, made me wonder what I could use to
remove that super strong rear view mirror glue. A PO had apparently put a
newer model rear view mirror on the windshield. Since I have the stock
mirror, I have no use for that metal "bracket" glued to the windshield.
