Subject: Re: [T2] Re; 81 slider window

Just went out in daylight and double checked what i was finding in parts 
listings.  The window is a one piece unit.  If it is similar in 
construction to similar windows i have worked on you will have to 
completely pull it out, remove the rubber seal from the window and then 
check where the seam on one end is.  Some of these type of windows are 
just held together by the seal and you can very carefully open the frame 
enough to remove the glass.  Others there is a hidden spot weld that can 
be drilled out with a very small bit and  figure a technique for 
reassembly.  just noticed that the sliding door window and the kitchen 
side window are the same part number.
