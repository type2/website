Subject: Low oil pressure at idle

I know the beast needs new mains, they are tired at 130,000 miles, but I want to drive it for the summer and do that in the winter. It runs 20-50wt, but after a good hard drive at 60mph the oil light will come on at idle. Is there a bandaid fix for this to last the summer? Would one of those oil pressure adjusters bump up the pressure to let it hang in there until the winter so I can tear it down? It's a 79 2.0 L Westy.
Thanks,
Courtney
