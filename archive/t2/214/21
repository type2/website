>I have seen most busses with spare tire wells in the back of the bus, mine
does not have one.  Where is the STOCK spare location on a plain jane 73 bus?

Sounds like you have a non-walkthru bus with a 1/3 2/3 front seat.
Tilt the back of the 2/3 seat away from the bulkhead..... the spare is under
it.
