Subject: Re: [T2] What's up with Bus Boys?

We are still here.  It was announced on the web site that we would be closed
July 4 to July 14.  During that time, a problem arose and our web site went
down.

The web site is up again and we are here trying to catch up.

Thank You,

Subject: [T2] What's up with Bus Boys?


I remember someone saying on this list that Bus Boys had their catalog
offline for awhile. I can't even land on their site. Does anyone know what's
going on up there? I ordered a bunch of brake parts, about on July 2nd or
3rd, then I went to call them back in the next day or two and there was a
notice saying they'd be closed for vacation, July 4th to 14th. Bummer. Well,
what can you do? I waited. Now it is the 15th. I'm the reasonable sort, but
I just got a letter from the city on Saturday. I have a van up on jackstands
and the city here is on my (-at-)$$, telling me it is an inoperable/abandoned
car, a violation of city code, and that I will be fined $200 if it isn't
corrected by the 22nd...with additional possible filing of criminal charges!

It looks to me like my order didn't make it out before they went on
vacation. I don't recall seeing any notice beforehand.
Does anyone have their number? I can't seem to get it from directory
services.    Jan B
