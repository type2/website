Cold start gasket is a valid leak possibility.  I have never seen the air
dist box rust, too much oil spray from the crankcase recirculation going
on for that to happen, I think :-)

*Very* important!!!  yes, I have had this happen!! And it was wierd
because the valve was closed at idle, so there was no leak at idle, but
one developed as you opened the throttle (and EGR valve).  The EGR system
is supposed to be feeding oxygen-free gas into the system, if it feeds
air, you are lean and run hot.
