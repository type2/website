Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Guage Calibration a duex

Guages that are adjustable will have a very tiny screw adjustment 
inside.  This means disassembling the meter.  Meters  are also set up 
with a calebrated voltage and load applied.  cost of the needed 
equipment about 1200 dollars.  cost of a new meter..about  25 bucks?
First....
1. have you verified the sender
2. have you made sure that 12v is at the terminal of the gauge
3. did you use an insulating teflon tape installing the sender  if you 
do  you have to make sure you still leave enough thread to get a good 
ground contact.  check for good ground between case of sender and case 
of engine.
4 what gauge of wire did you use to get from  sender to gauge.
