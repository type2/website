Subject: Re: [T2] Power Inverter in a 74 Westy question for the electronics wizards

I use a 600 power inverter to run the fridge on the 110v.  This is 
because the inverter has a cutout at 10.5 volts on the battery.  I also 
run a standard compact flourescent lamp on that inverter.  for the same  
17 watts that the little over sink lamp does i get the effect of a 60 
watt bulb in the back.  very handy with an extension cord that reaches 
right over the engine bay on my westy.  BTW the fan on mine runs all the 
time.  That how i can tell i left it switched on.
