No way no how can they be the same number.
There are 4 different Vanagon sliding windows.
The bus one has the latch handle at the corner of the glass. There is a left
and a right. The sliding window is at the front on each side.
The Westy one has the latch handle 14 1/2" back from the corner of the glass,
so you can have the screen installed and open the window. There is a left and
a right.
