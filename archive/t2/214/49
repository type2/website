Check you local carpet suppliers or any local fabric stores. Both have 
carpet suitable for campers and vans here in small town TN.

Try to buy reminants (pieces left over from an install job). These are 
cheap and usually come in sizes big enough to do a VW just fine. Be sure to 
have the edges bound so they don't unravel.

I live in a small town of 20K people and could name 4 carpet stores, and 3 
fabric stores in town or nearby that would/could have what you need.
