--Chuck,

I concur with everything you're saying, and add:

>1. My comments on wire colors are from a color schematic for 77 and >78 models. My 79 model schematic does not show wire colors.

they are typed in the wire. (at least in my bentley ie: bk/wh)

>2. My 79 schematic does not show a "hot start relay" and does not >appear to differ electrically from the 77/78 models in the area of >the double relay.

ageed, what is this box at my solenoid/starter?

>3. I assume you are reading 8 volts at the coil in position #2.

Yes

>4. 6 volts (in position 3)is not enough to drive the pump properly >hence the low pressure.

agreed.

>5. 6 volts (in position 3) is most likely not enough to drive the >ECU and electronic ignition as well hence no start even with pump >working.

Yes, I realized this powered the ecu the other day as well. bad.

>6.  I doubt that the pump, double relay, and ignition are bad. The >problem is low voltage in pos #2 (8 volts) and lower voltage in pos >#3(6 volts). Sounds like battery.

Agreed, except: Battery meters at 12.4, T30 at solenoid is 12.4, but by the time it comes back from the ignition switch, it's down to 8.

>7.  You have non-stock wiring at and around the starter solenoid. >Some one may have installed a "hot start relay" and it has >failed.  I would restore to stock at this point. If the >starter "needs" the hot start function there are better solutions 

I agree. Must verify what this is.

>8.   Double relay 86a should be zero volts in ignition pos #1 and >pos #2. It should go high in pos #3. This needs to be sorted out.

agreed.

>Hang in there.

To everyone: Working on it. Will dive in this weekend and report later. Thanks for your time/thoughts.

Billy
