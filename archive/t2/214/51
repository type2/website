Subject: Re: [T2] So...   Which is the...   *right*   carburator for me?

You simply need an air cleaner off of a Pinto.

The hose coming off of the bottom of the snout goes to something hot to 
preheat the intake air.

There will be a vacuum line that you connect to manifold vacuum.

Now when the air is cold it will close a flap and draw air from the lower 
hose and the warm place you put it.

You may also be able to use an air cleaner off of one of the many Japanese 
cars that came with carbs also.

Dual carbs should relieve some of your icing problems but I suspect that on 
very cold days you may still have some problems initially if you do not use 
a preheated air cleaner assembly. Dual carbs work well because they are 
closer to the heads and with much shorter manifolds. They may still ice in 
extreme winter conditions. Is Crossville an extreme winter location? Seems 
like it when you live in Cookeville!!! <grin>

Will 40 mm carbs work on a 1700? They would if you put a small enough 
venturis in them I THINK. (not sure).

My Porsche Performance book has an equation that says a 2.0 (with the small 
FI head's valves) needs 36mm carbs with 34 or 33 mm venturis. I used those 
carbs and they did in fact work well. I could have used larger carbs but 
with a big hit in MPG.

Don't forget that dual carbs require rejetting typically, manifolds, 
linkage, air cleaners, etc. My cost way back in 1995 for a dual carbs was: 
linkage = $50, air cleaners = $50 each, manifolds = $100, jets and venturis 
= $100 (I think). Shipping was a separate cost too. Lots of hidden costs. 
By the way - I was putting dual Dells in a Type IV powered Beetle so I had 
to order alot of "custom" parts from BAS in Germany versus the typical VW 
catalog. Remember this was "pre-Internet" for most folks (the Internet 
existed, but most of us didn't have access to it) so you had to buy parts 
wherever you could find them.

So... I would experiment with a Pinto air cleaner for $25. I think you 
could get one for $10 and spend the $15 on misc. stuff like a new filter 
element and hose.

Take your carb with you to a junkyard to see which one will fits your carb 
best. You may find that several brands of cars used air cleaners that will 
fit your needs. If you want to come down here early on Saturday I will run 
around to the yards that i know of. Most close by mid-day Saturday.

Being that the Pinto engine was the standard FORD four banger - you will 
find it in ALL Ford chassis styles - Rangers, Pintos, Mustangs, etc. etc. etc.
