Sounds like you have a healthy mid life engine.
These are numbers for a good normal Type IV engine.
Normal ranges are 7-14 Idle, 20-30 2500rpms, 30-40-3300rpms, and a 1600
will turn closer to 3900 rpms at 65 mph. It has been caimed that you can
safely runthe type IV engine at highway speeds with 18 psi.
Numbers for a fresh rebuilt Type IV engine are 
Idle 12-24, 2400 rpms 28-40, 3300 rpms 40-65 psi, 4000 rpms climbing
hills 50-70 psi.

Dear List, 
I have an 82 air cooled vanagon, stock fuel injected engine minus the EGR

system (PO modification) and running Pertronix instead of points (101,000

mi).  I've installed VDO Oil Pressure, Oil Temp (in the sump plate), and 
cyclinder head sensors(under #3 spark plug).  Running this setup for
about a 
year I've notice the following oil pressure trends: 
(Oil: Castrol 20W50 dino changed every 3 months or so.) 
Cold startup pressure: 60 - 70 psi (depending on ambient temp). 
Idle pressure when oil temp reads 180 is about 10-12 psi.  When hot (oil 
temp 200-220), idle pressure is about 7 psi.  My warning light has not 
turned on when running or at idle (except on startup - the blub works!) 
Highway speed (55 mph) WINTER oil pressure is 40 - 30 psi when oil temp
is 
180-200, respectively. 
Highway speed SUMMER oil pressure is 30 - 20 psi when oil temp is 200 -
220, 
respectively. 
CHT is about 300 at idle, 350-375 at highway speeds, has gotten as high
as 
450 on climbs in the Cascades.  I've never seen anything higher than
this.  
All of the temps and pressures above have remained constant over the past

year. 
I believe my bearings and oil pump are worn but I'm not sure if these 
numbers mean that they are excessively worn to the point of needing a 
rebuild.  I believe I read that VW set the running oil pressure warning 
light at 13 psi for the water cooled 2.1L engines.  Is this a good
reference 
point to use for the air cooled engine?  Or - if my highway speed oil 
pressure goes to less than 20 - do a rebuild no matter what? 
I'm planning to do my first compression test soon - just to see what
numbers 
I get - but I don't expect to find abnormally low readings (based on
general 
good performance).  If my top end is holding up - how much should I worry

about my low highway speed oil pressures?  Should I consider a rebuild
now? 
or just wait until I drop a valve seat and then do everything at once. 
Any opinions or past experiences would be appreciated.
 
Thank you.
Kevin
