Subject: Run-on fuel pump diagnosed.

I got the bus to start, and then Bob from the list -- Access Systems in 
Baltimore (what's his last name?) dropped by since he was in the DC area. 
What a great guy. He helped me diagnose the run-on pump problem.

This is embarassing, but, it wasn't the fuel pump at all - it was the sink 
water pump!  My 4 year old daughter had left it on when she was playing in 
the bus, and since I can't hear directionally (I'm deaf in one ear) I 
thought it was the fuel pump I was hearing since the fuel pressure stays 
high for a very long time.  Pretty silly, huh?

Bob also helped me check my dwell, which was too high.  I tried adjusting it 
after he left, but I couldn't get my flee-bay 8 cyl dwell meter to register 
a difference after changing the gap several times.  Anyway, the bus starts, 
idles, and revs fine, but when I let out the clutch at any rpm, the bus 
dies.  I'm hoping I've got the dwell and timing all screwed up and it will 
solve itself when I redo the dwell and timing.  I've ordered a Pertronix 
ignitor, since I've realized that setting points is not my best skill.  Any 
other ideas as to what could cause the motor to die when I engage the 
clutch?

To recap, the bus ran when parked 18 months ago, and I got it started in my 
garage every few months.  It ran last month, but got no fuel pressure last 
weekend.  Swapping in a fuel pump, new lines, gas filter, and electrical 
tune up has gotten me to this point.
