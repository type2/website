Subject: Speedometer reads too low 

My speedo is off too.  It reads 55 mph when I'm actually going 62. I run 
Conti 185R14 tires, stock size.  It's a minor annoyance but an annoyance 
nonetheless. I bought a used speedo from a 70 bus being wrecked, I'm 
thinking about swapping it and seeing if it fixes it.
