Subject: Re: [T2] Multiple Gauges - Dead Gauge?

Hi Todd,

I had a list-member send me a set of three gauges from a GTI... Oil  
Temp, oil pressure and voltmeter. The oil temp is in Celsius, the oil  
pressure is in Bar. (1 Bar = 14.4 PSI). I have the oil pressure and  
voltmeter installed under my radio along with a CHT gauge. Just last  
night I finally got the lights to work behind all three of them at  
the same time.

Now I'm thinking that for my next upgrade I'll put in a two-gauge  
under-dash pod for the oil temp and a tach.

Feedback... Gotta have feedback to know what's really going on back  
there.


Happy trails,
