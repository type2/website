This is a point of controversy among bus folks.  I use a small amount of
anti-sieze on the threads, being very careful to keep it off of the
electrodes and insulator.  I've never had a stuck plug or a thread
problem.

On the other hand, some folks have had problems with misfires that they
attribute to the use of anti-sieze.  Others say that the anti-sieze
actually causes the plugs to become stuck.  I haven't experienced this,
but it is something to consider.

I wouldn't use any spray-on substance, because it couldn't be easily
controlled.
