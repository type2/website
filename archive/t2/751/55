hello Ian  Well there were many years of 6 volt up to 1966 , now 1966 buses 
and ghias had a one year only 6volt 200mm flywheel    what years is the motor 
that you are planning to use  If you dont know the year post the motor numbers 
located under the generator stand below the firing order numbers   you will 
also have to change the gen, stand, coil, choke, idle jets if electric and the 
flywheel   The flywheel will be a problem as it will have to be a 12 volt 
,200mm one and wont just fit right on. I would take another 12 volt ,200mm flywheel 
and have the inner part where the o ring goes cut off so that the flywheel 
will fit the crank.  hope that helps   Later  Mark Dearing
