The AM-band kit will need a longish wire antenna, but won't be so sensitive
to obstructions (like metal Bus bodies) as an FM-band transmitter.  The
fidelity of the sound will likely be about the same with either mode given
the level of circuit sophistication found in a simple kit.  Individual radio
receivers may have been optimized for FM fidelity however.

The main differences for a given power will be (1) range (AM longer, FM
lesser) and (2) noise (AM noisier, FM quieter).  For practical purposes, I
doubt if it makes much difference within the area of a typical Bus
gathering.  Either way, it sounds like a fun project and a good idea!

I constructed one of these (FM Radio Transmitter Kit FM10A  with case)
and it has a range of about 1/4-1/2 mile.  It is battery powered and I
take it when traveling.  Use it at home to send my sounds throughout
the house and yard.  Definitely better that the iTrip, which I also
have.

These sound like the ideal thing to have at a bus event. Let people listen
to
what you want to broadcast if they want to in their own bus. Might be a
useful
tool. I was looking at the same kit yesterday, but was wondering what the
difference would be if you got an AM one? I figured that the AM stations
might
have less chance of trampling on someone else's signal. Is their any real
difference in the sound quality between AM and FM when used in such a small
area?
