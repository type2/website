Subject: Speedometer reads too low

Hello folks!

I'm driving a 1970 VW Type-2, Bay Window Transporter.

I've been hearing complaints that when my speedometer reads the speed
limit I'm actually driving 10 mph slower.  Examples: I read 35 & am
actually going 25.  Same problem at 55/45 and 25/15.  I've not found
any mention of adjustments I can make to solve this problem.

Could this be a wheel-size problem?  I have P205 / 70R14's for tires.

Thank you in advance,
