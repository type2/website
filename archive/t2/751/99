 I fear the non-hatch will be the cause of much cursing,
possibly outweighing the engine drop alternative. Time is precious as
camping approaches :)
Thoughts anyone?

Paul,

**I've done it on my 73 AND 72 and it was the same.  The lack-of-hatch was not an issue, with engine in.  

BUT, lookout.....for the firewall, my 73 had 2 screws from underneath and my 72 has 4.  I was always under the impression that all Bays had (only) 2 and was SO happy that I knew where they were when I did the 72.  After RIPPING the firewall out, I noticed the other 2, that are more central than the outers and HARD to get to from underneath, above the trans.

Do pre-73's have 4 or is mine a mutant?
