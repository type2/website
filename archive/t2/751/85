Subject: Re: [T2] coil, was No starting problems

Pertronix recommends that a coil has a certain resistance I think. Maybe the Bosch is the right one, I don't know, but if my Pertonix had died I'd be checking to make sure I didn't fry the replacement unit. 

Google is our friend: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=pertronix+coil+resistance&spell=1

I don't have the details in my head or I'd share the secret. 

Also be aware there is a Pertronix Series I and Series II. Both have different requirements as I recall.
