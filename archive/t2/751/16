Subject: RE: [T2] Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

A  little more explanation may be necessary. I have cut the balance tube
between the carbs and installed a double barbed brass fitting. When syncing
the Kadrons (which I run), I take one side from the barbed fitting and put
it on one tube of the manometer. I take the other side and put it on another
tube of manometer. That way I can watch how both carbs are working at the
same time w/o having to switch a synchronizer from one side to another. Ted

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
