>>>>>>>>
i am still on my quest to return my ignition switch setup to original in my
69 SC.

i have the housing which is part # 211 905 889. i thought the electrical
portion of the switch, part # 311 905 865A, but apparently it is not?

can anyone *please* suggest an alternate ign. switch part # which might mate
up to said housing?!?!?

TIA,
