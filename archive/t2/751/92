Subject: I Smell Gas...  (old story, new thread)

I filled up the other day, and on a left hand turn as the bus was
leaning toward the tank filler side i smelled gas.  it happened
several times.

I paid close attentino to the last thread about this from just last
week.   I dont want a fire in my beautiful bus.

I stared with the vent tube behind the spare tire bump in the engine
compartment, but I can find NO TUBE.....

Where is the tube connected to the gas tank?

Also, is there a vent on the filler neck as well?

Thanks in advance,

Im also searching the Bently book for pictures and clues.

Later,

David.
