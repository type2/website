Hey Don. Nice pics. How much did the overhead hatch help in your
efforts? I have a '72 (no hatch :( ) and all this talk of gas smells
and rubber lines reminds me that I haven't pulled the firewall to
change the vent lines on top of the tank. I'd rather avoid a one-man
engine drop to replace fuel lines, and your tack looks repeatable for
my need. I fear the non-hatch will be the cause of much cursing,
possibly outweighing the engine drop alternative. Time is precious as
camping approaches :)
Thoughts anyone?

BTW, the '79 deluxe interior install is moving along, albeit slowly.
The sound deadener is in, and I've been replacing the old dusty smelly
insulation with organic hollowfill stuff (and some spray epoxy). The
soundkill improvement with the different insulation is amazing. Time
willing, the insulation bit s/b done by the 18th (I work slow). Bolting
in the interior starts after that. The test install went great.
