Hello Ed  This isnt AVPs fault  this is a bad design fault from VW  Whoever 
takes this oil screen plate off had better be careful on how tight you do this 
nut. I have seen this happen a lot . What we do when the person doesnt have 
any money to take it apart is to get a bolt just a little longer coat the 
threads with JB weld , coat the upper part of the shaft on the bolt with permatex 
right stuff and reinstall the bolt being careful not to get it too tight. The 
way we have seen these break out it will leave some threads at the end tha are 
just out of reach of the old bolt which is why you use a little longer bolt and 
the right stuff will keeep the oil from leaking out . be sure to use the 
copper washer under the bolt that is suppose to seal the top of the bolt. After 
letting all this sett up for about 24 hours drive the bus and check for leaks. 
Do not take the screen out anymore. If you are replacing the motor go with a 
2.0L  with hydralic lifters   later and have fun   Mark Dearing
