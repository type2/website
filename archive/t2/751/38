Subject: VDO CHT update

Just a little something more on the previous CHT tests that I did.

I still had my new probe and gauge sitting out and had another probe that 
I took off another car(for 18mm plugs).  Both "factory" VDo probes, but 
one for bus spark plugs and one for the smaller plugs.  

Ran the same test as before and found that one "probe" ran 25 degrees 
different than the other.

Bottom line, it's a really crappy set up.  More on the other "thermister" 
probe setup that I am going to try soon.

Cheers, dave
