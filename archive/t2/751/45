Subject: Re: [T2] 180 passenger seat swivel?

Hi David,

I did that install in my westfakia back in the spring of 2001. I cut  
the swivel base from an early vanagon with an angle grinder and  
welded it between the rails of my original passenger seat. It would  
be difficult to bolt this part into place without destroying the  
original seat tracks, that's why I welded mine.

This mod will work with any 76-later "sliding seat track" bus. The  
only down side is that it will add about an inch and a half of  
altitude to the passenger.

Any 76-later westy will have the bracket you need.


Happy trails,
