Subject: Re: [T2] 1973 Bus - how to tell which carb is installed?

Shawn, 
What exactly do you mean by dripping fuel? Do you have gas running down the outside of the carb and dripping all over the engine? Or are you saying that when you push the pedal (or work the carb by hand) you can see a gas spraying down into the carb throat? 
Of course gas outside the carb is very bad. Spraying into the carb throat/itanke is exactly how the carb is supposed to work. A standard troubleshooting practice is to work the throttle and see if gas sprays into the carb.
Hope this helps

It works very well, but when engine is off and I give gas I can see it dripping
fuel.  This seems dangerous, and I feel it is not normal.  The question is :
how do I know which type of carb is installed for ordering replacement
parts?
Thanks, 
Shawn
