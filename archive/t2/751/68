I haven't seen AM versions of these sold.  One problem with the AM is that
the frequency is much lower (1.0 MHz vs. 100MHz) requiring an antenna
about 100 times as big.  Those big tall towers at AM radio stations aren't
there to support the antenna, they _are_ the antenna!

Now, you probably could get around this, but FM produces a nice clean
localized signal.  No sense stepping backwards into AM!
