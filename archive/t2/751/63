I'm not sure about the one year only thing but perhaps that's right for 
some applications. The Type 3s used a 200mm flywheel as well. There were 2 
different 200mm flywheels used and the difference is in the way they mated 
to the crank. One flywheel uses an O ring and the other doesn't. So you 
need to look carefully at the end of the crank on your 2 motors to 
determine if they are the same. Or if you have the six volt flywheel from 
that motor compare those.
