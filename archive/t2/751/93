<From the description here, I'm leaning towards fuel. If it'll fire and
stumble then stall when you pour gasoline into the carb(s) directly,
it's probably not your compufire/pertronix/whatever.

But I don't recall reading the Samba thread either.>

Yes, I agree if that is how it went. I read quickly and prob even missed the reference to seeing the Titanic in port that day... <grin!> Hot electronic ignitions can act like this too. Failing or stumbling when hot, fine when cold or dead ever after.
