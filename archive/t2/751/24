Hi George,

I had a spark plug seize in the head back in 2003. Reefing on the  
ratchet simply broke the spark plug in half, requiring a head pull to  
remedy it. Which was no big deal in the scheme of things anyway,  
seeing as how the other cylinder had an intake valve with a huge  
chunk missing out of it.

Moderate use of Antiseize is a good idea in my book.

Happy trails,
