Subject: Multiple Gauges - Dead Gauge?

Hey guys,

     I was considering using the 3rd gauge pod in our dash to put something else in. I currently have a CHT in there that's not working (that was a whole other thread). Someone mentioned to me, and I forgot who... but.. someone mentioned that there was a 3-cluster gauge set, VOLT, OIL TEMP, and VACUUM or something that fit in that 3rd cluster perfectly. Unfortunately, I lost that e-mail... does anyone remember where I can get that or from what car it came. I think they said it came from the VW Fox?


Thanks!

Todd
