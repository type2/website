If you went AM, you'd have more chance of trampling someone as AM 
signals travelers farther than FM (FM is line of site, AM bounces).  I 
believe there's a station broadcast from Mexico that can reach Canada if 
the weather's just right.  FM also sounds better than AM.

If you were going to go to a bus campout, I'd go for FM because chances 
are that you are out in a remote area and you probably won't get many FM 
stations out there.  Pick a free frequency and broadcast away..
