one thing is that it should be linear not constant.  the error would be %
not certain MPH

well on my 78 when I had 205/70R14  (another thread but P tires are
underated for the buses weight)  I had things calibrated and it was only
off by about 3%   ie: I was reading 65mph when it was actually about 63mph

YMMV
