Sure, they want to sell you another one too! 

I like to think that the recommended maintenace is the minimum required maintenance to get a reasonable service life out of the vehicle. My Honda and I think my VW Cabrio recommends a 7500 mile oil change interval. I do 5K with synthetic and 3K with regular oil. So far so good. All the engines have lasted a long, long time. 

I think the lack of break-in period is a consumer gimick. Yeah it will give a reasonable service life (how much is that?) but with some extra care during the break-in period it would last longer (now much longer?). 

Just my 2 cents.
