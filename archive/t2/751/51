Subject: one year only 6volt motor

I remember someone telling me that there was a one year only 6v motor/flywheel
combo. How do I tell if I have that combo? The reason I ask is the motor I
have in my 70 camper's head is striped  and I have tried fixing it by drilling
it and tapping it from the already oversized 10mm to 7/16 but that lasted a
day, grrr. So what I want to do is take a 6V motor I have and put it in my
camper till I get a new head put on.

Thanks Ian
