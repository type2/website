Subject: Re: [T2] propane heaters

Hi Folks,

I've run my Coleman Black Cat at 10 degrees F, and haven't had much trouble. 
  I have had trouble with the propane bottle not sealing when I've removed 
it from the appliance, and I've also had trouble with small amounts of 
leakage -- just enough to make my Bus smell bad, not enough to be dangerous.

The biggest problem I've had with propane in cold weather is lighting it: 
Bic lighters don't produce much of a usable flame below about 35 degrees, so 
it helps to have matches handy.

My door seals need replacing and my fresh air vents don't seal real well, so 
my cabin is pretty drafty.  As a result, I couldn't drive my Bus in the 
winter without my Black Cat!

Hope this helps...
