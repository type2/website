I first named my bus the Breadbox, because everytime my Mom would see it, she 
would laugh somewhat hysterically and say it looked like a giant bread box., 
(and everytime she did this I would give this scowl,.I think she liked to 
taunt me)

Anyway, now that I painted the bus and changed a bunch of stuff around (all 
new seals, new bumpers, wipers, shocks, yada,yada,etc). I realized I have a 
pretty quick little bus that has been really trust to me for many years now. 
--New look, new name--

So.....her new name is Trigger, not so much because of the Roy Rogers six 
shooter thing, but because of Burt Reynolds' car in Smokey and the Bandit. 
That was my favorite movie when I was a kid.

Two weeks to go, and Trigger is on the road! Yeah!!!!

Take care all,
