Subject: Re: [T2] Wow! Spare tire carriers, ladders, racks, etc.

The gentleman in question is Gary Lee, he is a very nice guy 
we exchange e-mail all the time. That is actually my 15" 
South African Alloy Rhein Wheel in some of the pics. 

There are several people on the vanagon list that have 
already bought his stuff. As soon as I make up my mind (there 
are a lot of options to choose from), I will too. I'm 
thinking about a ladder (w/ Jerrycan & highlift) and spare 
tire rack for my syncro westy...

Thanks,
Chris
