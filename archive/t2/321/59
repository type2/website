Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

I've used grease around the valve cover lip to hold the gasket in place
while angling it into place on the head.  Rock the cover side to side a
bit and u/down to feel that it is flat to the head.  I have a wooded
shim about 1/2" thick that I insert above the cover to keep it from
riding up as the bail is lifted via a brake adjusting tool or a pry bar
fulcrumed against the heater box.
