There's no right or wrong way to name your VW.  It mostly comes from the 
perceived personality of the car.

My wife and I start with a couple of basic rules:

1) The name of the car has to come from the country of origin of the 
car.  (VW=German, Nissan=Japanese, etc.)
2) Manual=Male Name; Automatic=Female Name

When we got our Westy, we held a Naming Contest with some of our 
friends.  Our friends submitted names and when we drove the bus to 
Volksfest we assessed the bus' personality and we chose the name "Wolfgang" 
from the names submitted.  For our New Beetle, we gathered a short list of 
names and tossed them back and forth for a couple weeks while driving the 
car and "Ludwig" became the obvious choice since the bug is outgoing and 
adventurous!  My wife found a music store in Kent that sold small plastic 
busts of great composers.  I went down and bought a bust of Beethoven and 
now it sits on the dash!  I'm thinking now of picking up a Mozart bust for 
the Westy.  We may have fallen into an unconscious trend  : )

Hope this Helps!  (anyway it's fun to tell the stories and hear how others 
name their VWs)

"In Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias they had  warfare, terror, 
murder and bloodshed but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and 
the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love; they had five 
hundred years of democracy and peace and what did that produce? The cuckoo 
clock."   --- Orson Welles (Harry Lime's speech in "The Third Man.", 1949)
