Our van got her name in an unusual way. My partner and I had respectively our
own vans, his was Oscar and mine, Georgia. As time went on we aquired "Jeremy"
the parts van, "Francois" named after the fellow we aquired him from, and
"Noah" the fastback. Meanwhile, "Oscar" and "Georgia" were our babies and as
the others came and went, we always had these. However, they were getting very
worn out and unsafe. One day, a friend of ours appeared and offered us his
sundial van which had been parked under cover for a few years and had no
motor. We accepted and after much reflection my brialliant partner undertook a
huge transplant operation. "Goskoria" was born from "Oscar" and "Georgia" and
consists of all of their organs. She resembles her parents but has a vibe of
her own!
