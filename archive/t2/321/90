Subject: Thule Rack on 79 Westy? Problem here...

Just bought a Thule Superhigh Foot pack and 65" bars for my 79 Westy.  My 
problem...the inner edge of the feet contact/interfere with the sides of the 
poptop.  Now I'm thinking I need to grind away some of the material on the 
inner edge of the feet to provide some clearance and allow the feet to sit 
in the gutters.

Before I take this step (and put my expensive foot pack into a 
"non-returnable" state), has anyone else experienced this problem?  If so, 
is there a trick to adjusting or setting up the racks so that they clear the 
top without modifying the feet?

I've searched the archives to no avail...

Any tips are welcome.  I'm hoping to get a canoe up there one day...

Thanks.
