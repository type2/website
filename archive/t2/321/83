Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filler retainer

Thanks for the history lesson there.  I ran into a similar problem with
my '78 CA Westy when I moved from Alabama to Colorado and tried to pass
emissions.  They failed my because I didn't pass the nozzle diameter
test.  Apparently, they test cars with catalytic converters to make
sure you can't fill-up with leaded gas, despite the fact it's not
available at 90% of the stations out here.  What a pain in the ass.  My
quick solution was to cut a piece of metal with the proper diameter
hole and install it between the bus and the cap retention ring.  Passed
without question.  But then I realized the root of the problem and
purchased what might have been the last NOS rubber neck at the local VW
dealer.  I was actually able to install it without removing the engine,
something I was told I couldn't do.  I wrote up a little article about
it if anyone is interested.  Have a great day...
