Subject: Re: [T2] Mig Tig or Arc Wire Feed?

David--Here's your cookie---

And be informed of the proper/ correct nominclature for welding
equipment.

MIG
Metal Intert Gas welding was originally designed to be use with either
CO2 or argon, prior to the demand of the econo units when a few low
dolar individuals didn't want to pop for the rental of a tank-- the
price of the gas or a  regulator--they wanted cheap.

So the welding Mfgs. simply came up with a solution--make cheap--anf
that's what is now available--and that's what you buy.

Now--next time your parusng that econo unit--check out the intake port
that has a little rubber plug in it---

Thats for when you--or the other econo mined folks wnat to get smart and
would like a better weld--

ALL WIRE FEED WELDERS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD / UNIVERSE ARE MIG WELDERS.

Do yourself a favor and call Miller---
Don't believe me.

Oh--and Scotts posting was not only misleading--but incorrect.

What is your or his profession by the way--

Just curious--I want to be aware of the source of professinal info--

How was the cookie--??

What bizarre info? It was all correct. Both of Scott's posts on this
subject have been very informative and useful as a matter of fact.
Thanks for posting, Scott.
You must be thinking about the econo Wally World mig welder's with the
flux coating on the wire, so you allegedly don't have to buy a bottle--
If it doesn't have a bottle, it's technically not MIG. It might be
"wire-feed" though.
The only welding done without gas is Arc welding--
Tell me what this welder is then:

It says "wire feed", it does not use gas... but it is not an arc welder,
is it? If you say, "it's an arc welder", then most MIG welders are also
arc welders.
I have a 300 amp Miller 100% duty cycle-- and I use CO2 -argon every
day--
Someone give Terry a cookie.
