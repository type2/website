Subject: Another cool reason to own a bus...

My bus was out of commission today and I had to pick my little boy up 
from school early so he could get to an appointment on time.  I only 
live a mile from the school and the walk there was cold but 
invigorating; the walk home the wind had shifted and it was too freakin' 
cold!  We were about halfway home and a guy pulls up in a Jeep ( I had 
never met him before) and says, "Hey, is the VW not running today?  Want 
a ride home after I pick up my daughter from school?"  We snagged a ride 
and had a nice conversation about the wonder of the VW Bus and how he 
had seen my bus around town and thought it was great.  I told him I love 
my bus too, and it loves me.  Peace and busses, Beth
