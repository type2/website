This topic has been a very informative discussion, but all I have to say
about this is, for those of you who haven't had to pleasure of running a
nice straight bead, or weld in some body panels on your beloved old bus:

YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN METAL SHOP IN HIGH SCHOOL, what were you
thinking??????  I have people say this all the time, man I wish I would have
taken shop class, but dang if I can get them there when they're in school.

We have a ton of fun in the shop classes and even learn a thing or two that
really is useful in real life.
