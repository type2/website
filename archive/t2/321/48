As soon as my girl friend saw our soon to be purchased '77 deluxe bus, the
red and white two tone reminded her of a kids story book character "Andy the
Ambulance". Andy has stuck ever since. Anyone who gets a ride is introduced,
and must say hello to Andy!!!!
Mind you he has been rescued many more times than he's helped out, so he has
some catching up to do to become a good Ambulance :-).
