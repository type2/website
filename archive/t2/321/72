Subject: Fuel Tank

Hello List,

    I recently pulled the fuel tank in my 72 bus because the sender was
no longer working.  Before I had the old sender out of the fuel tank, I
went ahead and order a new sender from California Import Parts.  Well
after some struggle, I got the gas tank out and looking at the sender
that was sent to me, I realized that they didn't match.  The sender I
have is a column sender and not a float.  So I am now looking for
another type of sender that I can install into my fuel tank.  I also
noticed that I need to get the inside of the tank cleaned.

So I have two questions;

1.    Does anyone know where I can find another type of sender?

2.    How do I go about getting the inside of the fuel tank cleaned.  I
heard about this POR-15.


I am going to take a pictures of sender I have and post it just incase
someone may have one.


Dean
