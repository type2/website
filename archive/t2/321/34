Subject: Re: [T2] Nicknames

Naming my bus was something I set out to do early but no matter how hard I
tried didn't seem able to come up with a name that fit. As someone else
said, you come up with the name, the name somehow comes to you.

Then listening to a Jerry Garcia-Robert Hunter it just sang out to me:
Uncle John's Van.

This something to do with the affectionate appellation that has been
bestowed on me by in-laws and nephews but more I think to do with the spirit
and the lyrics of the song.

John
