Gaah!  Noooooo!

Work ft-lbs are completely different from torque ft-lbs.

Work ft-lbs represent a pound of force applied over a foot of motion in
the direction of motion.

Torque ft-lbs represent a pound of force applied perpendicular to a lever
arm a foot long.  No motion at all is required to apply torque!
