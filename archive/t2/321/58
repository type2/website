Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

Hi Folks,

I wanted to share my experiences with HP and Torque, and I wanted to do it 
without many numbers or physics equations.

I find that my engine has very distinctive torque.  That is, when I hit the 
throttle at 60mph in 4th gear on a flat road, my Bus gets up to 70mph pretty 
quickly.  However, it doesn't make as much power as it does torque.  This is 
evidenced by the fact that when at 60mph in 4th gear the same flat road 
points upward, I have to downshift to 3rd to climb the hill.  In very 
empirical terms, torque helps you increase speed, horsepower helps you 
maintain speed.

There's also the issue of powerbands and usable torque vs rpm.  I find that 
my Bus will pull/accelerate well from 2000rpm up to 4500rpm, but I can only 
get really good cruising power above 3000rpm.  As always, YMMV.  If your 
engine develops 120hp but only does it at 6500rpm (as my Miata did), then 
most of the time you're only driving a less-than-120hp engine.  However, if 
your engine makes 67hp at 3,000rpm, you can drive it at or above 3,000 and 
use all the power all the time.

And finally, how did VW get a 67hp engine to push a 4500lb vehicle?  They 
designed the transmission to make the most of the engine's power and torque 
over the largest rev range.  As Archimedes said, "Give me a lever long 
enough, and I'll move the Earth" -- you don't need much power if you have 
the right amount of torque applied in the right place.  A perfect example 
being that cheater bar we all use to remove the rear axle nut.

Good luck!
