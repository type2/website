I've noticed the tag lines in some list signatures that list the owner's
love(s), for example:

71 westy
'75 VW Bus (Phigment)
'65 VW Bug convertible (Bertha)
1978 Westfalia CDN

I've got a '76 Bus, and wondered how to figure out it's "tag".  By body
style? Year?

Would someone mind helping me out with this quandary?  Thanks!
