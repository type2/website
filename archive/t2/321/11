Yes you are right. It was done with higher displacement (94 vs 96mm 
pistons), higher CR, better heads and exhaust. What was the torque on the 
914 engine?

I had a Kawasaki 1200cc Concours motorcycle that put out 100 HP or so. 
Torque was lower of course. Bike was very fast gaged by my calibrated butt 
(not compared to the real lightweight racing sport bikes - mine was a 
highway sport tourer). 10K rpm required to get those figures. My current 
Honda CR-V has 146 HP and unknown torque but requires max rpm to get that 
too (6700 rpm?).

My point is that you've got to balance the HP, torque and RPM figures to 
compare engines.

I want big numbers at 2500-3000 rpm where I can use it! <grin!>

>And wasn't VW squeezing close to 100HP out of the 914 version of the Type 4?
