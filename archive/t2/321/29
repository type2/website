Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

We seem to have forgotten a quite basic formula here volks:

HP = Torque * RPM / 5252

Horsepower is directly related to how much Torque and engine puts out at a 
given RPM. Horsepower is calculated. Torque is measured.

This will explain why any HP/Torque graph you ever see will have Torque and 
HP crossing at, oh, about 5252 RPM (HP = Torque * 5252 / 5252 = Torque * 1), 
if the engines rev that high.

As for top speed, imagine having a top gear ratio twice as low (= higher top 
speed) as stock. You'll never see a top speed twice as fast because it takes 
more power (torque) to get up to that theoretical top speed than the engine 
makes. You can make a jillion HP at 100,000  RPM, but if the shift from 3rd 
to 4th drops you down to where the motor only makes 10HP - you're not going 
anywhere. Gearing matched to HP = top speed.

All this said, our flat-4s are all considered very torquey motors, putting 
out max torque at relatively low RPMs. Heck, few of us ever even SEE 5252 
RPM!

Given the 101 lb/ft of torque at 3000 RPM someone mentioned, we can see that 
the T4 puts out, let's see... carry the 1... 57 HP (-at-) 3000 - already the max 
the stock T1 motor at 4K+ - much better.

But, who runs a stock T1, anyway?

My .02 worth.
