I figured this thread would be killed by now, but since it hasn't, I am
jumping in.

I bought my 71 westy off E***, it was located in NYC.  When I arrived, I
notice the plates, RNSONLV.  (RUNS ON LOVE)

That got me thinking, and I  immediately had "my" name.

It seems that anytime I would load the family for a road trip (well before
VW ownership) I always used the term "the happy bus is leaving"  When I got
him pulled back to Ohio, I immediately named him HapyBus.

I believe it is the perfect name.  He makes me happy.  He makes little kids
happy.  He makes my favorite parts dealer happy.  Everyone knows the
HapyBus.  When anyone talks to me, it's always "are you taking  HapyBus?"

I have since acquired a 66 westy, complete with hand painted latex house
paint and hippie stickers.  This one is no known as HipyBus.

So I have HipyBus and Hapybus.  Look for us at an event near you soon.

So there it is folks, as for me, a little bad karma immediately for changing
the name (ask me how I know) but once we settled in, and got accustomed to
each other, all is great!

Happy Birthday Mark Dearing!

HapyBus
