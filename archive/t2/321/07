No, HP is also demonstrated by how fast you can accelerate.  Go look for quarter mile ET calculators online.  They will all have entries for vehicle weight and horsepower.  None of them will ask you for torque.

Take this example:

Honda S2000 2.0l has 153lb/ft torque and 240hp, weight 2750lbs.
VW Golf VR6 2.8l has 179 lb/ft torque and 172hp, weight 2800lbs.

Which is quicker?

S2000 - 14.4 in the quarter mile.
Golf VR6 - 15.2 in the quarter mile.

Horsepower makes a car accelerate quickly.

How much horsepower does your bus have?  Very little.  It actually makes pretty decent torque though.
