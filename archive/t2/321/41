Subject: Head Gasket Question

Greetings Type2...

I'm currently re-installing the heads on my 1977 T2 and I'm a bit confused
about the head gaskets.  I received new head gaskets from Bus Depot that are
metal.  But, the heads already have metal shims.  Are these shims the
original head gaskets or do I add the new "metal" head gaskets to the old
shims?  (BTW, these are the original heads)
