I have to chime in here, as my bus is "The Bus with Many and No Names", 
with perhaps the most unusual history when it comes to her name.

When I "purchased" (read "traded a nice laptop for") the bus from a 
friend of mine she told me that my bus was for sure a girl bus, but that 
I could not give her a name as it would tie her spirit to this mortal 
plane, and cause her to die. Sort of a rumplestilskin kind of thing. Not 
wanting to kill her spirit, I have never, and will never give her a name.

The world on the other hand has tried repeatedly to make a name stick to 
this bus. When I first registered it, the license plate I recieved ended 
in EMA. Some people noted that this would make a good name and called 
the bus this, but it did not stick.

The bus is green, and so for awhile I contemplated getting a red cover 
for the spare tire mounted up front so it would look like an olive. I 
call the color Martini Olive Green, and so some people have taken to 
calling it the Martini Olive Green Bus, but this is not really a name in 
the usuall sense, and so it has not stuck.

Shortly after this I took to calling the bus "The Bus with Many and No 
Names" in order to make it absolutely clear that I was not naming the 
bus, and that people calling her by one name or another had given her a 
nick name that was not in fact her real name.

Name your bus what you like, or not at all. Whatever feels good in your 
soul is the right thing to do.
