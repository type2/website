Subject: ATTN: Crew Cab Owners - Look!

Just arrived from Germany.  I got six, but two of us at the shop are
snagging one each our own crew cabs, so that leaves 4. There are no more
where they came from.

Brand New GERMAN VW REAR DOOR SEAL for the Crew Cab rear passenger door,
still in the original VW box.  Price is $79, which is less than VW charged
when you could last get them almost 20 years ago.  These seals are always
ratty on crew cabs I've seen (not surprising after 25 years!), and the
aftermarket ones just don't match the German original, so grab one while you
can.

I'm giving list members first crack at these, so they're not on the website.
Email Cheri at   sales(-at-)busdepot.com , or call Customer Service at
215-234-8989,  if you want one.  First come, first served, of course.
