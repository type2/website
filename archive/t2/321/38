As pointed out a little rice
burner can develop impressive torque figures, but is only in a very narrow 
rev band, where as a nice drivable motor will develop good torque just off 
idle had hold that right through to the rev limit. This also makes for an 
economical engine to drive and not constantly changing gears. Mmmmmm I long 
for the days when engines only had a few cylinders, and the stroke was much 
longer that the bore. :-)

That's the very reason I drive a VR-6 Passat, and not a H&#$a SUX-2000 :^)
