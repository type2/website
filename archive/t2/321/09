do you use good respirator when you do all that welding?  i've heard that
welding fumes can be very toxic and possibly cause nervous system damage.
i would suggest a respirator where the filter hangs behind your back so it
is further away from the fume source.  speedglas makes a very nice series
of
these helmets which can be seen at:
