Subject: Fuel filler retainer

I've been having trouble removing my gas cap lately and I decided to take
off the retaining ring and give it some sandpaper treatment to smooth the
surface that contacts the rubber seal on the gas cap.  I bought a new gas
cap back in April and lately it's been getting harder to remove.

When I took off the retaining ring I noticed that the 6 month old
reproduction fuel filler neck (211 201 119) is already torn and split where
the screw holes go.  I was pretty careful at installation time so I believe
that it's not quite as good as the original.

If anyone, Ron, knows who's making these reproductions we'd benefit from
them making the rubber that contacts the retaining ring thicker.  I compared
it to the original and it's definitely thinner in that area.

I also noticed that the back of the retaining ring had some sharp edges from
drilling the screw holes which I filed smooth.  It might be a good idea to
do this before putting on a new fuel filler neck.

There's no part number stamped on it, just Audi/VW logo but ETKA says the
part number is 211 201 131D; I checked and it's NLA.  I never noticed before
but it says "Oktan min. 91/RON/ROZ" on the ring itself.  It's supposed to be
plated to prevent corrosion and ease gas cap removal.  Maybe yours is rusty
like mine.
