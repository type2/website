But CO2 is not an inert gas.  Be informed of the proper/correct nominclature (sic) for welding equipment.

Maybe so but I fail to see what relevence that has to our disagreement.

I'll ignore your insult for the moment - It is not a MIG welder until you use that port.

You never addressed the question I raised in my previous post with the link to the wire-feed welder.  Is it a MIG welder?  When you answer this, I may understand why you would make a statement like you just did above.  I included the link again at the bottom of this message.  Lincoln does not call it a MIG welder.  They do offer a "MIG conversion kit" for it though, which would make it into a MIG welder.

Here is my assertion:
A WIRE FEED WELDER IS NOT A MIG WELDER UNLESS IT USES AN INERT SHIELDING GAS

You think wire-feed = MIG.  You are using incorrect nominclature (sic).

>What is your or his profession by the way--

I'm an engineer who has had enough relevent education to discuss this topic.  Yes, we all know you have many years of welding experience.  Doesn't make you right.  Could just mean you've been wrong/stubborn for a really long time.

This has strayed off topic and so will be my last public post on the subject.  I'd be happy to continue this discussion with you offline.
