Subject: Horsepower

To make this understandable, put it in math terms:

Work = load/distance = lb/ft = Torque(for our discussion)

"work" does not involve units of time
"power" does,

Power = Work/Time = Horsepower (for our discussion) 

It's like speed vs. acceleration.

Thats why the quarter mile time isn't releated in Torque figures. There's no time involved in the torque equation.

Now a formula that relates a quarter mile time accounting for both would be interesting.

Torque relates directly to the push you will feel when you hit the
throttle.

Horsepower relates to the amount of energy available to do work.
