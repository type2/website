Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filler retainer

Given a choice, always fill your own gas, as the station gorillas just jam
the nozzle in and likely rip the back of the rubber fill elbow.  Also,
Nozzles with retention springs can rip the rubber elbow where it exits the
retainer.....In NJ, the pumps mostly have springloaded seals that must be
pushed back and the pump held in place or it can fall out of the filler
hole- good incentive for the gas jockeys of this "can't fill your own" state
to let me do it when I threaten thy might have gas all over their drive.
