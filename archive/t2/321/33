Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

I have to agree completely with Vanagon man and George. My dual carb 2L '77
bus develops power not too far below my brothers 2.1 L '89 vanagon, but they
are a world apart to drive, especially loaded or towing. His will happily
have a 1 tonne load and tow a 1.5 tonne trailer at the same time, I'd never
even think of doing that with mine. And the difference? The vanagon develops
double the torque down low.

Now if you really want to get pedantic about horsepower and torque, what you
really need to look at is a torque curve. As pointed out a little rice
burner can develop impressive torque figures, but is only in a very narrow
rev band, where as a nice drivable motor will develop good torque just off
idle had hold that right through to the rev limit. This also makes for an
economical engine to drive and not constantly changing gears. Mmmmmm I long
for the days when engines only had a few cylinders, and the stroke was much
longer that the bore. :-)
