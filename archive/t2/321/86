	Brian, et al...

	Sounds like you and your motor may have been bitten by the dreaded
"mag-alloy" cam gear monster...  There's way to tell from the cam gear part
number suffix - I've been harvesting T4 cam gears for while and have several
different aluminum cam gears for mocking up motors and recently uncovered
one of the "mag-alloy" monstrosities...  they are much darker in color
(outside) than the aluminum units and shinier when they are machined.  I'm
told the alloy is the same as the T1 case...

	Must to run a get teeth fixed now (mine, not the cam gear...)
