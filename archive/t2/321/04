Chris,

I agree, so why don't the drag race announcers tout the newest
offering from the abc team as a fire breathin' 5,000 hp track eater?

Answer....from the other side of the car biz....maybe someone said it 
already...

"Torque wins races, horse power sells cars."

I want torque numbers on some of those engines we all see in the mags now 
instead of hp numbers!!!

So, for the Porshe 2.4 guys, here are the numbers(original 1972 911s 
2.4liter)

190hp   159 lbft
0-60 (0-62.5) mph   ( 6.6 sec* )
0-100 (0-99.5) mph  ( 15.7 sec* )
Weight              1050 kg  (2745lbs)

Don't ask if that is old or new hp...I don't remember.

So my bus weighs about 3200 lbs with me in it....with one of these engines
I should be able to get to 60mph in about 7.5 secs or so!  I even added 
.3 secs for wind resistance.  Way cool! this makes it almost as fast as my
F.rd SVT!

Maybe Chris is not so far off as to put one of these in his bus!

LOL
Cheers, dave
