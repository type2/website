Subject: Need a torque value, please

Hi all:

I've separated the large cooling fan from the pulley it's attached to in
order to clean things up and paint the pulley.  The van is attached to the
pulley via 4 bolts with "triple-square" heads, similar to CV joint bolts.

Does anybody know the proper assembly torque for these bolts?  I can't seem
to find it in Bentley.

TIA.
