Dean,

Go search the archives for Richard Atwell's link to his terrific shots of 
cleaning out a 78 tank...yours will be slightly different.

Go to the por-15 site and read the faq on the kit that they sell to clean 
out your tank.

Go look at www.busdepot.com fuel senders for your year and see if you got 
the correct sender.

Cheers, dave
