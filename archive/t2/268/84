I would consider using urethane sealant like you use on a glass 
installation b/c in my experience silicone will promote rust - something 
about the ammonia in it - - - just like chicken droppings eating up a 
"chicken coop" bus.

Another option would be regular automotive body caulk. This would be better 
IMHO b/c this is the type of repair body caulk is designed for.

NAPA and the typical auto body supply store will carry both materials for 
under $10 per caulking tube I believe.

My '66 Moostang received a liberal dose of silicone around the windows and 
I won't go so far as to say it promoted rust but let me tell you it rusted 
REALLY QUICK in those areas. These areas were previously rust free for the 
most part.

On the other hand my father has used silicone alot over the years to seal 
in windows on his show cars (looks slick) but the silicone is applied to 
perfectly painted surfaces which may seal out the ammonia in the silicone.

FWIW
