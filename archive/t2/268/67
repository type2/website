Hi Richard,

Emergency tool: Duct tape

It wont be a nice sight but it will keep you dry.

I always keep the duct tape in the bus for emergency repairs. It is strong
tough and water resistant.

> I've got a windshield with rust under it that I hope to have properly
repaired soon.  In the meatime I've sealed it up a little where it was
leaking when it rained.

> Yesterday it rained like you wouldn't believe and water started to come in
through the seal in a couple of places: the water hit the window, went down
the inside of the seal, under the glass, and came up between the glass and
seal on the inside.

> I had this windshield replaced in 1997 just before I made the trek to
Austin but I'm not sure if they put on a new seal.  I would guess not by the
state of the seal now (dry and a little cracked in the corners).
>
> I have to go on a trip and it's likely that it will rain on me while I'm
on the road.  What can I do to seal the glass to the seal as a temp. fix up?
>
> I'd like to replace the seal now but I don't want to disturb the rust
underneath until I can have the bodywork done to repair the damage.
