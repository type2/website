Thanks.

It rained again today and it's worse that I suspected as more water is
seeping in even though it wasn't raining as hard.

What's happening is water is collecting on the seal just below the wipers
and is seeping in first.  I can't tell if the seal is saturating or if it's
just loose enough to let the water get in and come out the outside edge on
the inside. I suspect the latter.

After 20 mins. of driving the whole seal looks wet on the inside and water
drops are clinging to it.

The only silicone I can find in a can is lubricant so that won't do.

I bought something called BMW Gummi Flage (for future maintenance) that may
recondition the seal but I have no idea if it will be effective at this
point and it needs dry conditions for application which I won't have.

My brain has gone into desperate mode and I want to know if I can vaseline
the area.

I think the best solution will be to use some clear silicone in a tube
although it's going to be a little unsightly and semi-permanent.
