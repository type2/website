Good point...

http://www.pertronix.com/

Make that the address above. My mistake. Oops!

There are some very specific requirements to make these units last. 
Resistance of the coil and input voltages. My only point was to make sure 
you know what you've got (version I or II) and what their specific 
requirements are (ver I and II have different requirements).

I would not give it a thought but I bought a version 1 recently and I then 
read a very, very good article about it written by a Corvair friend (Bob 
Helt) in his new book "The Classic Corvair".

Good luck.
