Subject: speakers in my Westy

Folks,

78 Westy.  Wanted to get sound in the back, purchased a set of
Infinity 3052cf
3 1/2" two-way speakers.  Based my decision on their size -
thought I might install
them in the face of the chest beneath the folding seat.  Problem?
They didn't come with grills!

Any ideas?  I've contacted all the local car audio shops in my
area, and scoured
the internet.  Everyone has grills for those big ol' 10 & 12"
woofers, but 3 1/2"
is too small...

Thanks for any input.  I doubt this applies much to other folks,
so feel free to
p-mail off list.

Cheers!
