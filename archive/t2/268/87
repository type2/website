Maybe use plumbers putty underneath.  I'd be afraid that if the silicone 
hardened and then pulled free even a little, that it would then 'draw' the 
moisture into the crevices under the wood.  Something that remains pliable 
would IMO be a better idea.  Maybe urethane windshield sealant.  It remains 
pliable.
