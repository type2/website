Hi Andy,

It is possible to import seals from the USA, but why dont you just go to a
supplier in Germany. Even in Italy must be some vendors selling your window
seals.

Just take a look around Europe before you go to the USA. I think it will be
cheaper on this side of the ocean.

Aircooled greetings,
