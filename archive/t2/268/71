Richard,

IF...wups, no... *when* you get ready to replace the seal, you can
work the rust over pretty good and still put a new seal back in.

I did this on my bus last year before deciding to paint it.  If you have a 
non chrome window rubber, you are talking cheap.  I took mine out to asses 
the damage and then very carefully sanded the rust out.  I then painted
the rusty area with por-15 and put the window(and new rubber) back in.

If you are going to try this, then mark the current edge of the rubber to 
paint area and stay behind it when you sand and paint!  Go slow!

If you need to paint more, then consider just adding a line of black paint
below the window rubber...I don't think anyone ver noticed that mine
wasn't stock paint except another bay owner....cheap rust insurance before 
a major paint job.

If you get someone else to change out the rubber, then pay the price that 
the installer wants...they think their rubbers are better and would 
probably warrant them against leaking that way.

Cheers, dave
