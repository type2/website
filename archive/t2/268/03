Jim

I agree with the below, and will add one point that hasn't been touched on
in favor of the 1968-71 (and '72='74 but with different engine) models --
the interior design. Although the refinements of the 75-79 seem to make
sense--gas/electric fridge, built-in stove, etc., it has never felt as right
pr as natural as the 68-73 configuration. I admit it may simply be a
personal preference, but I like setting up the camp stove near the door, not
cooking inside the bus. As someone else observed, who wants to cook bacon
inside a bus?

Also, the old manual water spigot and ice-box cooler are less finicky, But I
suggest you look at various configurations and come to the conclusion that
is right for you, including air-cooled and water-cooled Vanagons.

For a pretty good guide to various model tears buses you may wish to check
out the Bus Depot's buyer's guide to campers at
http://www.busdepot.com/campers.htm

Best of luck an whatever you decide. You will find this list and all the
friendly people on it to be a tremendous resource.
