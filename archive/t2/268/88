Hi Everyone,
Just had to share this and Thank everyone for all their help on this after 
trying lacour thinner and all kinds of stuff my girl friend said why not try 
your steam buggy?  Wow on the dryed up crap it came right off  with no effort 
I know a few others P-mailed me on this so I figured I'd share.
That's all for now
