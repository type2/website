Subject: R: [T2] Windshield trouble

Just a question I am interested in...

How do the glass stays on the windows? Is it just pressure on the rubber
seal? If I need to change a window glass (or seal), do I just have to
pull hard and then push very strong to have it back in? Is there any
special tool I need?

I wanted to change all seals on my '76 bus (many are bit cracked), but
here in Italy there's no easy way; so I thought I could purchase seals
cheaper from USA (bus depot) and then do the work myself.

Is it possible?

Thanks

A.
