Subject: valve train geometry

I'm building a 1641 engine with all new parts. I've assembled the 
case and have just put the cylinders and pistons onto the rods. I was 
getting ready to install the heads and push rod tubes  tomorrow.

Then I read about valve train geometry and how to set it.  I could 
use a little help clarifying what I have read.

There seem to be two adjustments that can be made  -  thickness of 
shims and length of pushrods.

My reading of previous messages is that the criterion for choosing a 
proper shim is that the center of the adjusting screw be coincident 
with the center of the valve stem when the valve  spring is 
compressed to the half way  point of its travel.   Is this correct?

Assuming that this is correct, then after the rocker arms assemblies 
are properly shimmed, how does one determine the length for each 
pushrod?

And finally, I'm thinking that  there might be an advantage if I 
interrupt my assembly right now. I could temporarily bolt on the 
heads   (without the push rod tubes),  mount the rocker assemblies 
and push rods, insert the proper shims, somehow measure and cut the 
pushrods to length. After all this, remove the assemblies and the 
heads, and begin the engine assembly where I left off.

Please comment on all this.
