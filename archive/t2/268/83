Brandt,

If it looks as good as you expect then it is worth any amount of money 
that you paid!

Lots of work ahead of you though...I am up to the point of finishing my 
headliner installation and starting to put side windows in yesterday and 
today.  What a job!!!!!!(the headliner that is!)

Cheers ,dave
