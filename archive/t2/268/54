Be sure that if you use the Ignitor version 1 that you have the proper 
ballast resistor and the proper coil in the van or it will fry in short order.

Go to Compu-Fire's website and they have all the instructions.

The hook up requirements for version II are completely different.

I am assuming you don't have the instructions or you wouldn't be asking us.
