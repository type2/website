Hi Tara,

The backfires are a sign that the system is probably running too rich. 
It might also be an exhaust leak, but if that were the case the 
backfires probably would have been there before the tune-up. And if 
your mechanic used a lighter weight of oil during an oil change it 
could be the cause of the oil light coming on.

If you could explain what was done during the tune-up, it would help. 
With more precise info we can give more specific advice.

Happy trails,
