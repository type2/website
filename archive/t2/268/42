I've owned 69, 71, 74 and currently, a 79 Westfalia bus.

Best bus by_far_of the whole bunch is the 79.

78 - 79 buses have the most torque and hp, 76 - 79 have what many consider to 
be the best laid out camping setup.  72 - 79 engines will last twice as long 
as the earlier 1600 and have a superior fan assisted heating/defroster 
system. 75 - 79 fuel injection is far more efficient and reliable than the 
earlier single and twin carburetor systems. 74 - 79 have a convenient access 
hatch over the engine.

Later buses tend to be in better shape because they are newer and don't have 
10 additional years worth of miles on them.

Parts availability is great, check out the web page for "Bus Depot".

$5000 will get you a_great_76 - 79 Westfalia or Riviera camper/bus.  You can 
find solid camper bodies for less, but if reliability and fully functional 
camper options is critical, you will typically spend the extra bringing 
systems to spec if you do it systematically and correctly.  The Bentley 
Manual will be your freind!

You may not want to limit your search to the "bus" body style.  There are 
some good deals to be found in early vanagon campers also.
