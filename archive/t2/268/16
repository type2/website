Subject: RE: [T2] 71-72 Master Cylinder

Thanks for the information but I think that is only correct for replacement
parts - not the OEM parts. The spacing on nipples of the reservoir is
different on the 73-79 models as noted on the following web page from
Wolfsburg West. . .

http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/wolfsburg/brakes/bus_brake/master_cyl.htm

. . . and also in the library of the Type2 site. . .

I would thus like to know how I can tell them apart for in case I need to
get a matching reservoir or rebuild kit.
