Cylinder bore diameters are the same at 23.81mm

You're gonna have to check the reservoir nipple spacing like Ron Vanness
shows on his site.  Most 71-72s I've run across for the past 15 years
usually have the replacement style cylinder utilizing the later reservoir.
A lot of times the reservoir will have the part number cast into it (but
not always):

211-611-313H  Original for 71-72
211-611-313K  Original for 73-79, Replacement for 71-72

Unfortunately, I don't know the spacing.

It's just a personal opinion, but I avoid used brake hydraulic cylinders, I
always buy new 'cause brake and steering are where I won't futz with.  Even
new hydraulics have a limited shelf-life, not more than 3 years tops.  I
always tossed to the trash hydraulic cylinders over 3 years old because I
just didn't wanna take the chance.  All of the American hydraulic
manufacturers tell their distributors down to the FLAPS to rotate their
hydraulic stock every 24 months (I know this from experience).
