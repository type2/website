Several suggestions come to mind-
1) Get a lighter girlfriend:)
2) Get a bumper sticker that reads -
   " If this Bus is Rockin'- Don'r Come Knockin"!
3) OK, then-
The ride height is not controlled by the shocks.
Put the bus on a level spot. Make a measurement from a
common spot on both sides- bottom of the rocker or fender lip.
( Tires matched, air pressure equal ).
If the difference is an inch or more, consider a torsion bar adjustment.
Details are in the Bentley.
As for the bump noise, you do need new shocks.
But first see that the upper shock mount bolt is not loose.
And verify the rubber bump stop ( and the rubber shock bushings )
are still there.
