Subject: Re: [T2] Allright Fine Ill Say what Oil I use:

Hmm- what we need is a LONGER oil filter that sticks down in the
airstream, and with fins on it!!!!  Now about curbs and rocks......

Believe it or not, I have just such a filter!  I found it while U-Pulling 
-it one day on a bus.  It mounted underneath the drivers side battery tray, 
and was plumbed into the oil pressure galley and returned through a hollow 
alternator stand bolt.  Interesting item.  Cost me some effort and $0.00.  I 
also found a brand new non-finned version in the box in the same vehicle.  
They take a good ol' roll of toilet paper.  The paperwork even tells you how 
to read the state of your oil(and engine) by the way the used filter looks.  
I know bypass filters aren't the best thing in the world to rely on, but on 
a 1600, it's better than nothing!
