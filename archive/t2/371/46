--Deceleration valve?

Shiny aluminum flying saucer attached to the firewall with vacuum lines way back by the throttle valve assembly.

I didn't notice it while driving, but when Karl replaced mine and revved the engine, it had a much cleaner, even decel.

NLA, I think, hit the junkyard.

p.s. awesome pictures of the merced, where exactly does that river originate/flow thru?
