The pilot shaft bearing is in the end of the crankshaft on a type 4, you
will need to remove the flywheel to get the bearing out as there is a flange
in the flywheel that used to hold a felt grease ring and keeps the bearing
from coming out.  

To remove the bearing, I have slide hammer that has a number of pullers that
can be attached.  This tool is quality made and sure works wonders on the
bearing, or even the outer case.  The puller has one set of fingers that are
small enough to fit inside the bearing, then expand outward with the turn
screw.  A few whacks on the slide hammer and the bearing comes flying out.

The slide hammer is a Mac Tool #P4275R.  A great addition to any serious VW
person's toolbox.
