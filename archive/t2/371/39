Subject: Re: [T2] need FI manual

Hi Joel,

Not sure if you mean a VW specific manual or the one which is the same size as a Bentley manual because it is a Bentley manual. If the latter then you can get it from http://www.bentleypublishers.com/

I bought this just before I got my new bus with its 1600FI engine and found it to be a very good read, good for non FI people too as it explains carburation as well.

Good luck
