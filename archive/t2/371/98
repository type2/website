Subject: Name this color, please

I am getting ready to paint my old 72 deluxe. I want
to paint it the original color, but my m-plate and the
paint code are no where to be found. It is a light-ish
blue, but I don't know specifically which color it is,
maybe "Bahama Blue"?
Heres a link to a picture (borrowed from theSamba.com)
that has bus that is the color. Can someone please
name this color for me so i can order some from my
local paint supplier. Thanks!
