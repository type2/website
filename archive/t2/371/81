Subject: RE: Looking to build a performance motor.. hehe...

	Having driven the '70 single cab as a commuter for a 
month, there's no reason people should laugh at you for
wanting a "performance" motor. Start by 
reading the Idiot's book by John Muir, half of which
you'll disagree with, and the Haynes book for your
'73. 
	Then get a copy of "How to Rebuild your Volkswagen
Air-Cooled Engine". It gets good reviews, I've got
a copy myself.

	Then do the 'Good Cheap Fast, pick any 2' decision-
and research specifics.

	Compared the Chevy, VW didn't make that many
heads, in fact I can't recall any fancy mix and match
stuff, although there is a book on parts interchange
which might be fun to read.

	Your bus came with a Type IV 'pancake' motor in the USA,
optional 'upright' (original Beetle style, like 1971 and
before busses) in Rest Of World (ROW). The Type IV wieghs
about 100lb more than a Type 1/2 and can make 30+ more 
horsepower, stock. It can also be brought up to 2.0l stock, 
where type 1 stopped at 1500 or 1600. 

	Even better news, Porsche did better heads for the 914, which
got a Type IV motor, and so you can look for Porsche 1.7, 1.8 or
2.0 liter heads to top your motor. You'll need new exhaust system
I believe, but that's the price of progress. These motors came in
the VW-Porsche 914, from 1970 to 1976. And the 1976 "912E", a 911
with a Type IV 4 banger.

	If you want more power after that, consider a Porsche 6 cylinder
motor. Its Been Done. Mercedes alloy wheels go well with this upgrade :)
I've seen one. I bet it goes like stink :) I saw a 914 with a 3.something
993 motor in it once... ah when *I* win the lottery...

	Depending on your locale and smog laws, you can choose the Fuel
Injected route- easy starting, plenty of power, very reliable, or 
you can play Hot Rod Guy with carbs. Kaldrons are well spoken of,
if the stock setup isn't your cup of tea.

	Wanna get crazy? My pal Ray reads only Dune Buggies and Hot VWs
and built a 350 hp 'Type 1' motor for his sand rail. Probably every
part came from the USA, including billet heads. Not For Street Use.
But Ray seldom leaves his engines in one piece for more than 100 hours.

	Have a good time!

	Bill
