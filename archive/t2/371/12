Gail, if you look at the case (looking into the engine bay, with motor
installed) to the right of where the case halfs meet you'll find the number.
It's to the rear (rear is rear of bus) of the oil breather. 

As Karl usually points out (hi, Karl), don't go by the number stamped on the
fan housings, as the fan housings do get swapped. My bus currently has a GE
case w/ GE stamped on the fan housing. The replacement AVP case is a GD case w/
square port heads. So my bus will be another example of why you can't go by the
number stamped on the fan housings.

Another thing to point out. The engine listing at:
http://type2.com/bartnik/enginecodes.htm is wrong. Why, because it was probably
cribbed from Bentley which is wrong. Karl pointed this out to me a couple of
years ago, when I couldn't figure out why the original engine in my bus had a
GE number, but was clearly a 79 Federal bus (not cali).

It's nice to see that the guys at Tunacan.net (http://www.shoptalkforums.com/)
updated their page to reflect the correct info (it wasn't always like that).

Summary: Congratulations Gail, you have a 2.0L engine :)
