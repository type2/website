Subject: I don't know anything, and here's proof

I was driving my 70 westy home from work tonight. Just after I got to the top
of a pretty good hill, I happened to look in the rear view mirror to see what
sort of a line had accumulated behind me. Instead I saw a bunch of blue gray
smoke. Doh!!
I drove the last block home and planted my self in the ground. There was oil
dripping onto the brace that runs below the engine. The drip was mostly in the
center (left/right) of the car. There was still a little bit of smoke coming
from the muffler, so maybe some oil got there too.

What did I do, and more importantly, what will I be doing this weekend to
fix?? In case it matters, I was doing about 25-30 up the hill in third, which
has never been a problem before.

Thanks
Zach
