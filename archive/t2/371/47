Guys,

It's just not going to happen unless your springs that try and pull the 
shoes back together are shot.

The springs try and pull the shoes back toward the center after you let 
off of the brakes.

Count on replacing the shoes(you probably already are) and spray the 
daylights inside where the adjustors are with a penetrating oil...let sit 
overnight and then try to get the stars moved tomorrow.

Good luck, dave
