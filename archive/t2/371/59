Subject: EGR

OK, I'm receiving a lot of flak off-list from my EGR views so I'll just stick to the facts.

Science:

- EGR was added to lower NOx (smog) emissions only.
- EGR introduces oxygen depleted exhaust to the intake manifold.
- EGR lowers the head temperatures.
- When NOx emissions go down, HC and CO emissions go up.

Law:

- EGR is part of the emissions system and state and federal laws prevent tampering with it.

Observed:

- EGR produces a hesitation off idle because it causes a large drop in vacuum.
- EGR reduces horsepower.
