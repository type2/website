Matt,

Intermittents are hard to find.

You might want to try the following:
1 Key on

2 Turn on the Emergency Flasher Control

3 See if you can start the Emergency Flasher running by moving the wires 
near the Turn Signal and Flasher Relay. If it starts, what wire is 
responsible?

I know you are more concerned with the brake lights than the Emergency 
Flasher but they are interrelated.

4 Check to see if Fuse S9 is well seated. This supplies voltage to the 
Flasher Relay.

Do you have a volt/ohm meter?

Chuck
