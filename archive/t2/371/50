I wonder if they managed to harass someone who had the means to call their
bluff?  After all, if a site isn't making money, defaming VW, or
"diluting" their trademark they really don't have a case.  All they
really have is the potential for litigating the site holder or club to
death.

By creating a registration process, VW gives the impression that a
registration is required, which legally it is not as long as you don't
profit, defame, or "dilute".
