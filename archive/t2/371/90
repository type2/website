Isn't your engine a gex? if so list experience (& some personal
exposure) says there is a very good chance that the hydraulic lifters
are the least of your concern. Check out the archives for the
pros/cons of both sides. I don't really believe there is a right/wrong
selection, although many people have said that miss matching lifters
with cams can be a bad idea if the 2 parts rubbing together are of
a different hardness.
