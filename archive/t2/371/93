I assume with engine off, and you're looking for something that drains the
battery over several hours.

If you run too much current through the meter bad things will happen.

Disconnect ground cable
Set meter to highest amp setting.
connect meter leads to ground terminal of battery and ground cable.
Read current.

If current is too small to read, you can reset the meter to a more
sensitive scale.

A few milliamps of draw is normal for radio keep-alive circuits.  More
than that could be a problem.

Be sure to reset your meter to off or voltage so you won't fry it when you
next use it!
