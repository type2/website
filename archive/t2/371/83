Subject: Experience with Berg Shifters??

Anyone have an experience with, what I'm told is an older model, Berg
Shifters?  I bought one some time ago that was in 74 Baywindow with the
intention to us it in my 66, which is more like a 65 (it has the Shiftrod
setup of a 65 down).  Finally, after 18 months got the Bus down and pulled it
out of the Garage only to find it wouldn't go in reverse.  It wasn't like it
would fill like it's in Reverse and not move it just wouldn't go over there,
like it was hitting a wall or something.  I'm hoping the problem is the wrong
Shifter.  Berg list his Shifter for 65 down and 66 up, I hope it's wrong and
just won't shift over.  This is a new build T1 tranny.

I don't have a stock one to compare, so I'm going tomorrow and buy a Scat to
try.

By the way, reverse is up and over to me right.  I could remember, but tried
all locations.

Dave
