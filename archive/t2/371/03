Exactly - the short version is something like this.

When doing comparisons between e-fans and mech-fans use HP as a common 
measure.

The mech-fan uses over 10 HP at highway speeds. An e-fan of the right HP 
rating would use more amps than your battery and alternator could supply to 
run it.

I can supply better more accurate numbers but it would be gathered from the 
archive. Don't wait for me though - help yourself! <grin>

Just jerking your chain...
