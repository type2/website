Subject: Re: Brake Job - remove drum

OK, Dean, I forgot about this idea.  I am cc:ing the list to get their 
thoughts and input.

Basic problem:  cannot remove rear brake drum on '72.


Basic assumption:  adjusting stars are frozen and cannot be backed off.


Basic solution:   get some movement on brake drum and build on that movement 
until drum slides off (humor off)


Questionable Eureka!!:  If you unscrew each rear brake bleeder screw, the 
wheel cylinder pistons would want to recede into the empty wheel cylinder 
(brake fluid would drain/shoot/squirt out of wheel cylinder = empty).  this 
would take the pressure off the brake shoes against the brake drum, and you 
should be able to whack the sides of the brake drums to encourage the brake 
shoes to 'back off'



OK, members, how do you vote?? Will the above idea be of benefit in removing 
stuck brake drums??


Thanks for your support.

Barry
