I painted mine with POR-15 high temp silver.  Here's a pic

After a year, the paint on the fan shroud is still bright, hard and intact.
The paint on the muffler is long gone.  I'm working on a second engine and
probably won't paint the fan shroud this time.  I kind of like the patina of
gracefully aged aluminum =^)
