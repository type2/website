Chris,

I had this happen to me one time and it turned out to be the air flow meter for 
the FI. somebody correct me if I am wrong but it's called a potentiometer and 
inside of it there is a needle of sorts that rides on a circut board and after 
years of driving this needle can wear right through the board causing it to go 
bad.  If your bus is fuel injected of course.
