Subject: re: hesitation or surge

Have you checked the obvious first?  Perhaps there's an electrical
connection that's breaking contact when you hit a bump?  Or maybe some of
the ignition components are getting old..... plugs, wires, points, cap,
rotor, etc?  Also is the timing good?

Good luck,
Shawn.
