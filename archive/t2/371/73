Aah, now that sounds familiar. I had the same problem on my 78 2.0 FI. It
would somtimes cut out on acceleration but for the most part it occured
while cruising at about 1/4 throttle. It ended up being the AFM. Easy way to
tell is to pull the lid off the top of the AFM carefully and look at the
track that the potentiometer slides over. On mine it was worn through to the
circuit board in one place (right about where 1/4 throttle would have it
sitting). Replaced the AFM and have not had a problem since.

Good Luck
