I just did the brakes on my old 72 and the back shoes
were stuck as well. And "Yes' I believe that the
principle you assume is a valid one. FWIW, I also
found that putting the tire\wheel back on the drum,
once you have disconnected everything of course, gives
you a little more leverage to pull on. If you are
trying to pull off the bare drum, its really hard to
grasp. With the tire\wheel back on, you can grab the
tire at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock position, and by
pulling on each side consecutively, like a "see-saw"
motion, you can work the stuck drum off. Good Luck!
