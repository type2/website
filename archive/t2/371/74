Subject: Re: [T2] Hole saw sizes?

2 1/16 is a common VDO gauge dimension.
A common 2" hole saw will cut a hole 2 1/16"
due to the drill travel in thin sheet metal.
Practice on scrap metal and check the fit.
A  2 1/16" hole saw is not a common size.
The cheaper hole saw made for wood will
cut several holes before it is destroyed if
the drill speed is kept slow and you use
some lubricating fluid.
I can cut a dozen holes with a disposable
$ 2 hole saw before I have to toss it.
Otherwise, buy the proper bimetal or
high speed steel hole saw, $15-20.
