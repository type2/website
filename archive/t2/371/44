I couldn't guess from your pictures , what year of Vw your driving.
I can speak about the dual carb engines

one thing you can check is your fuel pressure, you can get a Vac/pressure gauge
pretty cheap.
Check the Bentley, but If you have stock dual solex carbs , you want 5psi with
about 400ml delivery in 30 seconds.

You can remove the gaskets on the pump base,, and try it again,, If that
increases your psi , then you have a worn rod.

At the same time, you can check if your tank outlet is plugged.   

If it was electrical,, you should hear a back fire as soon as the power is
restored. 

My guess is you are not getting enough fuel delivery
