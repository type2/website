Todd,

One word...ummm...maybe two...or three

1. Cheap 
2. Reliable
3. Fast

Pick any two and then go here http://www.aircooledtechnology.com/

*read* everything...including the part about the *killer* pistons and 
cylinders for only $3000....after reading this site and drooling, then you 
can work your way up the ladder to some ofthe european sites.

I've hear Jake is good and other will probably second that motion.

Cheers, dave
