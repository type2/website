Subject: Seeking Front 1/4 windows

Hi all,
Just wondering if anyone out there frequents VW wreckers?
Front door 1/4 windows are quite scarce here and was wondering if it was
worth getting some sent over. Just need some one willing to track them down
and package them up!
I'm willing to pay of course.
Please e-mail me if any one can help.
Cheers,
Richard,
Brisbane Australia.
