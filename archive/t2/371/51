your engine is most likely not an upright. This usually refers to the
style of engines found in all type 1's (called a T1 engine :) and
busses in the early 70's[0]. The easiest way to tell is if your
generator (or alternator) is on a pedestal located above and to the
right of the crank pully it's an upright. If your crank pully is also
a fan then it is a pancake.

[0] here in the states we got a more powerful "pancake" engine similar
to the porsche 914 engine, but many other countries kept the 1600
upright engine
