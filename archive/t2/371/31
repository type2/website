Subject: Looking for owner in MD

Hello group:-)

I apologize in advance if this in not an appropriate email, I hope it is
okay. I am looking for the previous owner of my 1977 yellow Westy.
Actually the previous owner to the guy I bought it from. So it would be
the PO to the PO. I purchased it last September from a gentleman who
only owned it for about a month. So anyone out there sell a nice 1977
yellow Westy in Columbia, Maryland last summer-ish? You would have sold
it to the guy in Columbia MD who I bought it from. Please I would love
to get in touch, I believe you owned it for some time and took very nice
care of it:-) I know I am hoping for a lot but any help would be
appreciated. It has a Jerry Garcia sticker on the headliner and a stealy
on the gas gauge and a bumper sticker "Bearlymovin'" (wish I could find
another one of those bumper stickers). Does this ring any bells with
list folks. Please help.

Peace

Meg
