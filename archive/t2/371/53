I don't think so. First, are the shoes stuck to the drums?  Usually they
are not.  If the drums are heavily worn, you will need to back off the
adjusters to move the shoes away from the drums.

Most really stuck drums are stuck at the big center hole.  Solutions
include penetrating oil, lots of pushing to and fro, twisting back and
forth, etc.  Not fun.  If you can get any motion at all between hub and
drum, then you can usually worry the thing off.

If you can't get it off, remove the big nut, pull the drum and hub as a
unit, and then apply the press or big hammer to separate the two.

To prevent future problems in this area, sand all the rust from mating
surfaces, then apply a thin film of anti-sieze.  Don't get carried away
with the anti-sieze as it can get on the drums!  The drum should go on and
off with little force, so keep sanding until it does.
