Subject: It's curtains for you Vanagon.

I bought some curtain material today to replace the sun rotted ones I 
found in the cabinet in my 80 Westy. Looks like all the hardware I know 
of is in the bus but I'm wondering if I am missing anything.
I was looking in a catalog to see if I could identify anything I might 
be missing and discovered "curtain hooks and gliders". I got the 
impression from the appearance of the original curtains that the upper 
rod and the lower cord simply slid into pockets at the top and bottom of 
the curtain. Is this correct or are the hooks and gliders necessary? If 
they are needed, how do they attach to the curtains? I see no indication 
that the old curtains had any hooks. The rod at the top of the curtain 
is about 1/2" wide and maybe 1/8" thick. I have never seen a good pic of 
these hooks or gliders so I'm not sure I need them.
Thanks
Tom
