Subject: Hole saw sizes?

I am putting the city water hook up on my 76 Westy from PEP/Go Westy and have 
not yet got the part and was wondering if any of the list members knew the 
diameter of the hole that it mounts in? Also I know it's been said recently but 
I need conformation on the diameter of the hole saw for the VDO guages I think 
it was 2 1/16?
