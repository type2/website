The berg shifter for the early bus is different than for the 74. I don't
think they interchange.

I would try to make the berg work before buying a scat. Perhaps berg can
change/modify it to work. They are very good shifters, and personally I
would try to make it work, or swap with someone for a berg splitty shifter
before spending money on the scat unit, which is not quite as nice as the
berg.
