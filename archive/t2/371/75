Subject: Fuel Problem After Carb Rebuild

Hi all-

Newby carb question: I have just rebuilt my 34-PDSIT 2,3 and now when I shut
off the engine and look down into my right carb, I can see fuel collecting on
the throttle plate. The engine also seems to be running a bit rich. What have
I done wrong?

Thanks for your help.

Cheers,
Matthew
