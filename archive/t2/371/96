Subject: Re: [VB] Experience with Berg Shifters??

What I finding is this is an older Berg Shifter.  Checking back in there
cat, they list 2 different shifters. One for 65 down and the other for 66
up. My 66 has the 65 style shift rods.  They use to make an adapter for the
earlier one. The new Bergs fit all.  This one will not go over enough to
engage reverse.  I know it's not the Tranny, I can select reverse with Vise
Grips from under the Bus.
