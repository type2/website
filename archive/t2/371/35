Subject: Re: [T2] Painting type 4 fan shroud

	Dave, Seth, List, et al...

	Funny this should come up - I just got a new Eastwood catalog last
night...  in the powder coating section they list some kinda hi-temp filler
schmutz (Lab Metal??) suitable for that exact application...  Check their
website too.

	As the days count down for my 2260 install, I'll be doing my
impeller housing interior with some left-over high solids enamel that came
in the POR Engine Painting kit, and a good wire brushing on the exterior
with some rattle can hi-temp F*rd blue that I've used to color-accent and
de-crustificate other things that needn't crustificate for heat transfer
purposes...  Then a quick trip into the oven for a mild baking...  Voila!  A
purdy black 'n blue impeller housing to accentificate my Taxi-Cab Yellow
bus...

	As always, YMMV...
