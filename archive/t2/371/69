Sabro,

A dual carb CU (European Vanagon) is essentially the same as a CJ (2L
European dual carb bay) with the exception of some tin, electronic
ignition, and the fan housing. If you have your old bay engine (any
1700, 1800 or 2000) you can simply use the fan housing (and alternator)
and tin from the old engine to make the CU engine fit. If you have
removed the electronic ignition module, DLS, and wiring harness from the
t3, you can use that too. If not, you need to replace the distributor on
the CU with your old engine's distributor.
The CU tin may be made fit but the easiest route is to swap the fan
housing and tin. If your old engine is a 1700 or 1800 you also need to
swap the flywheel.

I think this is all ...
