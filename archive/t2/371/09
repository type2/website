Hello, 

I know I have posted these before if if any one has
wondered what their fan shroud would look ilke if it
were striped and polished. I took my shroud out, used
an impact screw driver to take apart the 2 halves of
the shroud and sand blasted them. I then reassembled
it and used an angle grinder with a wire brush
attachment to "polish" the fan shroud. It turned out
well as you can see in the pictures. I used Por15
clear to coat the metal but the clear coat yellowed
severely and I ended up painting the whole thing blue.
:(  At least I got a few good pictures of it. If I
were to do it again, I would use a different clear
coat, possibly even shallac. Well have a great day!
