Find a 914 2L - engine code GB (European dual carb) or ??? (U.S. FI) -
or 1.8 VW 411 S engine - code AT (dual carb).

Both have dome pistons, large valves, large carbs, and interesting
cams. The 914 engine is rated at 100 hp (DIN) and the 411 engine puts
out 75 hp (DIN) in stock configuration. Both offer a good start for a
moderately priced engine with a little extra punch. I have a 2L case
with the 411 heads and carbs, a larger cam, and 914 P&Cs. It cost me
about the same as a stock rebuild from VW, but my engine builder
(Kummetat in Essen, Germany) put an extra 40 horses into the deal (about
50% increase).
