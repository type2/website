Hi Volks,

I got an email yesterday from VWOA. It was to informing me of the
"Enthusiast Licensing Program". The email told me:

> The Internet Licensing Program is a free program and offers VW Clubs 
> and Enthusiasts the opportunity to apply for a license to use 
> Volkswagen trademarks and service marks on the Internet and in 
> Internet domain names if certain conditions are met.

> If you are a Club or Enthusiast and have any intention of using

So in exchange for 20 minutes of tedious forms-filing, I get to list my
event (Buses Of the Corn) on their web calendar. Not gonna happen. Last
year I listed BOTC with VW.com and it only took about 90 seconds.

In my response I told them that it was too much trouble and that they
were spending too much energy on copyright infringement instead of
supporting the enthusiasts. I expect other event planners will boycott
the VW.com event calendar for the same reason; unless you're already
required to acknowledge a VW copyright it just isn't worth the hassle.

But now this.... Is VW actually turning the ship in a new direction?

Like George said... I'll wait and see if they rein in the lawyers
before I consider this battle over and done with.

Happy trails,
