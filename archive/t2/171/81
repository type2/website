Subject: Re: [T2] The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

I looked at Lowes, but I did not feel comfortable about any of the options
there.  I know that the Swagelock company makes valves that are compatible
with anything.  I would like a swagelock-quality fitting on the metal tube
exiting the tank, if possible, full flow, such as a ball valve.  These are
also available with electrical actuators, but the cost is too much for me,
and the valve is probably too bulky.  I kinda like the valve shown here:

This is for a propane fueled engine, it should work for gasoline as well.
It can be wired to the ignition and to a hidden switch as a theft/teen
driver deterrent.
