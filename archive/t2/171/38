OK, I just thought I heard that dropped/pounded seats were
not rebuildable, but I can't remember who told me that or
where I may have heard it.  That's promising, as I think
one of my heads has the typical exhaust valve problem, or
possibly a similar problem as Troys, I figured I may have
to buy a new one (2 liter FI) as a worst case.
