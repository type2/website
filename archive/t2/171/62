Subject: Westy FS or trade.

I just picke up a Vanagon Westy and found that it
better suits or needs as a camper. In light of this I
have decided to part with my 74 Westy.  It is rust
free, except for some under the windshield, has an
1800 engine, brand new ICT Webers, new Boge shocks,
alll the camping equipment is there and working
including a new last year pop-top canvas.
It is not a show bus, but a good daily driver and
camper.
It could use some new seals in a few places and the
front seats are pretty sad but it is a good bus.

I am asking $2500 for it, I would consider trades of
any other VW vehicles, air or water cooled.

thanks,
