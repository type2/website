Yeah, but that doesn't really answer the question of whether _booster-equipped_ vehicles are undriveable without.  Man, I must be way stronger than I thought!  
Comes from supporting my fat *ss all these years, I guess.  Exercise your legs by being overweight - who'da thought?

Seriously, I don't remember my 68 westy being a toughie with all drums.  I understand the booster was added at least partly because of the front discs requiring more 
oomph.  But again, my 71 just doesn't feel like that big a deal without it.

Sounds like if I ever get my booster fixed I'll be flying through the windshield on a regular basis until I get used to it.  Great - those pesky bay windshield 
replacements, to boot.
