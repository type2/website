sure. here's what I did. Went to home depot & got 2 brass shut off
ball valves. (I believe they were 1/4" but may have been 3/8") I used
used hose bibb adapters to adapt the female pipe thread fitting in the
valve to the fuel line. Clamped it & have been very happy since. I put
them both just out of the fuel tank. It is quite tight up there to
shut them off, but it's not exactly something I do every week. If I
can, I'll see if I can put take some pics & then post them. But
essentially it was something like <$20 in parts for the whole setup. I
thought about using gas valves because of the much more compact handle
but couldn't find a size that I was happy with.
