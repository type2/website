Subject: Orientation of Vent Slot on Fan Housing Plate

T1 engine question:

On the outer plate that attaches to the generator and bolts into the fan housing, there is a vent slot to push air through the generator, I guess.  

What is the proper orientation of the slot:  up, down, driver side, passenger side?
