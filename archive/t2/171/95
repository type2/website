Subject: Re: [T2] engine stand

>Does anyone have any experience with the 750 pound
engine stand from Harbor Freight?  Seems like a good
price and shipping is only about $10.  Would I have
to fabricate/buy/modify anything to get this stand
to adapt to type 4 or type 1 engines?

Here'a a link to it:

It is a rinky dinky POS that is not very sturdy. Spend $10 more and get the
next bigger one. The 2 end wheels on the crossbar makes it a lot more rigid.
Here is the 1000 lb one:
