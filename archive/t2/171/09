Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Fill

I havent tried this on a westy or an bus .. but in the past on several 
vehicles i have removed the old fill hole and the short metal piece and 
replaced them from other vehicles.  May seem strange but i just grabbed 
whatever was handy and would fit. and the cap would fit.  The danger 
part is that you may have to remove the tank to safely fasten the new 
filler to the vehicle if it needs to be tack welded and i dont recommend 
using drills that close to an open tank hole.
