Subject: Horns Again

Hiya All,

I received some great advice from The List and I got my stock horn working 
just fine.  And I thought, "It would be nice to have dual horns."  Just stock 
horns, nothing fancy.  The advice from The List was to go with a relay - like 
in the aftermarket set-ups.  So I went out and got a dual horn 12v relay (431 
951 253H) at my FLAPS.  My problem now is hooking it up.  The wiring diagram 
on the side of this relay is pretty cryptic.  Here's what I've figured out 
from doing a little research..........

30  to fuse
86  to 30
87  to horns
85  to ground  (through horn button)

I know that somebody out there has to have covered this territory before me.  
Does this sound correct?
