Subject: Re: [T2] engine stand


The engine stand is usable in usually one of two ways.

method one (i have seen written but never used)
evidently the bell housing front from certain bus transmissions is in 
two pieces and will bolt up to the stand and then you bolt the engine to 
it as usual.

method two (the version i use)
I made an adapter for the pivot hole in the stand to a different size to 
take the commonly available insert from the bench top aircooled engine 
stand (holder)
