Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter Change - cutoff valve

I like Impco.  

I plan to convert my bus to to a SLEV (super low emission vehicle) running
on God's Gas at the next rebuild.  Impco has many of the needed parts
available.  I also want to figure out a way to make an air conditioner work
using the fuel as the refrigerant.
