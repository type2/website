Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injection question about 76 two liter 

I got two replies to my question, and want to use this opportunity to thank 
the people who helped solve the problem......Doctor Tim  and  Sean Bartnik. 
I replaced all the vacuum hoses, removed the valve that controls 
recirculated exhaust gases, cleaned it and made sure it functions the way I 
want it to, and I also removed the "S" shaped duct between the AFM and the 
throttle assembly and checked it for cracks. Sure enough, the duct had an 
inch long crack that circled the circumference, between the ridges of a 
lower segment.  Probably the villain in this story.

I tried an emergency repair on the cracked duct. I cleaned the crack with 
alcohol, basted the space between the ridges with catalyzed polyester body 
filler (sets in about 3 minutes), and then I ran two circles of rope around 
the duct at the level of the crack. These circles of rope ended up imbedded 
in the body filler, and the ropes were very effective in sealing and 
supporting the patency of the duct when this composite hardened.

Daylight ended about the time the duct was repaired, and I have yet to put 
the system back together and adjust it and test it. Tomorrow...

Again, grateful thanks to the people who pointed the way.

Sure sounds like you have a vacuum leak downstream of the air flow meter 
(AFM). That metal flap you're playing with is the AFM. Remove the big 
rubber duct it is connected to and make sure it isn't cracked on the 
backside. Verify the clamps are tight. Check the intake runner boots as 
well. Clamp them if they turn freely. Make sure the brake booster hose is 
hooked up and not holed or cracked. Then check also the hoses for the idle 
air bypass and the breather hose that connects to the big rubber duct. 
Verify the intake manifold bolts are tight. When you seal all the 
downstream air leaks then the metal flap will open as required to start and 
run. You then must have the mixture adjusted with a co meter.
Get a Bentley before going further if you don't already have one and want a 
chance to understand the system and it's components.
Good luck,

Doctor Tim
