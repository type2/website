Rob,

Just bought one like it at the local "Big Lots" place for $29.99 and it is 
a 1,000 lb.

Two things about it....it is very low for me(6' 4") and I am trying to 
figure out how to mount an engine to it also.  The places where you would 
attach the engine are very long(longer than the bottom stud on a t1 
engine).

I have cut mine off some, but still trying to figure out the 
attachment as it doesn't fit the case well at all because of the raised 
edge on the back side of T1 cases..

Someone else on the list bought one and was using it...wonder how they did 
it?

Cheers, dave
