Subject: The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

Hi,
Can anyone tell me a way to change my fuel filter without getting a full
stream of gas pouring out onto my chest from the fuel tank line?  Out of all
the jobs one has to do on a bus, I dislike this one the most.  Nothing I use
ever closes that line completely shut, and I always end up soaked in gas -
every time.  Plus, the fact that there is so little arm room under there (I
don't jack up the bus for this) makes it hard to manuever and get outta the
way in the first place.  I'd sure like to know of a better way, because I am
tired of waiting months for my clothes to not smell like gas anymore after
each filter change.  Thanks!
