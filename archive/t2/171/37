I've seen this comment several places and I just don't get it.  I've been driving my '71 Westy without the booster for several years and yes, it certainly doesn't feel 
like power brakes, but it's not a big deal.  FWIW, I'm not ripped and buff, and my right leg is only marginally larger than my left one. :-)

Seriously, have you guys experienced dead-booster buses as being hard to brake?

(My daughter does say the pedal is a tough one, and I'd sure love to have a working booster, but they ain't cheap....)
