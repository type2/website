Subject: Gas Fill

Greetings All!

I just need some advise on what to do with the gas fill on my '72 Westy.  Not 
the tube itself, there's been enough already written about that, but the top 
where the cap seals it.  Mine, in the years before I bought it, had been 
banged up and deformed so much that the cap no longer seals and I have gas 
come out when I turn left.

Any ideas?
