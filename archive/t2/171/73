Subject: I need a good engine/ High Country/ Revisions

Hello List,

Well, I thought I would post this again seing as many
people don't read the lists' posts durring the
weekend. I am in need of a good 2L engine for my bus.
I am changing what I am looking for a bit. It doesn't
have to have FI on it. I really need a complete long
block. I have a fan shroud, alternator, dizzy , and
most of an FI system already. I need a long block that
would be good for a daily driver. I need one that has
relitively low miless perferably 100,000 miles or
less, no more than 150,000 miles. I am looking for an
engine that doesn't burn or leak oil. I have made up
my mind and I will be going to High Country Bus
festivlle so if you are planning to go and have an
engine like this that you wouldn't mind selling me,
please email me. If you are not planing to go to High
Country and live within 200-300 miles from me, I will
be able to pick it up. Thanks again!
