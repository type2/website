Subject: Fuel Filter Change - cutoff valve

I would like to post a BIG thank you to who ever posted the cutoff valve 
link to IMPCO.

At $26 it is the perfect line lock for the gas line. Be aware that they 
have one rated for gasoline and one for propane. Excellent fire protection 
AND theft protection!

The main site has their catalog for download on .pdf format. Great for 
those of us who collect info for later.
