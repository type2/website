Subject: Re: [T2] The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

I use small/medium sized needle nose vice grips with tape over the 
grooves to protect the hose and then clip on the hoses with just enough 
pressure to shut of the fuel flow.
Excess pressure or forgetting to tape up the teeth on the pliers means 
new hose.  The do make professional clips for the job as well but never 
saw the need for another tool in my rather massive inventory.
