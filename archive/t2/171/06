Subject: low oil pressure

Great and Powerful list

Was taking the 74 out for a cruise to see how she ran in 90 degree temps.
Engine temps were ranging from 230 to 250 after 1 hour of cruising at 60 to
65 or so. The problem being was at stop lights the oil pressure would drop
down to 10 psi and I had to feather the throttle to keep the idiot light
off. Cruising the psi wanted to hang around 20 to 25 psi after she was
warmed up. I searched the archives to see what the correct psi should be and
sunk a dry well. I assume its running low. Does anyone have a guess on what
may be the cause? Other than this the engine is running great.

Any advice would be most appreciated....Dana
