A mechanic showed me a neat trick to prevent this. Tie a rag around your
forearm, and the gas runs down your arm, but can't get past the rag to
your armpit.  When I do it I use this trick, and have my pencil ready in
one hand to plug up the hole.  Works pretty well, but I think a shutoff
valve here is a great idea, and next time I change the fuel filter I just
may install one. :)
