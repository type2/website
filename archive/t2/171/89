You can get it down to a fine art.  I built a simple ramp out of wood and
carried it with me at all time so I could drive a rear wheel up on it.

First, do it with the tank almost empty.  Get a $2 plastic pump from pep
boys if you don't feel like driving around first.

I've found a pair of yellow rubber dish gloves works well with a long
sleeved work shirt.  My dad got gas all over his arms once as it ran down
and his skin flaked and turn red for a couple of weeks.

I think these fuel hose clamps are safer than vise-grips...
