This bolt is truly a PITA, I have removed T1 engines from 4 different buses I've owned, and only 1 out of the 4 even had this bolt present, I guess the PO's knew it was a pain and just left it off when they re-installed. Anyway, try taking off the rear drivers side wheel and get to the bolt through the wheel well, this worked for me.
