This is the reason for problems getting correct tires for the westies.  
Standard 14 inch tires do not meet the load requirement.  It must be 92 
load rated.  Note that when you go to 15 inch tires with the new 
minimums for dot a while back most basic 15 inch tires meet the 
requirements plus a lower profile (65 vs 75).  Then the problem of 
wheels that will work.   Read the wheel manufacturers notes carefully.  
I have found that most 15" rims with conservative patterning (more metal 
less hole) will work if in the new audi pattern.
