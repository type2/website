Dana asked "I searched the archives to see what the
correct psi should be and
sunk a dry well. I assume its running low. Does anyone
have a guess on what
may be the cause? Other than this the engine is running
great."

What kind of oil are you running?  

In the summer I use 15W50 (if I can find it) or 20W50
(which is more common). But then this is Canada and it
doesnt get too warm here in the summmer either. If you
go by the owners manual:90F needs SAE40.  If you are
running 10W30, please change it asap (I emplore you)

I switch to 10W30 or 5W30 for winter driving (easier
starts at -20C).
