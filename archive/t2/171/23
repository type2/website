The bow's don't attach to the body, only the headliner itself. They =
simply run through the loops sewn into the headliner. Make sure you have =
the rubber ends on the end of the bows to stop any rattling later on. I =
glued mine on just to make sure they stay there. The rear most bow (if =
you have a full headliner in a bus) hooks to the cross member in the =
roof at the rear hatch (there should be some metal tabs in the cross =
member). From there it's just a matter of putting the end of each bow on =
the edge in the body work where the roof meets the walls. The bows just =
float there so you can pull the head liner tight as you move forward =
gluing the headliner to the edges.
Unfortunately I didn't take any photo's of the installation, but it =
wasn't all that difficult.
