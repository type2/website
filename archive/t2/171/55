I especially like the part when it runs down
your arm into your armpit.

I have a set of old coveralls hanging in my shop
that are used just for this purpose.  There's
someone on the list that mentioned that they had
installed shut-off valves to make engine removal
easier, maybe you can put one between the tank
and the filter.=20
