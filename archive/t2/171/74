Subject: engine drop & tin

Hello All,

We spent some time this week pulling the engine from my '83 vanagon.  Things
are going well and we are taking lots of pictures.  Things have progressed
well, but we are kind of stuck removing the upper bolts holding the engine
to the tranny.  The drivers side nut seems pretty inaccessible.  Anybody
have any advice here?  At this point I am not going to pull the transmission
along with it, but I may have to.

Also I'm really not happy with the condition of the tin.  The firewall tin
is bent to hell, and the stuff on the bottom is rusted very badly.  I think
I can repair some of it but I am definitely going to have to replace some of
it.  Bus boys lists the items I need in their catalog.  Any other suggestions?
Bus Depot doesn't have it, unfortunately.

thanks,
