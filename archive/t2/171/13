Hey all:
Remember my "lean" miss.

Just say vacuum leaks. What have I learned here?  I
have learned that when all the vacuum leaks are fixed
the engine has a little different sound (no whistling).

Reset the timing today (no easy task let me tell you,
four year old under the dash in the fuse block!). Runs
lots better, just need a new timing scale (my plastic
one is wrecked!)


Thanks to all that chimed in
Logan
