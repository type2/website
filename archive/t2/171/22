 Volks, I've asked before to no response...

 Can someone help me with my headliner?
I want to put a headliner in my Kombi but I don't=20
know how the bows attach to the body.

Do Kombis NOT have some holes or tabs?

Does anyone have pics of a bus after the vinyl
headliner was removed?

Can anyone relay any tips on headliner installation?
Books?... Videos?

 Comments, clich=E9s, Commentary?

Thanks, Jack
