Subject: Fuel return line on fuel injection 1700

I removed the pollution control "spider" from my gas
tank on my 1973 bus. I put rubber caps on the two
tubes that stick out of the tank where the spider used
to be. Suppose I did install a fuel injection
system... Could I install the fuel return line in one
of those two tubes that stick out?
                                    Thanks,
                                    Paul Deatherage
