Ball valves have a seal.  Hardware store ball valves can be had that are
resistant to fuels.

However, it would be much better to have a valve that screwed into the
outlet, because if you have hose between the valve and tank you're back to
the same problem when the time comes to replace it.  Does the splittie
reserve valve fit on a bay?
