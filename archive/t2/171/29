T4 head experts....advice?

Troy's picture here www.wicals.com/troy/vw/drop/huh
Number 698 and 699.  

Is this what t4 heads do when you talk about the 
seats failing??  I am still wondering about the ones on
my 78 and how soon I will open it up and look.

I am used to T1 engines where they just break and fall of into the 
combustion chamber.

BTW...great pics Troy!

Cheers, dave
