A cool offer to Rob and the list;

I have the opposite situation, bought a 79 bus that the p.o. stole the engine out of for his better 76 bus which had factory ac. I got the bus and the blown engine which came with the factory compressor attached.

Planned on Ebarfing it, but it didn't happen.

50$ + shipping, mounting brackets, fan hub attachment and decent belt included, reserved for Rob first, should he desire it.
