In the dark times when the gas tank was the bane on my existence, I had one
of these valves installed between the tank and the filter.  When I
ressurrected my bus a couple of months ago I remove the valve because no
fuel was coming out and I noticed that the seal has disintegrated.

You can find shut off valves specifically made for fuel.  I will put one on
the next time I have to change the filter.
