I go to Friedel's in Renton. Just 1/2 mile off
405 at the S curves exit 4B/A.
He is in the book... also just rebuilt my 74. Been
going there for about 20 years now. Not the cheapest
but one of the best IMHO and honest!

<<<<Can someone recommend a shop in the Seattle area.
I'm looking to
get the exhaust gas analized for emission testing and
the damn ticking
noise diagnosed.
Thanks, Craig in Seattle w/two Liter FI>>>>>>>>
