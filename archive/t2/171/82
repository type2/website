In following with fuel shut off valves, don't ball valves not have a seal, unlike other types, therefore not giving you the disintegrated seal problems?  Not that gas-specific valves are a bad idea of course.

First:

Went to home depot & got 2 brass shut off ball valves.

Second:

I removed the valve because no fuel was coming out and I noticed that the seal has disintegrated.

You can find shut off valves specifically made for fuel.  I will put one on the next time I have to change the filter.
