Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Wiper Tank/Hose Leak

If it is anything like i just did on my 82 westy, it isnt fun.  the one 
on my drivers side was a pain to repair and then to get the hose out for 
the passenger side was worse.  I ended up doing a lot of dissassembly 
and 4 bandaids.  Mine ran right under the dash right below the 
windshield with the line from the tank coming up just to the inside of 
the driver side spray to a tee fitting.  My hose was so brittle that 
fixing on section broke the next.
