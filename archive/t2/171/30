Looks like the engine that head came off of was run hard and put out wet
to dry---

Them seats aren't dropped, they are pounded out !!

Wow, talk about being in a recession !!-:>)

Later,

Terry

T4 head experts....advice? 
Troy's picture here www.wicals.com/troy/vw/drop/huh Number 698 and 699. 
Is this what t4 heads do when you talk about the seats failing?? I am
still wondering about the ones on my 78 and how soon I will open it up
and look. 
I am used to T1 engines where they just break and fall of into the
combustion chamber. 
BTW...great pics Troy! 
Cheers, dave
