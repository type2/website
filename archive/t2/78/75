Hi Guys

Everyone is invited to Join the trip from Southern Ontario to North Carolina,,
or to Eastern Ontario.

I am going to post 2 pages for campouts ,basically to promote the Cara"bus"
trip.. so if anyone knows when they are going,,let me know.. I will post it to
the page,, 

email me directly jrivers at globalserve dot net

I have found this type of page handy at the last minute,, a person can check the
page, and find out who and where to connect with others on their way,,

nothing real interesting there yet,, bookmark it if you think your going and
check back , or tell me you want updates
