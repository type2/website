If shipping is a hundred dollars, it may be worth it, just to get a kit.

I've looked into doing something like this myself, using my old front belts. 
(I replaced my front belts with retracting belts from a Beetle.) Presumably 
there's some major drilling involved; otherwise, I just don't see how it 
could mount. Even if you anchor it beneath the seats, and use a loop device 
over the shoulder (as I've seen in a few vehicles), it requires some dodgy 
jury-rigging that just doesn't seem entirely safe to me. Has anybody else 
undertaken a project like this? I'd love to put shoulder belts on all my 
seats, if I could see a way to do it.
