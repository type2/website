It's probably the steel that has the magnetic field.  Sometimes when 
you heat up steel to red-hot it will align with the earth's magnetic 
field.  Strange but true...

I use brazing when I repair holes in heat exchangers.  I cut a patch, 
lay it over the hole, and braze it all around.  Not pretty, but it 
works, and nothing beats OEM heat exchangers!
