Hiya All,

In disassembling the Duck for an upcoming paint job I ran into something I 
thought was rather odd.  Perhaps one of you Busexperts out there can 
explain.........

I pulled out the rear seat seatbelts.  The bolts out of the body were the 
original Repa 8.8s.  17mm heads.  I went to chase the threads and none of my 
metric dies would fit.  Lo and behold a 7/16 coarse did the job.  

So, what's the deal here?  Metric heads and standard threads?  What gives?
