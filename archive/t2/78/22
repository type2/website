Subject: 3 pt rear seat belts (was "Just Kampers")

I have done this for the rear seat of my 78 Westy, which now sports a
full width 74 seat/bed.  (I can suppy a pic if asked). The stock front
seatbelts will fit fine in the rear, using the stock mountings under the
seat and the shoulder mount found just beneath the window sill behind
the seat on each side.
You will find a plug in the holes with a giant philips slot in the
center.  In the 78 Westy, the driver side plug is hidden behind the
closet wall and I used a hole saw to expose it.  The shoulder belt holes
are low and the passenger must be careful to not let it slip down off
the shoulder.
