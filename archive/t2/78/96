Subject: emulsion tubes wanted

... those lil buggers that reside just under the carb top, right underneath
the choke butterfly.
i have a 30pict1 that i want to do some jet twiddlin' on, but the 'biggest'
emulsion tube i have is a 135z;
i am looking for sizes from 140 to 170, 'y' or 'z.'  the tubes increase in
number by jumps of 5, ie 140,145,150.

my local salvage yard charges $5 when he has 'em, i am willing to pay a
little more for your efforts in digging em outta your parts piles.

i know the main jets to some mikuni motorcycle carbs are straight swaps for
solex jets (tho they may flow just a tad richer) - anyone know if the
emulsion tubes are the same?


please reply via pmail.
