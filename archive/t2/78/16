Subject: CAD files in the archive idea

 
--Rob says his site will offer .dwg and .plt files IIRC, and there is strong support of .pdf files also.

Why not offer the pdf. file from the same place, which will be democratic, and require some admin. volunteer time. I run autocad, but I don't know how to convert to .pdf.

and/or: post the link to the "volo view" download so folks can see the .dwg's if they want to go that way. Most of us who will be drawing will be using the .dwg format I would guess.

can we get this whole affair on type2.com?

We'll need standardized title blocks with pertinent info so these drawings don't become useless if revised later.

Billy
