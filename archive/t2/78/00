Subject: PARTS FOR SALE

After finishing a 73 rebuild I have the following extra parts to sell so I
can afford the insurance.  If you would like anything and are concerned
about the quality I can send digital pictures.  Also if you want something
as a core to be rebuilt I could send it to your rebuilder and if it is
rejected than no charge.
