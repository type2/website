Jamie and list,
    Jamie rivers recently posted "Everyone is invited to Join the trip from
Southern Ontario to North Carolina..."
I would have loved to join you for the trip south Jamie.  I went in 2000 and
had a great time.  I was planning to go again this year, but just today
found out that I won't be able to get that weekend off from work. This is
one campout I recommend to everyone who can go.  Guess I'm feeling just a
little sorry for myself about the fact that I won't be able to go.  I'm
already waiting to hear trip reports and see pictures :-(
