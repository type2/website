I'm afraid I've never done this, but it sounds like a very workable, very 
good idea to me. My own project this summer involves chopping my z-bed in a 
very similar way; cutting out a middle section of it and re-attaching the 
sides, to shorten it so that I can put my sink next to it, in the rear. It's 
a mad scheme, but carefully executed, I think both our plans would work well 
and result in a pair of very nice custom campers.
