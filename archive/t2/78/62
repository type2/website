Hi Volks,

When I put together my Westfakia last summer, I modified the Z-Bed to go
full width, and tossed out the closet and cabinet that blocked the view out
the passenger side rear window. With the spare relocated onto the nose I
have the roomiest VW rear bedroom I know of.

This winter Collison Corner and I are helping Adam Narraway get his 68 westy
on the road in time to join the Carabus to EveryBus 2002. It's a joint
project  being worked on in the garage at Collie's.

Adam wants to cut the top off of the closet/cupboard unit in his westy and
shorten it down enough so that it won't block the passenger side rear
window. This way it will still provide some storage space and will also
allow lots of light and visibility. It seems like all we will have to do is
take a saw to the cabinets and splice the top back into the remaining
cabinets...

Anybody seen or done this before? It seems like a good idea to me since it
avoids the expensive issue of re-upholsering the Z-bed and finding spacer
cushions for the gaps in the rear deck. And since Adam has a tight budget
for this project every $ we save on this is a $ closer to EB2002.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
