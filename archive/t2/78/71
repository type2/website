The Coil over shock is a great feature,, My 74 Westy had factory ones on it for
at least the 100k miles with me driving,, and I suspect they were there for the
140k miles the original owner drove it,

I just replaced them ,, I didn't even check if they were available at the
Dealer,, as I got a pair that fit Mid 80's  Astro Van rear ,, specifically 1986
Chev Astro ,, you do need to add a spacer to the top of the Chev shocks,, I
think I used a 10 mm nut with the threads drilled out,

I found that the rear of my camper lifted 1/2" and sits level at the sliding
door now.  It takes about 1 hr to install the shocks,, and probably all day to
do the torsion re-adjusting

On a side note,, I was into off road racing for years, and tried coil overs
,,etc,on a BAJA BUG, As a mechanic at a foriegn car shop etc,, I never saw a
busted shock mount from any type of abuse.

I have one experience with a torsion bar in a BUG that snapped soon after it was
re-adjusted,, but I have only re-adjusted about 20 sets 

I do know one bus that was adjusted using the horizon in the mirror as a
guideline,, and it is twitchy to drive now ,, I suspect the front end has no, or
negative camber now. 

I never recommend torsion adjustment on a Bus unless it is way low,, YMMV
