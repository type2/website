In Brazil, VW recently ended production of its "combi,"
otherwise known as the Microbus (and in Germany as the
"bulli"). The loaf-shaped, air-cooled van, officially
called the T2, was the successor of the original bus
sketched in 1947 by Ben Pon, the first American importer of
VW Beetles, and produced in 1950. In the 1960's, the bus
became a hippie clich=E9, chugging to rock concerts in
psychedelic paint jobs.=20

In Europe and the United States, the bus was succeeded by
the T3 of 1980 and the water-cooled Vanagon of 1993. The
Brazil factory was the last source of the T2, which has
been recently sold only in Latin America.=20

"Adios Combi" said headlines on VW advertisements in
Mexico. The ads might have worn a tear, as did the cartoon
bus in ads that VW ran after the 1995 death of Jerry Garcia
of the Grateful Dead.=20

Across the Atlantic, a Volkswagen subsidiary, Bentley
Motors, has polished off a state limousine for Queen
Elizabeth II. It will be the first Bentley owned by the
Royal Family, which since the 1950's has relied on a series
of Rolls-Royce Phantoms for state occasions. (Even those
were radical departures, since the Queen's father and
grandfather preferred cars from Daimler, an old British
company that was later taken over by Jaguar, now owned by
Ford.)=20

The Bentley will be used on formal occasions. Other
transport in the Buckingham Palace garages includes three
Daimler DS420 limousines, a favorite of the Queen Mother.
Queen Elizabeth is believed to lease a Daimler version of
the Jaguar XJ8 sedan.=20
The new car is a gift from Bentley and British parts
suppliers for the queen's golden jubilee in June. Experts
say the one-of-a- kind Bentley would cost at least
$750,000.=20
