Subject: starter needed, also interchange

I need a starter for a 76 Non Pop westy.  A used one would be ok as I don't 
think the old one is completely shot.  But the inspection is coming up on it 
and I need a starter to get it over to the shop to do the bearings and 
windshield etc....  As well if you all could verify the years that a starter 
could come from I would look in the yards in the mean time.......
