And therein lies the problem. Not everyone uses the 185R14 that VW
originally put on the bus. Many people use a slightly larger tire.  In order
to accommodate a wide range of busses,  bus tire covers do tend to be just
slightly larger than what would be absolutely neccessary for a
"fits-like-a-glove" fit on a 185R14.  Otherwise, half of the bus owners
couldn't use them.  I guess it's in the eye of the beholder; I didn't find
it too baggy on my bus when I used it with a stock tire, and I haven't had
any other complaints out of the few hundred I sell a year. In fact, some
vendors sell bus tire covers that are noticable larger than mine (for no
good reason in my opinion).

However...
I will be getting a small shipment of tire covers from a new supplier whom I
am trying out,  in a couple of weeks.  Who knows, perhaps they are slightly
smaller, perhaps not.  (Although I can't say I particularly want them to be,
as I am happy with the size we're shipping now).  In any event, I'll post a
follow-up once I look them over.
