Before you start dismantling things, this is a good place to start. It takes 
quite a bit of driving (especially on the bus' small alternator) to build up 
a full charge on a battery. Even an hour or two commute to work won't do it. 
It may well get you just enough charge to start the car again (does on a 
Saab, at least), but the battery will not be fully charged.

To get it up to full, your best bet is a charger, or even a whole new 
battery. I had the same problem with my bus, and it was a bum battery which 
seemed to leak charge. To where, I don't even know. It would lose charge 
disconnected and sitting on rubber, which in my limited grasp of science I 
believe is outside of the laws of physics. I blamed it, ultimately, on 
leprechauns.

I can't wait. I'm converting my hardtop westy into a real camper (ie, with 
camping gear, instead of just a cabinet under the z-bed and a nice logo), 
and I can't get enough of looking at other campers to get ideas...
