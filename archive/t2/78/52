Hiyo

The bumper on the back of my Bus is a bit bent, and I wonder if anyone has
had the opportunity to have a Bus bumper straightened.  It is a 76.

This is a chrome bumper(at least it looks chrome) with a big thick black
rubstrip on it.  To tell you the truth, I don't think I've ever seen another
Bus with bumpers like this.  Is it worth trying to straighten?  Is there a
source for new "chrome" bumpers?

As always, thanks.
