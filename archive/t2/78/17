You must have met some pretty BIG people!,,  :-) I have tried with the biggest
sledge hammer,, and hitting as hard as I can to try and remove a stuck drum,,
then ended up cutting it in half with a torch,,

the ones that i did persuade off with a hammer were not damaged and worked quite
well,,, 

You actually managed to Bust a Vw drum into pieces by hitting the rim area??
