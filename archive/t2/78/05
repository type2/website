Well I hate to, but I have to disagree here becuase I don't want someone
else to be unhappy.

I ordered the "white with black piping" spare tire cover from Bus Depot and
it does NOT fit good. It is too big around for the stock 14" tire on my '72
and looks baggy. It is not a snug fit.

On a positive note Bus Depot now sells the Vanagon scissor jack that will
work on your bus and much better than stock. If you aren't going original I
would recomend it.

From their website:


Genuine VW scissors jack - fits stock jackpoints but much more stable than
orig style! Depot exclusive! (Not for Vanagon w/plastic rocker moldings)
click for picture $34.95  $0.00  237 011 031


They also got my last order out within 3 days, and all parts there (after I
called and made them swear they had the parts in stock). I had bad
experiences with them before. This time I checked 4 different suppliers. Bus
Depot had the best price on everything, but only 1/2 was in stock. I only
ordered what they had in stock and got the rest from GoWesty. I was pleased
this time around.
