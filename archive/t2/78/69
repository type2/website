I made a run from Connecticut to Utah last summer, and it wasn't bad. I'll 
be making the same trip in reverse this summer. Here's what I did:

I "camped" in the parking lots of busy hotels. I've done this several times, 
in all manner of vehicles, and never been bothered once, by brigands or 
hotel workers. I'm not nice-looking retired couple, either; I'm a 
dodgy-looking kid. I suppose they were glad just to not have me inside the 
hotel.

It would have been nice to have all the camping gear. I had to eat at fast 
food restaurants, and that's a bad thing to do on trips that long. Made me 
sick. Bring lots of food, or shop for good food... I suppose it's a given 
that you've got cooking gear in your camper, but just in case: you may 
regret it if you don't.

As far as personal security goes, you have to be careful. Weapon laws vary 
from state to state. Since you're starting in Canada, I don't think you need 
to worry about hand gun laws (I'm under the impression citizens can't carry 
them, there). Personally, I keep a Louisville slugger at hand in the 
vehicle, and a good lock blade pocket knife in my pocket. I've also got a 
nice sword, but police /really/ don't like to see that kind of thing, so I 
display it on my wall at home, not my car.

All that said, I'm a pretty shifty looking fellow. It's a totally different 
effect to see an angry, sleep deprived kid brandishing a weapon than an 
older man, and it may not do you a whole lot of good. I don't like hoping 
that police or other help will arrive in a timely fashion, though. Good 
locks are, of course, your first line of defense. A quick 911 call by one of 
you while the other, God willing, scares the idiots off would help. Most 
people breaking into a microbus are expecting stoned hippies, after all, not 
some crazy guy with a baseball bat or a knife.

And, having said all that, use it as a last resort. Camp in the driveways of 
AIRS list members and you'll feel (and be) a lot safer.
