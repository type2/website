Subject: swivel seat conversion kit

hello all,

my friend is zany for swivel seats. i can get shreaks
of excitement out of her with just the statement,
"swivel seats". she is so nutty for this amenity that
she has offered to buy me the swivel seat conversion
kit from eurocampers. will this work in a bay? does
any one have experience with this? i know that it is
meant for vanagons, which is why is ask. i would hate
to have my friend waste her money, so any input will
be greatly appreciated!
