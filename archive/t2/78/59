Subject: Looking for a Weber progressive and parts shops in the Naples Fl. area + more

Hi all,

The subject says it all. Anyone out there have a good used Weber =
progressive they want to unload for a fair price? I'm planning to put it =
on my =B472 Westy (1600) which is currently undergoing major =
restoration. Also, does anyone know any good parts shops in the Naples, =
Fl. area? My dad just moved down there and I'm planning a visit in the =
near future. Please p-mail with any replies.

For those of you who may be interested and weren't deterred by the =
subject line I'll give a little update of my =B472 westy restoration =
project:

It's early days in the teardown phase right now and I'm trying to =
localize all the rust areas that will need to be attended to. The Westy =
interior has been removed so I could check out the floor and I have =
started pulling all the exterior stuff of as well (I'll be painting the =
entire bus exterior.) This thing is definitely rustier than my other =
=B472. I've got rust on both the drivers and passenger floor (patches =
roughly 6x6 inches) and some small areas in the main passenger floor =
near by the sliding door. It is also starting at the welding points for =
the seat belts in the back as well. Other areas needing attention are =
all along the lower front behind the bumper (new metal needed ), drivers =
foot step (new metal), battery tray (minor holes=3Dpatch) and a small =
rusthole on the front beam (it's very small but I'm not thrilled to have =
found it.) Anyway all this will be replaced with good metal. Engine =
removal is in progress because I want to detail it a bit as well as make =
access to the battery tray easier. I also want to take a look at the gas =
tank and make sure everything there is as it should be. The P.O. =
butchered the wiring harness back there so a new one is on the list.  =
Otherwise, mechanically things look pretty good. I've got the typical =
oil leaks to be addressed while the engine is out but other than that =
nothing major-Yet!
I'm getting ready to pull the lock on the sliding door-any tips there =
are welcome...

I'll add more as I progress with the project.

TIA,

John B.
