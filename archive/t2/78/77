Subject: got the old Cv/axle off, step 2?

ok, so I have the old one off. The CV that connects to the tranny has dried
hardened grease on the place where the CV mounts - apparently it dried up
and may have been the cause for its going bad, it wasn't secured perfectly
to the plate either before I even loosened - allowing a little play....

anyway I have a new axle with cv's on it ready to go in, but should I be
scraping that older dry grease off of the mounting plate first, or applying
it both the cv's and the mounting plates before I mount the new one?


Thanks for any tips....
