Hi Ian,

I agree.

this is where you have to be careful. I have seen
people bust drums into pieces when using a BFH in the
wrong place on them. the only place you should hit a
drum with a hammer is BETWEEN THE LUG STUDS. dont hit
the lug studs either or else you'll have a heard time
getting the lugnuts back on, and may warp the hub
beneath them if they are composite drums (hub seperate
from drum). otherwise you may definitely warp your
drum (which will cause a pulsating brake pedal) or
bust it apart.

>If this does not loosen it up then you've got to work

lines.

the other thing i would try is taking the wheel off
them put 2 adjacent lug nuts back on. put a pry bar or
somthing between the 2 lug nuts and stand/jump on the
end of it (hold on to something) or beat the prybar
with a sledge hammer to break free. not really sure if
someone in the bus pumping the pedal would really
help, but couldnt hurt.

whatever you do, dont spray penetrant or ANYTHING
inside the drum unless you feel like replacing the
contaminated shoes. this will cause grabby brakes.

just my $.04

peace!
