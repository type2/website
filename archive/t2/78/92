I have enough trouble in winter getting my oil temp over 212 with the
stock system-which you need to get the corrosive water vapor driven out
of your oil.  In my high milage Westy, driving over 2 hrs at about 60-65
mph gets it up to just around 212, with nice oil pressure of 30 (in
summer it's 240+ deg and 20 psi! Adding oil coolers doubling as heat
exchangers would make this concern worse!
