My bus is like this.  The cabinets were cut off in such a way that
they are level with the top of the z-bed when it is in the "seat" position.

A partition was placed in the middle of the existing cabinet to partition
it into two equal sides, then a top was placed on it with hinges
so it might open towards the seat.

To be honest, I'm not sure if it is the original cabinet cut down, or
if it is just a well constructed replacement.  If it's a well constructed
replacement, the person did a good job as none of the wood is mismatched.
