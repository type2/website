Half fast, half rust.
Did I miss something?  Is there anything on this bus that would warrant =
a=20
$1195.00 price tag?  Serious rust, dents, crappy dash, no rear seats (or =

anything else in the back except junk) blocks in front of and behind  =
the tires
(does the E-brake work?), no bumpers.  I suppose the engine and tranny =
are=20
worth something, but $1200.00?  What a joke.
But, hey, those windows look pretty nice.
