     Basically, everything a Body Shop deals with is thought in terms of time 
and what a shop can save in time, equals money in their back pocket.  Hence a 
lot of shops cut corners, especially if they have a lot of cars due Friday 
afternoon.  In terms of cutting and buffing, cars have more visible flat 
surface area, hood, roof, trunk, whereas the roof on trucks and buses is 
rarely seen, so they skip it.  If a shop is really in a hurry to get things 
out sometimes they will only cut and buff the upward facing surfaces, 
skipping the lower part of fenders doors and rocker panels.  Let's face it, 
the is a lot of surface area on a bus, and just to buff and entire bus takes 
a good 3.5 hours and this isn't counting the color sanding.  A good detailer 
or painter can cut and buff a car in about an hour and a half.  So you can 
see the extra time a bus takes actually costs the shop money.  In fact, 
finding a body shop that will do a complete paint on a Bus is getting harder 
and harder to find.  Most shops can fix most fender benders in a 3 day turn 
around, making a $1000 or more and they can turn out a good 5 to 6 a week per 
body tech.  So complete paint jobs on buses ranks fairly low on their list.  
If you play with a lot of VWs it may be in your best interest to learn how to 
do your own.  A nice cut and buff on a used Bug can up the price a $1000, not 
bad money for an afternoons work.
