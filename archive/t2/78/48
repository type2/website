Don't know what your local equivalent would be, but check out a computer
repair/salvage joint for 12V dc "muffin" fans. I've got a pair of 'em nicely
(but not necessary) mounted to the top of my dash. Mine are 6 inch dia-
meter and really help defrost/demist the top of my winshield. I'm not 
that tall -6'1"- but I'm sure others suffer the same discomfort of try-
ing to view through the lower half of the windshield. The fans won't add
any heat to your system but even a little heat with the increased air-
flow should help speed up the defrosting...
