I'd love to hear if this kind of madcap scheme actually works. Right now I'm 
thinking of a propane heater, so the (hypothetical, as of yet unpurchased) 
tank can double for heat and cooking. I just got back from a 30 minute drive 
in middle of the night Utah winter weather; it took close to 20 just to 
defog the windows completely. When I got out to the vehicle, there was frost 
not only on the outside, but the /inside/ of the windshield, which I have 
never seen before in my life. Luckily, after a bit of driving, I reached the 
comfortably numb phase where you can no longer feel the cold, and shortly 
after that, a nice warm wave passed over me as my body passed through the 
numb stage into the so-cold-it-burns phase.

Who needs more than the stock heater when the body provides such a 
remarkable system of its own?
