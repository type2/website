It does not matter if it is a non-pop top or a pop top......
What matters is:
What engine do you have?
What transmission do you have?

If it is a 2.0L with a 4 speed, it uses a 76-83 starter. You can spot it by the
starter drive. The drive will have a blank section 1/2" long between the gear
teeth and the Sprague clutch.
[the teeth are farther out]
If it is a 1600 or a 1.8L with a 4 speed, it uses the same starter as a bug. The
teeth on the stater drive will be next to the Sprague clutch. No space.
If it is a 2.0L with an auto trans, it uses a self-supporting starter. This
self-supporting starter can be used on 1600's, 1.7's, and 1.8's with a 4 speed
but cannot be used on a 76 and up 2.0L 4 speed. It will not reach the teeth on
the flywheel.
