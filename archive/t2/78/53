That's great. Consult the archives for things to look for in this arena.

Other than this community of bus owners, I have never run across anyone
who understands the FI system. For these people it's easier to just say
VW didn't know what they were doing so I'm putting on carbs. Once again
there are many rants pro/con in the archives on this very thing. Here is
my take. A carb system is almost all (if not completely) mechanical in
design, with many mechanically enclined people used to working on them.
When things go out/break there is usually tale-tale signes before that
should be heeded. Also these systems usually are cheaper in the
beginning. FI systems are a horse of a different color. When they work
they work much better than a carb system. They do have the stigma for
being very buggy. I don't believe this to be true. Unlike carb system
joe "been wurkin' on bugs fur 20 yurs" can't just turn mixture screws
etc to get it to run if there is a problem. He has to know what is wrong
by following a standard procedure (such as in Bentley). The other down
side of an electrically controlled system, is that many things that
break (+20 yr systems here) just go. That is to say a lot of electrical
components fail with outh warning. These FI systems also have an
initially higher cost due to all the extra stuff that comes w/ it.

Consult the archives, but it will be somewhat pricy unless you can find
a doner bus that has the parts you need. I'll defer to more
knowledgeable people here.

Up to you, but I can say that a well kept up FI system is nice.
