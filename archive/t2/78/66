Subject: Advice neaded,

Hi Folks,

 I will be  taking a trip across the U.S.A  and Canada  at the end of
February . I live in Quebec
Canada near the Vermont border. I would like to drive south to Florida
first, then across to California
 then up the west coast to Vancouver Canada and back to Quebec.

 This being  my first long trip in my 1975 newly restored  Westy. I
would really appreciate it  if
 any of you experienced folks would give me advice as to where I could
camp cheaply while on the road, (newly retired couple) and what to look
for as far as security

 I am quite comfortable with the possible mechanical problem since I
spent the last 2 years
 restoring the van. I also am a new member of the airs list (note posted
yet) and I will carry a copy of
 the list with me on the road.
