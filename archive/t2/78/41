I'd love to see some of these broken torsion bars.  My bus has over 
100K miles, including a lot of dirt, since I readjusted my original, 
stock bars and they still haven't broken.  Neither have any other 
readjusted bars I've heard of on the list.  Has anyone here personally 
broken a readjusted torsion bar?
