David,

I've been caught out like this myself on occasion and I blame myself for not getting in line and placing the order earlier.  There are a lot of bus owners out there buying up this stuff.

When I am dilligent, I sometimes can't win either:  e.g. I received an email from California Imports telling me a part was in stock but they sold out in between the time they sent the notification and when I acutally read the email and called them back to order.

Bus Depot has been pretty good to me.  Many thanks to Ron and Cheri for answering all my questions.  I've only had one missing item incident, a hose, and it arrived promptly shortly afterwards when I mentioned it to them.  I've sent back a couple of items because the catalog wasn't quite right (IMHO there is a 76-79 accelerator pedal) but store credit was granted no questions asked.

I even received a call at home from them one time asking me if I wanted Mexican mirrors because the German ones were out of stock again.

I wish I lived that close to them.

BTW, I found a new supplier the other day.  Their catalog will be ready in 4-6 weeks I believe.
