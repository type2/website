and remember we are trying to keep 25-40year old equipment running
avaliablity is sometimes spotty...while I am about as demanding as they
come but I also run a business too and try to keep in mind that you can
only sell what you can get your hands on....the Bus Depot seems to be able
to get more than the average guy.   be happy that you can actually get the
stuff even in a week or two...my bus is my daily driver when it don't run
I don't go,  so I suspect it is more frustrating than for the average
person on this list when my bus don't go....Just ordered a head today, I'm
gonna be lucky to get it in a week and I'm popping for Air freight across
the country...youch!  And I'm not driving til it gets here and I get to
put it in....you just missing a little canvas!!!

smile if your bus runs!  

thank goodness for Ron at Bus Depot 

and a few of the other rare suppliers still putting up with us.  Rocky
Mountain Motor works, BustedBus and others to name a few
