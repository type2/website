Rob I have the same question as #2

I think you have to measure the bat voltage real time
first (it will make a difference). And from Mikes post
yesterday, I think its like this

(4 x (50/2))/360 X batt voltage

or 100/360 x batt voltage

You should be able to just crank it with cap and rotor
removed and set it like that
