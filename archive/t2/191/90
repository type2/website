Subject: Re: [T2] messy wiring


With a Bentley wiring schematic in hand.  Preferrably the colored version.  
It's a simple job if you take it a wire at a time.  Don't remove any wires, 
until you've looked them over for a few hours, and fell you comfortably know 
where the important ones go.  Use the fuse panel as a starting point, either 
from the battery, or to the accessories.  Feel the burn, enjoy the learn!
