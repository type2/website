Subject: bleeder valves

 
Listees, 

I tried unsuccessfully yesterday to open my rear bleeder valves on my 71 
before I switched out the hoses. I squirted them down with some rust 
penetrator ahead of time let them sit a few hours and still couldn't get them 
open. I gave up trying to apply too much pressure for fear of stripping them. 
Any ideas what I could do to get these little buggers off? Would a light 
torch help? I dont want to replace the back lines just to find out I cant 
bleed them and will be screwed.

Thanks all!
