Subject: Sheet Metal Piece on T1 Engine Cooling System

I was just examining an original head that was used on a 73 Beetle.  It
was used on the 1-2 cylinders.  I noticed that there is a small sheet
metal piece embedded into the gap in the center that is used to block
some of the air flow to the thermostat.  It has a diagonal slot in it
for the thermostat rod.  Does anyone know if this piece was ever used on
the 71 Bus or earlier single port engines?  Any thoughts on running the
thermostat without this piece?  It looks like the purpose of the piece
is to make the thermostat react quicker to engine heat by shielding it
from the cooler air from the fan.
