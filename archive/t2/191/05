to the printer on July 10th..so that is the absolute last date to get your 
order in:   link to shirt order form:

- VW FAMILY FEUD:  I sent out the survey to the list last week, and would 
like to thank those who responded.  But, we only received 40 responses and 
we need at least 100 bus owners to survey!  Please do not re-submit you 
answers, but if you did not submit your survey last week please click this

POT LUCK SUPPER:  If your not cooking Wings - Please bring any dish or 
anything that would go well with wings - celery, chips, bread, veggies, etc. 
There will be a lot of people so we'll all need to pitch in to feed the
