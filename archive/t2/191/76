    Best way to keep the shavings out of the cylinder is with compressed =
air! Pull the valve cover of the affected cylinder,    turn engine by =
hand until the exhaust valve is completely opened and intake is closed,  =
  place air blow-gun in tail pipe with wire tie or tape holding blow gun =
opened,     air will be blowing up and out of the spark plug hole,     =
tap threads at this time,     air will keep shaving out of cylinder!

Good luck, let us know!
