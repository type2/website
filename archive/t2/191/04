from your description, i am assuming you mean the tie rods. but really,
take your bus to a front end shop. arm yourself with Muir & Bentley.
have them give you an estimate. write things down if you don't understand
what they are saying. bring your new info back to the list & share. the
answer will then be provided for you.

>>...Could this by the source of my loose steering??...<<

yes, possibly. improperly adjusted tie rods can give your bus
some really wacky steering/handling behaviors. AMHIK. the other factors that
Mr. Schwarze mentioned are also good possibilities. we just won't know for
sure until you get a proper diagnosis.

its very likely all your bus needs is some much needed maintenence on the
front suspension.

good luck.
