Subject: Lifters and Pushrods


gurus,
pulling the lifters out of my T4 motor last night to het a good look at them 
i realized that they are hydraulic. my motor is a '77 2 liter with one 
rebuild that i know of. The 77 came with solid lifters. the pushrods in my 
motor are the solid lifter style (with the ends) and the lifters are 
hydraulic. i suspect that the cam is designed for solid lifters. i have 
driven about 55 k on this motor with this setup. should i buy new pushrods 
at this point? or just leave it as is?
-jeremy
