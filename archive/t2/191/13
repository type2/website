Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top order fiasco

I just got my first order from busdepot.  Very nice until i realized one 
item wasnt in there.  A gauge pod that i was told was in stock.  I got 
no invoice in the package saying it wasnt shipped.  Finally after 2 
emails asking if it was a mispack or arriving separate,  i get the note 
that oh.. that item is NLA and would i like the underdash version 
instead.  Not happy...Put me a week behind schedule.
