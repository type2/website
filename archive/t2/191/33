You know Mike,, you have a good point that I forgot to report... I did go through 12 liters in 1500 miles, to EveryBus and home,,, as I expected due to blowby.
The spark plugs are nice and tan,,no sign of burning oil there ,, 

I think it is blown out of the engine as it looks like a self oiling device now,,,
oil all over the rear of the bus ,,,

It spins over very quickly,, and starts up quick tooo....
