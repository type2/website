Objet : Re: [T2] re:stripped sparkplug hole??


Since it's basically a throw-away head you could always try "ye olde
JB Weld". When prepared properly this stuff works wonders & who cares
if you can't take the plug back out w/out damaging the head. Worth a
shot, especially if keeping the head doesn't matter. I have had good
results w/ jb weld, but you HAVE to make sure the surfaces are clean.
