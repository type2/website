I haven't had any response to this other than
checking for crossed plugs wires.  

Other data was compression 120 all the way
around, #3 started firing when I changed plugs,
#4 still dead.  Replaced #4 plug wire with known
good and it's still dead.  Replaced dizzy cap. 
#4 dead.  

With the plug fouling, I suspect dumping that
oily breather blowby directly into the carb port
may have fouled up the intake?  Any thoughts on
dieseling the carb as per Muir?  

Any other ideas?
