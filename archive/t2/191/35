Subject: Brake Warning Light On, No Brake Lights

I've been busy all day today trying to troubleshoot this problem... I 
thought it was just the brake warning light, but now I know the brake 
lights aren't coming on either. When the engine is running and running 
lights are off, the brake warning light works as normal (comes on when you 
turn the key, then goes out when running)... when running lights are turned 
on, the brake warning light stays on and goes out when you press the brake 
pedal... brake lights still don't come on. I had a new battery installed a 
few days ago... it's possible a wire in the engine compartment is shorting. 
I put a meter on the brake warning light... when the engine is running I 
get 12V on both the black and blue wires, but nothing on the red, which I 
believe powers the brake lights (i'm horrible with the wiring diagrams). 
The switches on the master cylinder metered out fine, and brakes are fine. 
There is no hand brake switch, and it isn't the press in button type of 
warning light. I found a new wiring harness for all the rear lights etc at 
a nearby VW graveyard today and am going to try installing that tomorrow. 
Any advise in the meantime would really help... Because the running lights 
seem to affect it, I think it's likely a short in the engine compartment 
somewhere?
