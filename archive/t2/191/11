Michael,

Go buy a short piece of steel tubing.

Smash one end down to about the right size...slip it over
the driving flapper end and cut/bend correctly the other end(90 degree 
angle if I remember correctly).

Remove the two screws holding the other flapper in and reinsert...

Or buy a replacement from busted-bus like I did<grin>.

I am going to take measurements on mine before I install it so I can
get someone to make one out of metal when it breaks.

The other option is to get a solid rod that is larger in diameter
than the spade ends on the flapper.  Cut slots at the correct angle
in a short piece of it.  Then buy some steel tubing that will just fit 
over the outside....same reassembly as before.

Cheers, dave
