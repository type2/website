Roberto:

I did it like this tonight and all my problems went
away.  This low speed miss after it warms up was always
due to crappy spark!

I measured the batt voltage at 14.25

50 degrees for 4 cylinders divided by 360 = 200/360=
0.556

14.25 X 0.556= 7.91 Vdc on the meter.

Starting voltage was just over 10 so a dwell of 63
degrees

So you should be around 3.33 V, but measure battery
voltage first and use an analog meter.

I cant believe it, my van runs like a top.  You could
cut a diamond on the air shroud at idle now.  And no
low speed miss, you can put it in 4th at 20mph and mat
the pedal, no missing!
