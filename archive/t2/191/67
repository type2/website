Hey all!
If you can, spend the money and buy premium quality.  If you love your bus 
as much as I, You may be able to boost bus karma by showing it the love you 
have for her by only using the best.  But seriously,  Any tool with a 
lifetime guarentee such as Craftsman, or Snap-on is a good tool.  Feel the 
weight in your hands, look at the finish, and try to find weld marks.  In 
tools, you can definitely feel the difference in quality.  I have a Snap-on 
model QJR3200C.  It is a beast!  10-200lbs.
It is my favorite tool, and the one I grab when things on the bus aren't 
going well and I need the love to come back!  This is also the tool that 
will be passed down to my son, and then to his.  (Torque wrenches make great 
heir looms!)  This being one of the most, if not the most important tools in 
my box,  I decided to go for the quality piece.  This does not however mean 
that the other people on the list have junk.  Some responses I see were from 
well respected people on this list, and should not be discounted.  Just 
wanted to get my 2 cents in.  :)  Good luck, and happy bussing.
