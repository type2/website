I would have agreed with that 20 years ago, but Craftsman has been 
producing some junk lately.  Like their air ratchet (granted it's not 
lifetime warranty) and their professional series open end wrenches.  IMO 
you can no longer blindly buy Craftsman and get a good tool every time.  If 
you really want some good Busma, buy high-quality German tools like the 
Stahlwille or Gedore brands mentioned recently.  :)
