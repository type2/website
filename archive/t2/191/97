Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp VDO gauge

I've got the one that you drill out a hole in the round oil sump cover... 
not the one with the screen, the other one... with a VDO gauge, it has been 
working like a charm for about 5yrs now! I had to go out and purchase the 
right size drill bit for it, but then it just bolts on. Great to have the 
piece of mind too... while you're at it, if you don't already have one, get 
the pressure gauge as well. It just screws into the existing oil pressure 
warning light switch. Good luck!
