Sure you can, I picked up a '79 deluxe sunroof in california (read rustless) for $150 with motor!

yes.

Yes, you would want the bell housing, clutch, flywheel I believe, from the 72. Basically motor can be any size T4, but use the tranny/clutch equipment to match the exist'g tranny.

Most of it would probably, with a few differences. The case size is the same, just piston bore differences.

091 tranny from 76-79, list?

Yes.

FI not scary. Best set up you could have. I'd never get carbs.

Get the bus, deal with problems later. 

Good luck,
