If the tie rods are what we are talking about - it is normal for them to 
rock back and forth a little at the ends. If they are twisting at the 
threads then somebody did not tighten them up after an adjustment.

At the ends - the tie rod ends - they are supposed to swivel or rock a bit 
- to allow for the movement of the suspension.

It's hard to explain and I always try to explain my answers like you've 
never seen the underside of a VW bus.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

Let us know.
