Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Warning Light On, No Brake Lights

I've just finished installing a whole new wire harness in the back end... 
all lights work except brakes :( I'm almost at my wits end... I put a meter 
on the pressure switches and they both seem to be functioning fine. I'm 
going to try the test from the manual, pull one off... test brakes, pull 
the other off... test brakes. I'm pretty sure the switches are fine 
though... I'm really at a loss... I even tried installing a different brake 
warning light.
