Melissa,

Because I know from prior discussions that you are replacing the master
cylinder, you are already commited to bleeding the rears, just to get the
air out of the line from the MC to the rear circuit.  That being said...

Dave is correct, new rear wheel cylinders is the answer.  New cylinders
from Bus Depot are $10.95, BTW, so your budget for attempts is ~$30 (2
cyls+shipping).  With that in mind, you are now free to abuse the hell out
of your current cylinders on the slim chance that they can be saved :-)
Try the following slim chance things.

First, remove the cylinder.  You don't want what you are about to do to
screw up your brake shoes. Then...

I would say take them to a machinist, but while they can certainly get the
bleed screw out, they will probably want more than $30, so that is out,
but you might try.

Heat is good, as you said.  Hold the cylinder in hand and aim the torch at
the bleed screw.  Stop heating when the cylinder gets too hot to hold.
(Drop the cylinder when it does, as it will continue to soak heat)  The
rubber boots inside the cylinder will take quite a bit of heat (they *are*
brake parts, after all) but not too much.

While it is hot, apply penetrating oil.  This has two good effects, first
it will penetrate better for being hot and second it will cool the bleed
screw much faster than the body of the cylinder and may break it loose
thru differential contraction.

Take a punch and tap the sides of the bleeder to try to break it free.

Vice-grips!  You will trash the bleeder, but they are $.50 at a FLAPS

Easy out.  break it off?  Well, you have learned why not to use easy-outs
for only $10.95, and now you don't have to relearn the lesson on an
exhaust stud :-)

Good luck!!!
