Subject: RE: [T2] re:stripped sparkplug hole??

ive heard from some folks to never, never torque or screw a spark plug when
the engine is hot!!  Wait until its cold, so you wont strip the hole!!

if you want a temporay solution, and no helicoil, you could use some Loctite
or better in my advice, get some JB WELD, put it around your spark plug  and
screw in...wait until its all dry (24 hour)!!




Objet : Re: [T2] re:stripped sparkplug hole??


well yesterday I blew out a sparkplug (again) was out checking this
morning and it will screw back in but won't tighten...obviously
stripped.  problem is this is a "temp" head while I was getting a new
(rebuilt AVP) head on a stock 78FI 2L engine but it isn't here yet
probably at least a week.  this is my daily driver and I don't want to sit
for a week also it is very hot and humid so working on it is not enjoyable
at this point.   

   is there any way to get this temporarily back on the road without
pulling the engine or swapping the head??   damage to the head is
acceptable but don't want to risk the new pistons and cyl.   being lazy
don't want to pull the engine twice in two weeks.
