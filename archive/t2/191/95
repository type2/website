Problem solved! The 12V supply from the fuse box to the brake switches had 
popped off the back of the fuse box... lol! That's always the way isn't it. 
Well, I have a nice shiny new wire harness now! Thanks to everyone that 
offered their advice. I'm still shaking my head and lmao... it's was 
getting to be a panic to get those lights working as I'm starting a road 
trip to the east coast tomorrow!
