I'm very proud to hear that almost ALL of your Bus Depot orders have been at
your doorstep within 24 hours of placing them.  24 HOURS!!!!

This is a perfect example of how we've been working on improving our service
and delivery times.  This kind of service has not come without a lot of
sweat and hard work on the part of my staff.  Long-time
listmembers/customers will recall the days when almost any Bus Depot order
took 2 weeks, but they put up with it because I offered better prices, went
out of my way to source obsolete parts that nobody else bothered with, and
contributed regularly to the List and the Bus community.  (And to those of
you, I really do appreciate your support!)    Boy have we come a long way
since those not-too-long-ago days!

24 hours to your door on almost every ground order you have placed!   How
can you beat that!!   You should be showering us with praise!

Instead you're complaining because this time your ground order won't get
there within 24 hours, due to a factory shortage. You never had a positive
thing to say when almost all of your "estimated 7-10 working day" ground
orders got to you within 24 hours -  but now you're complaining because this
one won't.

I am sorry that the manufacturer ran out of material so we didn't get our
full canvas order. Of course, we shipped the ones we got based on the date
the order was placed, which is only fair - and your order was just placed
yesterday, so by the time we got to it today some colors were sold out.  Had
we received our full order there would have been no problem.  And in fact we
already have more on the way (except for gray, which is a couple of weeks
out).

That said, we bent over backwards trying to help.  We offered you a yellow
one pronto, out of our stock.  Or we offered to drop everything and call the
factory right away, and have them ship a tan one directly to you (rather
than wait until the new shipment reaches us), so you could have it as
quickly as UPS could deliver it (in this case, about a week via Ground from
the factory, or sooner if you wanted air delivery).

But you want me to send it to you via Air, and pay for that out of MY OWN
pocket.  On an order I just received YESTERDAY!  That I will not do.  I'm
sorry.

Pretty much every VW parts vendor sells the same canvas from the same
factory (although most charge more than we do). Maybe one of them has a gray
one on the shelf.  Whether they will send it to you via Air for the price of
ground shipping is another question entirely.

I don't think I owe you an apology for the service you have received from
The Bus Depot.  In fact I kind of feel like you owe me one.
