Subject: Re: bleeder valves

Melissa,

I have not broken a single bleeder nipple since using liquid wrench AND
hammering straight down on the nipple to vibrate the threads loose. Don't
hammer to hard or you will obviously do some damage - just light taps with a
small hammer or even a heavy wrench. Hammer the nipple straight 'into' it's
hole - as though you are driving a nail - but just tap. Alternate between
sqirting on liquid wrench and tapping and then trying to loosen. Repeat many
many times if need be. Also let the liquid wrench soak in for a while - even
overnight.

I live in the rust belt so this is always a problem. But this method has
worked for me every time!
