One thing I'll add is that I know Ron Salmon is one of our most helpful folks here, and he appreciates any of us taking a beef to him for some direct resolution before we have newer folks like the poster earlier with a wavering 400 dollar order going somewhere else over one person's greivance.

I've never bought a thing from Ron, and he's helped me directly a lot on this list.

Address your greivances to the business owners on this list and see what happens before you publicly hose somebody.
