Subject: re:  Torque Wrenches

I looked at the Pittsburg torque wrenches, they are pretty cheap. I almost
bit.
However, I started looking on e**y, they have Snap On and Craftsman wrenches
all the time. I ended up going to Sears, the day I went they had Craftsman
tools at 50% off. I got a new 1/2" clicker for$49.95 Canadian, I was very
happy! It's a nice wrench, I've been torquing my wheel bolts with it.  I
used to have a dial indicator Proto, what a pain that was to use!
