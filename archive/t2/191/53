Your clarification is greatly appreciated. A little bit of negative press
can do a lot of harm to a small business, even if not intended that way.  I
could ship 1000 orders perfectly, but if customer number 1001 has a gripe
and airs it on the net,  his comment has more effect on my business than the
1000 well-handled orders that preceded it.  Such is the power of the
internet.

I'll follow up with the factory tomorrow and make sure they shipped that
canvas out to you as promised.
