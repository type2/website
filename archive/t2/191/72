Melissa,

At least you checked the bleeders first!

Every time I have done this, it's been a "no-win".

I've twisted more of them off than I can remember.

I've had some success with easy-outs(no flames please), but it's usually 
just a lot easier to get new cylinders.

My opinion is that if the bleeders won't come out correctly, then
you probably need new cylinders anyway.

I would probably avoid heat on something that close to brake fluid.

Cheers ,dave
