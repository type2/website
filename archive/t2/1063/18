Greg, I think you're right about making sure you've got enough voltage while
cranking.

I've found that a fresh battery is key to reliable starting when it gets
cold, which is why I've got the automatic trickle charger installed
permanently and always plugged in while it's parked.  I've always had these
in my vehicles.
