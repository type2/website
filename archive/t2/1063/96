Subject: Exhausts that delete the heaterboxes completely on aircooled

Are there any aftermarket performance/nonperformance exhausts that delete the heaterboxes and just run a header pipe from the exhaust ports out to the back of the van? I would think maybe a Porsche 914 exhaust? It seems there is nothing to do this and remove all the heaterbox crap. Anyone come across a system?
