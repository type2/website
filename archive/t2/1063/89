Subject: Re: [T2] Loss of power after warmed up

Hi All, 

Limped the bus to the friendly local VW mechanic, as he's got many, many
years experience on me concerning VW's.  

Turns out one of the adjustable linkages between the throttle bar and
the carb throttle arm came loose and fell off.   Oops.  Seems the jam
nuts didn't do their job.  

*IF* it warms up this weekend, I'll tackle that issue and a few other
nagging little problems.  Woke up this morning in Central Florida with
frost on the ground, my birdbath frozen solid, and my teeth rattling.  

Numerous dead plants, including the tender mammoth sunflowers that were
just peeking up out of the ground, despite being covered up.  :(

While frost and ice may be normal weather in July for Michigan (just
kidding), it isn't normal for central Florida!  BRR!!!  

Makes me want to kick the DPO all over again for removing 99% of the
heating system from the bus.  All I got left is the heat exchangers, and
the insulating tube up the middle of the bottom of the bus.  No blower,
no heat flaps (flaps present in the cooling tin though!), nada.  


At least my issue with the bus was a simple one.  Helps to have a fresh
pair of experienced eyes on the problem.  Especially since I was cursing
and fuming at the time.  ;)

Thanks!

Shad
