Dan, GOWESTY.COM sells the tack strips.

I went to Home Depot and bought two step / stair rubber threads, 4 ft long
and as thick as the original strips [there ARE different thicknesses], and,
not wanting to use the original plastic tack strips, I cut tack strips of
rubber from the two step / stair rubber threads.  Each step / stair rubber
thread was less than $3, and no shipping.  I only needed 6 each <> 4ft
strips, but I could have gotten 8 each <> 4ft strips out of the two step /
stair threads.
I cut the rubber strips with a carpet knife, but a regular 'box cutter'
would have done fine.  The rubber does dull the blade, so you would want to
use a fresh side of the blade about half way through.  You wont notice any
difference, but that's the idea; you don't want to be at your last two cuts
and say to your self 'I should have turned the blade on this darn cutter!!'

Worked quite well.  The 9/16" staples could have gone in 99% of the way if I
kept enough pressure on the electric staple gun against the rubber tack
strips.  But that's just normal electric stapling technique -   As it was, I
got tired, even of just pressing the trigger, and towards the end, a lot of
the staples only went about 85% of the way in.  I then took a small hammer
(actually a real tack hammer that came from my father's tool stash some 50
years ago) and seated all the staples, all the way around the 24ft rim of
the top.

I used almost a half box of 1250 staples, so I figure I used 500 plus
staples.

I didn't go for the stainless staples since the ones I took out were 30
years old, and they looked fine, no noticeable rust.
