Hi Don,

My guess is that it's voltage. I have a voltmeter on my bus and I can =20
tell you that if the battery can't supply 11V while running the coil, =20
fuel pump and starter, the ECU won't wake up and fire the injectors. =20
The cold start valve can't start the bus on its own.

Suggestions: Try a lighter oil to lessen the load on the starter, =20
replace the battery or warm the engine somehow. I have had good luck =20
with a 1500W hot air popcorn blower placed under the engine; one of =20
those can also be placed inside the vehicle to preheat the interior. =20
They're loud as all get out, but they are also easily found quite =20
cheap at your local secondhand store.

Another possibility is a cold/cracked solder joint on the ECU/AFM that =20
is temperature dependent. A parts swap will answer that quickly enough.

Good luck, it's plenty cold here too.

Happy Trails,

Something I've been fighting for the past month or so... The Guac won't
start if the temps are below 18*. The fuel pump is running, the rail
pressurizing, the cold start valve is squirting, the points and condensor
were replaced and I'm getting over 12v at the coil.

Before I dig further, any thoughts?
