Subject: PB Blaster and rubber shock bushings

When I installed my first pair of Koni shocks a few years ago, it seems I
left out the metal sleeve that goes inside the rubber bushing.  At this
point, I can push and pull (from the top) the shock as far as possible in
either direction, but the rubber bushing around the lower shock mount
shaft, will not break loose.  Can I take PB Blaster to this or will it
damage the rubber?
