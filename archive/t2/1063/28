Okee, 
So driving in to work this morning it was -21 (that's about -6f)before the windchill. 
A wee bit chilly you may say. 
Here are some things I noticed. 
1)
The engine was really hard to turn over. It sounded like the starter
wanted to, but the engine wasn't willing. After a few tries, I got her
to fire. 
2) VERY sticky gas pedal. Almost un-nervingly sticky
3) Does not want to idle once the choke warms up. 
4)
Going from 3rd to 4th seems tricky. There is a real "bog" in the lower
RPM's all of a sudden, and going into 4th, it can hardly keep up to
itself. I have to get going real fast in 3rd (by my standard at least.
I need to be pullin almost 50mph in 3rd) to make the transition into
fourth without bogging out. 

It is a 1600 SP. Heater pre-heat tubes still in place and functioning, electric choke still in place and functioning.
