Something I've been fighting for the past month or so... The Guac  won't
start if the temps are below 18*. The fuel pump is running, the  rail
pressurizing, the cold start valve is squirting, the points and  condensor
were replaced and I'm getting over 12v at the coil.

Before  I dig further, any thoughts?

hey don How is it cranking over, kinda slow at that temp probably. Is  it 
parked inside or out?  Something I use to do with an old 6V bug I had  was to 
drain the oil and keep it warm behind the woodstove in the house at night  . I 
would do the same with the battery. It was kinda a PITA but never failed to  
start when I did that no matter how cold it got.  later  mark  d
