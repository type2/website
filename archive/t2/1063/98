Hi Courtney,

I took a pair of 75-78 headers to a local muffler shop and the mechanic
there welded on a pair of Harley mufflers. It cost me $100.

They are VERY loud, as the PO had knocked oout the baffles. You can see
pics and hear my engine running at the following link:

I took them off after a month or so, as I decided that it was a little
too loud for night-time use in the townhouse complex where I live.


Happy Trails,
