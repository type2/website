apparently this is not uncommon as VW made a special shim for between
the lower roller and the door.  When I replaced my door I found these
shims when changing the lower roller to the new door.  and it was
pretty obvious they were factory installed.  my new door had the same
problem as yours and I copied the VW shims to adjust it to work
properly.  you may need to add a shim or two, they are quite thin to
raise the door itself up a little.

the shim BTW is shaped like the letter "E" and slides around the bolts
rather than have them go thru it.
