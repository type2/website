Hi Steve,

I have seen a few such conversions.... it works pretty well. The hardest 
detail to work out is the cooling system. The most stock-looking option 
is to put the rad in the engine bay, but you will need to choose the 
right fan/rad combo to make that work and if the fan fails you won't 
have enough airflow for highway operation. Some people have fitted the 
rad under the bus, but that again is fan-dependent and can also reduce 
ground clearance. Putting the rad on the nose of the bus is a little 
more fault-tolerant.

I am planning on doing this with my westfakia, using a 1.6TD mated to a 
mexican watercooled bus transmission. I hope to get started on this 
conversion this spring.

Happy Trails,
