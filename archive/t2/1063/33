Subject: Karl's in the hospital

Got an e-mail from Michelle, Karl's daughter. He's in the hospital in Coos Bay recovering from complications after a fall he took in December. He's had a blood disease for five or so years making this a real tough patch. 

He's in ICU now, hopefully will get into a ward soon. Michelle is monitoring e-mail, forums and will pass on messages and take care of any parts transactions. Her e-mail is maenad AT gmail dot com.

I'll drive up from Fresno on Friday or Saturday for a visit.
