I used a 3 gauge plastic mounting pod that sits on top of the dash, over the radio speaker holes.? Used to be able to get these from Bus Boys, but I think someone else sells them now - if interested I will hunt it down for you.? I fastened the gauge?pod to the top of the dash with velcro, and the wires go through the speaker holes in the dash (my speaker is not used and I removed it).? This was easy to do and did not require any cutting of the dash, or any other parts of the bus.? Best of all, the gauges are located up where you can see them without really taking your eyes off the road.
