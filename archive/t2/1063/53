Sometimes referred to as the "modesty strip,", it attaches o the bottom of
the rear bumper and hides the muffler and underside (a little bit). It is
usually painted black. Seems I have also heard it called a "stone shield,"
but I might have been at the time.

"To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of
his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose
fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate
arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
