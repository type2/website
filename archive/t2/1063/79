>But once it's been on the road at 45-55mph for a few miles, it develops
a bad miss at speed and has no power. Idle drops and it will stall when
stopped. On the road, it's about all it will do to hold 45-50mph, flat
on the floor. That's unnecessarily hard on the engine, as you're abusing
the crap out of the working cylinders.

I've had similar symptoms twice. First when the engine was running on
three cylinders due to a loose spark plug lead. But this ran like crap
when cold and warm! The other time was temp related and turned out to be
the coil. Could also be one of your spark plug leads failing when it
gets hot, too.

I would try removing the leads one at a time and changing the coil
before I pulled the spark plugs when hot - could strip the threads, or
checked the hot valve lash - this is a really unfun thing to do!
