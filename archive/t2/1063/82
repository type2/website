Subject: List input...gauges

Hi.. I am about to go to the input stage of my Dakota Digitals for CHT and Oil
temps, as well as install my MSD box.  I need info on...where is the best
location for the gauges..on top of dash, on drivers side window
pillar....????..and where to mounts the MSD.  Currently I have a 'breather box
for valve covers on the static tin above the motor tin, and I will need space
to put aftermarket electric fuel lines 'in' to motor area, through motor
tin...so..it looks to be a compacted issue..so want to hear from others how
they have set up.  It is '75 Westy 1.8L  Cheers
Syd
