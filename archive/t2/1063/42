I am that guy, and although I no longer have the photos posted, I still have them all and have no problem sharing with people who are serious about building something. I used a Toyota 4Runner radiator which is commonly available and Flex-A-Lite made a fan kit for it.

Recent snow has convinced me not to place the radiator underneath.

Thanks for the compliment, BTW!

 You know, there used to be a guy on the www who did a great
 conversion
 mounting a dasher or quantum (ie Audi anyway you cut that)
 radiator inside a
 hardshell spare tire cover with a perforated stainless mesh
 front to it.  Just
 looked like a front mounted spare on any ole Westy, was
 near impossible to
 tell it wasn't.  I think whoever it was was a list
 member in the day, anyone
 recall?
