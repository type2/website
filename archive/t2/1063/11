You're right. I'm running 5-20 right now.

The bus cranks beautifully. I'm getting slightly over 12v at the coil with
the ignition key on and 11* temps.

The only thing that's really changed was the injectors. I can't help but
think that poorly spraying injectors might be doing this to me. Last winter
it started with no problems.
