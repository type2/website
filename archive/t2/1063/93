Subject: RE: [T2] winter driving

I drove my bus a bit here in Vermont just before Winter with all season tires.
I live in the mountains and if it was going to be my daily driver in the
Winter I would have to get studded snow tires. Pretty much everyone up here
has studded tires or AWD.

I bought a Subaru and parked my bus in a barn until Spring - even just driving
it a few weeks on salted roads my rust free bus started to get the beginnings
of surface rust underneath.

Never buy a car from Vermont. ;)
