Subject: Fuel Line size - for 70 Bug

My fuel line is leaking (breaking down). This is the piece that connects the metal line at the rear of the bug coming out of the tunnel, to the metal fuel line that goes through the firewall and up to the carburetor. It is about 12-16" in length and is the grey braided original line. Does anyone know the equivalent inch size, like 3/16" or 1/4" etc., so I can tell the local flaps guys? They will start to drool if I tell them I need metric. 
Thanks,
Courtney
