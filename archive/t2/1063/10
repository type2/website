I have no issues starting at low temperature either.  I do run a  
lighter weight oil during the winter, but don't change anything else  
throughout the seasons.  I would guess that Don is probably already  
running a lighter weight oil compared to summer though, so I wonder if  
there isn't something else that should be looked at.
