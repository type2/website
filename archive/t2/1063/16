Hi Don,

Get someone to check the voltage while cranking. I bet it drops a LOT.  
I have a voltmeter installed in the dash under the radio, and if it  
isn't ion the green while the starter is running, the bus doesn't fire.

Check a plug, I bet they are pretty dry. Or put a noid light on it;  
either way it'll tell you that the voltage isn't getting there,  
because the ECU is offline.

One thing that has worked for me while in your situation is to bump  
start it; without the starter sucking the battery flat the ECU can do  
its job properly.

Good Luck,

Greg
