Hi George

Gave my 91 Weekender to my son when gas went to $5.  Regretting it now,
but gas will be back up there soon.  A Bay should get better gas
mileage with CIS and a 1.8 or 2.0.  Have to figure out what tranny to
use though.

How come the vehicles I like which are still made can't be shipped to
America:

Does South Africa accept refugees?  Americans fleeing a sinking ship?
