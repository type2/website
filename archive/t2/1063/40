You know, there used to be a guy on the www who did a great conversion
mounting a dasher or quantum (ie Audi anyway you cut that) radiator inside a
hardshell spare tire cover with a perforated stainless mesh front to it.  Just
looked like a front mounted spare on any ole Westy, was near impossible to
tell it wasn't.  I think whoever it was was a list member in the day, anyone
recall?
 
As a pure FWIW having done several vanagon inline conversions, I would NOT
(and I have) use CIS for a second, not that I don't like CIS but you can get a
Digifant car like a '90-'92 whole car for $200-300 and it is FAR easier to do
the conversion, just hook up the fuel rail, use a boy racer air filter, away
you go.  CIS laid down is a PITA to locate the fuel distributor and plumb the
injectors.  Far smarter is probably a '93-whatever crossflow ABA 2.0 as they
are even more common, I bet in a bus the intake would work out nicely, and
although I don't know, probably easier to take and convert but eventually they
get to have immobilizers and PITA stuff like that.  I haven't followed FWD
since I sold my Corrado so I don't know (1.8 G60 would probably fit as well
FWIW.)  To me a 1.8 regular ole Digifant is the easiest VW mill into a
Vanagon, and therefore likely into a bus.   But that raises the question of if
VW is even the smartest idea, 22R,RE,
 rotary (probably dumb in a Bus, great in a 914 apparently), Ford or GM V6,
1.8 subie, though no reason probably not to do a 2.2 or 2.5 Legacy mill, I
mean Kennedy makes the adapters for all of them.  1.8 VW is a pretty reliable
setup though.

I'm not sure how the Dasher radiator would fit the nose of the bus. Maybe
