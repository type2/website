Subject: Re: Won't start below 18*

I have a minor update. This morning it was a bit warmer, 19*. So this isn't
a 100% valid test. However...

Last night I bought a twin sized heating blanket from WallyWorld for $30.
(It was late and I didn't have time to go on a hunt for a block heater.) I
tossed it in the engine compartment and plugged it in, set to half power.

This morning it started up like it was summer. So I have a workaround to
give me time to find the actual problem.

Yay!

Some good suggestions have come my way. I'll let ya'll know how it goes.
