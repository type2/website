I had the exact problem at times last winter (in Arizona - the northern
highlands.)
I didn't want to drain the oil every evening, so as soon as the alarm went off
each morning, I actually threw an electric heating pad on the block, and
turned it on to 'high' , running it on an extension cord into the house.
Another PITA. By the time I was ready to leave for work (an hour later) it was
ready. It only got in the teens for a few weeks, though. Maybe you can prop it
up under the engine on a box or something?? hth
