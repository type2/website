Subject: '78 Paint Codes

Hello Volks,

Sorry as I'm sure this is a much asked question - however the archives are
not working so I've come to you. I have a web link to some VW paint codes
but don't see anything matching our bus.

I'm trying to find the paint codes or even the name of the color for our
bus.

This may be a repaint but I think it's been repainted the priginal color
(although maybe some of you could tell me different). Here is a link to a
picture:

Thanks in advance for any help.
