Hi Shad,

Could it be that the fuel tank isn't venting properly? If air can't get 
in, a vacuum will result that could potentially overpower the fuel pump 
after a while. Turning the engine off for a minute might not be long 
enough to recover.

Try running around town without the fuel cap in place; if the problem 
goes away then you should check the vent lines.


Happy Trails,
