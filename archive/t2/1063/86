BBB was GREAT!

Weather was perfect.  80+ degree days with light breezes when it got too 
hot.

Everything ran smoothly, no problems at all at the event.  The London 
Bridge Bullis know their stuff!

250+ buses registered.

Raised lots of money for the kids.

Dice run was fun.

Found some interesting bits for my bus.

Won a couple of little things in the raffle, but not the engine... :(

Saw a lot of old friends and made a few new ones.

Trip there and back was good, but had to tighten a loose carb on the way 
back.

If you missed it, you missed a great one!  Put it on the calender for next 
year!

George
