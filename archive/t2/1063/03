Subject: Won't start below 18*

Something I've been fighting for the past month or so... The Guac won't
start if the temps are below 18*. The fuel pump is running, the rail
pressurizing, the cold start valve is squirting, the points and condensor
were replaced and I'm getting over 12v at the coil.

Before I dig further, any thoughts?
