Subject: H2O buses

I wonder how a 1.8 CIS in line four (or the 2.0 block with a cis head)
would power the green bus.  It's probably a 1000 pound lighter than a
vanagon (according to door post stickers a mk 2 jetta is 200 lbs
heavier than a transporter).  You wouldn't have to rotate the engine.
The engine compartment is taller.  Have to check if the 1.8 would bolt
to a 091 tranny.  The radiator out of the Dasher ought to fit both the
1.8 and the nose of the bus.  AC would be an option also.  

Maybe I ought to pull the green bus out of moth balls.

What engine and tranny is in these Brazillian buses?

Is this sacrilege?
