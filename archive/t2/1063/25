Subject: cold starting

Here are a few thoughts from Shell Oil, and others, on starting cold-soaked
air-cooled aero engines.  Appropriate to our engines too.  I particularly like
the part about when it's -20F there is NO (ZERO) clearance between the
bearings in an aluminum crankcase and a steel crankshaft.  Of course, after
you cold crank it for some time there is clearance for oil to get there  ;) 
Preheat or die.  YMMV jon
