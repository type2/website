80 bucks sounds fair. Consider that you'll likely have to restore one this
age. Even if the cover is in good shape, the horsehair is probably shot.

Shipping will be a large factor if it's not local.

Good luck!

Thanks for the tip on the archives, Troy.

his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose
fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate
arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
