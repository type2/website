Subject: Re: [T2] Won't start below 18*

Sputters with starting fluid and has over 12v at coil when cranking? Did 
you check color of spark by taking a plug wire between cap and ground? 
Air leaks that make it too lean when it is very cold and gas is hardly 
vaporizing?  Wrong resistance from the temp sensor? Did you verify CSV 
is squirting or just getting juice?  You can jump the CSV to positive 
voltage yourself.  Do not squirt starting fluid in air cleaner, as a 
backfire will destroy the AFM flapper vane (ask me how I know 8-)- do it 
on the cylinder side of the throttle, like down the big hose leading to 
the T of the brake vac hose.  Did you check voltage is going to 
injectors while it is cranking? (Voltage always goes to injectors; the 
"brain" grounds them).  I assume the latter is OK as it starts in warmer 
weather.
