As a  pure FWIW having done several vanagon inline conversions, I would NOT
(and  I have) use CIS for a second, not that I don't like CIS but you can get 
 a
Digifant car like a '90-'92 whole car for $200-300 and it is FAR easier  to do
the conversion, just hook up the fuel rail, use a boy racer air  filter, away
you go.  CIS laid down is a PITA to locate the fuel  distributor and plumb the
injectors.  Far smarter is probably a  '93-whatever crossflow ABA 2.0 as they
are even more common, I bet in a bus  the intake would work out nicely, and
although I don't know, probably  easier to take and convert but eventually 
they
get to have immobilizers and  PITA stuff like that.  I haven't followed FWD
since I sold my Corrado  so I don't know (1.8 G60 would probably fit as well
FWIW.)  To me a  1.8 regular ole Digifant is the easiest VW mill into a
Vanagon, and  therefore likely into a bus.   But that raises the question of  
if
VW is even the smartest idea, 22R,RE,
rotary (probably dumb in a Bus,  great in a 914 apparently), Ford or GM V6,
1.8 subie, though no reason  probably not to do a 2.2 or 2.5 Legacy mill, I
mean Kennedy makes the  adapters for all of them.  1.8 VW is a pretty reliable
setup  though.

hey John I totally agree with you this.   I don't think you even  need an 
adapter for the VW engine, maybe the diesel bellhousing ,and oil pan and  
mountts,if you want it to lay over on its side.I have seeen  the CIS system  is too 
old and some parts are NLA and it doesn't work nearly as good as  digafant.  
Toyo 22re motors had their problems also , timing chains, head  gaskets leaking 
, but all in all good motors,  subie 1.8 were famous for  oil leaks , 2.2 is a 
much better motor, 2.5 had head gaskets problems and they  would bend valves 
if the timing belt breaks. I wouldn't touch a GM(gernic  motors) or Ford(found 
on road dead) or the rotary. Pat cook has a jetta 1.8 in  his bay with the 
radiator in the rear hatch.  took him a while to get the  cooling system right 
but seems to be doing great last time I saw him. He is in  richmond Va.  later
