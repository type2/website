Subject: H2O Vanagon part needed - pic included

Hey Y'all,
The subzero temps here in Ohio cuase the "H" shaped coolant pipe on my 85 Vanagon to freeze and split.  Now looking to buy one or trade parts for one.  If you are looking down into the engine compartment, the piece is just to the right of the coolant tank.  Anyone have one for sale?? Here's a picture if that helps:
