	Theorising utterly free from practical experience, I point 
out there's mass-produced finned copper piping which will, 
approximately, get rid of the heat in the airflow under the floor, 
c.20' being required to take the water fwd to a small heater (i.e. a 
small radiator) above the floor near your feet and then back to the 
motor.
	If this didn't work well enough in your climate, you could 
then paint the finned piping black.

All care & no responsibility    ;-}
