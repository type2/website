Subject: Re: [T2] "BIG' sheet metal surround engine gasket?

Someone will undoubtedly correct me, but I've always put the shiny side down
(outside) on the theory that the shiny side is impervious to moisture,
therefore won't absorb water prom splashes, etc.

I always save a small piece of the old gasket for fill; it seems that the
new gaskets are always about 4" too short and leave a gap between the ends
once installed.

I also install the gasket so the ends are at the top front of the engine
tin. Seems to me that a leak there would be less troublesome than a leak,
say, just above the muffler.

"To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of
his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose
fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate
arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
