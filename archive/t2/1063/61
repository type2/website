Subject: Fuel Line size - for 70 Bug

Scott is right, you can't fit (reliably) standard fuel line on your metric fittings. It's just not good. Last I checked, Scott has metric fuel line. If you are in a real pinch (like stuck, today) go to a motorcycle parts supplier. Many japanese motorcycles use metric fuel line. It will not look, or last, anything remotely close to original, so you should still order the correct fuel line. But this stuff works in a pinch. In fact, until not too long ago I actually kept a section of it on hand in my tool kit. 

Good luck, play safe!
