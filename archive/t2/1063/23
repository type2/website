I'm pretty sure I said I had over 12v. If I didn't, I'm saying it now. I
have over 12v. At 11*. While cranking. I have a nice battery.

;-)

I haven't checked the plugs. I can smell gas while cranking, so I bet
they're wet.

I have run the charger overnight before trying to start it in the morning
and it made no difference. I also this morning tried jump starting it.

I really REALLY doubt it's the battery. I wish it was that easy.
