Subject: [Q] Wiring Harness

Group-

I have a '71-ish camper project ('69 bus that was converted to a
westie-camper in '71).  I need a wiring harness as I am replacing the
electrical throughout.

Is a '69 wiring harness easy to acquire?

-David

P.S.  Ideas on other wiring products would also be appreciated.
