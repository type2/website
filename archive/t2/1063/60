Subject: Slider door rollers

I have a 74 transporter. The sliding door does not line up perfectly with
the rear latch when opened. I have tried spacers inside on the rear latch
and on the mechanism located at the front of the door. It gets close. I have
a body shop guy who thinks that the lower door roller is not lifting the
door high enough. I've examined the lower roller and compared it with photos
on Richard Atwell's pages and it looks the same not excessively worn. Do any
of you have thoughts on how to align the door and have any of you had to
somehow lift the door to get it to line up? Of course, I have looked in the
usual manuals and such. I don't want to order another sliding mechanism
because they are not cheap and I'm not sure it will fix the problem.

 

Thanks a lot!
