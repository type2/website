When I replaced my pop-up canvas, I reused the original white plastic tack strips.  Tack strips are used to prevent the fabric from puckering between
the tacks.  Also to keep the stress distributed so that the fabric does not
tear at the tack.  Steel tack strips could leave rust stains, and cardboard
tack strips could get soggy.  So plastic is the right stuff for this job.

If you don't want to reuse, just buy new tack strips from any good
upholstry supply.  They are a commodity in the upholstry trade.

Shrinkage?
The notion of boiling them and stretching them makes me wonder.  What if
the plastic shrinks back to the original length after tacking them down?
