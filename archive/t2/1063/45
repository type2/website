The old school archives search engine is currently still under repair. 
There is a note mentioning this, along with links to a temporary search
engine, on the archive page itself.  While it only searches only the

I did a couple of queries for 'full width', 'middle bench', etc, but had
minimal luck finding anything related directly to the full width middle
bench.  Maybe someone will chime in.

Peace, Troy
