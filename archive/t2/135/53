This list is about 98% street/road T-II's. In this context, giant carbs 
have no place. Indeed, others have corrected me on the 48 IDA dual throats. 
Still way too big a carb for a T-II on the streets. Could they even be 
fitted without cutting the engine overhead??? I'm a rationalist.

Perfectly proper use for it. Pouring it in your crankcase however is 
against factory advise for good reason.

It's not my wisdom. It merely the process given in Bentley. I just read the 
book and understand the processes by which engineers turn ore into 
maschines. They wouldn't waste the ink to say something unless there was a 
definate reason in was required. That reason will be found in their 
exhaustive test data. I accept their advise because they actually far know 
more than anyone else in the world what works best for their maschines. Who 
might you suggest knows more than they do????? Will any advise do?? 
Testamonials superior for decision making to the rational advise of the 
manufacturers??? The only thing wise about me is I accept the best EVIDENCE 
only. Claims cannot stand even in the shadow of evidence. It's called, 
ignore the bullshit, let's get on with reality.

Not if you want a nice pelt as a keepsake. Then rote skill and quality of 
the blade must come into play.

The 48 IDA's are dual throat. The 40 and 44 IDA's are triples. The triples 
were used as stock on Porsche 911's for several years. The 48's were stock 
on some Ferrari V-12's and likely other Italian supercars.


>Please enlighten me.

I'm enlightened by German technical process. I find it in the manuals of 
all German cars. You can find it there as well. There is much truth in 
wives tales.

How many Germans does it take to screw in a light bulb??????  NONE, if it 
was manufactured, installed, maintained and operated to German specification.
