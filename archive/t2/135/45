Subject: Gas heaters available

Hey Y'all,
I have finally put together a gas heater to work for my bus. I have been "collecting" a few different styles of gas heaters for the purpose of finding the one that I could make work best. Long story short, I have two 6 Volt stewart warner south wind gas heaters that I do NOT need. Both are complete and both seem to operate properly when 6 volts is applied. One appears to be in very good condition, and I tried to get it to ignite, but it started to leak some gas before the burner ignited, so I turned it off right away.  The other will need the fuel pump rebuilt (at least). Both fans on both heaters work, as do the spark plugs.  
Anyway, I'd like to trade these for bus parts. I have a 71 Westy (which doesn't need much) and a  Kombi (which needs ALOT, mostly interior parts and glass).  I am in Cincinnati, Ohio but could ship the heaters easily enough.
Anybody need these and have some stuff they want to trade?



Peace, John Baker
