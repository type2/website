I don't think I've ever heard of anyone converting a gas bus to run that VW
1.6l diesel. Let's start with the 47 brake horsepower the 1.6l Rabbit diesel
puts out. 

Lots of people have put gasoline Rabbit engines in the diesel Vanagons--if
you change out the oil pan, they go in okay. The other way around is no
good--the Bus gets real slow in short order.
