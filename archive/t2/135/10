Subject: WTB..Vanagon 80-83 propane tank

Title says it gang....I'm in need of a Westy propane under body tank
complete with valves (hose optional, but could use it too) for my 80
Westie project bus "Bluenose"

It goes to paint this week...

If anyone knows about availability of the Boogie Woogie Gazelle cloth
anywhere, I'm in need of a few yards to rework the z-bed, rear cushion
and front seats...I "think" that's gonna be my last obstacle to clear
before hitting the road this summer...
