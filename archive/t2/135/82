Subject: Pop Top Canvas Repair

I did it! I managed to get the pop top canvas off, sent in to have zippers 
and screens replaced and actually got it put back on. This is the canvas 
from a 1971 VW Riviera. This stuff isn't actually canvas, it's some sort of 
rubberized nylon. Now that it's back on I notice I have a few pinholes. 
About the size of a nail. Does anyone have any ideas what to use to plug 
these holes? I assume it needs to stay pliable?

I've seen the stuff you spray on tents to seal seams, but these holes are 
bigger than that.
