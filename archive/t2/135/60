48 IDA's are way to big for any street car.  You can try it all you want,
but you will spend a fortune jetting and re-jetting....................

All the motors you mentioned from the VW rags are
hot-rods..................They are not daily drivers.  The people that own
these take them off a trailer at the shows and probably drag them.

Much better off to get carbs that are close to the size you need to start
with.  Those 48's look impressive, but few cars can use them, and even fewer
people have the patience, money and experience to tune them right.

IDA's at that.

of Hot VW's running a 1835cc with twin 48 IDA's.

way wrong as well.

2332cc equipped 59 Sunroof bug that runs bored our 52mm IDA's with 46mm
venturis.

no back seat, spindle front wheels & a full rollcage.

Liquid Wrench or.......surprise, surprise....Marvel Mystery Oil & the
technical staff actually used the Marvel product.
