Hiya Michael,

I had this happen to me a while back on my 70.  I looked over a spare lid 
latch I had and determined that I just might be able to insert a long thin 
screwdiver between the lid and the lid seal and gently work it up to push the 
latch arm up and off the body catch.  I had to insert the screwdriver in the 
"seam" just to the side of the latch and proceed upward at a pretty steep 
angle.  While I did this I was pulling firmly on the latch to open that 
"seam" as much as possible.  Took a few tries, but it did work for me.  When 
I did feel the "contact" with the arm I relaxed my pull on the latch and gave 
the screwdriver a gentle push.  Didn't wind up with any scatches either.  By 
the way, I did not have the rear bumper on at the time.  If it is there, 
space might be tight.
