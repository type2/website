personal opinion only

  I have a 78 and drive it year round, and ski so I drive in some pretty
cold places.   in any case my heating system was totally shot when I got
the bus (8 years ago) 
   I have totally removed the heating system including the fins, so I have
naked pipes.   what I have done is put a gas heating system under the
front of the bus taking the imput air from behind the dash and routing it
back into the central duct above the front beam.
   When it is working right I can drive with a light jacket unzipped in
below zero weather with the wind blowing....durning the summer I disconect
the flame blower and gas pump and use the air blowers for defrost, I used
the A/C blowers for the heat when I removed what was left of the A/C
