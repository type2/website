It's easy. Bolts right in.  Use the corvair transmission too. You can get
the transvair kit from Clark's Corvair.  It makes it run a whole lot better
than with the weak vw engine.  No modification is necessary to the bus if
you are careful.  I would advise against using the VW transmission with the
Corvair engine.  If you use the corvair tansmission you don't have to
reverse the engine or any of that nonsense.  The parts are widely available
despite what some VW people would tell you.  The gas mileage is at least as
good with a corvair engine in there. I have a '70 "transvair."  It is pretty
nice and you wouldn't believe how much more power there is. It has great
torque.  You have just the right year to use in your conversion too.
Automatics or standard can be used.   GW
