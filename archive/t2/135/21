Subject: Buses by the Buoy

Postings abound about the location and dates for BbtB. Nothing has has
yet been decided by the sponsoring group i.e. Vacationland Volkswagen
Assn.
Please do not make plans or reservations yet.

Buses by the Buoy will be held probably Sept. 13, 14, 15, but all plans
are still tentative.

Info will be sent to the groups and at VVA's web page:

Also, if anyone has a valid phone number or mailing address for Rich
Young the VVA would like to have it.

Michael King for VVA
