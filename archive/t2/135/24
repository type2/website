Subject: Help-engine lid won't unlock!

Arrgh- had to test the engine lid key (kept in its magnetic box)- locked
fine, but will not unlock! Key slips in, will not turn; tried lubricant,
nada- Anyone (like the locksmith here) know how to break into this? 
Unlike the hatchlid, you can't push in the button when locked.  I don't
mind destroying the lock (have extra nonlocking type) but don't want to
wreck the lid.  Adding oil/cheching timing will be mighty tough through
the upper inside hatch!!
