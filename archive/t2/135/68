Thanks for the responses guys. They all confirmed what I had assumed
anyway. It is really not made for an adult. Jamie I wasn't going to make
my dad sleep up there I was thinking of myself.
I do have another rig I can set up there similar to what Adam has built.
I just need to fabricate one more piece. All will be fine.
