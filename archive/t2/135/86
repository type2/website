From the little german I remember...

  Bezeichnuwg: kugelkopf (ball type hitch)
  Tye: KA Grobe:36 Baujehr: 1956 (Type: KA, Size: 36, Manufactured:
1956)
  Zul Anhangelast Dis 1100 kg (Tounge Weight: 1100kg)
  Prurzoichen:  H.524

The last line im not sure of, but I think it pertains to the metal used,
as I said, I don't remember too much german, so I could be wrong on some
of this.

      Hi All.

    I thought I'd post a few items I have for sale.

   First is what appears to be a trailer hitch with built in ball for a
split window bus. I acquired this years ago and have no use for it.
There are 2 chain hooks on it as well as an electrical socket for
lights. It has surface rust and is dirty but looks all there. There is a
small data plate on it with the following:

      Westfalia-Werk Wiedenbruck
  Bezeichnuwg: kugelkopf
  Tye: KA Grobe:36 Baujehr: 1956
   Zul Anhangelast Dis 1100 kg
   Prurzoichen:  H.524

  I have no idea what this means except maybe 1100kg tongue weight. The
writing on the plate is very small so there may be some errors in my
writing.

  I also have a trailer hitch I pulled off The Contraption (73 Westy)
that bolts to the frame using the existing bumper bracket hardware.  As
well I have a mount for a nose mounted spare tire.

I will probably bring these items to Everybus with me if anyone is
interested.

Thanks
