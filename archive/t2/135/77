For those of you that have seen several of my posts....

Here is the refer battery update.=20

1) After using the type 2 library I was able to determine that the =
intermittent nature of the refer running on A/C converter was the result =
of the fuse in the power converter slowly working loose in the holder. I =
have now pinched the holder tighter and will replace with an inline fuse =
holder if it continues.
2) My battery isolator is fully manual. After stopping the engine I have =
a marine type switch in the engine compartment that upon switching to =
"off" isolates the batteries.
3) I purchased a Trojan deep cycle battery (they make marine and golf =
cart batteries) for the aux battery and it now will run the refer on =
battery for 8 hours. Also provides great protection from STD's.
4) Running on the A/C converter I filled my ice trays and had solid cold =
ice in 1 hour. Way Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
5) I had the coldest best tasting beer I have every had at the end of =
this episode. The Germans know what temp a cold beer is supposed to be =
and the refer seems to understand that.
