Subject: 77 Bus down 28 miles east of Ely Nevada

I just had a "Chuck" Call me from Reno who was in touch with  "down" 
bus owner who is supposedly broken down 28 miles east of Ely Nev. 
(US50)

Anybody in that area?  The message I got is that the rocker arm studs 
sheared off.  I have parts but am 200 miles away.


Airs doesn't have very good coverage in this area.  Anyone in Delta 
or Cedar City, Utah.

I wanted to work on my new project Vanagon Today, not take a road trip.
