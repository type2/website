Subject: octane and timing

hello all,

allow me to rephrase my previous post as simply this.

what type of feul(octane rating) do y'all use and
where is your timing set? what type of results does
this yield for you? now, i have a 76 Type IV FI so
info pertaining to that is best, but its all good:-)

thanks in advance. as always any answers, opinions, or
insights will be greatly appreciated.
