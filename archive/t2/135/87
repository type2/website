Subject: Autozone Half shafts

I've been using these for years on my A-1s & A-2s.  Never had any 
problems.  Glad to see that they now offer Transporter shafts.  The 
last ones I had done were from a local rebuilder.  Works great but 
not lifetime warrantee.  I have put 5 sets of brake pads on my 88 
Bronco II with this warranty,  AKA 500,000 miles.  All for one low 
initial price!  $20.  I hate myself but I do it anyway.
