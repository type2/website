I disagree. You have no evidence at all that the snakeoyl had anything to 
do with longevity. You just assume it so so you can think yourself wise for 
spending the money on snakeoyl.

Most on this list will testify that I am rarely if every tongue tied. Wrong 
again.

Don't need facts so don't need to listen to those with the most facts in 
hand, the engineers who designed and manufactured the vehicle. So good to 
know we have someone on the list to testify his subjective experiences have 
more weight than the factory.

No problem with anyone giving testimony of their experiences and 
conclusions based upon subjective observations. It just can't replace real 
data in a rational sence.

Others who maintain their engines spec with no snakeoyl at all can testify 
to the same great service. This would seem to back up the factory advise as 
at least equivalent to your assumed beliefs.

I know, you believe you are invincible.

You believe it works for you, you don't know it works for you. There is a 
big difference that you will never understand unless and until you develop 
rational thought.

Sell it to Marvel. They gladly accept unsolicited testamonials.

This is what you have said repeatedly to convince yourself that facts are 
inferior to belief. This is the tech of claims and testimonials. Repeat 
over and over until someone else believes it and you become validated in 
your own personal reality.

Sold you so it must be very convincing.
