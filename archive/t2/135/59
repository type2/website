Subject: Troy's engine/trans leak-Everybus goers note-

Regarding Troy Wical's leak from the trans/engine mate:
How far is Everybus for you?  If it is tranny oil (likely- does it smell
like rotten eggs or sulphur?) , figure out how fast you are losing it-  
Running it standing still won't help-even in neutral, clutch out, not
all is thrashing there.  Jack up the wheels and use jack stands.  Use
the bottom of the shock mount if you have a floor jack.  You gotta get
the tranny moving in gear, so run it in gear, wheels spinning, and check
it out- what's the rate of loss?  (how long to fill 1/4 cup?) If it's a
rate that will let you add a quart every 100 mi, then go to Everybus if
you are unconfidant about dropping your engine and assume 100 bussers
will help or collectively have along: Gallon of GL4 tranny oil and a
pump
or a qt high nozzle-cap bottle with a 1 foot hose (1/4" ID attached.
Engine seal (flywheel + crank seal), tranny shaft seal + second set if
you bung up the first), seal remover (has a hook shape at end), spare
clutch disk, carb cleaner (for cleaning oil off surfaces), rags/paper
towel rolls, a floor jack or at least 2 scissors jacks, a board
(plywood, 3/4" thick, about 2x1 foot to span under engine including
heater boxes), a small sledge for positioning jack or board, a piece of
pipe, 1", about 6" long to seat the trans seal, and engine dropping
tools (closed wrench for engine/tranny nuts, sockets/wrench for engine
bearer nuts, socket for accelerator cable clamp (8mm?), socket for
shrouding bits under engine (10mm),socket for clutch release/flywheel
(14mm?)-ie, have a set!), channel lock pliers/vice grips for oil fill
end pipe clamp, Philips head screwdriver/sockets for shroud connectors,
masking tape to mark hose/wire  ends, clutch alignment tool (actually
you can use a socket extension and eyeball the centering), a means to
plug the gas line (hoses good? Get needlenose vise grips, grind the tips
round and clamp the line; if unknown, bring a pencil!), a deep roasting
pan to catch gas, and if we don''t have a concrete pad or parking lot, a
board about 2.5' by 4' to roll the jack on.  While the family uses the
house bit, you and 100 kibitzers can work on the engine.
