Subject: some brake trouble...

hey everyone, i have a few questions. my 77 westy is having some brake 
trouble. here's the problem, when i press down on the brake pedal, the brake 
pedal is very sluggish to come back up. i have replaced the mastercylinder, 
calipers, and all other brake thing, except booster before i have run into 
this problem. i took the front pan off of the bus and sprayed all the linkage 
with oil and nothing has helped so far. im not sure what could be the 
problem. any suggestions? Thanks.
