Not to argue completely with this statement but other groups are involved
here that may skew some "facts"...The engineers may design the vehicle 
but the cost accountants have a great deal to say about the manufacture;
as do the regs in the countries where the vehicle is sold. The fact that non-
USA type 2's were carbed and USA ones went to FI is a case in point. I sus-
pect that price also is a deciding factor in what "stock" is - Boss Kettering
Engineering as opposed to the more analytical engineers...Hard to tell which
group has the final say...
