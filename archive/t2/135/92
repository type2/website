Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)


Problems with this that must be overcome.

Spezial oil pan, spezial engine mounts, spezial lower engine cover, spezial 
manifolds and induction parts, spezial exhaust parts, spezial bent lever on 
the injection pump, spezial fuze box with conversion of the harness, 
glowplug circuit to the dash must be installed, transaxle ratios from gas 
engine will not fit very different torque curve of the diesel. That's just 
off the top of my head. There will be other issues, but those are the ones 
that might cause real difficulty in getting to safe and reliable use for a 
reasonable investment of time/money. As an experiment, you could learn much 
in the attempt, but that doesn't necessarily mean you will get the results 
hoped for, ie, saving time/money by using the used motor at hand.
