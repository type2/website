It has been my experience that it is very difficult to tell by eye or feel 
which type of lube is leaking, engine or tranny, certainly not 
conclusively. However, tranny lube does have a decidedly sulfer smell and 
motor does not. This is only the case with dyno lube. I don't have a clue 
what synthetic gear lube smells like, but some of them are dyed blue.
