And your data, please??? Your response is just a testimonial, with citings 
of other testimonials.

So you must have data??? Did you put engines through hundred hour torture 
testing with and without the snakeoyl having weighed all the bearings both 
prior to and after testing to determine precise wear measurements????  Give 
us your observed bearing clearances on a particular new assembly, then the 
maintenance schedule for life to failure and the observed bearing clearance 
upon teardown, with the hours and milage of operation. You see what I mean. 
The factory engineers have so much more real data than you or any of us 
that you look rediculous in comparison. My only opinion is, that they know 
more than you, so do as they direct if you expect to get the kind of 
results they expected.



>I have used Marvel Mystery oil in a broad expanse of many vehicle's,

Show me your broad expanse of data. Extends beyond the factory data???

>Nor have I ever had any rings seize in their grooves, or lifter's
>fail,or stick------period.

The same can be said of spec motors with adequate maintenance and no 
snakeoyls at all. What does this prove??????

So has sin.

So how would you know if the proper maintenance alone was not responsible 
for good results??

The German seats NEVER had a problem with no-lead. Overheating from poor 
maintenance and adjustment is the foundation of most valve failures.
