yes the oil issue is almost a religious ferver and I tend to avoid getting
sucked in (and I'll probably regret it this time) but personally I just
avoid the whole issue and run a full synthetic lubricant, I am positive
(I've seen the data) that Mobil, Pennzoil, and the other big manufacturers
have done millions of dollars worth of testing before releasing thier
concoctions on the motoring public, At $4 a quart I better dang cite not
need any snake oyle in there.

IMO, YMMV
