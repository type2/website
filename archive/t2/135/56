That's a valid point. But with regard to the recommendations against 
snakeoyls in the manuals, that didn't come from accountants or the USA EPA. 
It came from the Neandereers who have the relevant, repeatable, very costly 
to obtain, test data. We're talking hard scientific research and 
development as opposed to claims and testimonials of masses of laymen. 
Charlatans have existed since the serpent in the garden. It's just we are 
more blind and unknowing today than perhaps at any other time in human 
history. The serpent lives on and is ecstatic at the rise of ignorance and 
the acceptance of belief "because it makes me feel good" despite opposing 
proofs of truth that makes you feel bad to have to bear upon yourself the 
responsibility of seeking the truth. So much easier to accept what people 
say than to work to find out what is right.

My last word on snakeoyl in your crankcase. ALL COMPETANT AUTHORITY SAYS 
NO. I believe I won't use it, thank you, regardless the opinions of laymen, 
though they number in the millions and all believe what the serpent says.
