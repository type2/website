sound like an engine pull just might happen if your up to it. I know I
can at least pitch in several hours & I'm sure others can as well.
here is a list of sime things you will need.

o-ring for flywheel, bus/Vanagon $1.50  021 105 279  
flywheel mounting washer 72-83 bus/Vanagon $0.95  021 105 275  
Rear Main Seal, Viton, 17-2000 $6.95 $28.00  029 105 245B 
assorted shims (there might be a shim kit out there I don't know)

I pulled these from Ron's site (busdepot.com) so these should be
pretty good $ figures. I would hurry and jump on the ordering if you
are really going to try.

You also should look into replacing the flywheel bolts. These bolts
have a flange on the shread side which will "dig" into the washer in
order to help it hold better & not back out. I'm not sure what the
part number is but I believe it's a M12x1x22 bolt.
