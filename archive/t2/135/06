Hi all!

Its been awhile since I've posted. I've been out of the country for a while 
and just got back home and to my camper. Before I left I had the engine on my 
71 westy rebuilt and she was running great. I knew it was running a bit hot, 
but I was at that mark to have the valves readjusted and did that yesterday. 
I was just wondering if I should have been using a lead additive in my gas 
this past hundred miles or so. The rebuild is fresh, and I used no lead 
additive. I was once told if you rebuild, you can get away with a low octane 
unleaded fuel, but I'd like the wisdom of the list members. 

Also, before I left I noticed my headlights were running dim, so I removed my 
housings and reground all the lights, replaced the fuses. Now I have bigger 
problems. My headlights come on when I start the bus. My turn signals work 
when they want to. My brake lights don't come on when the pedal is pressed, 
but I have rear lights. No reverse lights at all, under any circumstances. I 
looked in the archives, but found nothing useful to me. How did I screw this 
up?

Any and all help is greatly appreciated! 

Thanks!
