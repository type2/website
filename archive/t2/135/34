Subject: Parts needed at EveryBus

Hi,

I have two humble requests for parts. If anyone has them and would 
like to "unload " them while they are at EveryBus, I would be very 
appreciative.

#1 A set of curtain rods from a Westfalia. I need all and then some 
one to put curtains in my 68 that has no closet. So that would be 2 
for the rear hatch, the curvy one over the sliding door and one for 
each of the 3 other windows. I think 68 to 73 have one long one on 
the passenger side and nothing on the right rear because of the 
closet. For 74 up I am not sure how the layout works. If you have 
them and can bring them to EveryBus that would be cool Juat contact 
me.

#2 This is for my main man, Roy. Roy has a 76 Westy but does not have 
the rear table. He has the arm but needs the table top and whatever 
the mounts are underneath it. I think this table has a flip up leaf 
as well. If you have and want to sell it and can bring it to EveryBus 
please email me with you price.

Thanks!!!!!!!
