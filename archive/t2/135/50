Thanks, Steve- 
"Try a few shots of spray carb cleaner, then work the 
key in and out, followed by WD40.  If you get it open, I'd again flush
it  then lube it with Tri-Flow."- 

After noting I'd have to be a contortionist to reach the 2 screws on the
latch visible from the inside hatch, I tried Steve's approach-
The flushing worked- I tried the key while holding the button out and
wiggled it enough so it finally turned...since I don't plan to be in
cities for the forseeable future, I will leave it unlocked!
