Subject: FS in Fresno, Calif.

I sent this to both lists because of the wide variety.

In todays Fresno Bee:

VW 1975 Safari van, fridge, stove, runs great, $2500 OBO 559-438-4355

VW 1971 bus, good cond, new engine, $2700 559-224-5562

VW 70 bus, rebuilt engine, clean, $2900 OBO, 559-439-7728

VW 66 bus, needs clutch cable, $2200 OBO, 559-435-2933
(??? you would think putting a $5 clutch cable in would improve the chances of
selling it.....must be something else wrong)

VW bus complete '66 front end $175, complete transaxle $125
559-960-0589 Kingsburg [south of Fresno]

VW bug and fastback engine parts: carbs, intakes, distributors, generators,
etc $5-$25  559-222-9584

Now you know as much as I do:))
