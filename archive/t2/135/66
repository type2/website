Subject: RE: [T2] Oil substance leaking at rapid rate ---UPDATE

Ok,
	Looks like its engine oil. Don't know if I should allow a sigh
of relief or not.  But somethings tells me that this will be easier to
keep going than if it were tranny oil.  So, from what I have read, I
most likely will still have to drop the engine.  After reading the
archive and such on this, I thought that I may actually be able to
handle this.  But, a few more sips of coffee tells me that I have hardly
any of the tools needed to do this.  And not enough money to go and buy
them.  Looks like the engine oil went down about a half a quart or less.
	The list never fails to amaze me.  **questioning myselft-->
"Would bussers really be willing to spend their weekend at Everybus
helping me drop my engine?"   This is truly amazing.  I would love to do
this, but almost feel bad about asking.  Please let me know if there is
a way that this could be done.  I really have no other option.  I would
be willing to spend any extra money I have to get tools if needed
(Granted that's not much $)  Also, what seal is it that I would need to
get?  Should I get other seals to replace while I am at it?  I can't
thank the list enough and truly appreciate what you have all done.

Sincerely

Troy Wical
