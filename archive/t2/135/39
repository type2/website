troy,
	Well, if you are leaking a lot of oil it will show up in the oil
level that you see in the stick. Make sure the bus is level when you
check it, or else you could miss a loss simply b/c the bus is sitting
differently. Did you put your finger in the oil to see how viscous it
is? Gear oil from the transaxle is going to be very thick. Even hot it
should be much thicker than the regular engine oil. This might be a
good time to check your transaxle oil level. Parked on level ground
the level should be just level w/ the bottom w/ the fill hole on the
side.

If you are leaking gear oil, there might be a good chance it has
contaminated your clutch. Have you noticed any slippage? Hopefully
it's something simple. See you at EB.
