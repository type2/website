Subject: engine lid lock

Although you tried lubricating it, it may be that it is stuck due to old or 
improper lubricant.  Try a few shots of spray carb cleaner, then work the 
key in and out, followed by WD40.  If you get it open, I'd again flush it 
then lube it with Tri-Flow.  If all else fails. it can be drilled out, but 
that will destroy the lock.  Email me if you need more help.
