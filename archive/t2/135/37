Ok,
            Heres the scenario, or should I say, situation.  I drive to
Asheville, NC from Marion, NC (About 45 minutes.) and park at Best Buy
to go and buy a 128Mb memory stick so I can take lots of pictures at
Everybus.  I come out after being in Best Buy for about and hour, and
there is a puddle of oil below my engine.  Not sure if it was mine or
not, I glanced under the engine for about 20 seconds, in which time 2
drops of oil dripped down.  Now, here is where I am confused.  I check
my oil at every fill up, and the last time would be this morning.  Oil
level was fine.  So, checked it on the spot while at Best Buy, and it's
the same level.  HUH??  It seems to be dripping where the transmission
connects to the front of the engine. (Sorry for the lack of correct
terminology.)  Now, it very well could be my oil and it just isn't
showing much yet.  But, is there other stuff the needs to be checked?
Anything that could be coming from the transmission?  Top of the engine
is not oily at all, just bottom.  Hope I have provided enough info.  I
am worried because I would hate to miss my first chance to get the
Everybus.  If they will help, there is a slew of pics of my bus at
www.wicals.com <http://www.wicals.com/>  But none are of the bottom of
the engine.  I will take some pics tomorrow.  Thanks for the help
everyone.
 
Oh, by a guess, I would have to say that after an hour, there was about
2oz + of oil on ground.
