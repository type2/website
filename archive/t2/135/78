Subject: diesel conversion (some questions)

hello,

im considering trying to swap out my 2.0 Type IV for
the 1.6 Diesel that is in my rabbit. i remember
reading an artical once about a guy who put a GTI
engine in a diesel vanagon with good results. i know
that a vanagon is already setup for water cooloing
however i have a variety of ideas of how to work that
out.

what i am wondering is...

what is HP of the 2.0 Type IV compared to the 1.6
Diesel? if anyone knows HP of both GREAT but all i'm
really looking for (from this list) is the HP figure
for the 2.0 Type IV.(searched archives for this to no
avail)

also, does anyone know of anyone who has done this
conversion or something similiar? perhaps a website or
email address would be helpful.

thanks very much. as always any answers, opinions or
insights will be GREATLY appreciated!!!! thanks
again!!!
