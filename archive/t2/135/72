Anyone with a lead on a Westy Deluxe "countertop"...
covers the sink/stove when not in use?
My laminate is shot - last woodwork needed on my
beautiful Petunia.

I also had a damaged counter lid in my 79 Westy and
found a cabinet shop in Reno, and after looking
through hundreds of samples of laminate, found a
'perfect' match and I now have a new lid that even
when I tell people that it's a replacement they still
cannot tell the difference. I'm telling ya it is a
perfect match down to the black edging.
I have considered having a few made and offering them
to the list members if there is enough demand.
