Subject: Washers sprung a leak

It finally happened.  The window window washer system spring a leak, a few
inches away from the steering column.

What's the popular way to upgrade this to a motorized system?  I can get a
pump from FLAPS and hide a micro-switch in the steering column.  What has
anyone else done?
