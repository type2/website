Subject: RE: tired--Vredestein vs. Hankook RA08

Just to clarify, I didn't intend to disparage the Hankook, I am still glad
for my purchase of the tire, and its high load rating in the correct size.
I may buy 2 more of them after I drive them for a while.  just comparing the
visual impression to the Vredestein Comtrac.

The (non-winter) Comtracs on my bus in 185R14C are stamped with a maximum
load rating of 1874 lbs, load index 102, Load Range D.  The Hankooks have
the same markings.  I don't really see a downside either!!
