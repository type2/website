I corrected my Dad with whom I debate "issues" often. He too mentioned that 
Chrysler invented the mini-van and noticing my raised eyebrows he corrected 
himself saying the first "modern minivan"... <grin!> Well if we were in 
1968 the 1968 VW van would be as modern as they come... That doesn't even 
mention the numerous little Fiat people carriers. I often drove a Fiat 
Panorama van in Italy. Imagine a 80% scale van of the VW version...

The older I get the less I like the marketing guys... For one there is a 
whole portion of the population that takes their word as gospel and then 
goes out the spread the misinformation.

While I like the styling and ads done with a crayon wouldn't be as 
entertaining, there sure are alot of lies flying around from those guys. 
FWIW I consider the magazine industry to be part of the marketing process. 
They may review a product but they are about as impartial as the Pope is 
about certain lifestyle topics... <griN>
