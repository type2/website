Subject: RE: [T2] Rust

In regards to the muffler rust thread:  I have been running the
stainless set up from the bus depot for about 2-3 years now. I only have
rust on the bolt on tip section.  The rest of the muffler has that hot
stainless look sans rust.  If BD could carry a stainless muffler tip it
would be a complete rust free setup.  I love POR 15/20 as much as the
next person, but I believe the analogy that 'you cannot pave the world'
applies here...
