I have driven the I-15/I-70 route (haven't taken the I-40 route) and can
say this that the route is a long beautiful drive. in the winter be
prepared for LOTS of snow and in Utah it can be many miles between exits.
I have a photo taken on I-70 in Western Utah that warns "Check gas, next
services 112 miles"  and they weren't kidding,  going from West to East I
would make sure your brakes are in top notch condition there were a few
many mile long steep down grades.  especially the front range coming into
Denver.  I drove it in Sept and it was still plenty hot in places. so take
it easy, make sure your AAA is paid up and take your time, stop often and
enjoy the scenery.  you will be by far the slowest thing on the road too,
don't think anyone was even close to following the speed limit and in some
places I seem to recall it being 70mph.  oh and be sure and stop in
Glenwood Springs and marvel at the Glenwood canyon coming out of Glenwood
springs you go right down the bottom of the canyon.  if you are brave
and your bus is behaving the climb over Loveland pass on the Eisenhower
tunnel bypass is fantastic.

take your time, enjoy the trip and stop often to admire the view, and
don't forget to look down the wild flowers are beautiful
