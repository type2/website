I just wanted to know the price , well !!! new engine , what not puting 
a new wiring harness if it's not expensive.
I know I have a problem with my engine, I was never able to start my 
engine again (imediately after I bought it !! ;-)   )
I test the coil , Idle stabilizer , etc ....  with no success.
