These are the most common part numbers for ignition components used on the bus:

http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#B1972

Points: 01 011
Condensor: 02 054 (round) or 02 074 (square)
Rotor: 04 033
Cap: 03 010
Ignition Wires: 09 171
Spark Plug: W8CC

Before buying a condenser check to see if it's the square or round plug variety.
