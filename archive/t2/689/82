Chuck,

I had heard that someone was going to re-pop them....West Coast metric had 
them late last year...

http://www.westcoastmetric.com/latebus.php?Section=Headliners%20and%20Interior&stat=1

Your originals will probably *not* survive...they "good" ones I got for my 
bus from Bisted Bus several years ago were in fair shape...amazingly 
so...but I still fiberglassed them on the inside to make sure they would 
stay good for awhile.

Took lots longer to do that than buy new ones!

Cheers, dave
