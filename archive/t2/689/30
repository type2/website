Subject: TCWBC Haiku contest update

Hi Volks,

There have been some good entries to the TCWBC Haiku Contest submitted
so far.... There's no cost to enter, and you don't have to attend the
campout to win. (We do reserve the right to share costs on overseas
shipping if required.) Email your Haiku to me on or before Feb 7th,
2005.

If you're someplace near Southern Ontario, jonesing for a campout and
can't wait for spring, please visit the website for details:

We also have T-shirts ($12cdn) and "hoodie" ($30cdn) sweatshirts being
screen-printed by suburban design corp, if you'd like to order please
email adam at suburban(-at-)busesofthecorn.com.

Here are some of the Haiku submitted thus far:

Cold Westies shiver
As the day's light slowly comes
Campfires and coffee.
(Stephen)

Gray skies meet white fields
Westies circle unbroken
Bound by fire and friends.
(Stephen)

The heat doesn't work
Frost covers the orange bay
Spring warmth please save us.
 (Michele)

Driving mostly blind
Eyes straining to see through frost
Ker-bang! What was that?
(Tstone8359)

Heater cables broke
Bungee open the levers
The smell of hot oil
(Tstone8359)

Only three weeks left until the first Canadian Bus Campout of 2005!

Happy trails,
