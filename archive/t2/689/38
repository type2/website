One problem, Rick, is "mods" in a bus. Think hard about whether you are 
the sort of person who keeps things until they absolutely wear out, or 
whether you buy things and then sell them later to get something else. 
If you are the latter, DON'T mod. If you are under 30, you don't even 
know what you are yet. DON'T mod. But if you're the former, go ahead. 
It would still be smart to keep up the heat exchangers, and plumb into 
them the way the Neverbachers were.

What you need to be sure of is that these operate when the vehicle is 
in motion. Some propane devices do, some don't.

While you are in this inquisitive mood about heat, go to westmarine.com 
and look at their boat heaters. Look, in particular, at the Force 10 
heater. This isn't necessarily easy to install in a bus, but it doesn't 
require electricity to operate and it can be used with the bus in 
motion. In fact, I think it's engineered to work even if you roll 
(capsize, that is) your bus.
