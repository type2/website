I've always been under the impression that mufflers tend to rust from
the inside out - at least, that's what mine seem to do. Probably from
condensation collecting in low points... anyway, it seems that a rust
preventative paint such as POR-20 wouldn't do much good at preventing
this, unless you painted the INSIDE of the pipe? Or does it somehow
permeate the metal and protect?

I do know that POR-15 won't stop rust if painted only on one side of a
rusty panel. It still seems like a great product, and one that I'll be
relying on when it comes to fixing up my bus!

Cheers!
Mike.
