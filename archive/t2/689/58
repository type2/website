List,

germansupply.com is not just me, in fact it was started by Collie, AKA
Collison Corner, who has been around this list a lot longer that I have. We
run it together, he is the brains, I am the muscle :-). About 6 months ago I
began doing most of the order processing, phone answering and email, and we
both love being part of the type2 list, which is great community.
