Patrick, a good way to try and determine if it's a clutch problem is
to have the engine not running and see if it's possible to move
through the gear pattern w/out any problems. The inability to change
gears when the engine is off greatly increases the chances that
something transmission wise if foul, as opposed to the clutch not
doing it's job.
