As someone who has made the trip from behind the Orange Curtain to 
Colorado Springs, I can tell you the quickest route is through Vegas 
and up the Western side of the Rockies.

However, the Southern route is what my parents took (almost always) 
when they had their 1969 Westy...in 1969. My dad, a fighter pilot at 
the time, just could not stand the thought of crawling at a snail's 
pace up and down mountains. No fool, was he.

Easiest option is Southern route. WAY easier.

Just my 2.773 centavos.
