The RA08's were a current model as of two months ago when I met with Hankook
at the SEMA trade show.  I talk to the Hankook rep regularly and he's never
mentioned them being discontinued, and they're still on the Hankook website.
Also Hankook always fills my orders for them, and had more delivered from
their factory as recently as a month ago, so it would seem there's an
ongoing supply. They do tend to have trouble meeting my quantity demands
(resulting in intermittant backorders of a week or so) but their promised
shipments always do arrive. I'll ask my rep again, because if they go
obsolete I'll want to stock up, but I'd be surprised. Perhaps Hankook simply
isn't offering them in Canada. They consider it a "specialty" tire here in
the U.S., so even in the States its distribution is fairly limited.

Continental sells different reinforced tires in different markets, so the
ones sold in Canada may or may not be the same ones sold in the U.S. While
Continental was an original supplier of the Bus tire, the one commonly seen
in the U.S these days (the Vanco-8) is a light truck tire and not the same
as the original sidewall-reinforced tire they OEM'd for Volkswagen. I'm not
sure what the salesperson you spoke to might mean by "double reinforced."
There is no such designation that I have ever heard of.  I have not tried
the Vanco-8 myself (if this is the one he's talking about) so I can't
comment from personal experience. However, they were discussed briefly on
the Vanagon list back in November. Dennis Haynes (a professional Vanagon
mechanic who is quite well regarded on the list) wrote: "This is a common
tire on the Eurovans. My opinion is that they should be outlawed. Horrible
in the rain, prone to belt shifting and tread separation. As for the ride,
remember kiddy bicycles with the solid tires? And don't even think of using
them in snow."  (As you can see, Dennis doesn't mince words. :-)  Of course
the Conti sold in Canada may not be the Vanco-8. Might be worth checking.
