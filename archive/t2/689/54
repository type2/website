Looks like I may have it traced down to the one-way valve on the brake
booster line...lett off a hissing sound.

> When was the last time the fuel pump filter was changed? You might
have an issue with something plugging the pump that caused that severe
engine dip/surge. The very best way to completely diagnose the FI
system is to go get the few tools you need to check the system, then
follow every step in the Bentley FI section to a tee, something will
not check out.

BTW, my guess is you still have a vacuum leak of some sort
