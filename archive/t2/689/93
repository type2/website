some years ago (not sure if it is still around) there used to be an auto
mag sort of like Consumer Reports, it didn't accept advertising etc. and
it did call it like it saw em... there is still an auto show on TV from
Germany (DWTV auto or something) that I can occasionally get and it does
head to head comparisons of similar cars and ranks em 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.

in Any case FWIW, Klick and Klack had a on line car choseing software
program and if you put in your driving habits etc they would tell you what
car was best for you.  I took the test a year or so ago and they sent back
saying that I should get an H1 hummer, but if I didn't have the money for
that I should consider (see bus content) getting a VW van..the best for me
after the original Hummer.

would love to see that software  ;8*}
