LoL!

It's actually stopped raining here in OC for a couple hours now.
However, I just got home. And since the very first thing I need to do
is pull off the HEs and muffler, I'm going to wait till morning so
it's all nice and cool.

That and I really don't wanna do the CVs or brakes in the dark. ;-)
