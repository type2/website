Subject: Travel to Denver: High road or low road?

As ya'll know, I'm driving my bus from Anaheim, CA to Denver, CO. So
while I'm sitting here waiting for folks to wake up so I can start
making noise I'm thinking about my trip plan. Luckily I still have 2
weeks to sort it out so no rash decisions here.

I'm looking at the maps now and find that the "direct" route goes via
I-15 fto I-70. That looks like a pretty steep highway.

The other option is to take I-40 to Santa Fe, NM and then swing north
on I-25 which will dump me right at the office.

While the latter route is about 200 miles longer, is it better for my
bus? Long flats with a gentler grade going into the Denver area as
opposed to going over the mountains from the west? The other vehicles
I own or have owned over the years wouldn't be fazed by either. But I
love my bus more than any other vehicle I've owned (except for maybe
my 1976 280z) and want to give it the easiest option.

Experiences and opinions?
