That's how it starts. You look a these pictures, and start admiring the 
molded polystyrene, and start thinking that your baltic birch looks 
shabby, and next thing you know you've bought a Eurovan and signed off

Don't do it, Anton. Turn back toward the light.

Maybe Ratwell will do a 360 quicktime of his bus. That's half the 
thrill of the MB site, anyway.
