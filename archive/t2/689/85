Csaba,

You need pictures so you can check everything from front to back.

http://www.bus-boys.com/

Scroll down the left side of the page until you find "shifter and Shift 
linkage  68-79 T2"

Look at the pictures.

Then go here http://longenterprises.com/diagram_folder/diagramlist.htm

and look at the shift linkages that are inside the nose-cone of the 
transmission.

http://longenterprises.com/diagram_folder/diag13_irs_type2_002_housings.htm

There is a possibility that something could be broken inside the 
transmission, but most people usually have trouble with the shift rod 
someplace from front to back.

Cheers, dave
