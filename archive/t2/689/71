The Vredestein Comtrac is a great tire.  If it were the same price as the
Hankook I'd have listed both. But considering the price difference, I like
the Hankook better than the non-snow version of the Comtrac. As you noted
it's a lot cheaper, and is better in snow/ice, which appeals to most people
(although even the Comtrac is better than some supposed "all season" tires).
And while the Hankook's sidewall may seem less stiff, in fact it has a
slightly higher capacity than the Comtrac's sidewall. (The Hankook is load
range D with a capacity of 1874 lbs; the Comtrac is load range C with 1800
lbs capacity; an insignificant difference but one that technically favors
the Hankooks.). So I don't see a downside to the Hankooks, despite the lower
price. Maybe the Comtracs would wear better, but then again they have the
same 11mm tread depth so I don't have any particular reason to expect them
to.  (And even if they did, they cost more so they should!)  So I opted to
list the Hankooks in this size. That said, I can get the Comtracs if someone
would like them.

I do list several other Comtracs on my website, both snows and not, in
versions or sizes where I think that tire is the best value. (While the
Hankook RA08 is a good tire, it's only available in 2 sizes and only in
all-season tread, so not everyone can use it.)  For example I list the
185R14 Comtrac Snow (as well as the 185/82R14 Vredestein Snowtrack), and
also non-snow 205R70 and 205/65R15 Comtracs for people who want a larger
tire and/or have larger wheels.

These tires (and others) can all be found at
<http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details/tires.jsp> . If you want a tire not
listed there, email me and I can check on it.
