Although you are replacing only one head, you're taking both off, 
right? Before installing them, you should be dubious about the 
compression ratio on your GEX engine, calculate it, and then correct it 
with shims under the cylinders if needed (probably will be needed). 
You'll need a ring compressor, a special one for VWs but cheap, to add 
shims if needed. Lots in the library about how to calculate CR.

I'll let someone else comment on whether you should use head gaskets or 
not.

You might want to get a new bail for the valve cover. Scott at German 
sells those, I think. You'll have to do an inspection and decide 
whether to replace the valve covers themselves. You will need valve 
cover gaskets.

Yes, the head will be bolt-on. No need to fool with valves and springs 
(let's hope).

New head stud nuts are always nice. Check the rocker screws, replace if 
they're badly worn or pitted. Replace the adjusting nuts just because.

As for the general stuff, like corroded connectors, read through 
ratwell.com, the section on his restoration (engine1-5). Lots of good 
tips there.

It looks sort of like a torx bit, but more points and bigger.
