Interesting. I took the specs I quoted directly off of Vredestein's spec
sheet. But the ones on the sidewall itself would be the most accurate, of
course. Actually this is the second time that I've found a disparity between
the Vredestein technical spec sheet and the tire itself (both slightly in
the tire's favor). Either they need a better proof-reader, or the guy who
wrote the spec sheets was being a little overcautious!
