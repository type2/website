hmmm, my Michelins are getting to be about 5 years and 70,000miles or so
on them and was considering trying to chase down some Agelis tires but was
wondering

I need an agressive all season radial that is good in snow, (I ski)
I also like the looks and handling of the larger 205/70R14 tire

any suggestions other than the Agelis ????  tires still have at least a
year or two of life left in em but need to plan ahead when possible,  I
currently have the Michelin MXT tires on her.  for tires price is not
really a consideration, heck I paid over $125 each for the ones on there,
I don't skimp on tires.   I GOTTA be able to go in the snow but still
drive the interstates in my 78 (overloaded) auto tranny bus.  weight
rating is important.

thanks
Bob
