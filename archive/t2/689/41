Although I'm sure you will without prompting, be sure to thank Richard 
for all the work that went into that site. Also, try to buy something 
from Scott Lyons at German Supply, who provides some kind of 
sponsorship for the site.

There are several suppliers who are helpful to type2.com listees. Scott 
is one. Ron Salmon at Bus Depot is another. Ron gives list members a 
small discount, using the code "list1e" (thats ell-eye-ess-tee-one-ee). 
I've always thought the one was another ell, and I've never gotten the 
discount. But I've always gotten good service from Ron, so I don't 
sweat the discount.

Stan Wilder provides lots of help and advice, and he does ceramic 
coatings for engine parts. Mark Dearing gives lots and lots of good 
advice, but I'm not sure that he offers a service you could use.

And then there's Karl. You'll find out about Karl. Once you get your 
bus running, if you go to any gathering in California, you'll probably 
meet Karl, too. Karl is sort of like the angel Clarence in "It's a 
Wonderful Life."

I'm sure I've left someone out. Hope they're not too mad.

Mark
