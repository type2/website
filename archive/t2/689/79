No.

The next step is to check the plate where the stick shifter bolts to the
floor at the front of the bus. If you have rubber mat or rubber "boot"
at the bottom of the shifter move them out of the way and try to tap the
plate with a big screwdriver handle or wood hammer to see if it moves.
If it does move then you maybe just need to move it back to the correct
location and make it tight.

I don't know how to tell you to put it in the right place. When I do it
I just move it until it "feels good". Someone else might have another
suggestion.

If you move it and still can not get ito all 4 gears then someone else
might be able to tell you of another thing to check.
