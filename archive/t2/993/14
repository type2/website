Hey Frank!  That was the biggest Chilly cooker I have seen! , in fact , the 
fire to go with it was awsome tooo... who built that fire?? 

If you want to see chilly stirred with a canoe paddle!,,, besides all the 
rest of the fun ... then hang out at Dixie Bus ! 

I can't make it this year!  See ya down the road!
