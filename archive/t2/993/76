If you're going to get a small one get two (or more). Keep one in an
accessible spot in the cab and another one at an accessible one in the back,
especially if you're planning on cooking in a camper.

In case there is a fire you'll need to be able to get to one quick, and
you'll never know if the fire can block access to one. Chances are you'll be
able to get to one of the two.

P.S. funny this came up. Just last night I went out to dinner with my
girlfriend and after dinner I turned the headlights on and something under
the dash started to smoke violently. I reacted quickly by killing the
ignition (knowing full well there are always hot wires in there). My next
move was to the extinguisher, but luckily I didn't need it.

Turns out that when I did some work under the dash last weekend the end of
the dimmer lights wire came loose and shorted on one of the heater control
levers. The whole wire melted. I disconnected it from the head light switch
and since it had melted it was shorting several wires out in there. I yanked
(really peeled) the whole wire out and no more smoke. The first indicator
was when i turned the lights on the radio went really quiet. About 3 seconds
later there was smoke. I was lucky. But I had the extinguisher right there
and ready. So you never really know where a fire can start.

I know the dash wiring very well....still curious why the headlight fuse
didn't blow.
