Subject: Re: [T2] E10

I just returned from a ~4,000 mile driving trip around the US.  What I 
found was that E10 was in widespread use, was higher octane than 
petro-unleaded and was usually cheaper than 100% petro-unleaded.  The 
typical gas station sign was as follows:

Regular $2.99 (100% petro, 85 octane)
Mid-Grade $2.93 (10% Ethanol, 87 octane)
Premium   $3.19 (100% petro, 91 octane)

The above was typical of midwest states (KS, SD, MN, WI, IL, etc).  I 
saw no Ethanol in Oklahoma and very little in Texas.

The cheapest fuel I observed was $2.49/gallon for E-85 in WI.  I saw 
E-10 for $2.57/gallon in Bloomington, IL.  Shocking when you consider 
crude set a record high price this week.

Most literature I have read indicates that ethanol use results in about 
a 30% reduction in fuel mileage.  I translated that into a 3% reduction 
for E-10 which, pricewise is more-or-less a wash for equivalent octane 
fuel.  I have run E-10 in my bus with no observed problems but I always 
chose 100% petro fuel for my bus when I had a choice.  I didn't see a 
benefit to counter the risk of putting an alternative fuel in a vehicle 
that was not designed for it.

Sadly, I did not take my bus on the trip.  It is still on jackstands in 
the garage waiting for me to get my priorities sorted out.
