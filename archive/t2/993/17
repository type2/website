Here are the posts for the van this person is selling:

and

After a simple polite question about the busses reliability, I got this
reply from him:

"No they will definetly blow up. Shop elsewhere for gaurantees. You are
BLOCKED."

Now there's a kind VW bus re-seller. Be sure not to ask any questions!
