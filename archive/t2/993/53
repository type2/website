Yeah, I'm thinking more and more that it's a vacuum leak at the manifold head.  Spraying WD40 or other
flammables hasn't resulted in anything totally conclusive, but I'm to the point where I'm just gonna pull the
manifold, remove and inspect the existing crush washers, then throw on new
 washers and see how it does.

Are you really SURE it is 2 and 4??

2 and 4 are the rear cylinders, left and right.

The only thing they have in common is the camshaft....

If you really mean 2 and 4, are you SURE you don't have the 2 and 4 plug wires swapped??
