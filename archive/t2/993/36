Subject: Qu re hard shifting after tranny rebuild

Got 78 Westy back today- all good except shifting with rebuilt Tranny , 
new bushings in shift rod end, shift lever left alone.
Pull it to the left and up from neutral to go to first and it "hangs" 
(never wants to go to first- almost like it's overturning the rod 
towards reverse?).  3/4 gears OK, further right than I am used to, and 
it takes more "ummph" as though a spring is resisting.
1st you feel is very close to 3 (in fact going to 3 I clashed the gears 
sometimes as it was trying to go to first). Goes to second from 1st with 
a reluctant give as though it is hanging before it goes.  The mechanic 
said it was due to a very tight tranny and a sloppy (worn) front 
shifter, and an EMPI would fix it all, as it is a much better shifter. 
(old one had bushing gone in nose cone, but it shifted OK!)  We cleaned 
up and greased the shifter end and socket, reset the plate- slightly 
better but I would not want to be stuck in traffic with it- any 
suggestions- IE, will an EMPI shifter make such a differernce?
