Nope, don't have that kinda cabbage laying around to burn.  Founded in 1976,
my Old Volks Home was once a full time mail-order house manufacturing and
supplying window weatherstrip for Bugs & Buses, then in the 80s I expanded
to include replacement parts for Bugs & Buses.  After many years of no
vacations and health/heart concerns, I closed down, liquidated most (but not
all) the inventory.  These days, I work full-time for a VW related outfit,
but continue to buy and sell the weird, oddball VW item(s) on a part-time
basis.

There's a lot of Old Volks Home repair shops scattered throught the USA.
The one I'm confused the most with is one up near Santa Cruz in Nor Calif,
which as of late has apparently fallen on hard times and has been considered
with not having too good a reputation, based on comments received in recent
emails.
