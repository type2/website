Hi all:

I had the same thing happen last summer.  Coincidentally someone on this 
list at that time had a story about a bus fire.  I replaced ALL the 
hoses and got a fire extinguisher which I keep behind the driver's 
seat.  The Bus has a gravity feed fuel system where a fuel flow can keep 
going even if the pump is off -- right onto the street!

I am glad this one ended happily.

BEN
