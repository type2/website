Over the last few years, I have replaced just about every part of the fuel
line. The part that broke todat was the one section that I overlooked.

Thanks for the advice Christophe. I think that an extinguisher is a good
idea. I am gonna get one of those small Kidde ones from Lowe's or Home Depot
and mount it behind my seat.
