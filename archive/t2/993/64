Subject: Suspension upgrades

Grupp!  I am currently bringing back to "road", my '74 Westy, and perhaps have
put a little more "oomph", in it, but,  I currently have some "wide" audi
wheels and requisite tires, but, should I install the EMPI front and rear sway
bar kit and renew my KYBs front and rear, or should I "back out", and leave
the "westy" as is....factory suspension, etc.?  I love to go through the
"twistys" in the mountains here, and built the motor up enough to do it, now I
have to make the suspension adapt.  Any sugestions are muchly appreciated!
Sid
