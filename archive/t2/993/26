Subject: 411 engine in a bus -Timing question

Hi Volks,

Here's a question for you all to ponder.

I have a 1.7L engine I am working over to put in my bus. It is a high- 
compression engine that originally came with D-jetronic FI and a dual- 
vac distributor P/N 022-905-205H. The timing spec  oldvolkshome gives  
for that configuration is 27 degrees at 3500 RPM.

The oldvolkshome.com advance/retard specs for the 205H distributor  
are as follows:
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 11-13deg Adv; Centrifugal: 10-15deg (-at-)  
1500rpm, 22-27deg (-at-) 3000rpm

When the engine's #1 and #2 rings failed I was running it with L- 
jetronic FI and a distributor from a 2L bus, P/N 021-905-205P, and  
had the timing set at 7.5 degrees BTDC at 900RPM.

Which timing is correct for my setup?  Should I dig out the 205H  
distributor and go with 27(-at-)3500 when I get the engine back together?  
Or should I stick with the 205P and do 27(-at-)3500??

The oldvolkshome.com advance/retard specs for the 205P distributor  
are as follows:
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8.5-11deg Adv (-at-) 7.9 In. Hg;  
Centrifugal: 8-13deg (-at-) 1600 rpm, 20.5-24.5 (-at-) 3400 rpm
Am I correct to assume that means that at 3500 RPM with the 205P I am  
running 7.5 degrees + 13 degrees vacuum + 24 degrees centrifugal = 44  
degrees (-at-)3500


I am thinking that setting it up using the 27(-at-)3500 might be more  
appropriate given that this engine likes to be wound out a bit to get  
to the powerband.  17 degrees is a LOT of extra advance. OTOH much of  
that may be compensated for by the change in the FI brain, etc.

What do you volks think?

Happy Trails,
