Subject: Re: [T2] TDI diesel in a late Bay camper

Kennedy makes the adapter for the early VW diesel to attach to a bus
transmission.  This includes the early eco-diesels and the early
turbos as well.  I talk to Mr. Kennedy about it about 18 months ago.
At that time, he had none in stock, but was making them to order.  My
understanding is that the mount for the TDI is the same as these
earlier engines but the space required is not available unless you're
willing to raise the rear deck.

Regarding hybrid diesels:  they are available in Europe as are many
other vehicle with higher fuel efficiency than the vehicles here.
Then again, fuel is more expensive than is the U.S. so, that stands to
reason.  One of the more frustrating aspects of US' policy is that
many of the European vehicles that would stand a good chance at
success in the U.S. market do not meet our "standards".  They would
require all sorts of retro-fitting, many times adding enough weight to
completely counteract any built in fuel efficiency.  Check out the
European websites of Citroen, Renault, Smart Car.  They all have
vehicles available that get far better fuel economy than most anything
on the road here (including the only Smart car allowed in the U.S).

There are developers that will introduce mass produced cars in the
U.S. that get in excess of 100mpg in the next 10 years....so long as
enough citizens begin to demand it.
