Subject: Re: [T2] E-Brake vs. Foot brake

Assuming the cables are adjusted properly, you might need new cables.
My e-brake was useless until I replaced the cables.  The cable
housings were pretty banged up and rusted.  I can't believe how well
the e-brake works now.

Have you tried greasing the cables where they go through the housings
at the back?
