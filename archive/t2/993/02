What he said about the mustache bar mounts on the rear (RIR) of the

You also will need the '71, one-year-only doghouse front tin for a bus.
The doghouse beetle front tin is smaller than the bus tin.  in a pinch,
you could probably add to the beetle tin to make it work, but you'd be
better off to find the correct tin.
