Feel free to google/mapquest this address.  It is in the correct location

700 Kepler Dr
Mt Vernon, IA 52314

Basic Directions from I-80:  Take Exit 246 and head North on Highway 1 
for 25 miles.  At the intersection of Highway 1 and Highway 30, head 
West 3.5 miles.  Turn onto Kepler Drive and into the park.  The entrance 
of the park is in a grove of trees and is difficult to see.  However, 
that grove of trees is the only cluster of trees on the highway.

Feel free to respond to me with any questions or clarification requests.
