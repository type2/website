just stumbled accross a reciept for some Acetylene, for a 40cu ft tank , a
little one.  it was $40 for the gas, then they charged me $135 for the new
tank, but immediately credited me $135 for my exchange tank.

not sure if that is the going rate for a tank or just what they used for
accounting....
