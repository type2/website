Subject: High Top Camper?

I have one and love it. Plenty of standing room and extra storage above
the cockpit doesn't hurt. From what I understand there were only 700
made by Adventurewagen from California.

Only drawbacks are conventional garages are too low but you can always
have and extra panel added to to your garage. Driving in high winds
isn't the best, then again any Westy in high winds in no joyride!
