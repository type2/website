This may be a dumb/stupid question...

Several years ago I drove my bus from Tuscaloosa, AL (60miles SW of
Birmingham, AL) to Soccoro, NM. In this area of the Southeast, premium
gas is 93 octane. I don't remember where the dividing line was, but
at some point, the highest octane I could find out west was 91 octane.

Why 93 octane in the Southeast and 91 octane out west?

That was an interesting trip. I kept losing oil the whole trip, but
there were no drips under the engine. The back of the bus was covered
with oil drops though. I could never figure out where the leak was
from.  I made it back home ok. Wound up having the engine rebuilt when
I got back from that trip.
