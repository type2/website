Subject: Re: [T2] Side window seal

Jason asked:


For the second time on a row, I have opened my door to find that water is draining out of it! I figure it is
because the water that it hitting my side roll-down windows is simply dibbling down to the bottom and the
running out the door when I open it.

What is that felt-ish seal called that rubs up against your windows when you roll them up and down? Anyone
else replaced it? Common deal? Easy to replace? Anyone for tennis?

What you are referring to are the scrapers:

They do not stop water from entering.

Water will enter when it rains or you wash it.

The door has drain holes on the bottom. They MUST be open.
