More than one vacuum leak? Have you tried spraying your flammable 
spray of choice around the inlet manifold? I have found the plastic 
straws that sprays like WD40 come with to be useful in directing the 
spray to where I want it. Leaks at the bottom edge of the manifold 
can be particularly hard to reach.
