Yeah, I'm thinking more and more that it's a vacuum leak at the manifold 
head.  Spraying WD40 or other flammables hasn't resulted in anything 
totally conclusive, but I'm to the point where I'm just gonna pull the 
manifold, remove and inspect the existing crush washers, then throw on new 
washers and see how it does.

Cheers!
