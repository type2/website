Subject: R-12

To those of you that may be concerned about restoring your AC system to
it's original, maximum operating condition.

I may have available a limited supply of R-12 to bring back the AC
system in your Bus or Van to the way it was when it was new.

Drop me a line if you may be interested in eliminating the low quality,
low cooling 134-alternative---and reasonable.



Take Care,
