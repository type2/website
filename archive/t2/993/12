Subject: Questions re: 68-71 Westy Interior

Hey Everybody,

I've been working on revamping our 71 westy interior all summer and
I've come across two things:

1) Can someone post a picture/explain to me how the curtain rod that
hangs above the sliding door is hung. I should have looked at it more
carefully when I took it down in the bus I borrowed it from and now
I'm trying to put it in the other bus and just can't figure out from
pictures on samba etc how it could work. Is it one long curtain? Do
the curtains hang over the door if the door is open. The plastic piece
that the door slider is in is complicating things.

2) Also could someone please measure the back cushion on the jump seat for me? 
I'm trying to get a peice of foam cut to size. 

Thanks for all the assistance!!!

Mike.
