Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic igntion wiring

Marcus asked:


Question is how to best connect the FI to the ignition. In the stock configuration and in the '79 Cal setup
the FI trigger wire connects to the switched coil terminal. On the Vanagon an extra wire runs from the
ignition module to the FI brain.

So what I should I do: mimic the '79 configuration (use the coil terminal) or imitate the Vanagon setup (use
the wire from the ignition module). Using the Vanagon setup would obviously require that the trigger signal to
be identical between the two FI systems. I figure that the ignition module may provide a cleaner signal on the
dedicated wire as opposed to using the coil terminal. There must be a reason VW introduced this extra
connection on later models ....

Use the coil connection.  I have not had good luck using the last pin on the ignition module on L-jetronic.

The water boxer ignition is for Digijet [1.9] or Digifant [2.1] and I believe the trigger signal is different,
not just 'cleaner'.

I always use the 79-83.5 Calif ignition set-ups on air cooled engines.
