Subject: Electronic igntion wiring

Here is a question for the FI experts (and the owners of water leaker
Vanagon wiring diagrams) among you. I just installed a complete ignition
system (distributor, coil, ignition module, idle stabilizer) from a 1.9
Vangon in Myonnie's '78 bay. I am already using the same setup in my '74 and
like it.

Question is how to best connect the FI to the ignition. In the stock
configuration and in the '79 Cal setup the FI trigger wire connects to the
switched coil terminal. On the Vanagon an extra wire runs from the ignition
module to the FI brain.

So what I should I do: mimic the '79 configuration (use the coil terminal)
or imitate the Vanagon setup (use the wire from the ignition module). Using
the Vanagon setup would obviously require that the trigger signal to be
identical between the two FI systems. I figure that the ignition module may
provide a cleaner signal on the dedicated wire as opposed to using the coil
terminal. There must be a reason VW introduced this extra connection on
later models ....

Any ideas? I am not re-installing points or Pertronix ...
