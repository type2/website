Subject: Re: [T2] High Top Camper?

Sorry for the late reply. Intarweb problems at home.

I had one for a while. The high top is NICE for camping. Kids sleep up
top. But mine was a total rustbucket. If you can, check under the
hightop where it is screwed to the sheet metal of the bus for rust.
Mine was horrid.
