Be aware that there is a scammer or two operating on TS and Craigslist.
If the price seems to be too good to be true, it isn't.

They get rid of them on TS as fast as they pop up, but it's a game of
whack-a-mole

I have a feeling that this guy was only looking for suckers who would send
money via Western Union right away.
