Subject: TDI diesel in a late Bay camper

Volks,

I have always wanted to adapt a VW TDI to a 78 camper. Will this engine rotate 
the proper way? I assume the spider gears can be flipped on the transaxle. I had 
a thought the other morning. Hit me like a crystal bullet in the forhead! If the 
big auto makers can make hybrid cars that works on electric motors from 0-40 MPH 
and get 35+ MPG with gasoline engines. Why haven't they taken that same platform 
and substituted an engine like, say the VW TDI that gets around 58 MPG without 
the use of motors from 0-40 MPH. Think about it. The rpm range would be very narrow, and the engine would 
be only operating at peak efficiency with little or no torque needed to get the 
car up to speek. Now taking this a step further, what kind of gas mileage would 
a hybrid electric/diesel get?! Kind of makes you wonder what kind of myth the 
big car companies are perpetrating on us. You know, the old moniker that the 
technology doesn't exist for cars to get 50 MPG. Are we blind? or do they think 
that we are s
tupid? 
I propose that this setup of Electric/diesel hybrid in a regular car the size of 
a Jetta or larger would EASILY get 65+ MPG as the engine would barely be 
operating, and when it did, it would be most efficient. I wonder if Mr Kennedy 
makes an adapter for the TDI engine? 

Anyway, I may have strayed off topic a bit, but what do you folks think? 
Especially about the TDI in a late bay camper?

Matt
