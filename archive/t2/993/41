Subject: fuel ven/evap line size

I am almost done replacing all the old hoses on Myonnie's '78. New fuel
lines and vaccum hoses are in. What is left are the little pieces of hose
which connect the yellow vent lines at the top of the engine compartmet. My
vacuum hose is too small and the FI fuel lines seems to be too big. What is
the proper size hose for these connections? I checked the archives but could
not find what I was looking for ...

Also, is there a recommended strategy for refilling the carbon canister -
i.e. where do I cut the housing?

Marcus
