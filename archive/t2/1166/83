The worn camshaft isn't the direct cause of the overheating. Rather,  
the wear was causing poor performance: a significant reduction in  
horsepower. To compensate, the driver was working the engine harder  
than it was designed to work, about 20% harder. That's where the  
overheating was coming from.
