Subject: '75 Wheelchair Access Bus

One of my customers is looking to let his '75 Automatic bus go. It has a
very unique wheelchair access conversion. It is for transporting a
wheelchair bound passenger only. It does not have hand controls. The floor
has been lowered and the sliding door modified for a wheelchair ramp. It
also has a wheelchair alcove and restraints built in. It was done very
nicely as far as I can tell and most of the original hardware is still
there. The bus is worth saving just for its uniqueness and the potential to
help a disabled person have one cool ride.

Stock Fuel injected 1800cc. Fresh motor. Good compression. Good Exhaust.
Fairly complete and original.

Before I post it on TS, I hope there is a person on this list that has the
need for a bus like this. PMAIL me and I'll send photos and pricing.

Bus is in Metro Denver, Colorado.
