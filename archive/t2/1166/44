Subject: Re: [T2] New EFI system

Let me clarify, when referring to adapting the Type 1 fuel injection
systems to a Type 4, I meant that it would be difficult to adapt the EFI
systems to an Existing stock Type 4 FI system.

Bolting the kit directly onto a Type 4 *should* a person would only need
the correct intake manifold, linkage and in the case of the Redline/Weber
system, the recommended MSD distributor. (or more items, so best to contact
the suppliers directly)
