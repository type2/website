Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize and spark plugs

Yeah, those broken plugs look just like the one I had to remove from 
my bus. Thought I had stripped the threads when I installed the plug. 
Imagine my relief when I found the plug was missing its front end! 
Fortunately I happened to have an easy out to fix the problem.

BTW, the link didn't work I had to go to here and click through:
www.ngksparkplugs.com
then Tech Support
and the second bulletin.

Lots of chatter regarding various options and experiences with 
antisieze,
however nothing referenced from any spark plug manufacturers.  There 
are
some recommendations from NGK specifically mentioning aluminum heads. 
This
is from a tech bulletin from NGK, and can be found at
www.ngksparkplugs.com/pdf/TB-0630111*antisieze*.pdf.  Take it for what 
it's
worth.

*Topic *

The use of anti-seize compounds on spark plug threads that have a 
metal
shell

plating (i.e. Zinc or Nickel plating).

*Issue *

Applying anti-seize to the threads of spark plugs that have a metal 
plating
allows the installer to mistakenly over-tighten the spark plug in the
cylinder head; This stretches and fatigues the threads of the spark 
plugs,
causing a much higher probability that the plug will break during
installation or in some cases upon removal.

Example of 10mm thread spark plug broken during installation due to 
the use
of anti-seize leading

to over-tightening. (Note that plug gasket has been completely 
compressed,
anti-seize can be seen

on threads, and the break is in the direction of tightening).

*Solution *

For spark plugs with special metal plating simply do not use 
anti-seize on
initial

Installation; All NGK Spark Plugs are manufactured with a special 
trivalent
Zinc-chromate shell plating that is designed to prevent both corrosion 
and
seizure to the cylinder head; Thus eliminating the need for any thread
compounds or lubricants.

*Additional Information *

NGK recommends only using spark plugs with metal plating on all 
aluminum
head applications to prevent damage to the head and plug. Metal shell
plating acts as a lubricant which breaks away from the main body of 
the
spark plug during removal, preventing damage to the spark plug and or
threads in the cylinder head.

 I think seized spark plugs are a consequence of people who think they
 are fire-and-forget ammunition. I would think that people who remove
 them regularly to check cleanliness and gap at regular tune-up
 intervals are unlikely to encounter seized threads.
