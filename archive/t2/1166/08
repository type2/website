Subject: Rack for fiberglass camper top

Is there a rack made, or a design, that mounts directly to the fiberglass
camper top on my 76 westy?  Or is the only way to mount one on the rain
gutters?  I'm assuming there must be some kind of a rack that can hold some
lighter weight----I won't be hauling lead pipe or 20 units of sheet rock on
it.  Any info will be appreciated. --Happy
