I think posting a rundown of the differences on the web would be a  
good thing.

I just got the correct ECU for my year from a boneyard. I bought the  
correct AFM too (071 906 301B for 1982 CA). Somewhat had already  
gotten the wiper board out of it. But I bought it anyway (Ecology owes  
me a wiper board). It has a resistor that my Frankenstein AFM doesn't  
have.

The new brain and swapped AFM start. I haven't test driven it yet,  
much less tested.
