What I can say is that it is great at WOT!  I might have the fastest bus in
the county, but I cheer when I get better than 15 MPG.

Granted, I haven't spent much time tuning the engine as I have a laundry
list of other things to look into and it really runs nice and strong.  In
theory it supports a wide-band O2 sensor but again, I haven't gotten around
to that just yet.

And it looks way cool.
