Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Temp Gauge

I installed a Dakota Digital CHT gauge in my 74 Bus, and am very happy with it.
I added the optional 18' lead wire with 14mm ring to my order, and it
fit perfectly in my bus, installed under the 3rd cylinder head spark
plug.
I bent the 14mm ring end in a certain "S" shape so that the ring fit
well under the plug and over the adjacent fin and out through a hole
in the tin.

I try and keep the temps under 375, though Jake Raby says you can
briefly touch 400, but any significant time above 400 means engine
damage. If the temps get up there, downshift and slow down. If you
must stop for overheating, don't leave the engine running - that will
cool the engine too quickly.
