Subject: Re: [T2] New EFI system

Greg,

I believe I paid about $1250 for the Redline/Weber EFI kit in late 2005. I
think the price is closer to $1500 now.

It only fits a Type 1 Dual Port Motor and would be difficult (but not
impossible) to adapt to a Type 4. It utilizes a easily  modifiable software
interface to determine Fuel/Air ratios. However, it is a WOT system (Wide
Open Throttle) and relies on a narrow band O2 sensor for data, limiting its
everyday drivability uses. For racing, it has an excellent track record.
Above 5000 feet, the system gets sketchy. At sea level, it is supposed to
be very good.

CB Performance has a similar system, but with a more sophisticated "self
learning" computer coupled with a wide-band O2 sensor. The software is
adaptable and editable. It costs $1800 direct. It, like the Redline/Weber
kit, only fits a Dual Port Type 1 motor. But, with some creative fiddling,
I'm sure an enterprising type 4 enthusiast could make it work.

Jake Rabe advertises a EFI conversion for the Type 4 motor that utilizes a
modified GM style system. I have no knowledge of cost or effectiveness
however.

Megasquirt is very cool, very scalable but still reserved for the die-hard
geeks in our community. :) IMHO. I'm just not geeky enough...
