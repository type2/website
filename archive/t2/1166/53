I still have my catalog that Gene gave me personally wayyyy back in 1983.  He
said I could have it for free if I promised to read it cover to cover before
returning to his shop and asking more questions.  And God help you if you
forgot 
your customer number!!

I learned a lot from Gene. Still, it was his
way or he wouldn't deal with you. 
He would be horrified by the quality of VW
parts we get these days!  Gary
