Mark -

Yeah, what is shown on the web leaves a lot to be desired.

The biggest differences are:

1.  Circuit Boards for the Wiper Tracks - different apps sometimes
require different board layouts.
2.  Spring Tension for the Wiper Assembly, some are "stiffer", some are "softer"
3.  Certain electronic pieces in the circuitry dependent on the 2
above as well as the number of pins.
4.  Specific interaction with specific ECUs and there really isn't a
"fits all" for some of them, especially those that work with O2
sensors.

It's interesting to note that there are 5 different AFMs for the Bus
(4 w/o O2 thru 79, 1 w/O2 79 California) and just 2 for the Vanagon
Air Cooled (one for Calif w/O2, one for Fed w/o O2).

If you like, I will be happy to list the VW #, Bosch # and the
application(s) for all.

Maybe I will post this info eventually on my website like I do the
Bosch Distributor Info, as a lot of people email me weekly for that
kind of information.
