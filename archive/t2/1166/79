Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Anti-Seize and spark plugs

Well although I'm in the use antiseize camp, and use a good torque wrench,
being too lazy to look up the spec isn't the issue entirely.  The thought (and
likely true) is that a torque spec for dry plugs needs derated or damn well
not exceeded for antiseize.  This goes along if you have ever seen the demo of
ARP selling their lube where they got a torque cell and torque a rod bolt dry
and with oil, antiseize, moly grease, and their wonder lube, and measure the
deformation (stretch) of the bolt they are torqueing.  The results are all
over the place, particularly on repeated release and retorques excepting of
course with their wonderous lube, which is dead on every time.  And I do
believe that, I'm not mocking.  Anyway the problem is a real one certainly in
theory, that the torque you apply with antiseize will equal more actual
clamping, stretch, and hence more chance of stripping.
 
I don't know, I still
use the antiseize.  As well mentioned YMMV.
 
In thinking about this I do
recall perhaps VW literature from the early 90's somewhere relating to the
ludicrously priced plugs they wanted me to use on my G60 Corrado (which went
about $18 per at the time) being plated and to not use antiseize.  Perhaps in
a VW TSB?

To avoid over- tightening, consider using a torque wrench to
tighten the plugs
to the appropriate torque
You might look it up and check
what it is.
