What's interesting about late UK Bays with the 1600 twin port is the airbox.
It's not an oil-bath filter as used on early 1600 Bays.
It's a paper element
filter that is the same part as used on bays with the Type 4 engine.
You can
see part of it in my engine bay here:

Note, that's an old photo and the 009 distributor is now a bench-top
paperweight.

You can also make out the vacuum line going from the retard port
on the carb to the vacuum-operated flap on the air intake.
This controls the
warm-air intake based on engine load.

You can probably also see that the fuel
tank breather line is going to another port under the retard port.  That line
is supposed to go to a port on the airbox.

I don't know why it's going to the
carb, but I plan to move it back to the airbox and plug the port on the carb.

That's correct. SVDA or plugging the retard line and timing at 7.5 is
a suggested modification for US buses too.
