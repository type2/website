I have done many thousands of spark plug R&R on euro alum heads, including
Porsche, VW aircolled and any euro you can name. New or used steel or
alum, I always use 2 or 3 drops of light machine oil, 3in1 type, on the
plug threads. No problems whatsoever with this tech. Losen, turn out by
hand, reinstall by hand to seat, tighten to spec.

Can't tell you how many times I have had problems with plugs installed
with antiseize. When I find that, I chase the threads and install new
plugs and hope the threads will hold.

Many times I have had plugs that require spezial procedures to get loose
and out and they are found to have gummed up antiseize on them. The only
way to eliminate this issue is NEVER USE ANTISEIZE on spark plug threads.
