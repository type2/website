Alaska John then pointed out a major omission:

>Ahh Robert, but what doth thou

	correction:  dost thou
	The suspicion that Yanks have lost their grip on this sacred 
language is clinched by this appalling blunder ;-)
	Ah  ...  you others   ...  expect us overeducated nerds to 
get pedantic from time to time 8-)



>mean by "lubricated."

	My omitting to mention any particular lubricant was doubtless 
caused subconsciously by my ignorance of performance among the 
options within this category.  You don't want a ready-charring oil, 
but beyond that I have for once no theory.
	Even tho' modern sump oils are only about half oil, I use no 
other on spark plug threads (on profound account it's usu the 
handiest oil, e.g on the nearby bus dipstick).
	A case could be made for a straight mineral oil.

>aggreeing with Dr Tim, but I'll stick to my antiseize tin as it 
>hasn't failed me, gummed me, or stuck me in 20 years...

	My omitting criticism of that was in conformity with the rest 
of my post :-P
	My own policy is based on similar experience with sump oil on 
plug threads.  We are not talking statistics here.
	Is there any std method among successful racing teams?  I 
suggest most of the classic motorbike racing experience should be 
relevant, as most heads are aircoooled Al similar to ours.

	A correct spark-plug washer, wrist-tightened with a few-in T, 
thread & seat clean & oiled, is widely agreed to keep the plug in the 
hole and to refrain from changing the gap by distorting the plug as 
overtightening is not widely enough known to do.
