Subject: Gadget Guy Goes Mobile now free for the next 90 days on Kindle

I see no point in letting a few neurotic book reviews stop delivery of my
little comic book.
Many people can remember when Gadget Guy Goes Mobile was published one chapter
at a time on a weekly basis to a somewhat popular website back about 2004. It
had the website owners endorsement at that time and he published it to his
site without compensation to me.
The last three chapters were not published there but are free here
   http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywor

It will be about 72 hours before the book with the new cover is available free
from Kindle and the old book removed.

I have complied to the best of my abilities to remove any references to the
website owner and any other key words that might connect him to my project.
