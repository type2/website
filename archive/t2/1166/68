Come on Robert, engineers always talk/write in 3rd person, not 2nd.  I stand
by doth even if wrong as I guess it should have been "he doth" protest, not
"thou doth".
 
As do I by my antiseize, though in aluminum heads, I too as
mentioned oft (probably wrong) use what is on the dipstick or the oil can as
well.  Steel heads though, always antiseize for me.
 
And I (aghast again)
reuse plugs (and thereby gaskets as they are hard to find now on their own)
using the handy torque wrench so I don't have to have a calibrated pull of the
wrist any longer.

Alaska John then pointed out a major omission:

> Ahh Robert, but what doth
thou

    correction:  dost thou
    The suspicion that Yanks have lost their
grip on this sacred language is clinched by this appalling blunder ;-)
    Ah 
...  you others   ...  expect us overeducated nerds to get pedantic from time
to time 8-)
