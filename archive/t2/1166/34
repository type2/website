And as I posted earlier, in 1974 in the USA, Dual Vacuum/Mechanical
Distributors were on California Beetle Models equipped with the
34PICT-3 or 4 carburetor.  Federal 1974 Beetles came with a Single
Vacuum/Mechanical Distributors equipped with the 34PICT-3 carburetor.
All 71-73 Beetles and all 1971 Buses did come with Dual
Vacuum/Mechanical Distributors equipped with the 34PICT-3, as
original.

The 34PICT-3 came with the necessary (and sometime a few extra) vacuum
ports to accommodate either style of distributor.  Extra ports were
usually equipped with rubber plugs (if needed) as they are today.

In your case replacing your Dual Vacuum Distributor with a Single
Vacuum Distributor is completely do-able and I have done it dozens
times over the past 35+ years with no hassles.  I can see no reason
why your vehicles could not have the distributor swap.

In fact Volkswagen and Bosch themselves did it when they superseded
the Dual Vacuum Distributor to the Single Vacuum style as a
replacement over 20 years ago. Why?  Bosch no longer produced the
distributor or the Dual Vacuum Cans in the 90s and NOS can
replacements (and even the Chinese made can replacements) are
impossible to find (and if you do, their price is in the stratosphere,
like close to $200!).

Perhaps your vehicles are unique in a way I've never encountered,
anything's possible :)

 This was standard on all US 1971 type 1 and type 2 - I have one each vehicle
- both completely stock.  I don't see how you could correctly adjust using the
advance only type distributor with the 34PICT - or should I say, the 34PICT
carbs that I have would not tolerate this.
