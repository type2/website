Hi Mark,
not exactly true in my case. The engine got way too hot, even under
minimal load, i.e. running 60mph on a very, very slight uphill slope.
I could barely touch the throttle and CHT started to rise to 400F and
above.
I think the combination of reduced lift of the cam, and in turn
followers and pushrods, leads to even more reduced valve lift on the
valve side of the rocker arm. This will keep the valve from opening
all the way *and* it will keep the valve open for a shorter time. Not
enough fresh, combustible mixture can enter the cylinder (needed for
internal cooling) which *could* lead to an incorrect AFR (not sure if
this is true). Further, the piston has to force the exhaust gases
through a smaller or more restricted opening in less time increasing
the internal temperature of the cylinder and cylinder head.
Cheers,
Timo
