So you'd think.  I'll be going up the Cajon Pass in California in 2nd 
gear at about 4000 RPM at about 20 MPH with barely any load on the 
engine and the stupid thing will hit 400!!!  It's driving me absolutely 
bonkers.

Here is some other data:

This is a stock '78 manual transmission.  The only thing that isn't 
stock is the fuel injection, but fuel is fuel - doesn't matter how it 
was injected, it's still gonna burn... and in my case, too hot!

I really need to install my quad CHTs and then get the data back over to 
Jake for analyzing.  This is the thread where the above came from:

Like Jake has repeatedly said, the type4 engine is misconfigured and is 
prone to overheat.  That's why his camper special has different heads, 
different cam, 72-74 exhaust, and he bumps up the compression.  I'm 
slowly heading in that direction when I finish up my exhaust refurb.
