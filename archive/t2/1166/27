Hi Kevin,

My experience with routing wires is that you generally need more than
expected by the time you find a neat and tidy routing and tie it down. You
can always either trim to length or tie up the excess in an inconspicuous
spot.

Also, yes, the wire is special as it is thermocouple wire. Mixing it with
copper will ruin your readings.

You may want to purchase 2 sensors. That way you can easily check the temps
on both sides of your engine save for the hassle of trading the wires on the
back of the readout, however a switch box could be installed. A special 
thermocouple
switch is required to match up with the thermocouple wires.

I have been reading on the list about installing one of these for years.and
keep thinking I am going to install one.



The Dakota have been getting good reviews, (they are digital, which doesn't
look the best IMHO).



Do most folks install these under the #3 sparkplug, and is that an accurate
enough location?



It looks like the sender wire is a special piece of equipment, ie you can't
just use any wire. How long a wire do you guys recommend? I'm sure 6' is too
short, 10' might work, but I imagine it could be tight, 14' seems like
plenty, and 18' seems overkill.
