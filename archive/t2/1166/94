Subject: '75 Wheelchair Access Bus

I have a 78 and have owned it since 2008.  You can see pictures of when I
first got it at
 http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=330085&highlight=wheelchair

If those of you that have one could help me with my sliding door I would
greatly appreciate it.  Just pmail me.  I need help with the plunger door
stop, I think there were wires to it at one time.  Currently it is a real PITA
to open the sliding door all the way to drop the gate.  I do not have the
ramp, a PO must have removed it.
Thanks,
Kevin
