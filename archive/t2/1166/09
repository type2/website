Thule and Yakima make brackets that you can mount to the poptop.  They 
make arms that attach to the brackets and from there all kinds of 
attachments.  It's not really a vintage look, but it gets the job done.  
Be aware of the issues with raising the top with the added weight.  I 
put 40lbs of solar panels on the top of mine and it takes about all the 
strength I have to raise the top.
