Subject: Tangent: overheating problem due to worn cam

Hi,

Potentially a stupid question, but that's never stopped me before...

 "a high temp problem that was discovered to be caused by a worn camshaft."

If someone could help me mentally complete this picture, I'd appreciate it
- why does this cause high temps? Mike
