Subject: Re: [T2] stock ride height late bay

Jamie, I don't have my bently handy, but there is a spec from level. You'll
also need the specs of the splines so you can calculate how much to move
the spring. The front sits a little high IIRC with the driver in the seat.
They are always high in front when parked. . Don't recall your model year,
but at least '72 & up have a slot cut in the torsion spring plate that
allows removal without opening the hydraulic brake lines. Saves a bunch of
time. I've done this procedure a number of times. You might want to pick up
a magnetic angle finder ( *http://tinyurl.com/7j3l3g3 *), and be sure to
use talc when reinstalling the rubber bushings, not lubricant or
solvent.Plan on half a day for your first time.
