Subject: 16amp fuse

Hi, I took the bus for a ride since there is still no snow or salt. The last
time I parked it it just turned off by itself, so in the past I have had a 16
amp fuse (red one 4th one over from the passenger side) just blow out, so I
checked it and sure enough it was that again. Prior to this the left rear turn
signal was not working, but the bulb proved good, the fuse was not blown, but
melted the plastic enough to lose contact. So thats a little scary. I believe
this is the fuse for the ignition key switch also.. Which is a new after
market in dash switch and it is rated for 70 amps.. Too much? Obvious
grounding issue coupled with voltage spikes acting as a neutral. Yes? Oh where
to look.
