NGK Spark Plug Memo
states:
"... Metal shell plating acts as a blubricantb which breaks away
from
the main body of the spark plug during removal, preventing damage to
the
spark plug and or threads in the cylinder head.   ..."


IMO, he spark plug is
damaged if it's metal shell plating breaks away.
Where does that metal shell
plating go?  Into the cylinder?
