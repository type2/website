I don't believe the the entire story can be described by simply saying use
the correct torque.  I have read before there are differences in specs of
dry threads vs wet threads.  I cannot find any data to support these
assumptions, but my understanding is that by having the threads of any
inserted bolt lubricated the forces exerted on the interferences of the
threads (both external and internal) are much greater.

For myself, I simply use dry threads and torque them to the appropriate
torque.  Like many others this seems to work pretty darn well.
