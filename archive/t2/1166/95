Subject: Re: [T2] '75 Wheelchair Access Bus

Kevin, nice bus first of all.
 
Access Bob is definitely the guy to ask, yours
is probably the same as his.
 
Mine (long gone) still had the entire ramp, if
you look at his pics, his is about cut off to yours, he says he wheelies to
get into it.  The ramp on mine was at least 2 feet wide though, maybe more.  I
don't recall having to push on a pin like that, don't remember how it opened
up the track or if there even was an interlock to keep you from losing the
door (simpler times.)  A simple tab like you mention probably would work if
there is room to clear the roller to get past said tab on the modified track. 
I'd think it would be on the bit you still have though, as you have the track
bit left on the box obviously for the slider to slide in, any evidence of one
broken off (weld remains?)  There isn't any sort of interlock with the tabs
that hold the ramp up is there?  Things may have changed through manufacture
years/company on these as well as yours is pretty late for a bay obviously. 
Bob is pretty sure he's only seen one company advertised and he'd
 know, but I've seen em boxed down to different degrees so I'm not sure.  Plus
noting the info somebody found you, certainly many were made before that
patent date, so unless they just waited a bit to seek the patent (possible)
indicates perhaps more than 1 company, and the ramp on mine was full width not
cut for the wheel width like that, but again requirements for the patent, are
just a general ideas, not specifics.  BTW don't underestimate what people
thought you'd simply be cabable of doing in the 70's, solutions weren't always
expected to be super easy/exotic.  If you truely think there were wires,
perhaps just a spring loaded 12V solenoid?  Doesn't look like the depth behind
to me to mount it, but the peg does look 3/8"ish which is a pretty common size
that dad (EE) had laying around.  If so I'd bet they would have gummed up and
burnt out constantly, but who knows, maybe there was some simple switch driven
logic involved to tell it when to
 actuate and suck in, and the light switch could have been used as a trigger
to tell it door closed, stop pulling.
 
Still damn clean bus, and my favorite
color combo no less.
 
Will be interesting to see what Bob says his has for
the problem.
 
John

I have a 78 and have owned it since 2008.  You can
see pictures of when I
first got it at

If those of you that have one could help me with my sliding door I would
greatly appreciate it.  Just pmail me.  I need help with the plunger door
stop, I think there were wires to it at one time.  Currently it is a real PITA
to open the sliding door all the way to drop the gate.  I do not have the
ramp, a PO must have removed it.
