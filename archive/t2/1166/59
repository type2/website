I looked very hard for the chassis ground strap.  Well, it wasn't in plain
sight.  Probably because it didn't exist. And after some poking around I
found the two bolts w/out nuts.  Now, a new ground strap is installed, to
go with a new positive battery cable.

So far, so good (it started three time).
