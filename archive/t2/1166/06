Just  random thought today made me search for Kelly.   I recall a couple  
years
back he was having health issues (sounded like a life of body work  
catching up
to him) and was sort of semi-retiring.  His old domain  metwiz.com just 
points
to a for sale add, and I was wondering if anyone  knows how he is, what he 
is
up to.  Google can't find anything more  recent than '09 about him, hope he 
is
at least  alive.

John
