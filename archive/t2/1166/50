Subject: Re: [VB] Anti-Seize and spark plugs

I quit using anti-seize on my plugs years ago and I haven't had any more 
damaged threads in my heads since. I think the anti-seize would burn and 
turn into a little hard chunk of carbon on the end of the plug that 
would damage the threads as you removed the plug. I also agree with Gene 
Berg's thought that it is a thermal insulator that you don't want.

I save the anti-seize for where rust might be a problem.
