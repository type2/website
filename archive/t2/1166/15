Josh -

Sounds like you're doing everything correct, but consult my carburetor
write up I did for Airhead Parts regarding installation and
troubleshooting.  Could be one or more things causing the poor
performance, but in my experience two areas are usually the culprits:
1.  Vacuum Leak
2.  Fuel Dump Tube at the top of the carb throat is incorrectly aimed.
