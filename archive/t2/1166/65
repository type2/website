	This interesting thread has now thrown up q's on anti-seize 
in spark plug threads, e.g

1  Does the engine mfr recommend this consumable?

2      "       "     "      "   disparage consumables in this 
category?  {I suggest we leave aside brands awhile.}

3   Does harm often result from doing it as Wolfsburg says?

4  Had Wolfsburg any record of difficulty as evidenced by frequent bulls?

5  Have any useful statistics been gathered on the outcomes from the 
2 approaches?



	IMHO: Spark plugs in aluminium heads get into little trouble 
if properly cleaned, lubricated, and wrist-tightened.
