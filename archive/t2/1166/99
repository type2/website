Gary a damn good question I certainly don't know the answer to.  I would
certainly presume (and I'm a plug reuser...) that once crushed down it ain't
going to be the same.  Now oil pan gasket rings in annealed copper or aluminum
I do certainly get it, plastic deformation in compression, they are dead to
reuse.  The crush ring on a spark plug is a bit more exotic, as the steel
don't plastic deform once the surfaces come together.  Yeah it does in the
plastic collapse of the "accordian" form down to contact, but when it hits
contact which is where you start picking up torque, head to one side of
washer, to other side of washer, to plug there is of course no way the steel
itself actually squishes in compression, but the calibrated "crush" of the
collapse is gone.  Damn lot of technology in that little bit of steel designed
what like 100 years ago or better?  Probably isn't smart to reuse them.  I had
a box of 50 I had got years ago, but I
 eventually ran out of them, and haven't seen them local in ages.  Course at
$1.50-2.00 for a Bosch copper (even though a lousy Indian one) doesn't make a
lot of sense to reuse.  Just seems I'm always needing to do it some time, as
it is easier to toss a plug in the walnut cabinet and file it than it is for
me to drive 20 minutes each way to a parts store.  Particularly I'm always
needing to do it every time I fire up the aged rototiller or a Stihl for the
season.  I tend to undertorque on reuse a bit.  I have never stripped a plug
or had one come out in 20+ years personally despite my re-use and antiseize
use, so I'm not too worried I'll start anytime soon.  I agree with whoever
mentioned the #1 best way to avoid issues, particularly for convenience sake
on a T4 is use an extra 4-5" section of fuel hose to install the plug.

How does the "crush" washer on most plugs affect this
discussion? Seems like the torque needs might change once the plugs were
removed and then re-torqued?
