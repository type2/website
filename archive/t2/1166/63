While I don't remember exact numbers, #3 and #1 intake and exhaust
valve were missing about 2mm of lift on the pushrod side (once
removed, you could easily spot the wear just by looking at the cam).
Combine that with the stock rocker ratio of 1.3:1 and you see the
valve is missing 2.6mm of maximum lift... Clearly, this leads to a
very restricted breathability of the engine, and - as empirically
proved by my engine - causes severe overheating.

You can find very good information on cams (stock and performance) an
the Web Cam website:

Search for "Automobile", "Volkswagen", "Type4 8v".
Stock type4 with solid lifters:

Hydraulic lifters:

I don't know how close you get to these numbers in reality, but
checking lift is rather easy and comparing different cylinders should
highlight any problems.
