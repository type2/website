THERE IS ANOTHER ONE!!!

this is probably an HPBus conversion they are the only company that I know 
that ever did this.

I am disabled and have a 1978 HPBus conversion with auto tranny (all of 
these conversions were automatics) I have hand controls and drive from the 
regular seat, transfering from my wheelchair.  My van is approaching 
400,000 (known) miles.   would love to see any photos (will send some of 
mine if you wish) I surely wish I had a place to put it if for no other 
reason than a source of parts to keep mine running, as you know the 
folding ramp has the lower track and someone recently hit me while parked 
(and left the scene) right at that rear front wheel well post and down 
along my door.  opening and closing is now much harder.

I have had my bus since 1992 and am only the third owner. it is a very 
well done conversion but I have never actually seen another one. the 
company is long out of business.

I just barely saved mine as it was about to be parted out. I hope yours 
goes to a good home.

how much you asking

Bob
