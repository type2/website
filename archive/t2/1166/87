Subject: Re: [T2] stock ride height late bay

Should be level front to back but over time, like 30-40 years, the bus begins
to sag in the rear a bit.  I've never done it but you can correct this if
you've gotten tired of looking at the road in your rear view mirror. 

"Looking at the rear of a Late bay camper.. some folks complain the rear 
is
low.. or sagging

Is there a spec of ride height... or 
normal angle ?   Should the Vw bus sit
level at the curb?  or does a 
stock suspension actually sit a little lower
in the rear... ?
