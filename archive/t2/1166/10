I've got Thule artificial rain gutters mounted on my top and then I'm 
able to quickly remove my Thule racks in about 5 mins.  I actually have 
3 sets of rain gutter mounts - one set is by the back end of the bus, 
another is about 7-8ft forward of that, and then there is another set 
that is mounted to the luggage compartment over the cab.  The reason I 
have the various mounts is because I can use the rear-most mounts for my 
surfboards, or I can use the very front and the very rear mounts for my 
hang glider.  Unfortunately I only have two actual racks otherwise I'd 
use all three mounts for my hang glider...
