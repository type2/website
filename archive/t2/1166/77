To avoid over- tightening, consider using a torque wrench to tighten the plugs
to the appropriate torque
You might look it up and check what it is.

...........is from a tech bulletin from NGK, and can be found at
ww.ngksparkplugs.com/pdf/TB-0630111*antisieze*.pdf. .........*Issue *
Applying anti-seize to the threads of spark plugs that have a metal
lating
llows the installer to mistakenly over-tighten the spark plug in the
ylinder head; This stretches and fatigues the threads of the spark
lugs,
ausing a much higher probability that the plug will break during
nstallation or in some cases upon removal.
