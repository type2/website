Not so -

Only 1974 California Model Beetle 1600 have the DVDA, 49 State Federal
Model Beetles have the SVDA, both for which the current SVDA on the
market is based on.  The 34PICT, regardless of original design works
on both if connected and adjusted (both idle and timing) correctly.  I
use a 34PICT-1 with a SVDA for the past 8 years on a 68 Beetle
converted to Dual Port 1600 and my set up should be identical Josh's
in his 71 Bus (OK, different Air Cleaner, stock of course

Josh's and my setup is virtually identical to what Mexican Production
Beetles utilized thru the early 90s before going to Fuel Injection.
