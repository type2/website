Why would you introduce analysis into an issue which can be solved by
anecdotal evidence.

I've heard that at least 50% of all VW's on the road are
running on pure anecdotes instead of multi-grade oil.
Why change that now?

    This interesting thread has
now thrown up q's on anti-seize 
in spark plug threads, e.g

1  Does the
engine mfr recommend this consumable?

2      "       "     "      " 
disparage consumables in this 
category?  {I suggest we leave aside brands
awhile.}

3   Does harm often result from doing it as Wolfsburg says?

4  Had
Wolfsburg any record of difficulty as evidenced by frequent bulls?

5  Have
any useful statistics been gathered on the outcomes from the 
2 approaches?
    IMHO: Spark plugs in aluminium heads get into little trouble 
if properly
cleaned, lubricated, and wrist-tightened.
