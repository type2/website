Subject: Re: [T2] Rack for fiberglass camper top

Jack, 
I've had several buses and Vanagons come and go with standard Yakima
systems mounted with universal "bolt it on" flat plate mounts.  Each mount has
two like 8mm bolts if I recall right, on about 10cm centers, and a good HD
backup plate for the inside.  I presume Thule makes the similar but mine have
all been Yakima. Despite my worry, they have done fine and not cracked, some
of them in 6-7 years of ownership, and with two canoes on top.  That would be
about the limit though I figure, for me at least 150lb or so.  And I never
popped them with the boats on, so utility was a bit limited in some ways.
Beware on the bus that the hump of the roof is much higher than you initially
think it is, so don't go drilling for a set to low. 
YMMV. 
Mounts and bars go
pretty cheap on your favorite auction site. 
John

Is there a rack made, or a design, that mounts
directly to the fiberglass
camper top on my 76 westy?  Or is the only way to
mount one on the rain
gutters?  I'm assuming there must be some kind of a rack
that can hold some
lighter weight----I won't be hauling lead pipe or 20 units
of sheet rock on
it.  Any info will be appreciated. --Happy
