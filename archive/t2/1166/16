Cylinder head temperatures are more important to engine longevity than
oil temperature.

I recommend the Dakota Digital CHT because it is ambient temperature
compensating. Odyssey I or II is okay. There is also a VW bus specific
longer sensor:

Note that CHT and Oil temp are inversely proportional. Higher RPMs
give more cooling air for the heads, so CHT will go down, but higher
RPM means faster moving parts for higher oil temp.

Normal temps are listed here:

That having been said, I also lowered my oil temps by about 10 degrees
C by using synthetic oil.

On oil pressure, I read an article by a petroleum engineer who said to
aim for 10 psi for each  1000 RPM. That's why your oil light will
flicker at hot idle. It is set to come on at about 7 psi, so if you
are idling at 700, or viscosity is decreased from a hot freeway run,
you will be at low pressure.

Personally I experience higher oil pressure than this, but have read
some articles indicating this is okay for VW air-cooled.

To adjust your oil pressure without modifying the engine, increase or
decrease viscosity until you get the pressure you need.

Also keep an eye on the calibration of the oil pressure relieve spring
and the condition of the seat for the oil pressure relief valve.
