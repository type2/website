These are favored due to ambient temperature compensation. They also
sell a special bus sensor with the long wire to reach the engine.

#3 is favored since it tends to run the hottest, but I like to move it
around to be sure I don't have a temp problem on another cylinder.
Some of the more enterprising listees report installing a sensor on
all four cylinders and using a rotary or electronic switch to change
the cylinder monitored.
