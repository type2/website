Ditto. I use nickel anti-seize as it is designed for applications such
as this.

Nickel Grade Anti-Seize is compounded from fine particles of nickel,
aluminum and graphite in a heat resistant lubricant and performs
particularly well as nickel is a hard metal and keeps surfaces apart
even under high pressure. It is recommended when very different metals
are used together such as brass and steel or where high alloy steel
such as stainless are involved. Nickel is also used where soft metals
such as copper cannot be present, and it performs to 26000F.

Haven't had a problem in forty years of using it.
