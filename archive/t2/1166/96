I did a home check of calibration on my MAC inch-lb clicker a couple
months ago. Crude compared to a professional calibration machine. I
simply hung a known weight on a known length lever arm with a socket
attachment, and checked if it clicked. It was within about 3 inch-lbs.

I realize that 3 inch-lbs could put me over the edge on that sensitive
Type4 oil strainer bolt (max 9 in-lbs).
