I'd first look for incorrect timing then low octane fuel for overheating.
If you have loose valve seats / or broken piston rings will also cause the
problem, check your compression. A bleed down test should give positive report
but you can just check the compression with a normal threaded gauge and watch
for minor change.
A partially clogged oil strainer can cause the problem as well as rats nest
and dirt dobber nest in the cylinder fins.
The very simplest overheating can be caused by slipping fan drive belt. Check
the tension after the engine starts getting hot. Belts stretch when they are
failing from heat exhaustion.
