Subject: Re: [T2] '75 Wheelchair Access Bus

Jonathan,
 
They were a lot more common than you might think back in the day. 
I've owned 2, one useable, one rustbucket for parts only.  Couple companies,
one in the northeast I think did many of them, lowering the floor to different
degrees.  The 2 I had, had the frames entirely removed and heavy boxed drop
sections with the ramp that folded out the modified sliding  door.    I've
seen em though where the whole frame was not cut.  The better of mine a
'76 was still solid enough though, not obviouslly sagging, and this was in '95
or so.  The parter I had had hand controls and a swivel drivers seat to
transfer into, the one I bought and sold as a runner was like you mention,
presumably for just a passenger.
 
There was one that sat for years (all of
the 90's at least, perhaps still there) a couple exits in on I78 from where it
branches off I81, on the N side of the exit in the lot of a long abandoned
electrical/TV repair place.  Was an engine fire burnout but the bus bit was
relatively solid, excepting all the glass was busted out and it was being
stripped even in the mid 90's by vandals.  In truth I believe I liberated it
of front signal lenses.  I think in a cool factor it might have been a
Champagne as well as I recall.
 
I think I've seen a picture of one on a
splitty BTW and they kept doing them on vanagons (I've seen air and water
cooled with dropped floors) but by the EV years were mostly using lifts
instead, as I bought again a parter that had been so converted.  I actually
made back my money on that one selling the lift, and had the tranny and new
Agillis tires off it that I'd bought it for for free.  I have seen an EV with
a rear drop and fold out ramp though.
 
You are right though, cool in its own
right and worth saving/owning.  And quite functional in its own right as well.
 
John

One of my customers is looking to let his '75
Automatic bus go. It has a
very unique wheelchair access conversion. It is for
transporting a
wheelchair bound passenger only. It does not have hand
controls. The floor
has been lowered and the sliding door modified for a
wheelchair ramp. It
also has a wheelchair alcove and restraints built in. It
was done very
nicely as far as I can tell and most of the original hardware is
still
there. The bus is worth saving just for its uniqueness and the potential
to
help a disabled person have one cool ride.
