Vehicle: '79 Bay, UK model
Engine: stock 1600 twin port
Distributor: Bosch
SVDA
Carb:  34PICT 3


Background:
    I just had the bus serviced and had
been having some problems with engine rattle when loading the engine after
about 10 minutes of top gear driving.
I took it back they reset the timing,
but the problem persisted.  I decided to check the timing on my own.
It was
7.5 BTDC at 900 RPM as per the spec for this engine, carb, and distributor
combo.
I played around with the timing more, but with crap results.
Eventually
I took a look at the plugs.  Plugs 2, 3, & 4, I were able to remove by hand
(like, whoa!).
So I reseated all plugs and torqued them down.
If you can
believe it, the engine ran much better after that.

So then I went to check
adjust the timing and then the idle.
I've got the timing set dead on at 7.5
BTDC at 900 RPM.
I've adjusted the idle a few times now, but I seem to get a
stumbling at low-to-mid throttle settings.
Here's the procedure I'm using to
adjust idle:

1. Stop engine after warming up.
2. Disconnect vacuum hose at
the distributor and plug.
3. Set fast idle adjustment screw to 1/4 turn in
after touching the fast idle cam.
4.  Screw in volume (little) screw gently
until it bottoms.  Then back out 2.5 turns.
5.  Start engine.
6.  Adjust
bypass (big) screw until I get 900 RPM.
7.  Adjust volume screw to get max
idle (it's seems about 3/8 to 1/2 turns out).
8. Adjust volume screw to reduce
revs by 25 RPM (about 1/8 turn in).
9. Adjust bypass screw to reset idle to
900 RPM (maybe 1/2 turn in).
10. Verified timing holds at 7.5 BTDC.
11. Put
vacuum hose back on.
12. Drive away.
13. Disappointment.


This is my first
time setting timing and idle.
I've tried to adjust the idle a few times now as
I was probably over zealous with adjusting the screws at first.

However, why
the stumbling?  Should I try adjusting the idle to be a little richer?  If so,
then how should I modify the above procedure to accomplish this?
If that's not
the answer, then other suggestions are welcome.

Thanks,

Josh
