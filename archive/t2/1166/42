I believe that is why they say, "a little dab'l do ya". heh

I use a small amount of copper based anti-sieze on plugs and never install
or pull them unless the engine is cold. 20 years and no failures so
far...but I really think all things considered, clean plug threads, clean
head threads, proper torque and a cold engine are the best "guarantee" for
keeping your threads in your heads.
