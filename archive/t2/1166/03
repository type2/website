As I've mentioned the autobox T4 is about the worse possible cooling scenario
due to how a torque converter makes the engine cool (or not cool as the case
is) when coasting down after loading up on an incline.  Only thing to make it
worse is if it is in a Vanagon.  I've had great luck with external 96 plate
cooler located on the floor in the engine compartment on the US drivers side
(opposite the battery.)  If deluxe Westy, I'd just go ahead and relocate the
battery on that side as a sealed gel inside the bus.  96 plater fits perfect,
and is right there for oil lines.  Standard precautions taking them through
the tin.  Electric cooling fan on top (I've used Japanese import from pick and
pull) blowing down to supplement the ram effect of the scoops, and to keep the
air going down, not being sucked up off the exhaust when stationairy.  Will
drop oil temps an easy 30-40F.  I cut a big hole just under the size of the
cooler, cover with heavy expanded
 steel mesh on the bottom for protection.  You do need to watch and spray it
off occasionally to keep mud/crud out of the cooler fins, but surprisingly the
little splash guard in the wheelwell does a pretty fair job except if you
submerge it in mud/muck.  The 96 plate kits are still pretty cheap.  You can
use sandwich adapter, thermo sandwich adapter (search for 914 units), or
eliminate the factory cooler, but that takes a bit more work.
 
Having once
had probably one of the most overinstrumented air cooled vanagons ever run, I
wouldn't say oil and head temps vary independently, just oil lags the head
temps, and the oil temps tend to climb and saturate at a steady state
eventually.

I know that others have reported succes
with external oil coolers. It may be
worth doing a search.

You don't mention
the head temps. I understand from others that oil and head
temps can vary
relatively independently.

Martin.
