I have been reading on the list about installing one of these for years.and
keep thinking I am going to install one.

 

The Dakota have been getting good reviews, (they are digital, which doesn't
look the best IMHO).

 

Do most folks install these under the #3 sparkplug, and is that an accurate
enough location? 

 

It looks like the sender wire is a special piece of equipment, ie you can't
just use any wire. How long a wire do you guys recommend? I'm sure 6' is too
short, 10' might work, but I imagine it could be tight, 14' seems like
plenty, and 18' seems overkill.
