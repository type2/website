Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Anti-Seize and spark plugs 

Article is similar to the video I've seen.  But honestly I don't know Dan, the
whole thing is largely academic in some regards.  When I was an engineer I
bought a $150k ('97 dollars BTW) Sturtevant-Richmont (one of the best) torque
calibrator for our plant.  So of course I checked calibration on all my own
stuff, and a bunch of engineer and machinist buddies.  We hadabout 40
wrenches, a lot of old aero grade clickers, some that couldn't meet strict
military specs to recalibrate, several dials (Snap On, MAC, CDIs), various
cheapo clickers from the Craftsman micro-torque to a slew of Harbor Freight
stuff, and of course several aged beam wrenches of various US makers all in
1/4-3/4" drive.
 
The take home was results there were all over the place as
well up to the tune of 25-30% errors, and the Craftsman clickers (which many
people use likely) were some of the worst (mostly for poor repeatability),
some HF were good, some terrible, Snap-On and MAC dials were generally pretty
good even if unknown history, and beams were of course right on if they hadn't
been taken grossly plastic before.  What I came to was that generally it is
far better to take the chance on a good US aero/pro grade clicker or dial
particularly if it has an aged calibration tag but not one that states
rejected.  Particularly as S-R stated that without abuse, the average aero/pro
clicker takes about 2500-3000 cycles to start having issues with the spring
that makes it click to need a recalibration.  So if it made calibration even
in 1993 and has been sitting undropped in its padded box, it will still likely
today compared to one that has say torqued 4 plugs on 4 cars a
 day for 6 months, which likely will be shifting.
 
So this is another one
where I always sort of find it funny, because arguing a couple foot pounds on
a spark plug either way due to plating,  antiseize, or whatever is ludicrous
when countless people don't use one period and when whatever you are using to
do the measuring is likely to have much more error than the spec that might be
argued.  Same holds to rods, mains, through bolts, if you can't/aren't
measuring stretch you are probably just jerking yourself around on the
measuring.  Digital stuff throws a positive wrench into the mix sort of, if
you trust again not taken plastic and the quality of the initial gage, and
that the electronics don't drift over time.
 
An interesting question for all
the "pro" mechanics who have weighed in about using/not using antiseize would
be, do you all have your wrenches recalibrated every 3 months (our plant
schedule then for hand drivers, most 1/4-3/4 wrenches), yearly (our schedule
then on the bigger less used stuff), 5 years, EVER?  Probably (maybe) some of
the "pro" engine builders do yearly but most mechanics, I bet not.  I think
even in the aero world, technically the requirement is usually by number of
operations, not time strictly, just that most places do it by time as the
other is harder to track, and time interval catches ones damaged by drops,
etc.  Any aviation mechanics to weigh in?

I had not seen any
