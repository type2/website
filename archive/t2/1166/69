Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize and spark plugs

Methinks this argument is more appropriate for the English semantics 
forum.   I'm enjoying it, nonetheless.  As an interested observer, I'm 
leaning toward the use a little lube and no anti-sieze option but what I 
think should throw little weight around this exalted milieu.  Now, what 
time was that jousting match?  And is it Friday yet?
