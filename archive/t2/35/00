Subject: Re: [T2] The journey of moisture and a change of heart about undercoating.

I don't doubt that rolling out of the factory the
undercoating on VW's were fine & worked
effectively,but I regularly hear complaints about the
difficulty in repairing the metal underneath that
rusts. 
Sure,the undercoating worked,but for how long?
Nothing short of a chemical stripper or a sandblaster
gets the damn stuff off & it's a liability in a big
way.
As for factory paint being  the best stuff for it,well
I can tell you I had my laugh for the day.
Read an article on a vintage beetle or bus sometime &
it always reads that the spray painter gave the bus
very feww coats to retain the factory feel & look.
That's right,they didn't waste any extra paint on your
bus the day before it came out of the factory.
So lets be reasonable & admit that both factory
undercoat & paintjobs have their weaknesses.
I guess we're all whining abouu the same thing in the
end....RUST!!
:-)
Cheers
