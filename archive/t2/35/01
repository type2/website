I get your point,Terry.
When during the process was the metal zinc
prepped,after welding or before,because to weld
anything the zinc needs to come off first,as you'd
well know creating weaknesses from day one.
And yeah I'm not a spray painter,I'm a musician,but
the fact remains that short of a show car that's
driven very seldom & probably trailer to most events,
most people don't have the time or the hoist to do the
sort of cleaning you were talking about on the
underside of their bus.
I bow to your longer experience and greater
knowledge,but unfortunately it's still going to be me
that's going to have to face the rust monster with a
welder & a grinder as my only weapons of defence.
If you'd like to take a trip down here to Australia
I'll happily take some lessons:-)
Cheers
Andrew
