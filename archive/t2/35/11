Hello list,
I'm going to be in Norfolk, VA for about two weeks from 22 Oct thru 2 Nov. If 
anyone could help with directions to any junk yards or VW shops (repair parts 
dealers) I will be looking for various parts for my many different VWs and a 
few for friends. I am also looking for flea markets or the best place (store, 
shop, connections) to get HotWheels, and Matchbox. And a good place to have 
my birthday dinner on the 28th of October (only 29 for the 15th time:). Any 
help would be greatly appreciated.

Max
