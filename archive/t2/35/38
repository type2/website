the name has been changed I think to Agilis something or other
but I had to get em special ordered (the MXT) from Nevada, several stores
told me they didn't exist and they weren't in the computer database but
they were there with a little search and visiting several tire stores
finally got em from NTB.

balance, etc   not a cheap tire, but IMO well worth it.

that's one heavy van so get the right weight rating or learn how to handle
it when you have a blow out at speed due to tire failure (ask me how I
know) 

good luck
