Subject: RE: [T2] Engine hatch bove engine?

Hi Paul,

You have to remember that Muir was an American writing for the American
market and therefore (unjustifiably) feels free to ignore anything that
happens outside of the USA. So some of the things that he writes just are
not true and this is one of them.

Hatches in the tailgate floor were only fitted to T2 Type 2s with a Type 4
engine; the buses sent out of the factory with a 1600 type 1 engine were
never fitted with this hatch right through to the end of European production
of T2s in '79.
For the air cooled Vanagon (T25) the access hatch was fitted regardless of
weather a 1600 type 1 or a 2000 type 4 engine was fitted.

Muir ignores this because the people of the USA were deprived of 1600 Type 1
powered busses from 1972 model year onwards.

So either your bus is, or was originally, a 1600cc bus.

Good luck

Hi,

A quick question. In John Muirs book (How To Keep Your Volks Alive) he
swiftly mentions a hatch above the engine bay in post '75 buses which can be
opened for easy access to the engine. I've never heard of one and my '75 bus
does not have one, is this a mith or is my bus from before they were
introduced?

Thanks,

Paul.
