Subject: Heater Cable question again

Hello, I didn't get any response on my last heater cable question, and I'm
still having problems. I was able to get the heat to 'blend' to the back,
but if I blend only to the front, I can't get it to reset to the back again?
Despite my attempts to secure the cable to the center plenum, it still
moves.

Does anyone have a diagram of the center plenum cable they can e-mail or fax
me? Having a bit of heat in the back help take the edge of the cold. I
plenty warm up front, but after a while convection take over and the cold
air from the back will freeze me out.

Thanks,

Chris
