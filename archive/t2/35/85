Subject: Bessie and her Eriba Puck

Bessie is getting ready to pull our 1969 Eriba Puck-- We do need a little
help--I received two sets of wheels 8" and 10"  but no Spare!
Does anyone out there have an extra 8" or 10" Eriba Puck wheel??
Also we are missing the key--Went to a couple of locksmiths and no luck, on
a key for the Puck door--It is original--So if any one knows where or how to
get a Puck key--i need one--hopefully, uj
