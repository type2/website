Subject: Engine hatch bove engine?

Hi,

A quick question. In John Muirs book (How To Keep Your Volks Alive) he
swiftly mentions a hatch above the engine bay in post '75 buses which can be
opened for easy access to the engine. I've never heard of one and my '75 bus
does not have one, is this a mith or is my bus from before they were
introduced?

Thanks,

Paul.
