They started making buses with the hatch over the
engine in 1973 if I remember correctly. The '72
models, first year of the new engine, didn't have one
and they must have learned from that as they started
putting in the access hatch the next year.  Are you
sure yours is a '75 model? Or are they different "over
there"?  (I'm assuming Paul is in England, etc.,
because of his email address)
