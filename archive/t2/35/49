Might want to run your numbers - I think the 195/75R-14 is smaller than the 
tire the bus came with.

Anyone confirm?

I am running 205/75R-14 - a little taller than stock.

Of course I'll have 110 HP soon so who cares.

I figure the VW Type2 is a pretty low geared beast to start with so I don't 
want to give up anything by going to a smaller tire.

Understand that this is a tiny difference. I'll bet it is no more than the 
difference between a new tire and a worn one.

Ciao!
