Subject: Re: Clutch Cable Grease Suggestions?

If you cannot take it out easily to re-grease it, get some of that lithium
grease in a spray can. It has a little tube on it like WD40. When you spray
it, it comes out mixed with a volatile carrier which evaporates and leaves
the thicker grease behind. The stuff is great for throttle, ebrake, and
clutch cables.
