Subject: roof vent for Westy

I was wondering if anybody has had any experience installing a roof vent
(or sky light or something like that) on a Westfallia.  I have a '77 and
was thinking that it would be a good way to vent out some of the heat
and moisture when camping and to cool the bus when parked.  Are there
any kits available?

Thanks

Ben
