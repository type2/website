Subject: re-winter storage in barns

I just stored my van today in the local fairground cattle barn, where many
people winter store their precious cars($100 for the winter). People store
them there year after year, apparently.  No sooner did I do this than a
friend of mine told me never to store a vehicle where animals live,as the
ammonia from their urine will rot the vehicle. Does anyone know about this
definitively? I'll yank it back out if the consensus is that is is true
about the ammonia.
