The only problem with filing down the brass "tumblers" (for lack of a better
term), is that they are meant to be a fixed height above the grooves and
bumps of your key, by filing these down, you make if easier and easier for
multiple keys to work in the cylinder. Overall effect is to make it easier
for the wrong keys to work. A locksmith will replace the shims with the
correct shim number in order to fit them all to your key, while still
maintaining lock integrity and security. Money well spent I figured.
Whatever you decide on, lube the whole lock mechanism well before
re-install.
