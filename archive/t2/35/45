Subject: Re: [T2] roof vent for Westy

I have been looking at the same thing.

I have selected the Ventline clamp on 14X14 vent with 12 volt fan. It has
yet to be purchased it becuase I lack of funds an time to install it right
now.  I am hopeing to get to it this winter/spring.

My bus is a high top and already has a hole 14X14 with plexglass over it.
It seemed to me that the clamp on would be easier to install and would
damage the roof less.

Can anyone comment on what I plan to do?
