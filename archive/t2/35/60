Subject: searching

Hi Folks,
	Thanks for your recent tips on my oil leaks.  I'm a new poster but
a long time lurker. I have done a lot of searching the archives (100's of
hours) and gleaned much very useful info from them. For that I thank you
all very much.
	A couple of habits of list members make the search engine very
much less than optimal.  The first is list members replying to a help
message with "the info is in the archives".  Since the original included
message, or the header, still has the keyword, the search engine picks up
this useless (to the searcher) reply.  Over time these have accumulated to
where they become the dominant feature of many of my search results. It
would be of great help if the replyer assisted the newbie by directing his
search to the relevant message (ideal), or period, i.e. in June '99 we
covered this.  Sometimes I have become convinced that the info is NOT in
the archives but someone thought it was and now the ONLY thing the search
engine picks up are these useless replys.  Replying with "it's in the
Bentley" (without a page ref or some additional information) does the same
thing to the search engine. Please don't do this.
	The second habit is that of just hitting the reply button and not
cleaning up the mail so that the reply is pertinent.  It is such a
pleasure to see a reply where someone has taken a bit of time and replied
to various parts so that the asker, and others digging much later, can
understand what is applicable to what.  Finding reply stacked upon reply
stacked upon reply is often not very useful despite how snappy your words
seemed at the time. Remember, your emails become part of a very useful
community body of knowledge.  Please make searching for the pearls a bit
easier.  Thanks. jon
