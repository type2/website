it's off subject, but the Army's largest stockpile of
chemical warfare weapons is at the Deseret Chemical
Depot in Utah's west desert, about an hour from Salt
Lake. BTW, since 9/11 it's been surrounded by a
armored calvary regiment.

Nearby in the town of Stockton, is a tiny, lovingly
maintained VW junkyard.

Some sort of statement on the uses of technology, i suppose...
