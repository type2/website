The truth of the matter is Bob, while cosmoline does not dry hard, it is
a pain in the butt to remove other than washing it off with a good bath
of gasoline---remember that ?

And seeing as how I' not running anything I drive in a gasoline wash, I
guess I'm covered.

It is possibly the best inner panel rust preventative money can buy---it
creeps into them little baby spot welded seams where the tar and other
garbage just won't get to---
And on the bottom it doesn't move one iota---
And furthermore it doesn't chip, fade, peel or crack 
And done more thing Bob---ever  tried it, on the bottom of any vehicle
you have ever owned ?

How sad---it works.

Everthing that was shipped your way from here, was "undercoated" with
cosmoline, to protect it especially from the salt air in the holds of
the ships enroute. 
WW II surplus stuff can stll be found, covered with the same coating
applied 50 some years ago. 
and as a veteran I can tell you that stuff is the most disgusting stuff
I have ever had to deal with, it never really dries and it can be
scraped away very easily. great for shipping but I sure wouldn't want it
on my bus 
Enough said? 
more than enough said, yuck!
