Subject: tires

Greetings,

I am looking into buying a new set of tires for my '72 campervan and I would 
like some advice.  I have narrowed it down to basically two brands.

Either the Michelin MXT Reinforced 205/70R14 or the BF Goodrich Radial All 
Terrain T/A 27X8.50 R14LT/C.  If anybody would like to give me their $.02 as 
to which one might be better, or possibly suggest a brand that I have not 
mentioned that is better I would really appreciate it.  I don't want to 
spend allot of coin, but I realize that getting the proper tires is more 
important than saving a couple of bucks.
