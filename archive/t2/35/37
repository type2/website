I won't use Palo Alto Speedo again.  I sent my Type 3 Ghia speedo there for
restoration and they called me back and said they couldn't do a restoration,
but they could service it.  So they shipped it back to me in parts so I
could restore it myself and then I had to send it back to be reassembled.
Total price for taking it apart and lubing the gears was over $100.  Next
time I'll send it to North Hollywood Speedo (factory VDO center), which I
should have done in the first place.
