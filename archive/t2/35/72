Subject: Re: [T2] oil filter cross reference - FART

Take a clean filter and suck in and out through the center hole- there
should NOT be a backflow valve in the bus filters, as they are at the
bottom of the total oil level.    A filter that sticks down further
should not affect function, but is liable to off-roading or high curb
damage!
