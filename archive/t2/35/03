Send me the ticket---I'm on the way !!

A working vacation in Aussie Land sounds good !

One more footnote to this train of non- undercoating insanity---
Remeber WW II ?
Everthing that was shipped your way from here, was "undercoated" with
cosmoline, to protect it especially from the salt air in the holds of
the ships enroute.

WW II surplus stuff can stll be found, covered with the same coating
applied 50 some years ago.

Enough said?

I get your point,Terry. 
When during the process was the metal zinc prepped,after welding or
before,because to weld anything the zinc needs to come off first,as
you'd well know creating weaknesses from day one. And yeah I'm not a
spray painter,I'm a musician,but the fact remains that short of a show
car that's driven very seldom & probably trailer to most events, most
people don't have the time or the hoist to do the sort of cleaning you
were talking about on the underside of their bus. 
I bow to your longer experience and greater knowledge,but unfortunately
it's still going to be me that's going to have to face the rust monster
with a welder & a grinder as my only weapons of defence. If you'd like
to take a trip down here to Australia I'll happily take some lessons:-) 
Cheers

Andrew, 
Please read my prior posting which states exactly what you have just 
responded to---- 
The Robotic Paint system ain't worth nothing---but the sheet metal was 
zinc prepped prior to that thin film of paint, and you disturb the rest 
of that, you'll have more problems, very shortly. 
What do you do for a living? 
I refinish Semi's---Have been doing it for 25 years, and am totally 
aware of what goes into the prepping and refinishing of a new vehicle. 
I wasn't talking off the top of my hat.
