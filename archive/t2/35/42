Check the Yorktown area. Seemed like there were several in that area.

Also check west of the city. There was an area with alot of yards there too.

Sorry I can't be any more specific b/c it has been 6 years or so since I 
last was stationed there.

We always bought a street map and got out the metro phone book.

Lots more imports in the area but the salt air took it's toll.



Ciao!
