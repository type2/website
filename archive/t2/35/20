Hello List,

I want to thank everyone for their thoughts and
opinions on undercoating. I guess everyone uses what
works for them. I guess I can be alittle over paranoid
about rust, but I am. I am sure everyon's bus has
different degrese of decay in diferent areas. In the
same line of thinking, I am sure each bus's
undercoating is in different conditions.  The only
reason why I mentioned the thought of striping a
section of the bottom at a time and using POR 15 was
because most of the undercoating on the underside of
my bus has lifted or pealed off completely. Yes, the
undercoating that was there did a good job at keeping
rust out for as long as could be expected, but it has
long since failed on my bus. I didn't think this
thread would get much attention.;0) Thanks for all the
replies and encouragment. I hope I did not stray too
far from valid bus content. Good Luck with your bus!

Have a nice day!
