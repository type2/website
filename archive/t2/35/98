Subject: Turn signals and tires

Tried to fix a short in my turn signals/hazards last night on my new 78
bus. Behaviour is left turn works fine, right turn blows the fuse in about
2 seconds, hazard blows it immediately. Disconnected both front and rear
housing and I still have a short. So I pull the plug on the switch and the
short goes away. So I take the switch out of the steering column, expecting
worn insulation or something, everything looks fine, test turnsignal switch
operation with my OHM meter, works fine. At this point it's late, I'm sick
of my B&W wiring diagram so I go to bed. Grabbed the color wiring diagram
off the web for further troubleshooting tonight. Any suggestions? Dang horn
doesn't work either PITA! Inspection on Friday

On tires, I saw a great tip from a Rialta owner for a snow tire option that
isn't a offroad tire. Nokian makes a commercial load range D snow tire in
185R14   and 195R14. I found the info on Nokian's site but have not priced
them or checked availability, other then noting that Tirerack doesn't carry
Nokian tires. Here are links to the Nokian site, these are to the framed
pages, if you go to the regular nokian site you need to look under
products.LightTruck/SUV.Commercial in their nav menu
185R14 is the 10C, aggressive pattern

195R14 is the NR09, looks more all season.
