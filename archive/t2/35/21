They are no longer available new. You will have to try to find one at a
junkyard ('75-78 interchange except for California-emissions vehicles).  Or
you can replace your heat exchangers and exhaust with a new '72-74 setup and
elminate this and other NLA parts. Details on this option have been covered
on the list several times before; check the archives.
