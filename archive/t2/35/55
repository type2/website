Not that it's directly relevant to the original question, but the above
statement is not entirely correct. You can use a Vanagon wasserboxer oil
filter on a Rabbit, but you cannot use a Rabbit oil filter on a watercooled
Vanagon. The correct Vanagon oil filter (as sold by Volkswagen, Mann, and
Mahle) adds a check valve that prevents oil starvation at startup, a feature
specified by VW themselves but NOT found (or required) on the Rabbit oil
filter.  Some aftermarket oil filter brands list their Rabbit oil filter as
fitting Vanagons, but don't believe it; just because it physically fits
doesn't mean that it is correct for the vehicle.  I just wanted to mention
this in case anyone reads the above and decides that they can save a buck or
two by putting Rabbit oil filters on their wasserboxer.
