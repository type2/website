There are quite a few of them in Suffolk on US
58/460/13 (all three roads run together).  Just drive
down that road out of Bowers hill in Chesapeake like
you are heading to Suffolk, then take your pick, at
least 10-12 in the immediate vincinity.  Roberts is
especially good.

Closer to Norfolk (actually in Norfolk) is Tubbs and
Ingrams auto parts.  The are right next to each other,
right next to the Ford Plant on Indian River Road. 
Both of them tend to be higher than Suffolk, I guess
because of the convenience.  

Still watch out for snakes this time of year,
especially in Hampton Road with it's maritime climate.

Regards,

Mark
