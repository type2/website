Hi Volks,

I'm travelling again next month and will have an afternoon/evening
available in Salt Lake City next month on the 11th. I'll be in training on
the 12th-14th but will have evenings open on the 12th and 13th.

If any local bus owners are available to get together, drop me a line.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
