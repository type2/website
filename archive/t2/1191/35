Subject: Re: [T2] 77bus oil leak

hmm,, going from an oil filter change to pulling the engine to put $$$ into 
it... strange! lol

if it was me,, I'd want to pin point that oil leak BEFORE i pulled the 
engine...
if it is a crack.. they can be almost impossible to find unless the engine 
is running.
you might not have to pull the engine at all..

find a way to clean all the old oil off... pressure wash with hot water.. or 
even a degreaser spray... pry up some tin,, look thru the holes in the tin.. 
and see where the leak is originating..
then if you pull the engine, you know what area to zone in on

you might find something as easy as tightening or replacing the oil pressure 
switch..
good luck!
Have fun what ever you do
Jamie
