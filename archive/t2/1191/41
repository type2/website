Subject: Upper Shock Nut (grrrr)

Never, ever break the weld on the rear upper shock nut...All I wanted
to do was adjust the rear torsion bars, but first I figured as long as
the Bus was up and the wheel was off I'd replace the shocks and axle
snubber...Wellll, I put the wrench on the bolt and gave it a tug...
No go...So  put the breaker bar on it and SNAP...Shoot, I thought, the
bolt broke...But nooo...The bolt spun and I could just get a finger
behind the shock tower and feel the nut spinning...OK, so I got the
offset grinder out and cut the eye of the old shock and peeled it off
the bolt...My first thought was to cut the bolt on the outside and
using a suitable drift, push it thru' the tower...No go...Even tapping
the
bolt in revealed...The gas tank is sitting about an inch behind the
nut...OK, I've got to get some access to it so I pulled the firewall off
(Remembering the two secret screws under it). OK, firewall out and
using a sharpened prybar as a chisel, I cut out the inside of the wheel
well around the shock tower...Now using my longest Sawzall blade I cut
the bolt and nut...Surprise..The welded nut held but the sheet
metal had ripped out of the shock tower...Now here comes the scary
part...I put a shock bolt thru' the tower and got a thick washer and
nut on it..Tightened it up and (Don't try this at home, kids) shielded
the gas tank with some welder's cloth and mig welded the washer and
nut onto the tower...

Oh yeah, all of this only took about a day an' a half...Now to think
about adjusting the torsion arms...What's gonna break then ...;-(
