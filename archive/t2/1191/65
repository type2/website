Mandy, your battery cables are probably corroded at their connections on each end. Remove them at the battery end, and at the ground connection inside the engine compartment, and at the starter. Clean them really well, and at the ground point in the engine compartment you can even sand gently around the bolt hole the cable bolt screws into. I am betting it's just a case of corrosion.
