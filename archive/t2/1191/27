Subject: OE style headliner

I'm about to put the mohair style headliner in my 60 - I bought it from WW
along with the installation kit - there is a recommended auto upholstery shop
who will do it as will a local school shop - I'm looking for any photos or
instructions for the installation of the headliner - I'm confident in either
option but I want who ever I choose to be 100% aware the windows must come
out.

TIA
