Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 BUS FIND

The dual carbed 1800 cc type 4 engine on a 74 bus is a fine engine. Going
to a 1600 type1 engine would be a downgrade in performance and MPG.
Now, if it were me, I might consider putting a Subaru SOHC EJ22 or EJ25
engine in there, If I were to consider an engine swap of any kind, or maybe
Jake Raby's suby conversion 26 special.
But since I dont have an extra $5000 and a few months labor to spare - I'll
be happy as can be with the type4.
