Thanks John (and Mike) for your feedback and information. I'll search for the urethane boots and one of the greases suggested below. 

For what it's worth, all the bearings did fall right out of the bearing cage on the 'bad' CV joint when I removed if from the outer race. This only happened with one bearing on the other three when removed. 

Although it's a messy job, I won't be too intimidated when I need to do it again sometime down the road.
