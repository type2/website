Monty,

Oops, let me correct my previous statement.

I wrote, "This list exists to help you out if you decide to keep your bus
original"

What I meant to say is, "This list exists to help you our whether or not
you decide to keep your bus original". The previous statement sounded like
we are a pretty exclusive bunch. Sorry about that!
