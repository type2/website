For Max and others under, uh, about the age of 50:

Most of us didn't get into Type 2s because they were cool, so much,  
but because they represented - in the 1960s and 1970s - the antithesis  
of what the big three were offering. No annual styling changes. No use- 
it-and-throw-it-away mentality. That's why there's a Muir guide for  
VWs and not for any other type of car (did you ever wonder about why  
that was?).

The ethos of the Type 1 and the Type 2 was part of a larger whole,  
which included the Whole Earth Catalog (the original is available on  
line, if you've never seen it). And it was consistent with a style of  
economics that's pretty much underground these days. It was based on  
the work of E. F. Schumacher, "Small Is Beautiful."

I don't care why people get into old VWs. If it's because they're  
kewl, that's okay with me. But I think it's helpful to know what  
motivated the brand success in the U.S, as well as the ethic that says  
- learn how to fix it yourself. Which helped to lead to this list.
