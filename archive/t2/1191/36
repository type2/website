Hey bus folken,

Fifteen years ago I decided I needed a Westy for trips from San Diego  
to Flagstaff and back. I'm now on bus number two (the first was a 1976  
that I camperized myself; this is a 1982 Westy) and I have yet to have  
a bus that I trust to get me to Flagstaff (500 miles one way, 7000  
feet gain in elevation), although I've made it to Tucson and back.

I've been all over this one and can't get the vacuum up or the  
climbing temps down. Vacuum is 12-13 inches. The thing drinks gas like  
a Hummer. Clamps on everything. New runners on the intake tubes. S- 
boot checks out. New seal under the throttle.

I spent Thanksgiving stripping everything off the top of the engine to  
check the torque on the cylinder head nuts - they're fine. Put  
everything back together - no change.

Man, is this frustrating. I want to drive a Westy to Flagstaff.

I just had to whine.

Mark
