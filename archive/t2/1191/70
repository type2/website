Subject: 1974 BUS FIND

Hey volks, I just got ahold of a 74 bus, original paint, no rust!  It's
missing the dash though.  What years of dashes will fit in it?  Also, I would
like to put a standard 1600cc engine in.  I don't want the pancake engine.  I
need to find the Euro tin for the standard engine to fit in the bus though.  I
just needed to know these couple of things.  THANKS, Monty
