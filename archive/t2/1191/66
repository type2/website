Sadly, I must let my van go. I just found out I'm being laid off at the end
of December. It's not so much that I need to get rid of the van as I have
nearly another complete van minus the shell in parts (Westy interior).
That's stuff's gotta go, because I will no longer have the garage.
On to the van. As I said, it's a sunroof model, eight passenger. I'm in
California, so the two liter is all stock. The bench seats are removable
with wingnuts, bolts and clamps. I haven't recovered the bench seats, but
the fronts are done. The dash is in excellent shape, and all the gauges and
lights work except the fuel gauge (I have parts, but have been waiting for
a reason to pull the engine to get to the tank). I restored the exterior
about six & a half years ago, removed all the rubber and glass, shot the
van all white inside and out, then light blue below the beltline. All new
rubber, new custom tinted glass manufactured for the three rear windows (
as in tinted glass, not film) and for the jalousy windows I haven't
installed yet. New lenses for all the lights, Bosch DOT approved halogen
headlights, There are no wiring issues with this van. It is unmolested.
There's a nice Kenwood CD head unit with bluetooth and a USB port, electric
front door locks and rear hatch release, and a top of the line Clifford
alarm that I challenge you to locate. The wheels are 15", custom made from
the original centers with 15" rims welded on by Stocton Wheel, powder
coated white and all-terrain tires. I also have the original Westy tent
with all the poles. The rubber piece that clamps to the gutter is getting
stiff and is slightly torn (the rubber, not the canvas), and I see that
that part is once again available, but the rest of the tent is perfect.

Here are some links to some photos f the van. Keep in mind that these are
about six years old, but I've taken good care:

I think I'll ask $11,000 for everything.
