This works, give it a try.
    I have an old gas stove/oven in our shops engine room. We use it for
 powder coating, and other off the wall heating chores. We take warped valve
 covers and heat them in a pre-heated oven at 550' for about 20 minutes,
 remove them and install them on an old head till they cool naturally. Doing
 this allows the metal molecules to realign, letting the cover take a "set"
 while its straight attached to the head. I have done this many times with
 out fail. Even with the repaint its much cheaper than new covers.
    I found this by accident while powder coating a set. (bright green no
 less at customers request)

 I WOULD OFFER THIS DISCLAIMER: AVOID USING THE OVEN IN YOUR KITCHEN, THIS
 PROCEDURE MAY CAUSE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS ON THE COUCH! SOME WIFE'S JUST DON'T
 UNDERSTAND NOR APPRECIATE WHY CHRISTMAS DINNER TASTES LIKE PENNZOIL 10W30.

 HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALL!!!!!
