Correct, but lower case   -  list1e .  This code, which is for list members
only, gets you 5% off most orders over $50, with certain exceptions (most
notably sale items, special-order or made-to-order items, wheels/tires,
engines/transmissions).  The idea is to largely offset your shipping cost, so
your order ships free or nearly-free.  At $1200, for those who are doing a
complete restoration or have a driveway full of VW's like I do, the discount
doubles to 10% (code PROJ1200).
