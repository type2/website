Being a new Type 2 owner, I actually like having both sources, especially the archives here.
I also troll some of the UK boards looking for info. So far I haven't had a question about my bus that I couldn't find 
an answer for with some judicious searching.

Plus it's nice to get an email every once and a while that's not trying to sell me viagra.
