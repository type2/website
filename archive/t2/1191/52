Those look better than mine (I had some pitting) when I cleaned mine and 
that was 50,000 miles ago.  Are they knocking?  Usually when they go bad 
they knock because they've gotten really loose.

If you are going to change them, I'd probably change them as a pair so 
that you don't have to figure out which was the new one and which is the 
old.  That, or make sure you engrave the new/old ones so you know which 
are which.
