Subject: Voltage regulator plug.

couldn't figure out why voltage regulator was acting up, well seems the 
plug on the bottom (3 wire T pattern) was ready to crumble. so if anyone 
has a spare lying around they would part with.

didn't think there was any part not on the spare parts wall
but it is always the one you need "right now"

thanks
