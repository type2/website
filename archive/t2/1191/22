Subject: 68 bus

I now have a 68 bus for a frequent driver and road trips. Not a show bus, but
mechanically sound. I am not a body work expert, but plan to sand out and
treat the surface rust in and out, pop out some minor dents, and repaint....
It has been about 20 years since i did much more than tune ups....
Questions: is there a best place to get a headliner so i dont have to mess
with aftermarket that doesn't quite fit?
Also, where should i order window seals, all of them? My bus has side vent
windows. It has outside seal crome, but i am ok with either cali look or crome
back on.... I hear issues with ordering some seals that dont fit and finding
complete sets including seals for side vent windows..... I found a complete
set for $700 through kustom1warehouse.net but dont know anything about them or
thier rubber quality.... Or about seal pricing, but this seams alot more
expensive than 20 years ago :)
 Any other tips or suggestions before i start pulling windows, spot sanding
and priming would be greatly appreciated.  (Including weighing in on best
surface rust treatments)
Thanks. Mikah
