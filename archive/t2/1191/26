Bus Depot is a good place for getting quality parts for all systems for
your bus.  West Coast Metric makes good rubber parts in my experience, Bus
Depot may stock them, I don't recollect offhand.  I've not read/heard much
about that Kustom place you mentioned.

The rubber grommet seals between the master cylinder and lower reservoir,
as well as the sleeve seals between the tube connecting the upper and lower
reservoirs may need to be replaced.  This can be done with the M/C and fill
tube still in the bus, albeit gingerly.  I did it in the parking lot at
college when my 70 bus was with me for a photoshoot.

I'm working with relatives on dragging a 68 Westy home ~1000 miles and have
been thinking about all the parts/perishables she'll need.  Good luck on
getting yours back on the road!
