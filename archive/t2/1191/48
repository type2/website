So the pictures don't show a whole lot:

But the one listed vw10 is the one I will replace. There are some divots at the base and it's not as smooth as the others where the bearings sit. Looks like one CV joint and three other boot kits. 

Any suggestions on where to get decent boots are appreciated - I heard some are crap.
