Subject: Re: 1958 bus won't start

Mandy,

I agree with Courtney that it's best to start with cleaning the connections. 
I had a similar problem recently, and following the advice from this list I 
replaced the ground strap and cleaned all the connections, and that solved 
the problem.  I'm pretty sure it was the ground strap that was bad, though 
it looked okay superficially.

If you weren't getting the red/green lights when you first tried to start 
it, yes, there could have been a problem with the circuit from the coil to 
the switch.  You could run a temporary jumper from the regulator to the 
ignition side of the coil to test this, as Muir describes so well (and I've 
used often).  But the fact that it first tried to start and later didn't 
seems to point more to the connections at the battery.  I'd start there. 
Clean everything so that it's bright and shiny, and use dielectric grease 
when you put it back together.

Good luck,
Jerry
