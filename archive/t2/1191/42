Spare browser (to accept cookies temporarily) and a spare email address. 
That's how I get around nosey websites like that. Typically though like 
you said - I have no interest in doing business with such an establishment.

Beyond Internet Explorer are Opera (favorite!) Firefox, Safari, Sea 
Monkey, Midori, Konqueror, Ephiphany and dozens of others. One browser 
(Opera) is my general purpose browser, Konqueror ONLY does my work 
Facebook account and file exploring locally, Firefox for cranky 
websites, Midori for a quick look at something such as Wikipedia, and so 
forth. I quit Chrome but still use Chromium sometimes when a video won't 
play smoothly in anything else.

I have one email account that has thousands of email spam messages b/c I 
use it ONLY for nosey websites that have something I want. Once every 
quarter or so I go into that account and blow away everything at once 
without reviewing any message.

Everything stays compartmentalized that way. Work/play/personal/SPAM.
