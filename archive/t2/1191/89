Hey Mark,

I have quite a few sets of T4 covers and none are warped. If the warp is so
great that it is beyond the cork gaskets' ability to compensate, they may
need to be replaced.

Do you need a set of straight ones? I may be wrong, but I really don't
think bending the corners will do much since the shape is pressed.
