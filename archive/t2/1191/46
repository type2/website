Subject: Checking valve height on rebuilt heads with a straight edge

Hi,

Another question I believe I have the answer to, but could use some
reinforcement...

After receiving rebuilt (on old castings) heads from a reputable shop, and
before any install, I notice on each head there are one or more valves at
different heights, easily seen and confirmed with a straight edge.

This should not be the case unless there is a seating issue (new valves and
guides), and should be addressed with the shop in question, correct?

Thanks, Mike
