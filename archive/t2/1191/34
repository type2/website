Subject: 77bus oil leak

Changed oil filter 2.75 in od amd still have leak. Pulling motor tomorrow (
as soon as i can get it in the garage) im really leaning on a rebuild so ,
im thinking big hp while ive got it out...any suggestions on head temps or
oil  temps and how to control both? Or am i looking at more problems?
