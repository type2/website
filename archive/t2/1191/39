Subject: Re: [T2] 77bus oil leak

For finding an oil leak, they sell some stuff you can add to your oil, then
when you run the engine you shine a blacklight on the engine, and the stuff
sort of glows purple -or something like that. I can't quite remember. I do
remember using it a long time ago to try to find a leak-it is very helpful.
I don't think it cost too much-and should be available at your FLAPS. I
think it is best to get the engine as clean as possible before using it.

 

try a search for "UV dye for oil leak".
