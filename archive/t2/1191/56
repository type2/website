Subject: Re: [T2] Checking valve height on rebuilt heads with a straight

Thanks Mike. I'll see if I can get my hands on that article. Yes, Type4,
2.0. My PO-installed GEX would hit 400F around town on an average day - it
has 3 different length pushrods in it, random rocker shims, and 4 valves
either sunk or stretched.... so sure, I'd like to avoid the situation I'm
already in. Seem to be out of possibilities tho - I've found no one local
will touch VW heads. If I could afford HAM I'd have done so. I chose the
what I thought was the next best option. Mike



I'd venture to guess that this is no good.  Jake Raby has a very in-depth
article about adjusting the geometry and this sounds like it's gonna give
you a different lift geometry for the valves with different stem length.
