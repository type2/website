77 motors don't have filter adapters??
the oil filter is attached to a stock fitting on the left underside of the 
engine just in front of the fan housing.

how bad is the leak, I had an oil galley plug in that area fall out and 
the engine needed to be completely stripped down to repair, that however 
is very rare, and the oil basically pours out under presure.
