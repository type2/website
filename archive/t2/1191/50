Thank Jamie and David (great links); thanks John for the detailed
explanation. (-at-)$325 each, and given the great reputation of the shop, I
didn't expect to have to deal with these sort of seating/ geometry issues,
while realizing these aren't what are currently considered top of the line.
These are indeed for my long-suffering T4 near-stock rebuild. Guess it's
good I didn't spend more for the big valves and non-stock cam. I believe
the valves, guides, springs, retainers, bolts are supposed to be new (they
appear so). I'll contact the shop to ask about what I'm seeing, try to
verify what is new and not, and see if they offer any options for
addressing the issue. Mike
