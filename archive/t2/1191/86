Bob -

As a general rule, I don't offer the 3 pole plug separately because I
order enough to build all of my harnesses.  However, I occasionally
have a few extras laying around because I have shops once in awhile
want just the base harness and they wanna re-use the old plugs (and
grommets, wouldja believe), nothin' like doin' it on the cheap like a
lot of Bus owners :)

021 971 841  3 Pole Connector  $8.25 + $7 Priority Mail (Add $0.76 tax
if shipped in California).  Total $16.01 (CA) or $15.25 49 States.

This plug is the genuine article, made by Bosch in Germany.  Never
sold separately at the dealer and since obsoleted a long time ago in a
galaxy far away, I was able to locate a stash in Europe and bought up
a bunch.  Landed cost was certainly more than $5 each, but much better
than a quoted $18(!) from a builder of Alternator components here in
SoCal.

Paypal accepted, email your Paypal ID and I will send a Paypal Invoice
to pay from and get one to you.
