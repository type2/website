true,
I consider this a pull the engine job
I thought he was talking about the bolt on the pump adapters
which I can't imagine fit very well if at all on a type 4 engine

while I think it may be possible to pull the fan housing in the bus
I have never tried it I don't think. (lotta stuff over the years I've done 
and don't remember because it was so hard I never tried it that way again)
