Subject: Re: [T2] 77bus oil leak

Just changed oil and filter, still have the leak, looks like a little more
work and a learning experience for me . Guess im doomed to live and learn.
But its turning into a lot fun trying to figure it out. By the time im done
ill have it all rebuilt and doing awesome hp(at least for me) while ive got
it down i might even look at a turbo, or at least a set of twin carbs, cam,
and head work
