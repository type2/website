 I have never tried it I don't think. (lotta stuff over the years I've
done and don't remember because it was so hard I never tried it that
way again)

It's not that bad. The nuts on the heat exchangers have to be released
some to let the exchangers down far enough to allow the fan shroud to
get out.

Whenever I pull the shroud, I also change the fan hub o-ring and rear
main crankshaft seal. Dip stick tube boot and alternator cooling air
boot should be changed as well.
