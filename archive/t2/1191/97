My wife STILL doesn't know that the dishwasher on HD-wash with massive 
amounts of powdered dishwasher detergent will clean a Type 1 engine case 
half of that final little bit of grunge the carwash couldn't get. :-p I 
could almost get both halves in, but not quite.

I WOULD OFFER THIS DISCLAIMER: AVOID USING THE OVEN IN YOUR KITCHEN, THIS
PROCEDURE MAY CAUSE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS ON THE COUCH! SOME WIFE'S JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND NOR APPRECIATE WHY CHRISTMAS DINNER TASTES LIKE PENNZOIL 10W30.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALL!!!!!
