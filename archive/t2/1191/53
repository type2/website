I'd venture to guess that this is no good.  Jake Raby has a very 
in-depth article about adjusting the geometry and this sounds like it's 
gonna give you a different lift geometry for the valves with different 
stem length.

I'd check with another reputable head builder, or look at a new head, to 
see if the valve stems all come to the same height.  I got some new 
heads from Jake and I could have sworn they were all at the same height, 
but I'm not totally sure.

Then again, this is going on a bus, not a hot rod.  Due to the 
misconfigured nature of our engines (assuming this is a type4 engine), 
it's probably going to overheat and you'll end up with different stem 
heights anyways as the valves sink.  Yeah, pessimistic, but unless 
you're changing your valve geometry (different cam), compression ratio, 
and exhaust, you're gonna end up with an engine that will overheat going 
25 up a hill.  I've had this happen *repeatedly* on various stock 
engines... I recently saw someone with their freshly rebuilt (also 
stock) engine and it easily goes over 400 going 65 on the freeway.  It's 
unfortunate because people keep replacing heads instead of fixing the 
problem and then get rid of the bus because it's too problematic :/
