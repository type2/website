I think that if a cv jount has been driven for any length of time with a
torn boot, it should probably be replaced. I don't think your CV jount in
the picture should have damaged the axle.
These days, its so much easier just to install complete sub-axle, CV and
boot on each end purchased as a unit. Usually they want the old set as
cores.
