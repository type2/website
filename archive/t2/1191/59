No digital gauges. I'm only concerned about relative temperatures,  
really. Plus or minus ten to twenty degrees doesn't concern me. What  
does is how well it cools off after a climb, and whether any of the  
things I'm doing, like keeping revs down, as Colin recommends, make it  
better. Shutting the engine off for five minutes does make things  
better.

But I discovered that I don't have an important seal/grommet that  
surrounds the oil filler pipe. I found one, NOS, possibly the last one  
in the universe, and its on its way to me right now. Given the size of  
the hole in the tin and its proximity to the fan on the upper side and  
massive sources of heat below, I expect it to make a huge difference.
