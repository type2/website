I've been on this list for several years now, maybe since 2007, and I am a
younger, late 20's, guy. The list is invaluable for finding keen advice and
great ideas, especially the archives. Personally I have used the list a bit
less as I was fortunate to have a competent mechanic around. However, I am
in the process of moving and will again be sans-mechanic.

Anyhow, for those of us who grew up with modern cars, it helps to have the
perspective that this list provides. As always, thank you everyone for the
kind words, advice, and general cool mindsets.
