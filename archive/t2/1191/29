Subject: Re: [T2] 77 bus oil leak

penzoil website says "their" correct filter is a PZ19....
Take it off.. make sure the gasket is in place.. maybe put another in it's 
place.. sometimes new parts are a problem,,

Hello Guys    here a good one for you just put together a 2 liter motor for 
a
guy traveling that blew his all to hades, put the motor in and start it but
we get no oil pressure  try priming the pump , check the pick-up tube, 
start
to think the pump wasn't working, so take off the filter and crank the 
engine
getting good oil pressure at the filter, start scraching our heads , look at
each other and say you don't think that new filter could be the problem do 
you??
Sure was !!!!  put on a different new filter and bingo we now have oil
pressure. Just shows what I have been saying about getting good parts as 
being the
second hardest thing about working on cars, with the people being the first
hardest . Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem
