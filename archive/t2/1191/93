Yep, gotta agree with this. I was the sucker who went ALL over my electrics 
in my bus looking for a short that killed that ^&^*%$!!!!! battery. After a 
LONG time, I took the battery in to the FLAPS who put it on a load tester, 
and they guy said, "It's had it. Just showed a surface voltage of 12.4 but 
it is NFG". So get the battery checked for sure, although you said you used 
a screwdriver across the starter terminals and it kicked right over??? 
Hmmmm, gotta think about this.
