Interestingly enough, I never got into buses because they were cool... I 
just grew up into a bus family.  My parents had an orange 76 when I was 
born, got a green 76 when I was around 3, I inherited that one and have 
traded out for a few other 76/78 buses ever since.  The only car I ever 
owned until a year ago was a late bay.  It's been a great car to move 
crap, carry surfboards, go on road-trips, and whatever else you can 
dream up.  They are a pain in the ass to deal with some times, but it's 
a 30+ year old car and people think they're cool.

I look at other people and think, wow.. that guy's a bus fanatic.. but 
I'm probably one, too ;)
