I don't know if it makes a difference, but Greg's was a 74 top on a 79
body, and those years had the 'forward opening' top.

The 73 you have originally came with the 'rear opening' top.  If the roof
changed in 73->74 when the tops changed, your effort may be significantly
more than Greg's.

I'm sure others on the list can chime in with more/better details.
