Subject: '72 Weekender CV Joint Update, and a Question

OK, so here is the worst of the CV Joints:

It looks like a boot was replaced after the damage was done. This was the only one that had a torn boot also. 

Could something driven like this have damaged the axle? 

There was quite a bit of play. I'll see shotly, I guess. 

The passenger's side bolts came loose fine. I doused them all with PB Blaster overnight. Twelve down, twelve to go. No bruised knuckles. For me, this is a minor feat. The 6mm socket was key (Thanks Bartnik). 

And thanks for all your input...
