Subject: Re: [T2] '72 Weekender CV Joint Update, and a Question

From your comment it sounds like you have seen this article:

http://type2.com/bartnik/tech.htm

It has some good info about how to spot cv joint damage. The article by Tom
Carrington in the type2.com library is the one I used to remove, clean,
reassemble and refit my cv joints. Note the comment about it being easier to
reassemble the joints incorrectly. It's very true!
