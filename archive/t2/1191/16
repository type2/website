Well, I figured rather than give a half-baked answer, I'd go out and look.

The lower bolt is accessible from under the engine, but you'd need to
pull the fan shroud to get the upper bolt.

You'd better change the oil cooler o-rings while you're in there, and
pressure-test the cooler to make sure it doesn't leak too.
