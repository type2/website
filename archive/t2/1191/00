Hi Mike,

Sorry about that. I am currently migrating between servers and moving my
site to Wordpress. In the process of transition the Westfakia site has yet
to be reloaded... Life is crazy busy just lately and I just hadn't gotten
around to reloading the older content. I've been participating in email
lists a bit less lately thanks to a new work laptop which came with
restrictions on use which somehow prevent my email client from contacting
my server. I haven't quite figured out what I want to do about that.

At some point in the future I want to rework the westfakia site, but since
you need the content sooner rather than later I can (and will) reload it
back to the initial adddress at www.pottsfamily.ca/westfakia.

With any luck, I should have it restored later tonight.

If you want to ask any specific questions that are not answered on the
site, be sure to email me at this address, or at
greg_dot_potts_at_ndgraphics_dot_com. Your donor parts are pretty much
exactly what I started out with... I know just what you're up against.


Happy Trails,



Greg Potts
