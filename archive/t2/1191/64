Subject: 1958 bus won't start

At the risk of exposing my ignorance, I have a question for all you VW people.
 
This should be an easy one for you guys.  Haven't driven the bus in a while
and went to start it, and the battery wasn't strong enough to crank it.
 Charged the battery, put in back on and now I turn the key, and nothing
happens.  The red and green lights don't even come on.
I made sure the battery
was charged and was put back in correctly.  Then I crawl beneath and use two
screwdrivers to jump across the solenoid contacts.  Yikes!!!  That worked.  
But what does that mean?  Does that mean the ignition switch went kaput all of
a sudden?  The electrical system isn't my strong suit, as I'm sure you can
tell.
Thanks in advance,
Mandy in KY
