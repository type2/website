HOLD THE PHONE!!!! Just before I went on my test drive yesterday, I  
checked the vacuum in the engine. When I disconnected the vacuum  
gauge, I neglected to re-plumb the regular vacuum lines!

So this morning, after I caught this bit of stupidity, I went out and  
did the test drive again. And ... all my work has paid off!! Peregrine  
has never run or sounded better. Oil temperature stable at about  
220-225 degrees. MPG is a not great 18.4 mpg, but this is a Vanagon  
Westy, I was over 55 mph throughout the test, and I climbed a low  
mountain pass.

So, right, maybe I'm going to Flagstaff later this year.
