Wow. Go Westy website is very professional, even eye-popping.
But too commercial. While I will reluctantly submit my email address to
create an account in order to view details regarding something like floor
mat color, it's a little over the top to require personal information such
as my home address in order to filter results by the year of my bus. When I
was directed to the "create an account" page, I closed my browser window on
Go Westy permanently.
