Subject: Re: [T2] Checking valve height on rebuilt heads with a straight

Hi, Just a quick update. I received an email response stating "Don't worry,
some how the groove from the intake and exhaust stems are different a bit.
From factory... they will be OK." No mention of exactly what parts are new.
I'll have to call.

On one head, yes, both intake valves appear taller. On the other, only one
is. This makes some sense, as the valves all appear correctly seated on the
combustion side - that is, none appear seated at different depths.
Regardless, unless the valves are the same height, isn't now both the
tension different amongst the valves (as the spring compression differs)
and my geometry a mess in the making? I'll need to work out the push-rod
lengths for each position so that they are correct, which seems better than
shimming, but not as good as having things correct in the first place.
Thanks, Mike
