Hi Volks,

The westfakia website is back online at www.pottsfamily.ca/westfakia.

For those who care, I'd recommend doing a full site grab if there are
references you want, as I cannot guarantee full time accessibility until I
get a chance to straighten out my home network, which is probably not
going to happen for at least a week or two.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
