It's a toss up for me. I've tried stripping the engine in place to
make for a lighter load on the engine pull. The main thing that makes
me dislike that method is being a contortionist to get some of the tin
screws back in place on reassembly. Choose your poison. I'm pretty
back with you on pulling the engine instead.
