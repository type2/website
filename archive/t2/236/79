Subject: Shift-rod Linkage

I'm almost ready to drop  the engine (not literally, I hope) out of my '77
Westy, but I'm stuck on the shift rod linkage.  Bentley says to remove the
square-headed set screw, but the little bugger won't budge.  I don't want to
twist it off or anything...are they normally pretty tight?  Any tricks to
this?

Thanks,
RickG
'77 Westy "Pumpkin II"
