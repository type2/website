Here is the record of this summer

The last column is MPG per the fill and the previous
column is the running average.  I have an FI 78 westy. 
I agree with everything everyone said too.

Fills	Date	       Mileage 	MPG	MPG
1	May 25, 2002	34567.6	23.75	23.75
2	June 6, 2002	34736.4	21.66	19.79

11	August 13, 2002	36205.3	22.95	21.90

The low numbers was a weekend camping trip four of us
went on (fully loaded plus bikes on a rear rack).  WE
drove around 55-65 mph.

Yes I am anal about this, but its a easy way to monitor
engine performance.
