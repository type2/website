Subject: Re: [T2] Overheated & stuck flywheel

Hmm, I had a 71- it's a gland nut that takes over 220 lbs of torque.  To
loosen it, you either need a long (over 4' piece of bar you bolt to 2 of the
threaded holes in the flywheel to act as a counter force lever, or have 6
guys sitting on it as you torque it.  I've done it with a 3/4" sliding
handle breaker bar that had a 1 1/2" pipe about 5 ft long on it; a couple of
guys on this should do it!  150 lbs applied 4 ft out should be 600 lbs of
torque!  It helps to add shock and force against the part of the sliding
handle holding the socket as torque is applied- ie, have someone with a
sledge hammer strike behind the socket just as force ooomph is applied. Six
sided sockets are best----- Original Message -----
