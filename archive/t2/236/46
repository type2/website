Sound like a good deal to me if you wish to switch it back to VW, but
Corvairs are junk.  It's a real mystery a lot of the time when it breaks as
to how something could be that bad.  My Transvair Corvair engine+trans
conversion broke down 6 times in the 2 months after I bought it despite tons
of new parts and money being spent, and an engine rebuilt by a well-known
vair shop. Both engine and transmission were expensive to fix.  I paid over
$4,000 for my Transvair bus then spent $1,500 more buying parts and
replacing the clutch and transmisson at which point it had a valve seat come
loose and I gave up and put a VW back in.  This guy's bus sounds like a
great deal to me if it's in that good of shape.  In case anybody is
interested in this bus this guy is selling, I should note that on my bus I
found switching out the Corvair engine and trans for a decent VW unit to be
very simple.  It just unbolts right out of there, no problem.  GW
