STAY AWAY FROM 'DA FLAPS HOSE.

They may be selling you heater core hose and not real oil rated hose.

Go to the phone book and look in the yellow pages for industrial hose 
suppliers or industrial supplies.

Anyone you talk to - tell them you need a hose rated for hot oil. Don't 
mention that it's going on a VW.
