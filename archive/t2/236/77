Folks might also like to know that there is an article about Kemperinks in
the latest issue (7) of VW Camper & Commercial magazine.  It's specifically
about the one Just Kampers have just restored, but there is some history as
well.  Simon Holloway of the UK Type 2 Owners Club, who organises Vanfest,
also has one and has just written an article about them for the club
magazine.  His Kemperink is featured in the book "VW Bus Custom Handbook".
