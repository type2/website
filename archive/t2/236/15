Subject: LPG and Power

LPG is very popular in Holland, mostly because of cost

but you lose a big percentage of horsepower , especially if you set it up for 
gasoline and LPG

My friend in Holland has a Chevy V-8 van  and its a dog on LPG

plus it uses more LPG per mile/KM than gasoline

If you were only going to run only  on LPG you could build an engine for 
that, more compression and change the timing 

Holland is the place to look for info, as they have been doing it for more 
than 20 years on about 1/3 of the cars in the country

one more thing is where do you fill it up, in Holland its everywhere except 
in the middle of the city (safety)  but in Germany its a real problem with 
many of the fill-up stations being only open business hours -weekdays (they 
sell to big companies mostly)

it works , but not sure why you would want to go to the trouble here in the 
USA , 
as LPG - Propane is based on oil prices anyway
