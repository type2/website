Subject: Re: [T2] Quick Question(milage on a 78)

Depends on speed and maybe age/condition ND WEIGHT (CAMPER OR OPEN BUS)- my
high milage (237,000 mi wESTY'S engine appears to run rich (based on
exhaust, plugs dark grey) but gets about 18 run at 65 mph (which I rarely do
in hot weather) or 24 when run at a strict 55 mph!  Most of its life when I
was happily ripping around at 65 highway, it got about 18, but I have
records of when it was young (65K mi) it got about 20-22.
----- Original Message ----- If you own like a 1978 Bus (like I do) and it
is stock, what kind of gas mileage could I expect? I mean, an average to
look for...Not exact...
