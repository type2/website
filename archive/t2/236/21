TJ, please turn word wrap on in whatever mail program you are using.
For lots of people on the list it just comes out as 1 line that is about 
1,000 chars long!

At the time, I hadn't pulled a t4 engine in almost 18 years, so I went 
slow and tagged and bagged everything.  Engine pull was about
3 hours but I was in no hurry.  Pulled trans later.

Total to get the engine and tank out was about 4 hours.  Look at the
web site again and notice the red arrows in picture #1....would have been
a lot faster with list help had I know about these.

Take tank to radiator shop the next day.  Picked it up the next weekend.
Clean it out some more and then repaint outside with por-15.  I did *not*
use tank sealer on the inside as I could not get it clean enough for that
and could not figure out how to get the sealer on *all* of the inside 
correctly.  Hardly any rust inside the tank at all, mostly just rock hard
varnish!

Cheers, dave
