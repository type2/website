timing and compression are usually adjusted for lpg.  from a local rep 
it is usually 3 deg advance.  compression increase on aircooled is 
advised and this is usually done at the head.  price wise lpg may be 
partially linked to oil but it is primarily still a marketed waste 
product.  it is still exempt from almost all federal and state 
transportation taxes.
