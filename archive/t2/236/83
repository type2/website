Subject: cool,alt. tin?

cylinders)from a type 3.i also would like to have oem alt. tin, i am not too 
pleased with the tin that came with my alt. kit.where can i find these 
parts? i asked joe at bustedbus.i have discovered that the bug eng. in my 71 
is missing some more tin that is supposed to go from the doghouse cooler to 
my new firewall piece.
