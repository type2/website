Most shops have it. Check CB Performance, Busted Bus, Bus Depot, Gene Berg, 
Bus Boys, etc.

The OEM part apparently comes in a spot welded version which broke on my 
Beetle and on a '70 Westy a friend owned. A replacement I found was solid 
welded and never has given me fits. I think you could solid weld an OEM 
type and fix what I see as a manufacturing defect.

You may or may not need to consider replacing the bushings too.
