Talk you out of it?

Naw--talk you into pressure washing it--

Kerosine, Diesel fuel, mineral spirits are all OK--

But please elaborate on how you plan on wiping the whole engine clean,
regardless of what you apply--

What you are saying here, from what I gather from your message is you
are just surface wiping the engine--you have no intentions of cleaning
it---

Simple Green works good--but hosing or pressure washing after is
necessary for a total cleaning.

Zep, Gunk, as well as many other mfg's offer excellent cleaning
agents---but the H2O ( or Steam ) is a required necessity for a good
job---no way around it.

Later,

Terry

Who wants to talk me out of using either Mineral Spirits or Kerosene on
my very dirty engine. 
I want to brush it off, then wipe dry. I looked at engine degreasers at
FLAPS but they want me to hose it off. Don't wanna do it. 
Thoughts please.
