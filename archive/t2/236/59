Subject: symptoms of fuel pressure being too high

hey listees, I've about pulled my remaining hair out trying to figure out 
why my truck gets such poor mileage. (about 10-15)  It's a 1/7L type IV 
with dual weber 34 ICT's.  I've tried 3 different jet sizes and have 
finally settled on one that makes it run better than the other 2 but it 
still gets lousy mileage.  It came with 55's, I tried 45's (that made it 
buck like mad upon acceleration).  I finally put 50's in it and it runs 
great, but still poor mileage...  it has an electric fuel pump on it 
although I don't know the brand or any of the particulars.  Should I try 
putting a fuel pressure regulator on it to see if that helps?  tia,  greg
