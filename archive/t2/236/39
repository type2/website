I ain't no guru but I'd suggest a set of Type III cool tins. I've got a set 
someplace that I got years ago from a catalog and never used them. They 
force the airflow to cool the bottom of the cylinder better.

I got "wise" and gave up on hot rod Type I motors and built a Type IV motor 
for my Beetle.

YMMV - I like them all....
