(more of the "what are you smoking" department. Answer: my heads)

Rob,

I have just started running an 1835cc and discovered sure enough, what they
say is true--non-stock Type 1 configurations DO run HOT!  Man do I enjoy the
extra power over my old stock single port (in a '70 Westy), but I expect
that it won't last forever. . .

Got the pistons and cylinders (92mm) on a trade, so I decided to use them
despite their reputation for overheating.  Rebuilt dual-port heads with
stock valves, Solex progressive carb, Engle 110 cam, dual quiet pack
exhaust, doghouse cooler, stock crank, full flow oil filter.

I set the CR at 7.6:1 which I thought wasn't too outrageous, but the head
temps are running 350-450 consistently, toward the higher end at fast cruise
(60 mph), this is at ~92 degrees F ambient in Georgia.  Oil temp reads 210
but seems hotter than that--I haven't yet calibrated the sender (may be low
due to JBweld thru sump plate).  Advance of 009 at 8 deg static.  Tin sealed
pretty well.

Questions for the gurus--I want to make the best of this--would it run
cooler with:

	a)  lower compression ratio (maybe 7.2:1 ?)
	b)  better airflow from dual carbs or larger valves
	c)  vacuum advance distributor (less advance at part throttle?)
	d)  all of the above
	e)  none of the above
	f)  see you on the side of the road, pal

I have a theory that the Type 1 cylinder head doesn't have enough cooling
fins to dissipate the heat of the larger displacement.  I am planning for a
new top end in about 20,000 miles with new heads and 90.5 mm thick-wall
cylinders.  Things I would like to check at a shop:  exhaust mixture, and
total advance.
