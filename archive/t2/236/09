Hi Michael,

I have looked on the "Volkswagens in Film and Video" site and saw the pic of
the airport bay bus. http://vwfilms.net/daf.htm
But is a bit too blurry to tell if the tail lights are horizontal.
It might have been a special conversion for the airport at that time.

As a Dutchman i can tell you it must have been a custom job. I have never
seen horizontal tail lights on baywindow buses on the road.

2 splits...but I saw something wierd.  The part of the movie where I saw 2
of the bays was set in Amsterdam and the tail lights were horizontal.  I had
never seen this before so i had to rewind it a couple times...we this done
in certain areas? or was this just something that could have been issued
only for utitlity vehicles as these were being used on a runway as transport
cars...
