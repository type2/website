<<Well there is the Clara way......

She take a sock and drops in a strong magnet. I would recommend taking ap=
art a broken speaker, or better yet a old hard drive for the magnet. Put =
the magnet in the sock, and take a wire hanger and tie off the sock. Drop=
 this in the gas tank, and let the end hang out of the filler tube. WHY? =
You all are asking WHY? The magnet will pull the steel bits to it. You ta=
ke the sock out once a week and clean off the steel bits.

Really, does this work? I'm not sure I would try it; seems that you could=
 lose the sock in the tank and then you are out one sock...Not to mention=
 the pain of getting the sock back. Of course, this might answer the age =
old question...Just where do those socks go when they end up missing from=
 the laundry? In a VW tank!
