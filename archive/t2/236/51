Depends on what type of fuel system - carb or fuel injection.

My stock (except the muffler) 2.0 got as high as 23 on flat ground at 55 
mph and as low as 17 at highway speeds in the hills. I'm sure that short 
portions of any trip would have revealed higher or lower numbers but my mpg 
is based on the whole tank of gas.

I here gas mileage with a Weber progressive CAN be significantly worse - 
but I suspect most of those occasions are b/c the carb is not properly jetted.

I would recommend either installing and O2 sensor so you can set your 
mixture yourself or getting it adjusted by a shop - no matter what type of 
fuel system you've got.

Recently I started and warmed up my sleeping VW which has been off the road 
for a few years now for a renovation and it ran quite rich. More so than I 
remembered. When it goes back on the road I'll be installing an O2 sensor 
so I can set the mixture with my DMM.

Originally this van had significantly worse mpg but that was when i first 
bought before I sealed up the exhaust system properly, replaced all of the 
vacuum lines, replaced the injector seals, and blocked off the EGR which 
was malfunctioning.
