Subject: lpg conversions

Received this from the owner of the bus featured in the camper and=20
commercial issue in response to questions.

Hi Jim
My tank is 94L "wet", that holds 76L of LPG at the 80% fill cutoff.
Dimensions are 1600mm x 285mm, fits from side to side under the rear=20
seat of
my Caravelle..
Cost id =A3235 inc VAT and delivery to a UK mainland address, delivery =
time
approx 5 weeks from receipt of order and =A3100...

As for power, as per my article, I have noticed only a slight drop in
performance at the low rpm range, it isnt much, only just noticeable too=20=

me
(very sensitive seat of the pants!!)
There are a few tweaks, but the important one is to advance the timing a
slight amount (around 5 degrees!!)
But if you fit a smaller tank then you have to be careful, as you may be
running on petrol more often.. I still have not put any more petrol=20
in... so
that makes it =A350 worth of petrol in 1 year!!!! even though I have =
done
quite a few miles!!!
My 1.9 wbx (78BHP) will easily cruise at 70-80 mph (thats what I usually
do!!) and I get around 23mpg at that!!
I am just in the middle of fitting a "new" (rebuilt by Laurie Pettit) =
2.1
High compression engine... this will be running with lambda control on=20=

the
LPG, so I should see better driveability and maybe MPG too, If I can=20
resist
the extra power that will be available (about 25% more torque over my
1.9!!!)
Any further questions, just ask..
Si
