I was watching this James Bond flick last night....and noticed 3 bays and 2 splits...but I saw something wierd.  The part of the movie where I saw 2 of the bays was set in Amsterdam and the tail lights were horizontal.  I had never seen this before so i had to rewind it a couple times...we this done in certain areas? or was this just something that could have been issued only for utitlity vehicles as these were being used on a runway as transport cars...

thanks
