Just a word to the wise---

Be prepared to have Carb--injector problems with any-- (not just the POR
products) when these miracles in a can breaks loose inside your tanks---
which it will eventually.

It is almost impossible to prep the inside of the tank perfectly to
assure proper, and permanent adhesion of any sealer.
It's just a fact of life.
 
The only thing that I have ever done to eliminate the rust inside a
rusty tank, and keep it that way, was to split the tank and sand blast
it clean---then weld it back together--no more problems --EVER--

Do the job right once, and be done with it--

Later,
