Subject: trip report - friendly neighborhood

buddy jason came over yesterday morning. proven spider in a fuel injected
engine. one vacuum hose short of a dozen. unbelievable - one hose and it
wouldn't run at all because without it the afm wasn't getting its love.
that's the way it is with fuel injection. that's the way it is. i could
make a better gasket for the egr filter, but i drove around the corner a
few times, dropped off some tin for a mellow fellow friendly neighborhood
neighbor. time for a campout! i moved a few railroad ties on my next door
neighbor's lawn, nice lawn about two feet higher than our property ~ so we
had ...elevation. nice dinner from our garden, took the children in the
doublecab to see a few innings at the minor league team field from the
pickup bed over the right field fence. kids and i returned and hit it. wife
read to the children;  i read my unbound edition of "spit in the ocean"
vol. 7; and kerplunk. now, i need to pick up a fuel injector because i am
running on 3.5 cylinders. then, there'll be trip reports. meantime,
splitting wood near the umm - campsite.  - steve, perhaps still camping
