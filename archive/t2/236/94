Subject: Window Felt Install?

The body shop that painted my bus took the felt strip out of the passenger 
door. It broke while out. I'm finally getting around to putting it back. I 
ordered the felt from WCM. Looks like good stuff (but what do I know??). 
What I didn't know was that I need several clips to hold the thing in.

The clips are not there. I called the body shop, they deny taking them out 
and have no idea where they might be.

Does anyone know where to find these clips?

Is this a big job?
