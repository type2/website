Er, I forgot to mention it's been doing this since eastern Oklahoma. Road 
surface was my first and best hope, but that got ruled out pretty quickly.
  I checked the tire pressure the next morning in Oklahoma City, and it was 
fine.

Steve sez I could futz around with the tire pressure to see if the noise changes.
  If not, that rules out tires, and it's probably bearings.
