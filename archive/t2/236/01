Very popular in Europe. I was toying with this idea myself. 
Here is an edited repost from the Vanagon list:

Gary Lee has a 50L tank (I am not sure it that is total size 
or usable size at 80%) that he says extends the range of his 
van by 300km.

FES Autogas http://www.fesgroup.co.uk/autogas2.htm
has "Dough-nut tanks" that occupy the space normally reserved 
for the spare tire. They are between 35 and 70 litres in 
capacity (28 to 56 usable). Typical range for their 57L (45 
usable) (-at-) 5.5mpl (25mpg) is about 250 miles.

In addition Reimo sells tanks from 21L to 60L (16.8L to 48L 
usable) that would fit in place of the stock tank... or 
under the sliding door. Though the larger tanks give up some 
ground clearance.

With unlimited funds, I'd get a 70L tank in place of the 
spare, and probably two 38L tanks for a total capacity of 
146L (116.8 usable) that plus my stock 16 Gallon gas tank 
would carry me farther than I would EVER be able to drive 
without having to pull over for nature's call.

Thanks,
Chris
