Subject: another lp conversion site

this site has info on a conversion done several years back to a rambler
 From what i have seen it is very much the same for almost any vehicle 
with only slight changes in tanks and fittings.

Love his "gas can" for lp.  It confirmed what i was thinking was doable.
