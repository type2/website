Subject: Re: [T2] Hose for external oil cooler - keeps spliting

that's cheap (-at-)$$ neoprene hose. We have some really good stuff, you don't
even need hose clamps if you use our fittings (fittings are about $2ea, hose
is $2.50/foot). Of course, you could throw down for some Stainless hose, but
that may be overkill.

We have swivel fittings with -8 ends too, so you can convert to SS hose in
the future, it also makes removal and re-installation a snap with a wrench,
instead of fighting those #&*$)#*& hose clamps!
