Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 on clean metal &gas tank innards?

why not just seal the tank and be done with it? the POR fuel tank sealer is
outstanding.

If I could only tell you how much time I wasted changing filters and
"flushing" fuel tanks, only to lear the best thing to do is just yank it,
seal it, and then enjoy the rest of your life. If you don't, it WILL come
back and haunt you, it's just a matter of where and when you are going to be
(wearing a suit is a common trigger, as is driving at 3am in the middle of
nowhere).
