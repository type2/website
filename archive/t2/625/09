Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

Wise but so hard! How do you say no to someone who says, "will you please 
take my VW off my hands?"

Then my wife says they call me, saying "John, John, you want me...."

And I say, isn't one of our missions the rescue and preservation of 
distressed VW's?

Seriously though, we are way overextended right now. Before joining the 
Type2 list, we were thinking we are getting out of Type 4, but now I am 
thinking they are do-able. So, we will sort through the current fleet and 
settle on what we like best. One thing I think I have learned from this is 
only one project at a time!
