Subject: Re: [T2] Battery won't charge 

The PO put in a new battery two days before I came to pick up the bus.
He said it was having a hard time starting. It ran for a couple weeks
with no problem and then the other day it was dead. I'm going to pull
the battery in the next day or so and put it on a charger and see what
happens. If that doesn't work then Ill proceed by looking at the
brushes and then finally a new gen/alter.


Thanks,

Blake
