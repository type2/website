I have this unit also, with piezo ignition.  From ebay also...

It SO rocks.  I use a 5 gal square bucket that kitty litter came in -
the shower and a few bottles of propane fit into it for
storage/transport, and at camp it holds the water supply.  Set yourself
up somewhere relatively draft-free, and get clean!
