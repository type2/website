Subject: RE: [T2] What would you do?

Mark,

Do you live near any small airports? I've found that machinists that rebuild
small airplane engines (lots of air cooled boxer engines... I'm surprised
people aren't putting used lycoming engines in their busses) are hands down
the best out there. The extra money you'll pay in shipping parts all over
the place to the "preferred VW builders" will go a long way towards paying
these _certified_ machinists to work their craft. There is no "black magic,"
no "secret valve guide installation method" involved. They build engines
that will last the specified number of hours without fail, period. Take your
parts in for balancing and line boring; they have the proper tooling. That's
what I've done, and I'd do it again. Assemble it yourself. Remember, the
last 10% toward a perfect engine will cost you another 100%. Is it worth it?
Keep another block, rebuild it at your leisure, and drop it in when you need
it. It's certainly an easy swap.

I had a pair of Stevens Machining heads on my '72 (type IV) that were great
until I overreved and lost a valve spring keeper. Robbed one off my standby
rebuilt engine and put it on, all was well for another 66000 miles, and
that's when I sold it. Could still be running for all I know. That standby
rebuilt engine came in handy.
