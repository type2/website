Subject: 1976 Bay parts 

I am about to slice and dice a 1976 Bay window bus. It looks beautiful from
the rockers up, but it has died of terminal rust.

I am going to hack away with a Sawzall and cutting torch until the pieces I
don't want are small enough to throw into my pickup and haul off to the
metal recycler.

I am going to keep just about everything that will fit my 1978 Westy, but I
don't want or need all those parts so if anybody needs something let me know
right away. I would feel badly if I sliced up some part that someone could
use. I am going to take it apart really fast so some parts will be ruined
that otherwise could be saved if taken apart with saving in mind.

The bus will be dissected in Columbia, MO. I can save some parts for other
people for only a short while. I don't have enough storage space to save
everything I want to save.

Gary
