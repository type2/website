Subject: alternator mounting bracket

Hi, folks-

I'm gonna need a new alternator mounting bracket (Part #39 on 
http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/Microfiche/t209300.gif)... and for that 
matter a new bolt (#13).  Any hints on a source for these parts?  My 
neighborhood junkyard rarely has any Type IV engines.

Thanks,
