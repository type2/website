Subject: Amplification on "what would you do?"

I'm getting some useful feedback about my engine building situation, 
but I thought I should throw in an amplification. This would not be my 
first engine rebuild. It will be my second bottom-end build, and my 
third top-end. I've made most of the beginners' mistakes before (like a 
distributor gear install 180 degrees wrong).

I destroyed my first rebuild by having a vacuum leak in the FI system; 
new cylinders, pistons, and heads plus an almost manic attention to 
vacuum leaks made for a pretty good engine the second time -- until the 
camshaft parted. I did spend an awful lot of time toward the end trying 
to figure out why it was so loud.

So, I know that I can do it, having done it.

I also know that I can screw it up.

I have confidence that I can build an engine and get it running 
smoothly. But without measuring the case, having it align bored if 
needed, and having the rotating mass balanced, I know that it will 
probably be a 40,000 mile engine. Maybe as much as 60,000. Maybe as 
little as 20,000.

But at least I'll be able to drive it out of the garage.
