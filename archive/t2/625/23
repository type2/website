Subject: [T2] Hitch Question (Was: Driveway blues)

I have been reading about the hitches people are making and I am wondering doesn't Jamie Rivers make a type 2 hitch? I seem to recall seeing some really nice receiver hitches he was making that fit busses and vanagon... Don't recall his wesite but I'm sure its in the archives. Is he still in business?
