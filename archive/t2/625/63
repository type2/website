If the ignition system is in question and one wishes to test the 
veracity of the coil can one test for spark by pulling the center 
wire off and "ground "it while the starter motor turns? I have done 
it with a plug wire to see if it arcs but not the  center wire off 
the coil. before. With only a test lamp, is there any other way to 
test the goodness of a coil?

Thanks
Chris
