Subject: Final question: align bore?

Mark,
In my opinion, No I would not use an align bored case. I've built a dozen
engines and used an align bored case one time, on a 1200cc 40hp motor, and
(just like gene Berg said it would) it suffered from chronic low oil pressure.
Type 4 cases are alledgedly stronger than type 1 cases, and less prone to the
bearing bores being pounded out of round.
  But you know what they say about opinions. Everybody's got one.

Once more, the question is whether to have the aluminum case from a
2.0L align bored. I would like to get maybe 30,000-50,000 miles out of
this engine. After that, I am going to pull out all the stops and have
B. Bob build me an engine.

If I could drive the case across town, I'd just do it. But I have to
ship it across the country and then have it shipped back.

So what's the consensus? Bore, or no bore?

It would help if you could post to the list (although I'll accept
p-mails gratefully) so that there's a little bit of debate -- and so
that the thread ends up in the archives.
