yup I hand them my lug wrench and insist they put the lug nuts on with
that, I tell em, if they put them on with it I can get em off with it.

the place I have used recently insists that EVERY tire on every vehicle be
put on with a toque wrench, they wouldn't tighten my tires down until they
checked the spec in my (just so happens to be with me) Bentley
