Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchangers.

Jack asked:


 Does anyone have a source for heat exchangers on a 75 bus? I've got more
hole than exchanger and was hoping to not quite freeze through the
coming winter. I ran a quick search at samba, but didn't get any hits.
Am I correct in thinking I'm limited to a 74 or 75 exchanger for a
replacement?

75 is 75 to 78.
74 is 72 to 74.

Unless someone put the early heater boxes on your 75, you want 75 to 78 style 
boxes. They have separate manifolds and U pipes.  R and Q in this pic:
