Again Richard, thanks   Last night I was going to take the '76 out for a 
spin.  I want to take it out once a week, usually to church.

The '76 was having some oil dropping problem, but the last 3-4 times I ran 
it [from place to place] and checked underneath, there was like no oil on 
the ground or the cardboard [when I used that]  Last night the oil came out 
really, really the worst I've seen.

I left the '76 idling in the driveway with a large cardboard under. Just in 
case, you know. There was much oil.  I looked under and I could see the oil 
dropping from the oil filter bottom.  The oil left a streak from the FIF 
front-center part of the oil filter to close to the center of the oil filter 
then left a big drop at about one drop per five seconds.  Considering that I 
was warming the '76 up for about 3-5 minutes, you can imagine.  This was the 
largest deposit of oil I got over the past 3 months.

Strange, but the oil just did not drop down in a solid drop.  There was some 
air blowing across  from the FIF front to back, and there was a feathering 
of the oil drop so that tiny dropplets were blowing towards the back of the 
bus.

Some people say it is my oil cooler seals, but your picture does not confirm 
that.  the oil cooler seal area seems to be just a bit inboard of where I 
would expect the oil to hit the oil filter top.

But, my previous oil droppings came not from the oil filte ritself [the oil 
filter was always greasy] but from the mustache bar, just left of center.  
that was where the  observations were made that gave the oil cooler seals as 
the problem.  I think that is a good observation.

Thanks.  Your picture is very helpful/.

I have a bunch of beetle oil filters,; they are skinnyer, and should fit the 
'76.  This will let be get a closer look up behind the oil filter.

I have some UV dyed oil in my '72, and this stuff does not really work that 
well.  The oil does not shine like a hippie painting.  It just makes the oil 
visible when you shine a black light on it.  The UV dyed oil look to be a 
honey mustard color vice clear oil, even without the black light.  I don't 
think it will help, since my oil at the oil filter is a murky color [less 
tahn 500 miles since oil flush and change]
