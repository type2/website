Subject: Stolen 77 Bay Window-Seattle

     We're grieving here in Seattle. Our beloved 77 Bay window - was 
stolen (in the middle of the morning??!!) Tuesday.

Please keep a lookout for it and if spotted, report to nearest 911.

It used to be a Station wagon but no middle seat anymore - and replaced 
rear with a Westy bed.
Color  - a bright, royal blue (actually a Subaru color).
Sunroof
Newly upholstered seats and bed.
Spare on front-black cover.
Bumpers are black.
Exhaust - a Monza look-a-like
Louvered side and door windows.
Very, very clean
Drives like a gem.

VIN 02272001339
Oregon License number: SLA989
(cant find the motor number, but if I do, will post)

Thanks folks.......
