Subject: Re: [T2] Battery won't hold a charge

Batteries don't take kindly to being completely drained. Not the
lead-acid vareity anyway. Ni-Cd's do though. heh

Take it to an AutoZone or whoever and have them charge it up and see
if it holds a charge. They perform this check for free, and it will
tell you if your battery is fried or your Alternator/regulator.
