> I have been reading about the hitches people are making and I am wondering
doesn't Jamie Rivers make a type 2 hitch? I seem to recall seeing some really
nice receiver hitches he was making that fit busses and vanagon... Don't recall
his wesite but I'm sure its in the archives. Is he still in business?
