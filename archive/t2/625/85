Andy,

Good post! Let's review. With switched 12v coming from the front of 
the bus there is always + to the coil with the ignition on. In a 
perfect world with points (don't say it) the ground is redirected to 
the plugs when the points open and the rotor is in the right spot on 
the cap. Pulling the center wire off the dizzy with the motor 
turning, by starter or by hand,and ignition on will yield a spark 
when the points are open.

Pulling the center wire out of the dizzy and grounding it should 
yield a spark if the points are opened manually of by action of the 
motor turning the dizzy. Yellow spark=dying coil, no spark=deal coil.

Tell me if I am wrong here. Putting a test lamp on the neg. side of 
the coil should bring the light on every time the points open which 
should confirm that the coil is not completely dead. It has been a 
little while since I have set the timing on an AC/VW motor but as I 
recall this is how I used to static time the motor. Or I have gotten 
old and forgotten :)

Thanks
Chris
