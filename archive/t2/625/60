Subject: Battery won't hold a charge

Hi all,

The other day I went to start my '70 bus and noticed I had left the 
lights on and drained the battery. I got the bus started by jumping it. 
I drove it around for 20 minutes went to the gas station to top off the 
tank and when I went to restart it it was dead. I again jumped the 
battery to get it started and drove it back home. As soon as I turned 
it off, I tried to start it again to see if I built up a charge and it 
was completely dead. So I pulled out Muir's Guide and I think its the 
generator, but since this is my first foray into fixing my bus I wanted 
to throw it out to the list and see what else it could be. If it is the 
generator, I was looking for prices at MidAmerica Motor Works and 
Wolfsburgwest and noticed a conversion to alternator kit. Is there much 
of a benefit to doing something like that?


And of course is there something I could hook up to my lights to beep 
when I turn off the car and they are still on?

Thanks,

Blake
