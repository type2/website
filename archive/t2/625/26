Chris,

Negatory! as my buddy Bob(A&P mechanic who does hot rod VW's) says, 
airplane engines are made to put out a certain torque at a fairly 
low speed(like 2500 rpm).  HP not too important, except the torque is!

I have an VW engine sitting in my shop right now that was built for
and airplane.  never installed and never started...I would love to just 
put it in a car and go...except!  It is 82x88 and would be great, except 
for one little thing...the cam won't run the engine at much over 4,000rpm.
All torque is developed at about 2500rpm and hardly anthing power-wise 
is developed after that point.



Cheers, dave
