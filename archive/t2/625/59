Subject: Vacuum Leak Tests

A few weeks ago, someone suggested shooting carb-cleaner spray in the vicinity 
of a suspected vacuum leak.  IIRC, the idea was that the cleaner would produce 
a noticeable change in the idling speed of the engine.  Have I got that right?

Also, any other practical suggestions?  I know the one about using a length of 
tube as a "stethoscope" kind of probe, but haven't had much luck with that.

Any thoughts appreciated.... thanx
Glenn
