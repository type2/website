I was once told that it takes about 15 minutes of driving to recharge the
battery for one minute of cranking, so if your battery was totally dead it
would need a lot more than 20 minutes of driving to put any kind of charge
into it....put it on an automatic charger, or drive at highway speeds for
a few hours and then try it....

BTW, not sure when it started but on my 78 the headlights will not light
unless the ignition switch is turned, only the marker lights.
