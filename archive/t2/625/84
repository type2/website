Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

Oh, yeah, and one more thing. There's a phrase that some retail and 
service people use that you should listen for. If you ask for a tire 
size or for a part for your bus, and the guy says he doesn't have it 
but can order it, but it's "not too popular," turn on your heals and 
leave the premises at once. Run for your life. I don't know how this 
phrase crept into business usage, but I sure hear it a lot (being a bus 
owner and having related tastes) out there in the retail world. I don't 
give a &$*#^ what's popular. To me, popular equals stupid and mindless. 
SUVs are popular. On the other hand, I too was not too popular in 
junior high. So when somebody uses that phrase, they insult me, my 
tastes, my bus, and --by the way -- the Platonic ideals.
