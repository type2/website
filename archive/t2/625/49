Subject: [T2] bad fuel filter reactions 

bucking really bad now so couldnt of been the fuel filter... bucks real bad in third and fourth..... also trying to cut off at the red lights after idleing down...? it sounds normal and then just acts to want to die....?
rev a little to stayed crunk..
when idleing... it sounds as if it misses a heart beat in its rythym a skip if that makes sense..? sounds like after a few repetitions..?
leaking oil pretty bad and maybe using it? 
peace
