Subject: A Corollary Question Re: New Head

Regarding my previous question on my engine problem, the next diagnostic 
step I will be taking will be to relax the valve adjustments to see if my 
"clunk" goes away in order to test the theories of whether my problem is a 
piston impacting an open valve, or a rod knock or something else.

In this regard, I noticed another list member loosening his valve adjustment 
to 0.030 in an attempt to pass smog. I was wondering how loose I can go and 
safely run the motor over the long term. I was thinking about some previous 
information posted to the list on how valve float beats up the valve train 
when weak springs do not enable the valve stem to follow the cam. Though 
I've heard loose valves are a lesser problem than tight valves, I was 
thinking that loosening the valve adjustment too much would create a similar 
problem.

Thanks,

John
