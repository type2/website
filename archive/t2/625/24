Now that it's Friday, I can post the list I'm been accumulating over
the week 8-D

Sign's you've setup permanent residence in Buslooptopia:

* Who needs a luggage rack when you can have a mulit-purpose solar
skylight, water heater, charger, and, for lack of a better term:
Breadloaf and Turkey Baker!

* "You know...if we seperate the dune buggy in half right behind the
driver's compartment, we can make mounts for front section on front of
the cab, and a tow-bar for the engine half..."

*  Collect color changing paint scheme remnants soley to achieve the
ultimate tie-dye bus.

* Inspired by London's double-deckers, plan out a *safe* version of
the Type2 varient by first making a double-wide (well, 1 and a half
wide, wouldn't want to have to register as an SUV ;-)), THEN adding
the second layer.

* Justify new parts bus to wife by noting it will make the most
excellent chicken coop.  Follow-up with blissful disregard for you're
gated communities live animal policies.

* Heads-up display augmented with audio readouts (with recording
capabilities, to capture and play-back audience reaction every time
you hit 64MPH....)

* Catching yourself mentally smelling the sea air from your 12th story
cubicle as your dreaming of painting and shaving your vanagon in a
splittie tribute.

* 3rd battery to power the array of HAM and DJ-on-wheels equipment
charged by the a generator attached to the wheels of your trailer

Friday joy to all,
- Dean
