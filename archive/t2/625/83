Subject: Charcoal Canister

I want to install a replacement charcoal canister as mine is currently
disconnected.  Mine is a 76 with the canister on the upper left side of the
firewall.
On the left are two openings, one about 1cm and one about 3mm.  On the right
is one about 1cm.
From the archives I gather the small one goes to the gas tank.  Since I have
no current connection for reference where does this small line connect to the
gas tank?
Also from the archives I gather one of the larger connection goes to the air
intake and one to the fan.  Which one goes where?
Is it large one on same side as small one goes to air intake and large one by
itself goes to fan
or
large one on same side as small one goes to fan and large one by itself goes
to air intake?
Thanks!
Mike
