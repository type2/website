is a draw tite hitch or imitation. Let me know. I have one and it's good for
pulling a bike trailer or real small boat.

My '77 has a sort of bar running just under the edge of the lip of the body
below the engine hatch.  It's not attached to that body lip, just attached
at the ends somehow.  Let me look at the fiches for a minute...

No, can't find it there.  Went out and looked under the bus.  It's not the
engine carrier bar.  That's further forward.  It's a u-channel shaped bar
that runs between the rear bumper mounts.  It's welded to the left and right
bumper mount brackets with the "u" of the channel facing to the rear of the
bus.

I guess it's stock.  The hitch doesn't look very sturdy.  It's only welded
to the bumper and to this bar.  The bar has already been bent out towards
the hitch.  I'm beginning to think it's a PO job and shouldn't be trusted to
tow more than a very, very small trailer, probably unloaded at that. :O)
