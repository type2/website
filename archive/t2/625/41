The braided hose is what the local repair shops seem to use.

The fiche says to use N 020 281 1 (7x3mm) hose but two hose sizes seem to be
offered interchangeably:

- a braided hi pressure hose (N 020 357 1). The Continental version of this
hose that I've seen is actually 7x2.5mm in measurement. I've used it for the
fuel breather lines behind the firewall. It's a very very tight fit on the
fuel rail and I don't recommend using it there.

- the smooth covered high pressure hose (N 020 281 1) from Continental is
7x3mm just like the fiche. I've fit this one to the various barbs on the
fuel rail and it fits perfect (could be tighter on the cold start valve but
the barbs are smaller and that's what hose clamps are for).

You might also try "fray stop" from the fabric store. It dries and stays
flexible.
