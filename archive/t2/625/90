Hi Gary,
          I've got a 69 Bay with serious rust at the bottom of the windshield.  
If your donor vehicle has solid metal in that area, please let me know.

In addition to the Sawzall, don't overlook the circular saw with an abrasive 
disk.  The disks are sold at hardware stores for around $4-6 and really move 
through sheet metal.  Note there are varieties for metal [right] and for 
masonry [not what you want].

I had to chop up a greenhouse splitty years ago... still regret having to do 
that.  Terminal rust.

Glenn

I am about to slice and dice a 1976 Bay window bus. It looks beautiful from
the rockers up.....
