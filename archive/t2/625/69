Chris,

Your best bet is to pull the center wire off the distributor and hold it
about .25" from ground. You can turn the motor over with the starter, or
pull the cap off the dizzy and crank the engine 'till points are closed,
then, with the ignition on and armed with a small screwdriver, hold the wire
from the coil .25" from ground, and open and close the points manually (This
also gives you a good visual of the condition and action of the points).
Better yet, if you have a remote starter switch, hook it up between the
points side of the coil and ground. Releasing it and pressing it will
simulate points opening and closing. Either way, look for a fat blue spark.
Yellow indicates a weak coil. If no spark, make sure you have 12v to the
coil.

Armed with only a test light, you can check the primary side of the coil.
First use the test light to see if you have voltage to the positive side of
the coil by connecting between the + side of the coil and ground. With the
ignition switch on the lamp should light. Disconnect the wires from the -
side of the coil and check for voltage between the - side and ground. The
lamp should light, but it may be dimmer.
