Subject: Final question: align bore?

Hi Mark,
          I was working last week with a friend who is an independent mechanic 
for specializing in fine vintage German cars.  As a special favor to one of his 
customers, he is working on the bottom end of a vintage Pontiac.  The fit of 
the bearings is of particular importance -- so he is using the plastic gauge 
product to be certain the oil clearances are correct.  In case you are not 
familiar with this, it looks like fine spaghetti; you put an inch or so along 
the bearing face, parallel to the axis of the crankshaft; then you see how how 
it squishes down.  The manufacturer gives you a handy little ruler kind of 
thing.  I don't know if this product is applicable for non-split bearings, but 
you could certainly check the split bearings this way.  Years ago I remember 
seeing the techs using fine (soft) solder, which got mashed down to a couple of 
mils, when they measured it with a micrometer.  In all cases (it goes without 
saying) the bearing house must be torqued to spec.  If you take the 
measurements carefully, then you know firsthand.  Just bolting-up an engine 
does not sound like good practice to me; YMMV.  All the best... Glenn

Anyway, I got a split decision on the align bore, AKA line bore. Some 
responses said I should do it, some said not to (given the assumptions 
under which I'm building), and one said don't do it because I may not 
be able to find bearings.

As for the oversized bearings, Boston Bob has assured me that whatever 
I need, he has; all I have to do is specify the grind of my crank.

So I'm down to I'd better do it, and it's okay if I don't do it.

Once more, the question is whether to have the aluminum case from a 
2.0L align bored. I would like to get maybe 30,000-50,000 miles out of 
this engine. After that, I am going to pull out all the stops and have 
B. Bob build me an engine.

If I could drive the case across town, I'd just do it. But I have to 
ship it across the country and then have it shipped back.

So what's the consensus? Bore, or no bore?

It would help if you could post to the list (although I'll accept 
p-mails gratefully) so that there's a little bit of debate -- and so 
that the thread ends up in the archives.
