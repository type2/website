Last weekend I installed my tired 1600DP into my '67 Freedom Camper.
After that, I adjusted the:
	- valves/timing
	- brakes
	- e-brake cable (thanks Mark Hineline for the Brake post which spurred 
me to do this))
	- clutch

I also verified the front bearing play (new bearings).

I promptly slapped the license plates on it,  got in and drove 240 
miles to pittsburgh!

I made a rookie mistake which resulted in some high head temps on the 
way out.  I had swapped a stock sized pulley onto the engine to replace 
my oversized degree pulley (long story) but didn't read the pulley 
right.  I used the timing mark (7.5 BTDC) when I was adjusting the 
valves and setting the timing.  It was only later that I saw the subtle 
TDC mark on the front lip of the pulley.

Here's the trip report that I posted elsewhere.  Pretty boring, but its 
good to be driving Lily around again.  I still have to figure out why 
she grinds slightly when I put her into first and why the alt-light 
glows occasionally when driving at night (alternator going south? fan 
belt slippage?  Battery reads fully charged when put on a charger...)

Driving style was roughly: stay between 52-57 with the occasional nudge 
to 60 on the downhill.  Stop for 5-10 minutes after every hour or so of 
driving.

happy friday!

  is what the odometer now reads. 600+ miles logged.

Trip highlights:

  -- high head temps (400-450)
  -- ate a new fan belt (installed to replace worn one, probably too 
tight)
  -- passed an air-cooled VW shop 2 miles later and bought a new one (in 
the middle of nowhere, rt. 166 wv/pa border)			
  -- tail-lights occaisionally dodgy
  -- adjusted clutch, re-adjusted valves (see below)
  -- #3 doesn't seem to have much compression

All in all, Lily did pretty well. My spare engine is tired, oh so 
tired, but it pushed me 600+ miles. Coming back from Morgantown on I-68 
& I-70 was especially tough, given the huge hills (6% grade on some of 
them). The engine was running a little hot after that long run on I-68 
and I stopped periodically to let her cool down after the long grades, 
but I still ran her pretty hard.

  I didn't take the bus for a test drive (farther than around the block) 
before leaving Bmore at 11pm Sunday, and I paid for it slightly. Turns 
out the pulley I had thrown on the tired 1600DP had a different TDC 
marking than I'm used to and as a result, I had the timing too far 
advanced and the valves slightly off.

doh!

so she ran high head temps (410-490 F) for the trip to pittsburgh. It 
was pretty chilly that night (high 30s, low 40s) which kept the oil 
temps down. I figured this out before I got to Grandma's on Monday and 
re-adjusted the valves there. Most of the clearances were close, 
although #3 was off quite a bit. This could easily be because that head 
was running so hot.

As an aside, I know that these heads aren't torqued to spec (not loose, 
but take additional turning at 23 ft-lbs) because the head studs are 
pulling out. I expect I might have something of a vacuum leak as a 
result.  I blame this in part for my high head temps.

Notes:
  - engine is very loud in different RPM ranges, something's probably 
loose
  - fan/alternator seems to be rubbing in one place on the revolution
  - no noise from the tranny/rgbs! they're very quiet! yay!
  - alternator light glows slightly at night: alternator going? fan belt 
slippage?
  - still backfiring slightly on decel (H30/31 carb, vacuum advance 
dizzy)
  - seems sluggish (go figure, I think #3 is toast)
  - oil pressure isn't great, and is probably a little worse after the 
hard run yesterday
  -- tried to keep it above 20 psi (-at-) speed on the trip out, but on the 
trip back was more lax
  -- lucky to keep 20 psi pressure (-at-) speed after 45-60 minutes of driving
  -- ~3600 rpm (-at-) 55, ~4000 rpm (-at-)60
etc.


I'm fairly happy with the trip and I'll be driving Lily to work on the 
days I work at the Columbia office. This has, however, reinforced my 
resolve to get to work on my new engine.
