We regularly use ovens to preheat molds, heat cure resin castings, etc..

We're also careful to not use the same oven for cooking after using it for
casting.  Residual vapors in the oven can taint food cooked in the oven.  I
don't know if powder coating is a similar substance to polyurethane resin,
but there might be a similar reaction.

It takes time to feel the effects.  You'll be able to get away with quite a
bit of double use before you start to exhibit symptoms.

Now back to feeling like crap.  I accidentally ran through a red light last
night, clipping another vehicle with a company truck.  I always drive the
speed limit, obey traffic laws, etc..  Can't figure out how I missed seeing
the light.  At least I wasn't in the bus.  Of course my boss thinks I have
Alzheimer's... :O(

And no, I haven't been double using my own kitchen oven!
