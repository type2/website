Trust me. They won't even acknowledge the letter. 

Several years ago I had a Dodge Omni (stop laughing!) and went to Just
Tires for, well, tires. They sold me some crap made in Poland. They
were cheap, and the Omni wasn't exactly a sports car so I wasn't
worried.

A few weeks later one of the tires separated. I didn't think anything
of it since flaws happen. But over the next couple months, all 4 had
separated. But after the second replacement they stopped carrying the
tires (hmm, wonder why) and were replacing with Continentals.

I insisted on getting the 2 remaining Polish ones changed to
Continentals since I paid for a matched set of 4 and that's what I
want, but they refused.

I sent 3 letters to each of the corporate office, store manager, and
company president. Not a single "We got you letter". Nothing. I'll
never do business there again.
