Hmmm.. The middle of the coil is actually the positive side of a separate
coil of wire in the coil. It is really a transformer, with the primary side
having fewer wraps of wire than the secondary. Here's a link that helps:

In our coil, the secondary winding is grounded to the case.

But not constantly open. The high voltage is created when the magnetic field
in the primary winding builds then collapses, inducing current in the
secondary; the magnet has to be moving. The points have to be closed then
open.

Right on. As long as the points are the only thing connected to the negative
side (besides the light).

Here's another really good site on automotive ignition
