Subject: Re: Buses in Sandpoint Idaho?

A few years ago we were up in that area in our Type 3 Ghia and I found
myself in need of a valve cover gasket so I looked in the phone book
(which covered the whole county) and found that the one and only VW shop
was in Sandpoint. Just before we got into town we passed a road crew
taking a break. One guy saw us coming and started jumping up and down,
clapping, and whooping at the top of his lungs. That may have been your
one fanatic but judging from the number of VWs we saw in and around the VW
repair shop there's probably a few more fans in the area.
