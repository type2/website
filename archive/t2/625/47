Subject: NJ Emissions HELP!!!

I am having the worst time trying to get my 70' Westie thru NJ emissions 
inspection, believe it or not I have been thru 9 times and still can't get 
it to pass and am starting to hate NJ more and more each time. OK, now here 
is my situation I have a 1641cc motor with a stage 2 camshaft mostly for low 
end torque, I just put a brand new 34 pict-3 carb from California Imports on 
and it runs beautiful low idle everything, will not pass emissions due to 
cam so I adjust the valve lash out to .030 in. and run it thru to no avail. 
Readings are still high on CO at 7.93% needs to be less than 7.00% and idle 
is too high according to their BS vibration meter it is actually 900rpm, 
where it should be, what I need to know is how to adjust the carb. in order 
to cut the CO down without affecting the HCs which are currently at 593ppm 
and can't be higher than 700ppm. I do not have access to a emissions tester 
(which is why I have been thru 9X) and Magik is a daily driver in warm 
weather 12K miles+/YR so not eligible for NJ collectors exemption card. 
Please help I don't like driving around with a rejected sticker especially 
in NJ. :(
