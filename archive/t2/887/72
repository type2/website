I bought -3- one oz tubes of Hylomar High Performance Formulation Gasket
Dressing and Flange Sealant.  $0.99 per tube.  Close out table at AutoZone.
Call yout local store and ask them to look in the close out cartons....

"Hi-Temp repostioning gasket dressing sealant.  Non hardening/non curing
gasket dressing that provides an instant seal after assembly with proper
torque.  As a dressing, it holds gaskets in place and allows for
repositioning during assembly.  Ensures easy disassembly even after
long-term applications."

Will not fouul electrical sensors
Resistant to all autopmobile & shop fluids, icluding gasoline. [sure, but
how is it on Blood, sweat, and spit!!]
Temperature range -60 to +600F (-51C to 315C) {OK, so can I use it on my
exhaust??]
Seals Surface imperfections [Ladies, do not apply to face.  Use
Revlonproducts.  Not as high a temp product as Hylomar . . .]
