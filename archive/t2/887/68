Subject: Re: [T2] Ceramic Coating Exhaust

Yesterday, I picked up my 1972 original muffler from the coater  
(Thermal tech Coatings: http://www.thermaltechcoatings.com/).

I am not sure what it is called that they did to it, I think that it  
is a type of ceramic coating.   I had a choice of black, white, grey,  
or chrome.  I chose black.  pics are here:

I was going to throw this muffler away, my helpers insisted that it  
could be saved.

I had found on eBay a nickel coated tailpipe a few years ago which I  
may use.

This original muffler was a very rusty thing.  My helpers sandblasted  
(a mix of dirt, ricks, and black beauty sand) and welded up the  
holes.  The coater insisted on re-sandblasting it with glass beads.

This cost me $130 to have done, I could not be more pleased.  I would  
say that I highly recommend this, but I have not used it yet.  I can  
hardly wait.

Now, if I can only find the right gasket for the tailpipe.
