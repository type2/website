 Jeff,

Probably not.

The average Bus owner usually has a heck of a time getting the drum's
off when it's time to change the brakes---

He--or the guys that did the prior brake job more than likely didn't
clean up the axle hub, and slop some anti seize on it---and the drum has
grown onto the hub tighter than a fat ladies socks---

No need to worry about having the drum fall off while changing that
tire---believe me.
