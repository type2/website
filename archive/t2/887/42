Subject: 77 Automatic Transmission - Is it toast ?

Regular Lurker, needing help in starting on my 77
Automatic.

Regular transmission leak - 1 quart a month; finally
reached an apex and today lost all power, high engine
RPMs and no-go !  I know I topped the fluid off a week
ago and doubt I ran out.  A fair bit of smoke,
obviously burning ATF from under the bus, what little
ATF remains is blackish/brown and smells burnt.

Should I just assume it is blown and remove ?  Or is
it possible I ran dry and could just drain what is
left, put in new filter and pray ?

I'm leaning towards just pulling the whole thing since
it was leeking in the first place, I've been riding on
borrowed time for awhile and time has run out.

Where are the reputable re-builders of a 77 Automatic
Transmission [would a local place be qualified to
rebuild or would they just send it out anyway...].

No Go and looking for advice in Kansas City
Bob
