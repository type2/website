My '79 Westy with California emissions exhaust came with the driver's  
side stainless steel header pipe wrapped in some kind of insulator  
(asbestos?) clad tightly with a tin shield on the outside.  The tin  
cladding burned up in about 100k miles, and the insulation crumbled  
off leaving the naked header.  Since this insulated header is NLA,  
when I rebuilt the engine, I wrapped the pipe with a fiberglass type  
header wrap and secured it in place by wrapping it with .030 welding  
wire.  I figured that the factory probably insulated that header for  
a reason, probably to reduce head temp since that header runs  
directly under the head.  the passenger side has a regular style heat  
exchanger, similar to any other bus.  After approximately 25K miles,  
I haven't experienced any heat stress or failure in the wrapped header
