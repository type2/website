Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Search Engine

I didn't know about the layered searches.   I actually think  that is a smart thing.  You probably should put some of that  information on the front page of the website.  I've had trouble  finding stuff myself but it must have been because I was down too many  layers to find what I was looking for.   Thanks for the  info.  I'm sure I've bought something elsewhere that you had that  I just didn't find.  Cheers....KR

is a bit different from most. Our "smart" context-sensitive search function
is powerful but can be confusing if you don't understand how it works.  Also
the two search boxes on our site serve very different purposes.

The search boxes on the main (white) pages are context-sensitive. This means
that on each page, the search box only searches within the vehicle and/or
part category that is shown above that search box. For example, if you go to
"68-71 Bus" and then search from the main (white) page, it will search
within all parts for a 68-71 Bus. But if you go to [ 68-71 Bus > Brakes ],
the same search box will now search only Brake parts for that vehicle.  If
you go one step further down, to [ 68-71 Bus > Brakes > Front Wheel
Hydraulics ], now the search box below it only searches within that
subcategory. And so on. This means that you can drill down as far as you
want to into the catalog, and then search from there.
