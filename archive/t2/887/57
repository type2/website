Subject: Ceramic Coating Exhaust

It seems to be popular as I have seen it mentioned
numerous times here in The List. I did it several
years ago. My experience was that the coating got
sandblasted off all of the bottom lead sides of my
header tubes in about six months time. The coater said
he would do another one for me free of charge, so I
took another header and brazed in all the areas where
the tubes were really close, to fillet them smoothly
but I never got around to going back and having it
coated.

Has anybody else had trouble with the coating standing
up? -BaH
