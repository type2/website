possible loss of fluid, possible the pump has gone

it doesn't hurt to try putting some fluid in

I have found maybe two auto tranny places in the country that I might send
my 78 auto tranny (same as yours) to and one is in North Carolina and the
other is on the west coast, you are looking at in excess of $1,000 from
anyone worth his beans...

the tranny itself is mostly the same as a Jetta and parts are still
avaliable.

personally I would start looking for a good used one.. figure about $250
or so for one in decent shape.

and be VERY VERY carefull with the shift linkage taking it out.

follow the Bentley exactly even if it sounds crazy it's right

good luck
