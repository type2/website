I'm not looking to go that fast, but really what I'd like to be able to do is cruise at ~70 and not have the engine race as much as it normally would have to. Is there anything I can do? I think I read somewhere that the Bus can take a Porsch 914 5-Speed transmission? Is there anything else that might improve my top-speed... or, more correctly... lower my highway cruising rpms?

If your Bus was built before about 1974 the 'stock' tires are wrong. Around 1970 VW decided to put radials on passenger Busses while sticking with bias tires on the work trucks. The new radial tire size they came up with, 185R14, has a smaller diameter than the old bias tires. But they didn't change the speedometer or the gearing to match so Busses in that age range suffer from high revving and while apparently going the speed limit still getting passed by everything around. There is now a tire available that is the right diameter to match the old bias tires. Its the Continental Vanco 8 in a 195R14.
