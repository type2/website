Hi Kevin,

Sounds like the problem is in the handle... The pot-metal behind the  
chrome will get corroded and the trigger will freeze up.

Remove the handle, carefully pry the trigger loose from the back and  
then clean and lubricate it. That should work better for a couple of  
years. On occasion I have seen the trigger break at the pivot, so be  
careful when prying. There's also a spring behind the trigger -- if  
it's still there then try not to lose it.

Happy trails,
