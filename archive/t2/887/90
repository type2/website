Subject: Re: Ceramic Coating Exhaust

Greg is half right with the rust protection. 
Ceramic coating (depending on the type and quality)
can actually help keep the heat going in the right
direction. Ceramic is an insulator. Keeping the heat
inside your exhaust, and not on your heads, that's a
valuable thing. 
Not having an exhaust that rusts off it's flanges is
also valuable. 
If you are contemplating keeping your bus for a while,
I think ceramic is a good investment. It looks good,
sure. But I know that I have gone through a couple of
heater boxes, and mufflers in my short ownership
period. If I had gone ceramic, I would likely more
than double the life of my exhaust, so it saves you
money after a few years!!! Also, from a resale (not
that we ever think of selling our beloved buses) point
of view, a bus with a ceramic exhaust, has a lot more
appeal than a rusted exhaust.
