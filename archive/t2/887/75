Subject: reversing exhaust

i tried to post this earlier and i must be having a computer malfunction.
sorry if this is a repost for you guys.

in the case of the harley exhaust on greg pots' westfakia, did you guys have
to cut and reweld the flange on the manifold or was is as easy as putting
the left on the right and vise versa.  i am planning to do the same thing
myself and i was just wondering so i can pre plan as much as i can.  thank
you in advance.
