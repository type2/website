Subject: Re: [T2] Reversing exhaust manifolds and bending some exhaust

Question: If you build the "headers" from the heads to the "Y" from 1.5",
then build the "Y" from each side in 1.75" which would eventually connect to
a 4-2-1 system, why couldn't you split a length of 3" (used on diesels), and
wrap it around your 'header pieces, closing them off and adding a 2" inlet
and outlet?  Sure, there would be no fins inside, but airflow acrosss the
pipes themselves would transfer some heat.  Weld on sheet metal fins to get
more heat transfer.  Home built heater boxes?

We have actually thought of trying this on a friends Westy.  Serious exhaust
leaks which seem to be robbing a LOT of power.  It is an automatic, but no
where near what his '82 4 speed van does on the streets.
