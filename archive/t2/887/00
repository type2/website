Subject: 3 rib tranny for a bus?

Hi All, 

My neighbor has a VW transmission free for the taking.  He asked if I
wanted it, so I had a quick look at it.  It's an IRS, he tells me that
it came from a bus, but it's a 3 rib tranny of unknown gear ratios.
It's "complete" with rusted up drum brakes and a well-rusted castellated
nut that I'm sure an impact gun won't touch.  And without the weight of
a bus, a big tire chock, a 1" breaker bar and 10' of pipe (I'm a
lightweight), won't come off.  

Worth picking up?  The price is right, and without the half shafts, it
won't require *too* much storage space.   

The bus I have is a '77, 2.0L FI.  She cruises comfortably at 75 mph.  I
sorta doubt this tranny would do that.  

Thanks!

Shad H.
