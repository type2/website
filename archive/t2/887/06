Subject: Highway Gears / Transmission???

Hey guys,

    I'm curious... I'd like to know if there's a way that I can improve the top speed of my VW Bus. I'm not looking to go that fast, but really what I'd like to be able to do is cruise at ~70 and not have the engine race as much as it normally would have to. Is there anything I can do? I think I read somewhere that the Bus can take a Porsch 914 5-Speed transmission? Is there anything else that might improve my top-speed... or, more correctly... lower my highway cruising rpms?


Thanks!

Todd
