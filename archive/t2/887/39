Subject: door latches

I thought I had the infamous VW Bus door lock problem but after  searching the archives, I'm not so sure.  All of the problems I  found in the archives were with trying to unlock the door with a  key.  Mine is with squeezing the latch open.
  
  Quite a while back I had this problem.  The door latch would be  very hard to squeeze open.  I could insert the key, lock and then  unlock and it opened fine.  I sprayed it good with PB  Blaster.  I've come to think of that stuff as a cure-all but have  since learned spraying anything into the locks is a no-no.   Anyhow, I don't know what fixed it but it quit doing that for well over  a year.
  
  Now the problem is back.  Same symptoms, driver's door only.   Real PITA.  Anybody else had this problem?   Thanks....KR
