Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Search Engine

I ordered over a dozen parts last night, and didn't
have any trouble finding each and every part I needed.
 The Bus Depot search engine works just fine for me. 
In-fact, its a better search engine than the
one-search-box-fits-all on most web sites.  Even the
`list1e` works every time.
