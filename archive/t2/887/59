Subject: Re: Ceramic Coating Exhaust

In my opinion, the topic seems related to the practice of wrapping the 
(stainless steel) headers with asbestos-like fabric that is soaked in a 
silicate, which then hardens into a thick, waterproof and impervious coating.

Wrapped headers on Type 4 two liter engines have resulted in containment of 
exhaust heat that changes the temper of the stainless steel and subsequent 
warpage and erosion of the metal walls over time, with eventual failure 
when the metal is gone.

If the ceramic coating  contains the exhaust heat like the wrapping does, 
then the results may be similar. Therefore, it seems a bit risky to 
me.  Maybe you are lucky that the coating got sandblasted off.

Advantages of doing the ceramic coating in the first place elude me.  I 
considered wrapping my headers to retain the heat in the exhaust gas so 
that it would arrive in the heat exchangers at a higher temperature. I 
figured it would help heat the inside of the bus. Anybody know why ceramic 
coating the headers seems to be "popular" ?

Has anybody else had trouble with the coating standing
