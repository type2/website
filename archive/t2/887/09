The flasher in my '75 is a common 3-prong unit that you can find at any 
parts store .. so the Bus Depot listing is wrong.  The thing about 
computers is that they're only as good as the information fed into 
them. :-)

I had the same sort of thing happen in mine, but my problem was the 
hazard switch itself.  Wiggling the knob around cured it for awhile, 
until vibration from driving worked it loose from the "sweet spot", but 
wiggling it again got them working again.  I've got a replacement 
hazard switch to fix the problem but haven't gotten around to putting 
it in yet.

Try replacing the flasher (IIRC, I told them I had an '82 Rabbit to get 
mine), and try wiggling the hazard switch knob.  If either of those 
suddenly "fix" the turnsignals and hazards, you've found the problem.
