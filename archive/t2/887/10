Now THAT is simple!! I just happen to have a pair of Sportster mufflers too. 
Looks like he just reversed the exhaust manifolds so they pointed back 
instead of towards the front of the bus? He should have made the mufflers 
removable via the stock clamps too. Gotta talk to Greg, a fellow 
Canucklehead. :-) I wonder if it is loud or backfires when coasting or 
letting off of the gas?
Thanks Dean!
