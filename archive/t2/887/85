Anyone ever heard of this outfit and where they ran off to?  My bus came
with some paperwork with thier info on it and I am trying to get a better
idea of just what the heck was all done by the PO(s).
I got about 10 years of recipts(I don't think they are complete but the big
things are there like the AA Transaxle paperwork and some other mic parts
and the engine)

I drove past the address listed but its a parking garage now which I half
expected.  The phone number goes to VM.

Anyone heard of this guy(shop)?
