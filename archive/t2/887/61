Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Ceramic Coating Exhaust

My advise prior to pre judging the ceramic coated exhaust system would
be to contact Stan Wilder who does this sort of thing for a living, and
would be able to give an educated answer to your questions, rather than
guessing what or how long the stuff will last , and what sort of damage
the coating will do to the pipes.

Stanley is a straight up guy and will give you an honest answer.
