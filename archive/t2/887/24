Hi Rob

The mostly likely cause of strange electrical behaviour is loose, 
coroded or missing earth (ground/chasis) connections, it sounds like the 
wipers and the lights are grounding through each other.  I can't 
remember the specifics, the wiring diagram is at my mums garage, so I 
will try and get up there and look tomorow.
