Hi Doyt,

The purpose of the coating is to prevent rust.

The extra cost for ceramic coating is more than offset by the gain in  
longevity of the exhaust components. With a typical complete exhaust  
system now costing approx. $700-$1000 to get from the engine to the  
tailpipe, you want that investment to last as long as possible.


Happy trails,
