Subject: Re: Tom Noble Engines in seattle

Don't ask me why! But when I do a search in Google for Tom Noble Engines, I don't get anything at all.
BUT... when I put in Tom Noble Seattle in Google, I get a direct link for directions to Tom Noble Engines Inc.


This is the information I see:

Tom Noble Engines Inc
1414 NW 53rd St
Seattle, WA 98107
(206) 783-4778

My guess is that he sold that property for a profit and moved.

Is that address anywhere near your?


Here is the link:

http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=tom+noble&near=Seattle,+WA&cid=0,0,14752587261595725882&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=47.668711,-122.373748&spn=0.013699,0.027552


If that link is too long and doesn't work, just remember to put it in google as "Tom Noble Seattle".


I hope that was helpful, and hopefully they are still around...
