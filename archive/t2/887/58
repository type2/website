Subject: Re: [T2] Reversing exhaust manifolds and bending some exhaust

Hi Courtney,

I considered that, but the first muffler guy I talked to came up with  
the Harley pipes and the conversation stopped then and there.

If I was gonna Y the system I would design the system bring the  
exhaust forward, then connect the pipes up front and bring the  
exhaust out just behind the driver's rear wheel. Running the muffler  
in that location would keep it in the slipstream and there would be  
less heat radiated towards the engine air intake.

Happy trails,
