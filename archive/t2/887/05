Subject: Tail-light wiring!

Hey guys,

     I've ALMOST got the tail light wiring on my bus completed. I just need the extra little wires that go from the ground to the parking light, and from the parking lights back to the parking light on the tail light.

My only question though is... on the two-phase lightbulb that has both the parking light, and the turn signal... which prong is for the turn signal, and which prong is for the parking light?

I know that I can eventually figure it out once I get all the wiring done in the cabin, but I figured I'd make it easier on myself and try to do it right the first time.

So, looking at the lights from the back (as if I was standing in the engine compartment), there are two prongs coming out of the same socket, which one is on the right, and which one is on the left??


Also, one other quick question. Is there a fusible link between the voltage regulator and the wire that comes off the battery (or the alternator)?  I noticed that the replacement battery cables have a smaller wire that supposedly is supposed to go to the voltage regulator. However, the wiring that I have for my Bus instead has a wire coming off the starter (positive lead where everything else attaches to, but not the main battery cable) that goes to the voltage regulator. Is this ok? Is it not supposed to be like that? And should there be a fusible link between that connection?


Thanks!!!

Todd
