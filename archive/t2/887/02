Subject: 1975 Flasher and Turn Signal Failure

I have a 1975 Westy and all of a sudden the turn signals and flashers stopped working, they do light up all around the bus, just wont flash via the turn signal or hazard switch.  The hazard switch lights up, but it does not flash, neither does the indicator on the dash.  I checked the so-called 9 prong relay and see that the bus depot sells a German replacement.  From reading the archive and type2 library this seems to be the culprit.  However, only the bus depot lists this parts as being used on my bus, no other source of supplier indicates this relay was used on my bus.  I cant be sure by looking at the relay and comparing it to the photo at bus depot.  

Does anyone have any suggestions?  I have a camping trip planned for the first weekend in July and just spent a lot of money on hankooks and adjustable konis (worth every penny in my mind), but if the bus is sidelined, the wife is going to kill me.  Thanks!!!
