Subject: Friday - Anyone need a shell?

I was kindly notified by the Missoula police department that my unregistered, engine-less, multi-colored '79 "parts" bus is no longer welcome on the public street in front of my house.  Normally I would have been upset at such a notice, but the day before I finally got the '72 westy tuned and road worthy.  It is hard to dampen my spirits right now.  I was hoping to keep the '79 shell as long as I could to make use of all of the goodies that remain on it.  It has an automatic transmission that was working strong when I removed the engine.  The interior is shot, but the body appears to be in good shape with very little detectable rust.  The PO stopped by the house a couple of months ago to give me the history of each and every drop of paint that was lovingly applied to the inside and out.  It is a true multi-colored vehicle with a forest scene on one side and a space scene on the other.  Wonderful song lyrics are carefully written throughout the bus.

This weekend, to avoid towing, we are going to wheel it into the backyard and out of the neighbor's view.  This arrangement will have to be temporary.  So, if anyone in the area can make use of this shell, get a hold of me and for a case of beer we can probably work out a deal.  I am determined to keep this out of the salvage yard.  Even if you are not interested in the shell, but are in the area, let me know, would be nice to meet some local VW folks.

Thanks,
