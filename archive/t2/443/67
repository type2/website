Subject: Info needed for T4 engine with mechanical fuel pump

Hi Folks,
    I'm trying to help someone with a fuel delivery problem.  His pump
had no output so he bought a new one and installed it with the same
results, no output.  We tryed both pumps with the output hose removed
and the engine cranking, no output.  Both pumps work when they are
removed and the operating lever is pushed by hand.  So this made me
look at the push rod that operates the fuel pump.  Even at it's
highest point it did not come out to the "top" of the plastic,
intermediate flange.  Also, I couldn't remove the pushrod.  I could
pull it out a little, maybe a 1/4 inch or so,  and then it would stop.
In addition, the operating lever of the fuel pump only extended past
the pump's mounting base about an 1/8 of an inch.  I believe the
problem is that the pushrod is not moving the operating lever of the
fuel pump even though the pushrod moves in and out as the engine turns
over.  The Bentley manual doesn't give any info on this set-up exept
how to remove and instal the pump, so I'm left with some questions.
    1.  Is the pushrod removeable ?
    2.  Are there pushrods of different lengths available ?
    3.  With the end of the pushrod all the way out, what is it's
relationship to the top of the plastic intermediate flange ?
I hope someone can help me with this info so I can pass it on to my
friend
