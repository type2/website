Subject: 68-72 Westfalia Pop-top Hardware

So, I'm analyzing my 71 Westy Pop-Top hardware and realize that the front
hinge mounts are in very sad shape. I'm looking to replace them but don't
seem to see any replacements available for purchase anywhere. Am I looking
in the wrong places or do they just plain not exist? Do I need to find a
place to refurbish my existing hardware professionally and if so what sort
of place should I look for?

Thanks for your replies!
