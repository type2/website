The Type 3 is (was) to Volkswagen as Oldsmobile is (was) to GM. Its where new designs were tried and perfected before going on their bread and butter cars. While the Bug was suffering through the 40 horse phase
the Type 3 was getting progressive refinements of the the engines that eventually made it into the Type 1 & 2 line. The earliest cars had a single side draft carb and then the '64 & '65T3s had high compression
engines with domed pistons and dual carbs. In '66 they got essentially the same performance by going to larger P&Cs and then in '67 they got dual port heads. Both of these improvements went on later to be
standard in Bugs and Busses (note, for instance, the 311 part number on all dual port heads). But, while the internals are the same for Type 1, 2, & 3 engines of that vintage there are key differences in
everything around it. The most noticable differences for the Type 3s are the engine cooling parts and the carburation (dual carbs thru '67 & fuel injection after that) which, of course, meant different
distributors as well. Other minor differences are the placement of the oil pressure switch, oil cooler, and dipstick hole.
