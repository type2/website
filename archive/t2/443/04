Buy and build thee a slim jim. On a VW bus you can get inside in about 30 
seconds. I've got it open as fast as 8 seconds. MUCH faster that window 
replacement... <grin>

I once (actually twice) got into my Siper Beetle with a 12" bread knife 
borrowed from a restaurant in Caserta Vecchia, Italy. Used it like a slim 
jim to push down on the lock mechanism. Scary how easy it was. Asked owner 
if they could loan me one. It was during siesta so she pointed me to the 
restaurant and told me to myself in... Very nice people I met when I lived 
there.
