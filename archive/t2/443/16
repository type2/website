This reply is more in the where they why theme.

For a while on my 1584 SP.DR type motor I ran a temp sender in the 
sump and one in place of the dipstick. I wired an A/B switch at the 
dash just ahead of the gauge. I A/B tested and came up with a 10% 
variation between to two senders. e.g 200 at the sump and 220 at the 
dipstick. Through the range of temps the difference was always 10% 
+/- 2% '
