Yes, the push rod for the pump definitely sides straight out!!!
What sometimes happens is the end of the push rod can wear and leaves a burr
on the end of it preventing it from being pulled out.
The best I can suggest is to see if you can pull it out with a pair of
pliers. If that won't get it out, I'm not sure what else you can do short of
stripping down the motor?
From memory what VW specify is the length of the push rod. I think it is
140mm for the type 4 or there abouts (don't have a manual handy). There is
also a specification for the stroke but I can't remember that (~14mm at a
guess?). When I had mine off and a new push rod installed it was still a
couple of mm short of the lever on the pump when fully retracted, but not
much.
If you have troubles getting this working, it may be cheaper and easier to
install an electric pump until the motor is stripped down for other reasons
and you can replace the pump push rod.
Incase you haven't already looked at it, check there is a free flow of fuel
from the fuel tank to the pump so you know there's no blockages there.
