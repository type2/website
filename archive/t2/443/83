Seann,

This is one of those times when I actually use rtv on my bus.

Had one on a convertible that was the same way.  I found that
the valve cover gasket behind the mirror around the edges
would make it even with the chrome surface all around(yours may be 
different).

I glued the mirror to the cork and back all at the same time making sure 
that it stayed cetered in the back and even all around.

The next day I either used rtv or regular houshold "lifetime" silicone 
caulk in white.

Wasn't worried about it being a perfect application cause I just waited 
a coule of days for it to dry and then used a razor knife to cut the 
exceess off even with the surface of the mirror.

I doubt that anyone could tell how I had done it and unless they were
specifically examining my mirrors, no one would *ever* notice.

You might try www.mcmastercarr.com

They have some of the most amazing things that you can not find anyplace 
else...including several kinds of those "good" hose clamps that we were 
discussing the other day.

Cheers, dave
