Chad,

Thanks!...no you can't borrow it this weekend<grin>...I took it out wed 
afternoon and was so nervous that someone was going to run over me, that I 
didn't enjoy it very much...better on the way back home, but now I need to 
go make arrangements with my insurance folks for full value.

Anyone notice the third brake light in the rear window?


Anyone like to suggest what good value might be for insurance purposes?

Cheers, dave
