Cha Moon,
In order to use an upright engine, you will nee to switch the bell housing 
on your late transmission to a '68-71 housing.  In my '71 I have a late bay 
transmission for the taller gearing for my upright 1904cc. The install of 
the upright in a late model bay will have tin (cooling) issues.
