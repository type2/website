Dave,

Thanks for the suggestion for the seal.  Unfortunately, the glass broke
when it hit the ground.  It all stuck to the fabric backing, but is
unusuable.

If anyone knows of a source for just the glass and seal, please let me
know.  I'm driving with the inside rearview mirror turned to the left,
which is actually working great, but just for now.  I'd hate to have to
buy the whole mirror assembly just for the glass. Plus, replacing things
on my bus makes me feel like I'm doing an amputation.  I think he wants
to keep his mirror.
