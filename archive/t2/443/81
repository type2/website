Volks-
I use a '73 Campmobile as my daily driver (with the hanging locker on the
passenger side). Barry is correct that it does cut down on the visibility,
but I would disagree that it is "worthless". I use a bubble-style blindspot
mirror to aid in passing and parallel parking, and have little trouble. I
have no problems storing my gear, or with seating, even when camping with
five adults as we did this summer.
Bottom line: The newer layout may be better, but VW built thousands of the
older styles because they work. If the choice is between going camping with
the older style, and not going camping, I would say get your tools together,
and go get that interior!
Cheers,
Matthew
