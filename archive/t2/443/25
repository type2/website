> Wow, that looks great especially the detail on the engine. I especially like the red accent on the dipstick.
Does anyone know if the original color was black or grey before the rust took over?

Most all the dipsticks I have seen were red.

lead to? I've seen them on a few busses but when I bent down to take a look I couldn't tell exactly.

They direct the hot air from the heater boxes, when the flapper valves are off, to the rear of the
bus.....instead of to the front of the engine. This happened on 78 and 79 buses.
