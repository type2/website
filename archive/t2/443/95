Subject: this is why I hate bringing my bus to the mechanic

So, I take my bus in to get the oil plug fixed, and then when I get the 
car back, it's running all funny.  So tonight I'm redoing all the fuel 
lines, and I noticed that they crunched one of the metal fuel tubes; 
nice, huh?!

however, I'm really happy that I got that piece of foil out of my tank 
!!!! :) :) !!!
