I hear ya, I dread getting my bus back from the shop, I always end up 
retuning it.

Last time I had my bus in to get my idle circuit looked at, I got the 
bus back, drove it for 8hrs to find both carbs were lose, so much so 
that the two mounting bolts on each were rattling as they were pivoting 
apart and the linkage had come apart. I noticed the problem when the 
gas peddle stayed floored when I took my foot off. It sure was nice of 
them to not rebolt my carbs back on my bus after tinkering with them.

Fortunately I had the tools (of course) to put it all back together and 
rebolt the carbs down properly.
