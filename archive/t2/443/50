Hey Listers,

On Monday last I was on I-75 in the Cincinatti area and saw a white late bay
with a pop-top carrying a bicycle or two on a rack. If it was anybody on the
list, I'm the crazy, bearded guy who was honking and waving until I
remembered I was driving an 03 Caravan, not my beloved bus. (Had to rent the
mini for AC and serious highway speed for a quick, hard trip of 1500 miles
in 3 days.)

Anyhow, if it was a fellow listee, I hope you had a good trip.

Dave
74 Riviera.
