Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Champagne Edition Restoration...Thanks!!!

LOOKS GREAT!!!

I'll bet a number of us are painting our dipsticks red this weekend!!!!

Champagne Edition Trans-Vair update:  (remember these are only bolt in 
changes, keeping everything so I can go back to stock)

I'm working on our bus again. Finally the itch is on me again to be 
bussing... Dave's Champagne update is helping!

Got the flywheel bolted (Corvair flywheels are composite assemblies and 
with age the rivets loosen and the flywheel rattles. $7 repair), got the 
carbs down, soaked, cleaned, and ready for assembly (kits for both $20 
total).Engine is cleaned and ready for assembly It is a longblock 
now.  Bringing my 4 speed 3.55 gear tranny up from the family barn this 
weekend for cleaning and checks. Most everything is powdercoated now and 
ready for assembly. The local Corvair club is holding my hands and helping 
me along with guidance and a helping hand. Simply engine but a real mystery 
without the books - hey, just like a VW - gotta have those books. A friend 
in Clinton, TN told me to come up, he's cleaning out his Corvair parts and 
reference material as he has taken up Corvettes. So Saturday I'm going for 
a visit, to purchase some books and parts, and then that evening going to a 
cruise-in of all makes and models.

Talk to you all soon!
