Folks,

I have several parts to get put back into my 78 Champagne edition and one 
of them is a squareish rubber block(about 3/4 inch thick) that was 
marked..

"behind last seat drivers side"...I think it was to be a bumper or
something between the wall and the tire.

Does anyone have a picture of such a thing? so i can try to figure out
where/how to place it and finish getting my tire tied down?

I don't think it would be there on a camper....

I *did* go back and look at my interior shots, but had left the tire cover 
on when I did them for reference....duh..

Thanks, dave
