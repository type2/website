Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pump Studs Length?

Hello Theodore:

I have my OEM studs out at the moment so that I could resurface the pump gasket surface. My measurements indicate that the
studs are 37.59 mm, so 38 is the max length.

I have been following your oil pump saga. What pump have you decided to get and what are the modifications that you will
have to do? I gave up looking for a replacement for a new OEM pump and just decided that my existing pump was good enough
and that with a little blueprinting it would work well for my rebuild.

The messages from John at aircooled.net seems to indicate that his pump would work, but I would want to know all the
modifications that need to be done in complete detail before I contemplated using that pump.
