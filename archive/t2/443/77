If you found the stuff, and it's in good shape--you better hang up the
computer and go get it---

Because if you don't, one of Murphy's Laws will kick in--
And when you do find it conveninant to go retrieve it--it'll be gone.

This is pretty much how things are---

Why did you even take the time to write this mesaage?
Aren'y you at the boneyard yet??--:>)

Later,

Hey guys, how easy to come by are the Westfalia parts? I'm really
interested in possibly getting the Z-bed, and the cabinetry work that
goes with it on the side (the part that goes along the passenger rear
side of the car. (Also includes that roof shelf). Another thing I
thought I'd mention is... well, I found one in the junkyard, and it has
all of these pieces in GOOD shape. I'm considering buying them, but I
just don't have the time this weekend (or the means to get it there). I
can't drive my bus long distances until I get that steering damper. In
any case, I guess what I'm asking is.. what am I giving up here, are
these pieces easy to come-by?
Thanks!
Todd
