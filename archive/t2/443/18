Folks,

Here are some pictures that I have promised.  They are not my best, but 
show some of the good stuff.  We are expecting rain for the next few days
so I wanted to get them while I could.

Many, many heartfelt thanks to the individuals and the vendors who 
provided parts and help.

First thanks to my sweetheart(Marian another vw person) who encouraged me, 
took care of me when I was working 30 hrs on the bus on  weekends for 
3 months in a row and generally supported me when I got frantic(read 
crazy) in the last few days before the 
Eureka Springs show.  Thanks to my kids(19 &22..Nick and Ben) who cleaned 
parts, sandblasted parts in 100 degree heat outside and sanded and scrubbed
when it was really cold last winter.

Thanks to my friends Bob Dean and Jim Frisby who did things like weld
oxygen sensors to new manifolds, compare notes and provide much needed
help for the whole process.

Special thanks to Karl, George Lyle, Chris Mills, Richard Atwell, Jim 
Hayden  and many unnamed others who provided parts(and encouragement) when 
I freaked out because I thought I  had the right stuff and didn't....and 
provided notes and pics for stuff that I forgot where went.  You *know* who you are.


There will be a full writeup on the do's and dont's, a bitch section about 
headliner, seat covers and carpet from TMI....and better pics.  Comments 
about the window from hell that took 4 seals to put in and the vinyl 
piece from hell that probably cost me another award....and the "right" 
vinyl glue to use....

Yes, I know I have some wrinkles in some of the vinyl down by the windows, 
it *will* be corrected.  Yes there are still some pieces missing..can you 
spot them?

I still won the 1st place trophy for t2 68 and later  at the show, and 
being a trophy "virgin", it was good!

2000 hours, Megabucks of parts, the look on peoples face's at the 
show....priceless!!!!

Many thanks to all on the list....consider this "your" bus!!!!

Cheers, dave
