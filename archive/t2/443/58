Subject: Re: [T2] 68-72 Westfalia Pop-top Hardware

> So, I'm analyzing my 71 Westy Pop-Top hardware and realize that the front
 hinge mounts are in very sad shape. I'm looking to replace them but don't
 seem to see any replacements available for purchase anywhere. Am I looking
 in the wrong places or do they just plain not exist? Do I need to find a
 place to refurbish my existing hardware professionally and if so what sort
 of place should I look for?


The 68 to 72 tubular hinges suck. They bend and break very easily. VW finally got smart in late 72 and
redesigned them for the 73 year model. They were made of steel flat stock instead of aluminum tubes. [Like 74
and up rear hinges.]
68 were one-year-only in how they attached to the pop top. They were held on with wood screws. The holes had a
built-in countersink. 68 also was the only year that had a vinyl 'gasket' between the bottom part and the
roof.
69-73, the upper holes were flat because they used a carriage bolt that went thru the roof and a nut and
washer held the hinge on. The 73 hinges will work on 69-72 tops.

I have a good pair of 68 only hinges.
I have a good pair of 69-72 hinges.
I have a good pair of 73 only hinges. [these are getting very tough to find!]
