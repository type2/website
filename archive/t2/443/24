Wow, that looks great especially the detail on the engine. I especially like the red accent on the dipstick. Does anyone know if the original color was black or grey before the rust took over?

Also, I've been wondering for a while but where exactly do those extra exaust pipes beside the heater boxes lead to? I've seen them on a few busses but when I bent down to take a look I couldn't tell exactly.
