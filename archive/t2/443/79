Todd, if they are in excellent condition, you should go out right now and 
get everything.

My estimate on the prices for the pieces, proivided everything is there,  . 
. .

Opps, I just re-read your message and you said the cabinet is in the 
passenger side = SUICIDE cabinet!!

If you are looking at a '73 or earlier setup, is is pretty much worthless.

The suicide cabinet makes parallel parking absolutely impossible.

The sink/cooler cabinet that sits behind the passenger seat takes up 
valuable floor space, space that you would be sitting when drinking your 
beer, watching the sunset, with your favorite partner (no room for the 
partner)

The jump seat behind the driver is really an upholstered BOX that you can 
store things.  Better to use that space for the Rubbermaid cooler that can 
come in - out as needed.

The shelf that attaches to the roof (AND the suicide cabinet) is really not 
deep enough to load it up with light weight materials, like plastic cups, 
change of clothes, towels, curtain for the front windshield, sneakers, and 
lots of light weight snack foods.

The fold out Z-Bed is fine, but it needs the suicide cabinet to take up the 
extra space.  Otherwise, you will be replacing the two boards that form the 
seat and the seat back, adding foam, and replacing the vinyl / fabric (if a 
'73 = fabric) and trying to piece something to put in where the suicide 
cabinet was removed, i.e., the base of the Z-Bed dies not got he full width 
of the Westy.

And hopefully the rear cushion is there!?!?  Or you will be buying some 
foam, and recovering it to match.

Good luck.

Now if this was a '74-'75 or a '76-79, I would say go for it, just be sure 
to get as much cabinet stuff as possible.

Again, even here, things MUST be in excellent condition..

Have a nice day, sorry to cause some rain.


'73 and earlier setup = $150; '74-75 full width setup = $200 (has cooler 
behind passenger seat); '76-79 3/4 Z-Bed and cabinets (including sink 
cabinet) = $250
