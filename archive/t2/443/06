Subject: Another Westy Question: Cushion thickness?

Folks I know I've asked allot of questions, but I have nothing to compare to.
Hope I'm not in somebody's kill file.

Is the rear shelf cushion thinner, by about an inch, than the cushions on the
seat bottom and back?  I was trying the fit of a ZBed someone gave me (thanks
James) in my Split window.  When I fold the bed out I used an extra seat
cushion on the back shelf to compare to.  It set about 2 inches higher then
the seat cushion part of the bed.

Thanks
