hello, I am in the middle of installing my cabinets out of a late model
westy, but the trim around the closet door and the rest of the black
trim around the rest of it has shrunk with age and is to hard to
stretch. So is there a source for new trim? Any idea's? I've decided to
try and mount my spare behind the drivers seat, any problems or idea's
about that?

Thanks,
