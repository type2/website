Subject: re: mech fuel pump problem

I have a 74 dual carb T4 engine...
The installation for dual carb and single carb
mech fuel pump seems to be a bit different.
  If your bus is a dual carb then (as I understand it)
you check the stroke length by hand turning
the engine and measureing how far out the rod comes.
The PN i have for the dual carbed fuel pump is
7 20005.0 the new one I got from the busdepot
is made in Germany by pierburg.
  I would suggest measureing how far the lever arm in
the pump travels
when you operate it by hand and the make sure the rod
travels approx that far past the flange on the engine
when the engine is hand turned. I am also thinking
that you sould be able to just pull the rod out but I
am not
sure about that.. it's been a while. 
  The other question is.. does the rod actuate in and
out when you hand turn the engine? If not you have a
problem... 
  The question to the list would be (for me) Shouldnt
you be able to just slip the rod out of there.. thats
 how I remember it being but as I said I could be
wrong
about that...
