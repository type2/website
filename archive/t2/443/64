Subject: RE: [T2] Side Mirror Seal/Gasket(formerly cargo door handle)

Jon asked an excellant question regarding the repair of his side
view mirror.  The seal around the glass had failed and the mirror
itself had fallen out.

This exact thing has happened to me before..  I just bought some
silicone sealant and filled the edges and put the glass back into
the mirror unit proper.  This worked great until I found a
replacement mirror.  The trouble was that it look half-a**ed.  How
hard could it be to find a stinkin seal?  damned hard it turned out.
I couldn't find a replacement anywhere.  The mirror unit was
perfectly fine.  The glass was unbroken and serviceable.  Only the
seal was toast.  It looked just the picture that Jon provided in his
post:

Long story short I still have the mirror and the unit because they
are the stock equipment and I have hope that someday I will be able
to find the correct &*%$#(-at-)! seal for that mirror and return the part
to my beloved bus.

Anybody know a supplier for a convex seal like that?  I have been
able to find window glass and framing equipment for buildings that
are 200+ years old, but a silly little seal for a 27 year old
Volkswagen escapes me.  This appears to be what Jon needs as well.
