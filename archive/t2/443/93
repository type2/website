Subject: Transporting a bus cross country

Does anyone know of an economical way to get a bus from San Francisco to
Chicago?  I don't think that I have the time to pick it up myself.  The bus
in question doesn't run and it doesn't need any special attention, just
needs to be brought to me.  I will be fixing it up here in Chicago.
