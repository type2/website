Hi Todd,

Aren't you the one who couldn't get your SO to go camping? Once you get 
that westy interior installed you will be amazed how quickly the 
resistance will be lowered. That thick foam bed in the 73 layout is 
very inviting...

I have a modified 73 layout in my westfakia. When I transferred it from 
the 73 donor-bus I threw away the "Suicide cabinet", and widened the 
Z-bed to full width. I have seen other people shorten the suicide 
cabinet to window height, this is a good compromise of storage utility 
without losing visibility. With the spare tire up on the nose of the 
bus this is a very comfy double bed. 1974 and 1975 campers had a 
full-width bed from the factory, but with thinner foam than the earlier 
models.

I got rid of the sink/icebox unit as it was obstructing the door and 
nowhere near as useful as a cooler and a basin, which can be removed 
when not camping. Be sure to remove the small "spice-rack" shelf from 
the side of the ice-box, this can be conveniently mounted on the back 
of the passenger seat bulkhead where it will prove quite useful.

The rear-facing seat allows up to six comfortable seat-belted 
passengers, and quite often it is hotly contested as a preferred perch 
for my three offspring.

Happy trails,
