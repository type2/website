Subject: Re: [T2] Engine not firing

Thank you all for the suggestions. I ended up towing her into position
as it was just being a bugger to start. I had a friend who is into
bugs help out and we put in the shortblock I had picked up. She fired
right up with the first turn of the key, it was rather remarkable.

I appreciate the help, especially on Labor Day weekend. KK is back on
the road again.

Thank you all,

Max
