Subject: French art thief

This just in...A thief attempted to steal from the Louvre
and make his gataway in a VW van. He was captured 
less than two blocks away when the VW ran out of gas.
When questioned as to how he could have planned such
a daring robbery and yet not remember to fill the VW's
tank, he replied, "I had no monet to buy degas to make
the van gogh."
