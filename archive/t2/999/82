Subject: more on the wiring harness

My only guess, based on a post in the archives, would be that the lack of a
"B" on the ECU after the #s would mean it is off of a non-california Vanagon .
. . and my ECU which has a "B" means it is from California, since my Westy was
purchased new in Calif?  The post didn't talk about a "B".  The post just
indicates that there are possibly 2 kinds of harnesses that come off the ECU
for the same years . . .and I know my ECU has a "B" and it was made for
California.
