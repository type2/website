I had some water damage on the floor from my sink or from road splashing
through wear the gasket around the drain goes (If any one knows where to
find that gasket, please let me know_

Anyhow the wood was a mess and I removed it only to find out how rough of
shape the metal floor was. A few holes - lots of rust spots from where rocks
had it the underbelly and moister did the rest.  The holes were on the
driver side along the wall.

After grinding the rust and fixing the holes,
used por 15 on the rust spots.
On top of everything I used Kool Patch.
Next I put a layer of a wood floor underlayment called QuietWalk. about
1/8th inch thick
Painted 1/4 inch plywood
1/8  Masonite hardboard.

I will install carpeting after the seats and icebox are put back in place.

- Any one figure out how to better insulate the ice box? Is not worth the
work for a couple more "R"s and should just buy ice sooner?
