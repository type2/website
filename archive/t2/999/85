Subject: Re: [T2] wiring harness replace for 81 Vanagon

Check out this link for EFI wiring harnesses. Not cheap, but a good value
for the quality workmanship. Kyle does a professional job and mainly for
Vanagons, but they work on Bays. He makes new harnesses using old
connectors. I have one and it's a beauty.
