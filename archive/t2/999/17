Subject: Need for middle rocker panel??

Not being a purist into show-car standards, I'm wondering what the purpose of
the middle rocker panel is for? I've got the inner, and the outer, but the
middle ones have been a little more elusive. Would I immediately go to hell if
I didn't put them in between the other two rockers? They seem to be
redundant??? Metalwiz or other bodymen, please chime in.
Thanks,
Courtney
