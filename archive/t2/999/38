I'd like to give a major shout out to Tom Hughes in Central PA!

Tom went above and beyond the AIRS call of duty last night: I found his
name on the AIRS list, called him up, and he guided me in over the phone
to a safe Walmart to camp at near his house, late in the evening on a
holiday weekend. This morning he met up with me bright and early to help
me sort out my alternator pulley problem.

Thanks a bunch Tom!  I owe you one...

Cheers,
     Avocado Tom
