Subject: Re: [T2] Re post for leaky tubes

There are 2 piece replacement pushrod tubes so you don't have to remove the head.? 


Spring loaded are cheap plastic with o-rings (check www.cip2.com) but as I recall, I heard they leak pretty quickly too.? 


There were also aluminum tubes that are more expensive but more reliable(check www.busdepot.com);
You still need to remove the rocker arms to pull the push rods out, but
you can then pry the old tubes out and install the 2 piece style.? If
the oil leak seems bad and is only noticeable on the driver side, it
may be oil cooler seals leaking down on the side of the block so look
above the tubes too.
