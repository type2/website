I'm sending this message for my brother who is driving across I-80 in  
Pennsylvania and his alternator pulley is about to go.  He needs a  
new pulley for his type 1 engine.  Heading to Pittsburgh from Scranton.

This is for Tom Tarka, he's driving a 1600SP and he's currently at  
mile marker 290 heading west to see how far he can get.  His cell  
phone number is 571-218-2412.  Please call him if you can help.

Sincerely,
Andrea Tarka
Tom's sister
