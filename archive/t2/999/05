Subject: Re: [T2] Sending Unit O-Ring needed?

s r asked:


Hello lists, I just got my 75 Riviera running and
driving, for the first time in atleast 9 years.
 
My problam now is I have a fuel leak coming from the
Sending unit o-ring. So where do I find one? What size
is it?
 
 I always see posts about replaceing your fuel lines,
which I did, but I have never seen anyone say to
replace or check the O-Ring.
 
So if it has been said before then I missed that post,
but if it hasn't been said. I am now!
 
Check those fuel tank sending unit o-rings also when
you are checking and replacing the fuel lines. 
 
Thanks, and hope everyone is enjoying the long weekend.
