According to the 68-69 Color Bentley Diagram, they're supposed to be all 8a
White.

However, having owned a 69 Kombi, I remember using 16a Red on Fuses 1
(Stoplights/Turn Signals, etc.,) and 9 (Hazard/Interior Lights,
etc.,) because of so many items connected to these two and they would
occasionally blow.  At least with my experience.

See this link for the Color Diagram (technically it's for early 68, despite
the link stating it's for 68-69)
