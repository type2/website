Hey Devin,

If you are stalling out after 15 minutes of running, and then the bus runs
fine after cooling, you may want to check the fuel filter for debris. Often,
it gets clogged as the gas gets sucked through, and then when you take the
pressure off, the debris settles to the bottom of the filter and you are
able to drive again.

Hope this helps.

Ned
