Subject: Steering damper

I replaced my steering damper last night, I couldn't torque the
nut/bolt that attaches to the beam to 32ft/lbs (per bentley). Every
17mm wrench I had didn't fit in the bracket except one. And when I got
it to torque I couldn't get the wrench out. I had to back it off a bit
and pull it out.

Anyone have any tricks to keep that nut locked? Would a lock washer be
a bad idea in there?
