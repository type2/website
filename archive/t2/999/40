I've been anxiously awaiting the outcome of this situation.  I knew somebody would come through.  Kudos!  I knew the list would come through.

And another Kudo to a considerate driver I ran into last night.  I was on my motorcycle and noticed a guy in front of me with his blinker on.  The truck in front of him turned, then he went on straight.   Later, he did it again.  I guess he noticed a motorcycle following a safe distance back but just wanted to let me know that someone in front of him was turning!  Little things mean a lot in this world of inconsiderate, cell-phone using drivers.  Maybe there's hope for this society yet.

Cheers...KR

Tom went above and beyond the AIRS call of duty last night: I found his
name on the AIRS list, called him up, and he guided me in over the phone
to a safe Walmart to camp at near his house, late in the evening on a
holiday weekend. This morning he met up with me bright and early to help
me sort out my alternator pulley problem.

Thanks a bunch Tom!  I owe you one...

Cheers,
