Subject: wiring harness replace for 81 Vanagon

I'm trying to replace my old crusty half fried ECU wiring harness.

My existing ECU has the part #071 906 021 B.  I've found a possible
replacement which has the part # 071 906 021 (but without the "B").  Will this
cause any problems?  Can I use it?  Not sure what the "B" means.

Thanks!!!!

Brad
