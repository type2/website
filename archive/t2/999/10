Subject: Problems with 78 after new points

After several more attempts I readjusted the points and am running a solid
44-45 degree dwell.  I think initially my problem was that the rubbing block
was not seated properly. The bus is now running again.  I also put my old AFM
meter back in, because I keep stalling out.  I drove for over 1 hr  (in the
mountains) with no problem's. (crossing my fingers).  I do not own a gas
spectrometer and suspect that because I made no adjustments to the FI that is
why I keep stalling out after running for about 15 minutes.  Sounded like it
keep flooding out and would not restart till after the engine cooled.
