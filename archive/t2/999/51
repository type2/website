I have run a single Weber 40 IDF for about 15
years with very little problems.  The only time I
have to do anything to it is when it sits for a
long time and it has to be cleaned out.  The jets
are easy to get to with the single setup and no
linkage to mess with.  I recommend the heat
risers if you live in a cold area.
