Brad -

As an earlier post from Karl has indicated, 071 906 021 (without a letter
suffix) and 071 906 021 B are for California sold Vanagons, 1980 and 81-83
respectively.  Since the replacement ECU harness hasn't been available from
Volkswagen for more than a decade, they don't appear in the ETKA
(Volkswagen's Dealer Electronic Parts Catalog), I dug into my VW Factory
Parts Fiche archive and retrieved the following information:

071 971 761 - ECU Harness, Federal Vanagon 80-83 Models using ECU's 039 906
021 B, 039 906 021 C, and 039 906 021 E

071 971 761 A - ECU Harness, California Vanagon 80-83 Models using ECU's 071
906 021 and 071 906 021 B

So, essentially, there are only 2 different harnesses (harni ?) to look
for.  The main difference is that the California model harness has
additional wiring for the Oxygen (O2) Sensor, whereas the Federal model does
not.

Based on your originally provided ECU information, you have a California
model, so the harness from the 071 906 021 will work just fine, provided the
PO hasn't butchered it.
