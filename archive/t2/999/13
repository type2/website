Sure is nice to be driving Bussy again. Hopefully I've
got the bugs all accounted for and can enjoy some
drive-time! Of course, the list of things to do is
longer than ever, but the cooling system works and the
engine's running well - and the tranny is behaving
(first time in about 5 years!)

On to the body touch-ups (just to get by another
year!) and the new LED idiot lights and the rear
mounted stereo with new speakers and the brakes will
need adjusting before winter... and the diesel heater
is gonna go back in, I believe. Still gotta do
something about the spare tire. No rest for the
wicked! -BaH
