 I know nothing about this, just posting it
 because it's at like $100
 bucks and no one seems to have bid on it yet.
the Bus looks like it's actually in really nice 
shape.  Just by looking at
 it, it's missing the
 engine and transmission, and the rear bumper. But
 other than that (and the
 windshield needing to be replaced), it looks like a
 very decent condition VW Bus.
 Anyway, the auction number is: 160153612122

I asked the seller a few questions about the condition
of the bus. Here is his response.

Hello Volknstein,
 (the sliding sun roof) is fabric, no leak,busted
windsheild right below rain gutter so a little water
came in and under carpet so surface rust on pan right
behind front seats back seat is complete og with
matching velor cover pink like front seats some what
faded or dirty. brakes lines are cut but every other
peice is there rotors up front drum in back and worked
when i bought. see tow truck guy thought they were
locked up but what was happening was no engine or
trans plus wide back tires mean tire rubs on swingarm
a little so i thought put all the stuff back in maby
tire wont rub. but he allready cut lines. it will
steer good. tires are old and cracked.i will try to
send more pics thanks for looking at our project bus.
i had to have it when i found its so clean and alot of
hours were spent on body and suspention, wheels and
custom inside panels i was impressed. ive seen
hundreds of buses in california wernt even close to
this.to be in carolina i know its rare...so for the
price no reserve you choose engine and trans to keep
up with today cars.good luck thank you.

It looks like a good project vehicle.
