Subject: Re: [T2] Brake lights not working

95% of the time the problem is a bad ground connection. Try
disconnecting the spade connectors that come from the tail light
assembly and attach to the bus body near the engine door and run that
wire to a good known ground (like the  negative battery terminal :). I
tried cleaning the connectors on the body several times but they kept
getting flaky. I eventually just ran a permanent wire and they've been
fine since.
