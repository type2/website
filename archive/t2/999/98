Subject: Flasher Relay

Hi All,

Trying to get a 68 camper bus back together that had been in an accident and have run into an electrical question.? I can get turn signals to work properly, but as soon as I try the 4 way flashers, #1 fuse blows which is feeding ignition power to the flasher relay.? Is this a failure mode for these relays or should I be looking elsewhere?? As near as I can tell everything seems to be wired properly.? Anyone know of a schematic for the relay?? I also noticed term #54 goes down to brake switches and was trying to figure that out, more out of justing wanting to know why.? Thanks!

Ray
