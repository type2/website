I need crankcase to rebuild an 1800 ('74 Westfalia)

My preference is for a good used one within driving distance of Regina 
Saskatchewan Canada.  I also prefer that it not be line-bored or need to 
be since, through a lack of planning, I've already bought the main bearings.

I think a 1700 case will work but a 2 liter won't. I'd appreciate being 
corrected if that's not true.

Thanks for helping me get this rebuild back on track,

Jim
