Subject: Turn Signals on '78

Hello again -

I've searched the archives but am not finding the exact situation I am
having with the '78. The hazards will light up but do not blink and the turn
signals do not work at all. Can anyone point me in the right direction? I'm
even less electrically inclined than I am mechanically so use small words :)


I appreciate the help.
