Brian,
      As far as I know, you can't do it on a type 1 without pulling
the heads, which I understand is not something you can easily do
without dropping the engine.  I did this on my type4, I still had to
pull the rocker arms and it wasn't easy to do, but it was possible
without pulling the engine.  good luck!
