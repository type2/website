Do you mean the AFM?   I got mine from Bus Depot.  Their is also information
available to relocate the plate in the AFM in the type 2 library.  I have not
tried that, but will on my old one.   Bentley tells you you need some type of
gas spectrometer to adjust the FI after installing a new AFM.  I can attest
that simply puting in a new one without such adjustments doesn't work.  In
fact I put the old one back in today because I don't have one of those things
and the bus just keep stalling out.  (sounded like it was running too rich).
With the readjusted points and old AFM back in the bus is again running.
