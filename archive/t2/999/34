david,

you probably already know this, but in case you don't,  the "quiet
walk" is also a moisture barrier which means that any moisture that
gets between it and the metal floor will only be able to go back
through the metal.

i've used the quiet walk under bamboo floors as a sound deadner and a
a moisture barrier.
