It is mostly there to support the slider track. On the other side it just
takes up space. And it stiffens the assembly, tying the bottom edge of the
outer into the floor. On the driver's side I'd say you could delete it
without any ill effects. Rebuilding the rockers to original is massive work
if you have to cut them out and replace all 3 pieces.
