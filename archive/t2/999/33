Subject: Re: [T2] Sending Unit O-Ring needed?

In addition to the dealer, Bus Depot, etc., having this O-Ring, Airhead/VWG
has been making 'em for the past several years:

Amazingly enough, VWG sells several hundred of these a year into Europe (of
all places) to various vendors.  In addition to late Bays, they also fit
Super Beetles, Rabbits, Jettas, Sciroccos, Vanagons, etc.  I always have a
bag of 'em in my display case when I take it to a show.
