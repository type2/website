Well, go for it... Then you can use the parcel tray!  Actually, that's what
Just Kampers calls these busses, as busses with air ducts on the doors are
less common in Europe. (This is the drawback to carrying European made
products; there may be U.S. options that weren't considered in the design.)
Of course most Westies don't have the door air ducts, nor do some
non-campers.  I'm not sure how much cutting/modifying would be required to
get the far edges of the tray to fit around the edges of the ducts going to
the doors if you didn't remove them. My last four Type 2's didn't have door
ducts (2 crew cabs, 2 Westies), so I've never actually had an opportunity to
try.
