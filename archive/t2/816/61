Slight typo - hole was 3/8" rather than 3" - got the idea from the silly STP 
smog devices that we had to fit in Calif in the 70's that required a 3/8" 
tapped hole in the heat riser.

 I spent the good part of a day cleaning and painting a '70 single port
 intake manifold. The cable in a drill did not work well. What did work was 
drilling and tapping a 3" hole at
 the curve of the heat riser pipe. This allowed me to drill through the 
carbon in the horizontal portion with a
 long electrician's drill bit. I closed the hole with a brass 3/8" pipe 
plug.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Wow!!   I am still trying to visulize a 3" hole in the bend of the heatriser. Where did you find a tap?  :)
