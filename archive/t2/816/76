Subject: Re: [T2] 1965 Beetle front wheel aligment problems

Hola Roberto,
I'm no Beetle expert, In particular I don't know which tie rod (left
or right or both) is adjustable on the Beetle. But I have some general
advice below.

So you replaced the left tie-rod only. Do I understand correctly that
the replacement tie-rod is an inch longer than the original one ? If
this is so you should just go get the right tie rod, since an inch out
of alignment is quite a lot.

If the car was aligned before, the replacement tie rods should have a
length closely matching the original ones. If the replacement tie rod
is adjustable, adjust it to match the length of the original. If not
adjustable and the length is very different, then something is wrong.

If there is a 1'' difference, you are probably better off driving with
the old left tie rod until you buy the appropriate replacement. Such
out of whack alignment will eat your front tires in no time and
probably make the car unsafe to drive

Good luck to you

- Arnaud
