pulled the carbs.  plug the manifolds with rags.
still get the sound.
pulled the manifolds.. plug the heads with rags...
still get the sound...

but wait.  I get visual that corresponds to the sound...
cylinder 1 intake....
cylinder 3 intake....

they seem to be sucking more air than the other cylinders, judging by
how far the rags crunch in/out....

Hmmm.  I followed procedure in VW manual to adjust valves.  Time to
look at it again.

The engine does run, and it runs good...

I cannot imagine valve problems on both sides of the engine, both on
FRONT cylinder, both with same sound with new heads.

I'll let you guys know what happens with valve check and noise.

I definitely know it is in head now.
