I think that the cable method works best on manifolds that are not
completely plugged.

What I did on mine was to drill a 1/8 hole in the backside of the heat
riser tube just above the sharp bends and angled to allow a straght shot
at the center section where the clogging occurs.  I run a long reamer I
made from welding rod into the hole and carve out the center section.

When done, stainless hose clamps and a dab of red silicone close the
holes.
