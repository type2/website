Subject: slider door mechanicals maintenance tips

Okay,

So I'm replacing windows and seals and painting, and I have the cover off the
slider door track.
I see a nylon/rubber u-shaped rider which is not sitting on top of its
intended rail anymore.
What is a good maintenance & parts replacement strategy for this system (76)
right now?
I'd like to replace all wear parts and oil/lube/clean everything I should
properly.

Thanks,

Billy
