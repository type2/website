Not a myth really, but a matter of degrees. In some head-on collisions 
the parcel tray will make no difference, because you'd be in a bad way 
with or without it. But there are some collisions in which a rigid 
parcel tray would mean the difference between walking away from a 
collision and being wheeled away on a gurney (and that goes for your 
passenger, as well). So the cautious thing to do is to make sure it 
will break before your knees do.
