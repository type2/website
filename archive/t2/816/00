Hello, As I live near the ocean, I am always fighting rust.  One of the 
things I'm proud of is my bus' undercarraige. 
I recently set this to a friend.  I thought I would post this inorder to help 
anyone else and also receive some feedback on other helpful suggestions for 
my van. 

I first cleaned the bottom with Castrol Super Clean Cleaner-Degreaser. This
product is available at WalMart.  It is sold by the gallon in the
automotive section (about $6).  It is colored purple.  It is a great
product that can be used at full strenghth to clean your engine and under
carraige.  It is simular to a product used to clean your wheels (do not buy
that product).
After the bottom is cleaned and dryed, I applied the Wurth Rust Guard.  Do
not get this on your skin (it will not come off).  Use many latex gloves.
Used a brush to brush it on.  Use the whole can if you can.  So have alot
of things to paint.  Once the can is opened it will have to be used.  If
not, just poke a little hole in the top of an unopened can.  Put some paint
in a small container to use.  The screw a sheet metal screw into the can
top.  Place in the refridurator for future use.  The shelve life is only a
few months. This paint has no UV protection so the sun will destroy it
unless top coated.  Top coat (spray) the rust guard paint while still
tacky.  If you do not the finish will be very shinny and paint will not
stick to it.
After all was dried, I then sprayed the bottom with the Stone Guard (after
72 hrs or so).
Then after that dried I sprayed the bottom with Boeshield T-9 (about 2
cans).  I respray from time to time after I clean the bottom (once or twice
a year).

This is just what I did. Hope this helps others who are getting ready for 
winter.
