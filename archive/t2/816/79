Subject: Clock ideas for Bus

Hello all,
I have a quartz clock in the clock pod now which I installed by removing the 
button in the center of the blank dial and installed the clock movement which 
runs on a AA battery.
This set up works perfect but I don't have any numbers on the "dial" so here 
are my idea.
Scan a VDO clock dial from a broken clock and print it out, put that dial on 
the blank dial.
So comes my question.
Can someone provide the scan?
I have a 71 bus with gray dials.
This idea could be packaged in a DIY clock kit and sold for millions!
But I give it to you for free.
Thanks!
Rusty
