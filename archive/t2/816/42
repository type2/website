In a front end collision, my main concern is not my knees!  With a crush
zone that consists of one layer of sheet metal, the goal is zero
collisions!

I doubt that my homemade trays are any more dangerous than the
aftermarket variety.  Neither have been tested for impact situations.
Mine have a wide lip on the side toward the passengers and a suspended
mounting system that allows the shelf to fold down and move forward if a
large force impacts it from behind.
