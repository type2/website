Subject: Re: [T2] Clock ideas for Bus

Hiya George,

IIRC, I saw an article (thread posting) about a European Bus Driver who had 
(not installed, although that was his intention) a tach which matched the 
speedo and clock face design.  This one was for an early Baywindow, ie. gray face.  
If this was for real, I cannot say.  I'm just a bit skeptical because I have 
not seen a tach of this design anywhere else.
