Subject: 1965 Beetle front wheel aligment problems

Hello Volks

After found that the tierods ends of the small bar (pilot side) of my 
steering system were gone I decided to replaced them, every thing was O.K. I 
tryed the Miur method to set the toe in (since I could not find the tierod 
end with the eyelet for the steering damper, I decided to wait untill I get 
it to fix the longest tierod), after a short test ride I noticed the 
steering wheel harder to turn that before and also noticed that the steering 
does not retur to the straigth position besides a loud sound that cames from 
the tyres, so I got under the car and tryed againg, and againg , and againg 
actually I have better abdominals than before .
With succes not acheived ( a little better, after set it toeout, messuring 
the distance on the outside of the wheels) I decided then to be a little 
more formal so I picked up my 1958 bentley manual guessing that 458 and 465 
are similars and the data about the length of the tierods are 12.8" and 
31.8", more than a inch shorter than mine in the small tierod and of course 
1" longer in the longest one, since my 1200 bentley manual is on the way you 
are my last resource, any info on how to fix this????, by now is toeout, can 
be drive with a noise from the tyres, before I started to work on the car 
the steering was very smooth and the car does not pull to any side or had 
tyre's noise just a clonking noise coming form the bad tierod ends.I know I 
can take the car to an alingment facylitie but if this was my attitude from 
the begining this was not my hobby, all I ask is a decent steering behavior 
until I find the parts to fix the other tierod and beside learn and have fun 
in the process too
One more time thanks in advance, from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
