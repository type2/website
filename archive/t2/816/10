Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray-a safer design

In my estimation, owner-made parcel trays made of solid shelving are 
knee busters waiting to happen if one has a front end collision.  It's 
your own risk if just you drive the bus, butis a concern if the driver 
(college daughter) will have all kinds of friends as passengers in her 
van.  The original had a flexible rounded rubber outside with internal 
metal support to which is fastened a crushable netting to form the 
floor.  If you don't want to pay th price for the safe one at Bus-boys, 
then try this:  You can get 1/8 by 3/4" or 1" aluminum bar from a good 
hardware outlet. About $6 for a 6 ft bar.  Cover the front and sides of 
this with whatever tubing will fit- a garden hose or the 1" poly stuff 
off the roll at HD.  Bend it to shape and provide for screwing it to the 
wall in the back and side brackets bolted to it.  Make a floor of 
whatever works- Needlepoint netting comes to mind, or a piece of leather 
with holes punched along the periphery, or heavy vinyl fabric with that 
stripping you can get at a fabric outlet that has grommet holes all 
along it- sew it to the edge of your shaped floor.  Spiral lash this to 
the tubing with the laniard stuff and you have a functional SAFER tray! 
  When my daughter gets home from college I plan to do this in her 75.
