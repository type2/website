Sorry for the miss understud by my english is not a good as it must be, I 
was trying t o explain that I replaced the tie-rod ends that are in the 
pilot side of the car that is shorter that the one in the passanger, the 
bentley manual sais that the length of the shorter tie-rod after install the 
both ends must be set at 12.8" and mine before dissasemble was about 11.8" 
and the other tie-rod was set an inch longer to compensate is my guees.
By know I decided to set the tie-rod to the length espedified by the book 
then I will adjust the toe-in againg as Miur sais.
I wll let you all know.
