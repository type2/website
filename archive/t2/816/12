The headliners we ship are almost exclusively Acme, not TMI (except in
isolated cases; i.e. if Acme doesn't have the pattern). I would second Jim's
opinion on their quality, and also add that their customer service is better
(they ship faster, and tend to be more responsive in the rare case where
there is a problem). If you shop around, you'll find that our prices for
Acme headliners are frequently LOWER than many shops charge for TMI.
