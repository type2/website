Dave,
The thing that you mention is #6 on Fig 7-9. As the name indicates "
Piston retaining plate" it retains the piston in the right position.
The right position of the piston is when the pressed-out projections
of the piston face downwards, with caliper installed

Not many people seem to care much about that though
