   I believe Peter Egan (contributing editor/columnist for Road & Track)
said it years ago when he described himself as someone "trying to 
maintain a sportscar on a bicycle budget" ...
   For "sportscar" fill in your particular vehicle/hobby/passion/etc... :-)




Tony in NJ ("A four cylinder British sportscar running on three cylinders
                  has a distinctive sound...Like a Spad going down over Flan-
                  ders..." also Egan...;-)
