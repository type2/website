Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifold

I spent the good part of a day cleaning and painting a '70 single port 
intake manifold. The cable in a drill did not work well. What did work was 
drilling and tapping a 3" hole at the curve of the heat riser pipe. This 
allowed me to drill through the carbon in the horizontal portion with a long 
electrician's drill bit. I closed the hole with a brass 3/8" pipe plug. 
Think I have some pics of the plug location.

A few days later I noticed that Cip1 sells a new SP manifold for about $32.

 Plugged heat risers...has anyone used the muriatic acid method of clearing 
the residual carbon deposits which cause such a problem? If so, please 
relate experience and methods.

 I've already tried the "speedo cable in the drill" method- no good for me.

 Thanks!
