Subject: Re: Safer parcel tray

A cheap, safe, and easy way to make a parcel tray:

1. Go shopping for:
	
	a. Two sheets of matte board, reasonable sturdy, from an art supply 
store
	b. Roll of vinyl tape (like duct tape but in colors)
	c. A length of foam insulation, used for wrapping water pipes
	d. A piece of vinyl
	e. Small angle brackets

2. Cut the matte board to the correct size for the parcel tray, then 
spray paint both sides to seal

3. Tape the edges with vinyl tape to keep out moisture

4. Cut foam to correct length(s) to serve as a lip, and check fit

5. Cut vinyl so that it will wrap around foam and tuck into the 
lengthwise cut; contact cement to foam

6. Glue lip to front of matte board shelf

7. Secure to bus with angle brackets; rivet shelf to brackets with 
large rivet washers

8. Stand back and admire
