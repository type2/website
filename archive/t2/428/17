Hi Todd,

Assuming you can still get into the bus....

Is the key for the ignition the same as the rear hatch? If so, pull the 
rear hatch and there will be a code number on it. Then visit  
www.steveslockshop.com and call Steve Sandlin. He will take your credit 
card info and ship you a new key.

I had this experience with my camper back in 2000, and Steve was a 
great help.

Happy trails,
