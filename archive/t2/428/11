You may be "running out gas" at higher speeds where you are using more gas. 
Check the fuel tank outlet to make sure the metal screen is not full of 
junk (drain tank, unscrew the little metal line, should be a metal screen 
there). Water that collects in the gas tank from water at the gas station 
or condensation will settle there (water is heavier than gas) and rot out 
the metal screen.

Also it may be that the fuel pump is not creating enough volume of fuel.
