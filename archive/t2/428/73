Subject: removing head with engine in vehicle

Subject: Exhaust valve

I am fairly certain I have a burnt exhaust valve, has anyone pulled a head
with the engine in? I think I've heard you can.

ggm responds. yes you can pull the head with the engine in the bus. I did it once, then
I grew some more brain cells and realized that I worked a lot harder than if I had just
pulled the engine. besides you will find many things you want to fix and everything is a
lot easier with the engine out and up in the air on a stand. Everything is much more fun
to fix when you are not kneeling on your knees. Besides, if one exhaust valve burnt on
one side, it is time for you to replace the exhaust valves and guides in both heads. You
never do just one side of a VW air cooled engine. If you have a newer bus with the
welded on un-removable rear engine deck, then I also suggest pulling the engine and
transmission as unit. They drop straight down so easily and after rebuild, they bolt
together so easily it is fun. With the engine and Transmission out, you can replace the
front engine flywheel seal and the Transmission input and output shaft seals and grease
up the CV joints. You can get a lot of life out of a VW engine by just doing both side
head-valve jobs. The VW bottom end is really strong and it will last through several
both side head-valve jobs. You can even get real wild and re-ring the pistons and have
an almost like new engine. I replaced one head only once when the engine was recently
rebuilt, but had been in an off road accident and one head had been cracked apart when
the heater box smashed into a big rock. Otherwise, do both heads .
