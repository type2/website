ggm responds,

with open pools of gasoline, you also have to worry about an infinite number of every
other ignition source in the environment: the passing smoker flipping a cigarette into
the pool of gasoline; the guy with a flat tire running on the rim screeching to a halt
in a slew of sparks; the hot water heater gas pilot light in the RV that stops next to
you to gloat; your emphatically waving girlfriend wearing her wool sweater (static
electricity sparks) ; etc. ad infinitum. gasoline sends out vaporous fuses anxious to
ignite at the slightest whim.
