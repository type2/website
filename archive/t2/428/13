Subject: Front ball joints

Hi all,
Been looking at over hauling the whole front end on the Kombi ('77 bay 2L).
No problems with the tie rods, drag link, wheel bearings, brakes etc, but the
ball joints (for suspension/steering) have me worried.
Are they much harder to remove from the steering knuckle than a tie rod ball
joint? It's looking like a job for the pro's as my ball joint remover doesn't
look big enough.
(I wasn't contemplating pressing them out of the torsion arms either, another
job for the pro's).
Cheers,
