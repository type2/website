Subject: need to get rid of 72 shell

hey so cal bus fans, i am very soon going to be needing to get rid of my 72
bus shell.  what is left will be the shell and suspension parts but the
good news is the brakes were redone just about 1k or so miles ago so if you
are in need of these parts and you can drag my shell away then it is yours
for free and heck, i'll even give you a few beers and help you load her up.
this will probably happen in a couple of weeks so pmail me if you want it
otherwise she'll be taken somehow to the ecology junk yard.
