Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door removal

Hi Volks,

Another way to detach the door at the beltline is to remove the 
mechanism from the door. This can be done by removing the 4 10mm bolts 
on the inside of the door at the rear edge, just below the window. 2 of 
the bolts are probably hiding under plastic covers, the other 2 are 
clearly visible. Once the mechanism is detached you can just slide it 
backwards on the track to keep it out of the way.

I like doing it this way as it's less trouble getting the beltline trim 
off. Up here in the rust belt those screws can be a real problem. But 
if you have to work on the beltline mechanism then the trim probably 
has to come off anyway.

I like to keep an overturned plastic bucket or milk crate handy when 
working on the door so I will have something to rest it on as it comes 
off the vehicle. Having a helper handy is also a good idea, and be sure 
to clear the space around your work area before you start. Once you 
start swinging that thing around you are going to want lots of room to 
maneuver  and it's a bad time to suddenly discover a surprise underfoot.

Happy trails,
