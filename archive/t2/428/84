thats it thats it...
yes now i can put the other battery back inthe other side of the engine compartment and have two batterys.. yes that is what i am talkign about doing...
i want both to charge but yet want one to run interior camping lights and radio and such ...
but yet still charge by the alternator if i was to crank it and let it run a bit..

that way the other battery is for only starting you are correct you read it right..
thanks so much i will save this email so that i can get it taken care of..later when i got about 50 bucks...
will go ahead and try to find one.  /
thanks 
peace
