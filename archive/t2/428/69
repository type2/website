Subject: Re: [T2] '70 front brake shoe adjustment stars, possible

Hiya Bill,

After all these years of not much use I'd opt out for "The Real Man" 
approach.  You'd be surprised at how much general crud can accumulate inside a wheel.  
That and the viability of your wheel bearing grease would make pulling the 
front drum off a good idea.  
To really get "into" the stars and their wheel cylinders you'll have to pull 
the shoes off.  But that will give you the chance to really look over those 
brakes and do a whiz-bang job of cleaning out the stars.  A hint:  pull the 
stars out and chase their threads, same for the inside of their respective wheel 
cylinders.  A SMALL amount of wheel bearing grease on these threads will do 
just fine.
