Seems like we covered this one but I need the review...

Isn't it because the plats are a low resistance plug and the coil relies on 
a high resistance plug like the conventional Bosch Super to build up a 
charge in the coil before the spark jumps the gap?

The plats let the spark jump the gap long before the coil has really charged?

So Supers (and basic plugs like them) make a hotter spark with points style 
ignition while the Plats are better suited to an electronic ignition?

Good luck getting your engine dried out. You'll get there. I had to run my 
motorcycle (same problem) for a weekend trip before they cleaned themselves 
out. It took coasting down some long grades to create a high vacuum 
condition where the carbs finally ingested all the junk and motor spit it out.
