Subject: wireing my radio

well i was wondering how else i should wire my radio....?
right now i have it wired to a spare car battery....
evry few days i take it loose and recharge it...

well i would hook it into the wires that the original radio came from but they are hooked in to the switch....
so i have to turn the switch on wired this way before the radio comes on...

i cant sit there and just listen with the switch on cause i got one of those wierd fuel pumps that ticks when you tun it on..
i was told that leaving this on to tick to long could burn it up the fule pump that is..

what i am wanting to do is save my setting and also be able to sit and listen to the radio and also be able to recharge the battery back up with the alternator..

would it be as easy as runnig some 12 gauge wire seperatly to the battery for the engine that way it will continue to recharge it while running or i will just have to start up the bus to get it to recharge...?

looking for possibities..
?
need to save those settings and also be able to listen to it with the car of and it still recharge.... the battery..

can i hook two batterys up somehow to the alternator .. or would that blwo soemthing up like a batterty or melt something..
how do they do this on mack trucks..

usually the trucks i am talking about usually have two batterys on them..dont know how they are ran to the altternator unless they have like a crossover or something hell i dont know guess thats why i am so curious...

would like to have both batterys top be able to charge while driving so that i dont manually have to charge it and loose settings not only that but i wouldnt mind haveing the second for the radio and then the other lights and such that i will be runnig in there or fans or such for camping...

thanks for all or any help..
hope i make some since... at least some..
peace
