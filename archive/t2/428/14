For anyone who is interested and in the (west) Phoenix area, we will be
having a so-called "work party" for this year's Jerome Jamboree raffle bus
this
coming weekend.  On the to-do list will be installing the freshly rebuilt
engine
(thanks to Jim Burnite & Co.), electrical system overhaul (re-installation),
brakes on all four wheels, assorted cables, shocks, and tons of body
hardware
and rubber to install.  Also on the list is to polish, polish, polish all
the
not so shiny Deluxe trim.  There will be plenty of hydration and dips in the
pool (after all it will be 105 or so), plenty of meat on the grill, and lots
of
VW stuff to get done.  If you want to come check it out and HELP, email me
off
line for details/directions.
