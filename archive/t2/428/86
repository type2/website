Subject: Re: [T2]wiring my radio II

There is another way you can wire your radio. Find a 12 volt source under 
the dash that is hot all the time.

Wire the radio memory to that. That will keep the clock and station memory 
on. Check around the fuses for the lighting.

Now run a wire from the aux battery to the main power on the radio and a 
second wire from the main battery to the radio.

Connect the aux battery to 1 side of a two position switch. Connect the 
main battery to the other side of the same switch and the radio to the 
middle portion of this switch. Now when you camp set the switch to the aux 
battery position and when you drive you could set the switch to the main 
battery position but if you have the proper VW camper charging circuit 
intact to charge the aux battery the radio should get enough power at all 
times to run unless you've got a ghetto blaster radio (thumper stereo) in 
which case your radio might use more power than the aux battery would be 
getting from the recharge circuit.

I think most of the Bus suppliers sell a relay kit for the charging circuit.
