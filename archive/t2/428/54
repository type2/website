Well, a quick test shows that when the sliding door on our bay is fully
opened, and you attempt to shut the door, the projection looks as if it
would hit the locking stud that usually holds the door shut in the closed
position (the metal bolt thing that the rear door latch grabs onto when the
door fully closes).  I won't actually install the original handle, so this
is an educated guess on my part.

I'm not sure what the projection would hit when the door is opened, though.
My bay doesn't have the dividers behind the front seats, so I'm not sure if
there would be anything in a position for the projection to hit.

The arch in the projection appears to give it clearance to miss the locking
button when opening the door.

Anyone out there with Westy that still has its original sliding door handle
that could check this out for me?  Thank you!
