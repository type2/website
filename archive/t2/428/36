Nah - just hook your VW exhaust pipe to the pipe in question, evacuate the 
building, start the engine, and start pouring a pencil thin stream of 
diesel fuel into the carb... Makes LOTS of smoke and cleans out the carbon 
in your engine. <grin>

Of course you wouldn't want to drink any water out of those pipes for oh, 
about 75 years or 5000 gallons of water - whichever comes first...
