Subject: fuel gauge diagnosis using Haynes manual

I've got a '78 2.0 FI bus, and the fuel gauge doesn't read properly. When I
fill it it reads 3/4 and drops down to empty in the first half tank. The
Haynes manual  diagnosis (p 47-48) refers to a connecter near the fuel tank
(T.1.C on wiring diagram, track 41, p 255).  I'm trying to figure out if it's
the sender or not, but I'm having a tough time finding this connector and
following the instructions.

I did one check - I put the voltmeter on the lead coming into the fuel gauge,
ignition turned on, and got a reading, though it ranged from like 0.5 - 9.0.

Any knowledgable advice is welcome.

Thanks
Mat
