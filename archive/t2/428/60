I don't see any reason to think so. Could just be a nice strong engine,
combined perhaps with a gauge that is reading a bit on the high side.
The readings can vary depending on the particular gauge, temperature,
cranks, etc. Perhaps more importantly, the compression is relatively
even in all four cylinders. This is a good sign of a strong engine.
Personally I'd even take an engine with, say, 100 on all four sides,
over one with 130 in 3 cylinders and 95 in the fourth.
