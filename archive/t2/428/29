Where is the oil coming from that blows up the rear hatch?  (not out of the
exhaust, I have checked) >>

Anything that comes down from the engine, i.e. oil, will be blown 'up' when it
reaches the back of the Bus. I was curious a while back and set off a plumb-
er's smoke bomb under the Bus and drove it off. My buddy in another chase
car watched the smoke go back under the Bus, then go up at the rear. It was
an experiment to see if the Beetle trick of opening the engine cover would
help or hurt cooling...Not a good idea on the Bus, since you'll just suck 
exhaust
back into the engine compartment... ;-(
