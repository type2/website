excessive crankshaft endfloat may cause knocking also. it is also much
easier to fix! i took apart a mofoco engine once that had 0.014 endfloat. it
was "new".

make sure to check the endfloat before tearing the engine apart. the
endfloat can be checked with the engine in the bus, if you are industrious.
