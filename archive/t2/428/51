Subject: Re: [T2] Negative battery terminal on a 72

On my bus the orange cable is indeed the ground for the main battery.

I believe the previous owner got a generic battery cable from FLAPS or
Walmart after the factory ground cable rotted away...he didn't seem to know
that black is ground and red (orange) would be positive.  While not the
official way to connect the ground to the bus, my setup seems to work fine.

The braided cable you purchased must be the official factory style cable.  I
have no idea where it goes.  It may not even connect to the engine.
Hopefully another list member will respond with photos of a proper ground
cable.

Best of luck in your restoration project.
