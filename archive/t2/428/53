Subject: Westy sliding door handle

I'm now the happy temporary borrower of a Westy sliding door handle (thank
you, Mike!).

Several things that I noted right off the bat.  The Westy design is more
robust than the `77 bay design that my bus has.  And it has that projection
on the top.

Any idea what the projection does?

I'm almost tempted to stop making the bay design and go with the Westy,
simply because the older handle seems to be a more physically strong design.

Anywho, out to the bus to see what the projection might be for...
