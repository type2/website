Subject: RE: [T2] Lost my keys!!!

If you're in a hurry, I think a locksmith could come out and make you a key
on the spot. I don't know what they charge.

<SNIP>
Ok... well, looks like I lost the keys to my VW Bus. I know, I know. I've
never lost keys to any car before in my life... but this time I did.

Anyway, what do I need? Steering wheel puller, etc?

I figured I would just get an entirely new lock cyl. Do they sell those?
