Subject: re new Mexican Bosch Vacuum Distributor

I bought a brand new Mexican made Bosch distributor on my favourite auction
site, for $68. It looks really good and really no different than any other
Bosch distributor I've seen, other than being brand new.  I installed it today
in my 70 1600 single port bus. I've been setting the timing. I've referenced
the archives and my own experience, and come up with what I think is the best
timing setting. I measured between TDC and 10BTDC marks, tripled it and made a
full advance mark at 30BTDC, marking it with white-out. I'm setting it at full
advance with my timing light, as the idle setting seems to be too far
advanced. I'm not sure how many degrees of advance this dizzy has, it is
probably the correct distributor for a Mexican Beetle. I'm hoping that it
isn't too far off for a 1600 single port bus. It seems to be around 12 BTDC
for idle setting, revving it up to 3000+ yields 30 BTDC.

The only strange thing is, if I disconnect the vacuum hose, and advance it
with centrifugal only, it is exactly the same- it reaches 30 the same, and
every setting is the same whether the hose is on or off. It behaves much like
an 009, to tell you the truth. The vacuum advance hose fits tight and doesn't
appear to leak. The bus runs well, no problem there.
Anyone have any comments? Hopefully I haven't bought the wrong dizzy?
