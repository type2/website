Subject: Won't idle cold

I've made it home in my "new" 1970 Silver Bullet (pictures linked below)

Alright - the main problem is my 1970 1600 dual port won't idle when cold.
I've got to hold the gas down slightly to keep him going for about 4-5
minutes.  I also find that the idle drops off real quick a lot when
approaching a stop.  I'm going to check timing and idle speeds tomorrow.
Anything else I should be looking at beyond this?  Need to find me a
tachometer to get installed - none there right now.  A lot of work in the
coming weeks, for sure.
