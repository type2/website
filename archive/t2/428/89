I'm usually quite brave when it comes to trips like this but I think its worth noting that less than 2 months ago 2 split window Busses were demolished doing basically the same thing. Unspoken in the original story was the implication that they must have been going pretty slow. They got rear
ended by a semi on the road from L.A. to Phoenix. Also unspoken was the fact that they were probably traveling at night because the towing vehicle would have died in the desert heat. If you decide to go through with this folly I suggest bringing all of your Christmas tree lights along to give
those vehicles traveling 90 mph (That's almost everyone, right?) a chance to see you.
