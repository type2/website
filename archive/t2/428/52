Subject: compression #'s to good to be true?

I adjusted my hydraulic valves yesterday to Bentley spec at 2 turns in, so
today I decided to check the compression since it hasnt been done since I
bought the bus almost a year ago. The test was done with the engine warm and
with WOT. Well, I got quite the surprise. The measurements were:
#1-135
#2-140
#3-140
#4-140

Are these numbers to good to be true? When I purchased the bus the PO said
that he had bought it from a girl only a couple months earlier and she had
told him that the engine had about 40k on a rebuild. Now that would be about
45k miles. I had the bus checked over by my mechanic before I bought it and
the compression had been 140 on two cylinders and 135 and 125 on the others.
That was before I had done any work on it and who knows how long since the
valves had been adjusted. Since todays numbers are above what Bentley says I
should have, should I be concerned with a possible carbon build up or be happy
with a nice strong motor? Do the numbers vary quite a bit between a cold and
warm engine?
