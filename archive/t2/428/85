Subject: Re: [T2]wiring my radio

Run a hot wire from the hot post on the main battery. Use a fuse in-line to 
keep your bus safe.

Now no key is necessary for the radio to operate.

The aux battery should be getting recharged every time the engine runs. If 
not then the charging relay or the wiring is messed up.

I did find a hot wire under the dash that I could splice my radio into but 
later decided I liked my stereo on its own fuse and own wire.

You'll need to connect the main radio power wire to the radio memory wire 
to each other and then to the wire that runs to the battery. That way the 
clock stays on time and the station memory is maintained.
