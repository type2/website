Subject: Off the wall type 3 question

I know this isn't a type 2 question but I was hoping for a quick answer. I
was driving around this weekend and came across what looked like an early
type 3 pickup truck. I was a little beat but looked way too good to be a
home made job. Did such vehicles exist?
