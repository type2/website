I'm still fairly new to Type 2's, but I know of two simple (but annoying) probs that can
happen when you do wheel work. And with drums, you can see either of them.
Firstly, if you have had the wheels off for a while, or if you haven't driven the van in a
while, and there's moisture inside your drum you will have rust. So now where ever the shoes
were in contact with the drum when this rust occured is still smooth compared to the rust
"exposed" surface. When you brake this can cause a vibration until you have worn past the
rust.
Secondly, if your wheels have been on your bus as long as mine have, they were probably a
real bitch (gangster rappers please pronounce as "be-yotch) to get off. So they probably gave
them a few "taps" with a mallet to get them loose. This technique however can also loosen
debris inside the rotor which can get caught under a shoe, which can cause vibrations, and in
a worst case scenario, severe "track marks" on the inside of your drum. Use the mallet on the
mechanics head and have them look inside the rotor for any signs of the above.  Unless, of
course, you are the mechanic in question.
As per Chris, I had the same thing on my Suzuki rotors, I re-torqued them with my old
"clicker" and they were fine.

The Bus Fire Defense League thanks you for not lighting your bus on fire, it will do it on
it's own.
