Swap your 1600cc SP (single port) engine for a 1600cc DP (dual port) engine

Actually, to me, a single port engine is "premo" for a bus..Those tough
cylinder heads are the way to go for a hard worked engine..

My 62 Micro has an engine I built 12 years ago installed (1600 S/P) with
everything stock, the old bus cruises at 65, with reduction boxes, and is
still on the road with 205,000 miles....It has recently had a valve job, and
ring change, but the bottom end remained intact..

I KNOW I will catch alot of criticism about this, as all the gods think
single ports are a thing of the past, we still do alot with them, and even
build big valve "single flow" ported and polished heads that we install on
some bigger bus engines..

BTW, single port heads are much more resistant to cracks.....VW used the
design for almost 31 years, and ual ports for the last 8 years of
production, mostly because of the need for twin ports for fuel injection..
