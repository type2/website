Subject: Re: [T2] Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

'69 bus - drums and all four corners(no discs)

Torque on the nuts is 90 ft lb neighborhood

front tires 30ish psi

rears 35ish psi

depends on load

Adjustable adaptor? Find a place that does medium size truck work. 
Diesel shop maybe. They should have fixed adaptor to wide five rims.

With 65 psi in all 4 corners and out of balance tires anything out of 
spec will be amplified and telegraphed to the pedal.
