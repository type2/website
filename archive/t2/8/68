my wife owned an almost new 1974  412 squareback (station wagen) and put
close to 100k on it before it was clobbered by a drunk while PARKED !

only time it ever got hot that I noticed was when the cold start valve
failed and it caught fire....fortunately had a fire ext and it was quickly
put back on the road

that was IMO one of the best family cars off the showroom floor ever
built.
