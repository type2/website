Subject: lowering a bay-window bus

ALERT! NON-STOCK BUS INFO REQUESTED...ALL "STOCK OR NOTHING" GUYS DELETE 
THIS MESSAGE NOW!!!

That being said...

What methods do the custom bay drivers use for lowering their busses? I'm 
guessing adjustable front beams in the front.

What about the rear?

And while I'm asking, what about getting the Porsche wheel bolt pattern. Is 
there a way to do it without using spacers?
