Hi Jamie,

The only way a brake drum would work is if it were itself perfectly balanced - including the nuts which of course you would then only be able to use on the studs for which they were balanced.
So although you could in theory in practice it would (in my opinion) be more trouble than it was worth; especially as a good tyre shop should be able to do it properly.

Good luck
