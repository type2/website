Subject: Re: [T2] engine door seal

I ordered the part number from Bus Depot that Andy posted (as always, thanks 
Andy).  I should have it on Friday and I will post my install experience 
sometime this weekend.  I also ordered a "new" hatch latch from Joe at 
BustedBus.  Too bad the locking one I got from him 6 months ago is wrecked.  
Joe is really responsive and seems to know me by voice these days.  
Sometimes I wonder if he thinks, "Oh no, that john from Cali again..." but 
he is always cheerful and has supplied many parts that I was unable to find 
in my local yards.
