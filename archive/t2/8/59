Ah yes.  This brings back memories...  Memories about why the heck I moved from 
San Antonio, TX to Colorado Springs, CO in the first place!!  David's right.  
914's are more than capable of getting too hot too fast.  They're lighter, more 
aerodynamic, and geared a lot better, but they're in need of external oil 
coolers every bit as much as a bus.  Can't speak to the 411's since I've never 
had one.
