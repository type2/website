Hmmm,
I kind of agree with Damon on this one. No one is really slagging the Bus Depot.
It is important that we discuss our supplier experiences. I, for one, would
never have thought of going to either brokenbus.com, or JB Heater Source if it
wasn't for these conversations.
However I disagree about the second half of Damon's message. I don't mind
welding tips, or conflicting mechanical fixes.
An if your concern is that a supplier is be slagged, remember, its for a reason.
If bus depot doesn't maintain thier site, and they read on this mailing list
that people are losing faith they may spring into action and do something about
it.
