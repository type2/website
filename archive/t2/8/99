Subject: Smoke and Lights

Greetings, all. I have a couple of small questions for the group.

A)    I have an 1974 1800, Weber progressive, hydraulic lifters, running
20/50 Castrol synthetic, just coming up on 4000 miles on an AVP long block.
I have noticed a puff of bluish-white smoke when starting cold, not every
time but maybe every other time. I haven't noticed it on a hot start. She
starts easily hot or cold. The oil level doesn't appear to be going down so
it can't be burning much. Could this be related to the hydraulic lifters? Or
maybe related to the synthetic oil? I am given to understand that syntho oil
will leak through a smaller gap than dyno oil will. This motor doesn't leak
a drop anywhere. Ideas?

2)    My high beams don't seam to work. I installed the low-end halogen
replacement and the low beams are fine. When I pull up on the turn signal
arm to activate the high beams, either the lights go out completely (just
the headlights) or the brights go on while I hold the arm up, but go back to
low when I release it. Is there a relay going out here, or is the switch on
the column the culprit? Or is it just the gremlins that seem to follow me
around?

Thanks in advance,
