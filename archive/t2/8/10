I find that the 12mm hex is preferable to the 13, as it makes it a lot
easier to get a wrench on the nut in the tighter places.

Same applies to the carburator nuts on a type 1.  Some Japanese 12mm nuts
(such as those used by Honda) have a very nice flange on them which
increases the bearing surface and makes the nut more secure.

These nuts are self-locking.  As the nut is tightened, the helicoil grasps
the bolt.

Well, I think the process is called "corrosion."  Hot things corrode
faster.

I find that a healthy dose of anti-sieze on the exhaust nuts when
installing makes life much easier when removing the nuts.  Don't leave
home without it.
