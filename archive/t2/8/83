Me again. sorry to dwell here. I did a quick search and found this little piece at
Aircooled.net. Is this the short shifter you speak of?

Quick Shift Kit

        Price: $ 6.95
        Part #: CFS0002
        It's hard to believe a product this inexpensive can work this well! Shortens shifter
        throw 40%. Includes all hardware.
        If you have a sloppy shifter, this is NOT the solution. This amplifies shifter
travel,
        and if you install it in a car with worn out components, it will amplify your
shifting
        problems too! Replace the shift coupler and bushing(s) if you have shifting
        problems.
