I would read up in the Bentley, the Muir Idiot book, and then check the 
Type2.com library.

Another option is to have a friend work the shifter back and forth while 
you crawl around under the bus. That should help you find everything.

A short shift shifter doe not shorten the length of the handle you use to 
change gears, but instead shortens the length of the travel - the distance 
that you have to move it for each gear change.

Don't worry, I made that mistake too once.
