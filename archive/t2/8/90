Sorry to get to this so late in the post but I wanted to tell you all that if
you're not too concerned about OEM stuff, the plastic strip can be put back
on with flahead screws and washers.  I did it on my westy and they hold
fine.  I put them about every 4 inches.  Used a lot of them but they are
strong and you don't have to wreck your staple gun trying to get staples thru
the hard plastic strip.
Of course an air powered staple gun world do the trick.
