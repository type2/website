Subject: Re: [T2] 79 rebuild/colorado

ALL The rebuilds that I have seen from Norway, Holland, or the entire are of
the Netherlands have been less  than worth theri investment...

Like i have said before, if you want a good engine, contact us, or Boston
Bob, all the other produced engines we have seen have come far from meeting
our expectations..

I have some used engines in running condition, price is 500.00 plus
shipping..
