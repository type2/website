Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Again

Thanks Chris,
Actually I'm less concerned about the engine than I am about the tranny. The motor was
rebuilt before I got it (thus the brazillian case) but the tranny is original.I kind of like
the idea of keeping as original of a motor as possible. I'm all for the KISS theory, whenever
possible.
However, a deterent for me keeping the tranny was also the shifting. It seems like the gears
are all over the place. Its more about guess work, than selecting of gears. Should it seem
this sloppy? I'm aware that the shifter is about 3 times longer than what I'm used to, so any
sloppiness would be magnified, but this seems really out there. You can move the the handle
about 6inches to the left of the gate for first/second, and about 4 inches to the right of
third/fourth. The overall 'sweep' (for lack of a better term) of Neutral is close to 24".
Once in in gear there also seems to be a lot of play.
