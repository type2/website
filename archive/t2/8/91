Subject: Looking for a rubber elbow that connects to fuel tank on vent line

I need some help....

Finally got the firewall out of my 72 with the engine in.  Thanks for
the advice.  As soon as I lowered the wall right in front of me was the
guilty fuel line leak causing the wonderful smell of gas.

In the center of the tank there is a small rubber 90 degree elbow which
connects to a vent line.  No one, not even the VW dealer seems to carry
this.

Can I make one from regular fuel line just cut a little longer so it
does not kink?

Or does anyone know where I can find the replacement part?

What size is the hose?

Thanks

Craig
