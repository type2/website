Volks,

If you have a die grinder (dremel, etc.) and a small stone, I don't
understand the need for any extension.  On my Vanagon, I installed the
gauge/idiot light sender straight into the block.  To do this, you will
need to clearance the tin by only 2-3 mm.  disconnect the wire from the
old switch, take a sharp scribe and look straight down.  Note that the
opening is a circle when viewed from directly above.  Run the scribe, also
held vertically, 3mm or 1/16" out from the current line, then take the
dremel an cut away the excess.  The sender sits low enough that there is
no interference with the distributor if you do it this way, honest!

Warnings:  Leave the old switch in place and stuff a rag down the dist
opening to keep metal shavings out of the engine! Vacuum up before you
pull the old switch out.

(Sorry for the earlier blank message, too fast on the send buton :-(
