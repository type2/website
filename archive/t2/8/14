Subject: RE: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

Hi Eric,
It sounds to me like you have a '73 head, ('72 didn't have them and the
head changed in '74). Those two holes, I believe, are part of the air
injection system used in conjunction with a smog pump set-up. What
should be in each hole is a threaded tube. On mine I've just welded the
ends closed as I no longer have a smog pump. Perhaps if you go to the
wrecker you can find a pair of these tubes to use on your head.

Subject: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

howdee volks,

i purchased a used 1800 head for my 74 westy that turned out to be a
1700 
head.  with a bit of craftiness from a gifted machinist friend it became
an 
1800.  motor back together and running smoothly it was as loud as a 
helicopter.  valves were readjusted, timing set, no exhaust leaks.  the 
problem discovered was that there are two holes on the head leaking 
combustion pressure. i see short wiffs of flame during firing.  scared
to 
run it anymore.  each hole is just to the outside and below the
outermost 
intake manifold bolt.  the cowling on either side looks like it shows a 
place for a stud or something.  looking into the hole i believe i see
the 
fins of the head along the circumference of the hole and a valve. anyone

know how to remedy the problem of these mystery holes or what the heck
they 
are?

mystified,

eric
