Subject: Balancing Wide 5 Wheels.

Went through the hell today of trying to find someone in my area who can do
this. The only way appears to be dynamically balancing them on the vehicle,
but they say they can only do the front ones, because the rear has
independent suspension. They want $10 a wheel. Of course, if you take the
wheels off, and move them to another hub, they are no longer balanced.  The
archives doesn't have much on this. I read where one person machined a
special adapter. Has anyone ever tried bolting a Beetle 5 bolt Chevy adapter
to the wheel, and balancing it like that? That's my only idea...Tom
