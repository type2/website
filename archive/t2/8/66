Subject: 79 rebuild/colorado

Hi folks!
I need to replace a 79 westy engine with shot main bearings, and serious
oil
leaks.  I was curious if anyone had one available in good shape or knew
of a good
place to get one around Fort Collins/Boulder CO area.  I've been running
a weber
progressive and would like to avoid fuel injection.  At this point I am
considering replacing the whole engine rather than risking a rebuild on
the
current one, and any advice regarding this would be greatly
appreciated.  Has
anyone had experience with the holland rebuilt engines which my mechanic
suggested
I purchase?
Let me know what you've got, and feel free to reply to me so as not to
bother the
other list members.
Thanks much, and happy driving to all,
mark
