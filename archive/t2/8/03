Subject: Replace pilot bearing or not?

I'm finishing up the rebuild on my '78 T4 2l.  I bought a new pilot bearing
when I ordered the other parts.  I'm tackling the flywheel tonight and the
pilot bearing (in the end of the crankshaft) looks fine... not chewed up,
turns easily.  The reason I bought the new bearing is that Tom Wilson
recommended replacement at every rebuild.  The archives contain some brutal
methods for removing this bearing.  Should I replace it, or let it go?
