Subject: Re: [VB] So I done did it. I bought a welder.

Close Dave my one miller is an 130xp i bought it new ,the used one i bought
is a straight 130, older model, pain in the ass.( not the welder's fault
needs a liner and tweeking.) The xp does great on 20 gauge and is my
prefered machine, I also bought a Weldpak 100 this spring, Its good on sheet
metal also but i like the miller better on jack points and frames. I run a
75/25 blend gas,75% Co2 and 25% argon, i tends to burn a bit hotter than
straight Co2. The miller is more flexible to me than the lincoln weldpak, so
it stays on sheetmetal for the most part.    Hope this helps , later
