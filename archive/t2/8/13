ON a camper with 185R14 radials, the manual pressures are:

30PSI front, 37PSI rear at 3/4 load.
30PSI front, 40PSI rear at full load.

If you run more pressure, the ride will be be stiffer and you'll wear the
tires in the middle of the tread.

Retorque the lug nuts.  Uneven torque might warp the drums.  I never
let a tire shop near my lug nuts.  I take the wheels off myself and
take them the bare wheels.  That way, the tire jockey can't forget to
reset his air wrench from "Peterbilt" to "Volkswagen".

Take the tires to some place that balance the wide-5 wheels properly.  As
the VW ad said "Are you paying someone to learn how to fix your VW?
