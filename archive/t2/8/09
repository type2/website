Hello,
    I have a 71 bus and I am putting the master brake cylinder back in. =
The plastic tube that fills it has a rubber sleve where it connects to =
the reservoier and another one at the top.  Where can I get two? Can =
they be fabricated?  With what an old inner tube? Can anotherr plastic =
be used for a new tube? Thanks for any responce.
Patrick
