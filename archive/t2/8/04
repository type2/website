Subject: RE: [T2] Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

Hi Ric,

Well before you burn your bus I would get your tyre pressures way down.
The max pressure marked on the tyre would be for a vehicle of the max
permissible weight for the tyre - and for a D rate tyre your van is way
below that.

A 69 bus would originally have had cross ply tyres, radials being introduced
in August 71
So as you have bought radials (better than cross ply) you do as for a 71
bus; Bently manual says
front 30psi rear 34psi up to 3/4 payload
front 30psi rear 40psi above 3/4 payload

Inflation over this will cause bad tyre wear - the centre part of the tyre
width will wear out first.

This alone may be the cause of the bad braking.

Next as someone else has suggested check the torque of the wheel nuts  - it
should be 94 foot pounds.

If that doesn't cure your problem then take it back to the tyre shop as the
most likely thing is poor balancing. If they are not capable of doing the
balancing correctly (and with a 69's large hole in the middle of the wheel
they will need a special adaptor on the machine) then take it somewhere
else.

Take it somewhere else if they refuse to do the wheel nuts up with a torque
wrench too.

Good luck

I finally got the new tires on the 69 camper today 185R14 D rated.

They say  65 pounds maximum pressure, and that is what they put in them, but
what pressures should I run?

The tire place had a hell of a time getting them balanced due to an
adjustable adapter that was not working right, so I am not sure they are
balanced correctly. Anyway, as I drove off there was no roughness in the
ride. They seemed very smooth until I touched the brakes. When I touch the
brakes, the petal does that vibrating up and down thing like I have a warped
drum. What the?
Why would this start right after the new tires were put on? It does not make
any sense to me.

I'm ready to set the thing on fire, and be done with it. Please help.
