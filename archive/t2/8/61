How long can I last like this?

Start saving your money you are about to be parked.
Shop around for a good used standard tranny.
I've found that original is usually best so stick with the manual tranny.
If you go to the auto be sure you get the drive axles (80-83 Autos have
different axles than 4 Speed Manual) your axles could be the same but I'm
not sure.
