Rex,

Jake is basically right, but I did manage to shoehorn a '79 trans and '80
block (with '78 heads and exhaust and '78 clutch assembly) into my '73
body without changing the bell housing.  He is very right that it is a
PITA in the hanger department!  Probably would have been easier if I had
used (or had for that matter) a '73 bell housing, but I didn't and
couldn't switch them.

The later trans is 1" longer than the earlier one.  The body of the trans
is the same length, the shift housing at the front is 1/2" longer and the
bell housing is 1/2" longer.  There is enough slack in the adjustment
plate in the front under the shift lever so that if you flop bell
housings, you can compensate.  If you retain the late bell housing, you
are going to have shifter problems.  In addition, the '73 hanger is subtly
different than the later hanger.  I could and did flop in the later hanger
which probably saved my bacon.  I was installing not only the later engine
but the fuel injection, and the tube for the throttle cable comes out in a
different place for FI and Dual carbs, so I hadda, but there were other
differences as well.
