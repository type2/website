Great discussion. The cost points me back to ice (more or less free) or some sort of ammonia absorption version similar to our current stock Westy icebox. A bit of heat applied to the coils in this case. It seems to me that a pilot light flame would have enough heat to run our icebox versus the electric heater element - of course it would require all the safety gadgets too found in a Vanagon...

$1000 more or less to keep some drinks cold is a bit much. 

Wait... that's what we have in our kitchen (well $600)! <grin>  

See ya!
