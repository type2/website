Subject: new to the world of dual port

i'm catching up with my new bus and have a nice short block ready for it.
my choice so far is i have a set of seemingly newly rebuild single port GEX
heads, or two sets of dual port heads, and i've been exploring the dual
port route. while doing so i read tom wilson's vw book, and found his
comments on the "quench area" in the combustion chamber facilitated by a
ledge helping to create turbulance, etc. and other advantages found in the
DP set-up.

none of the four DP heads have that ledge, they appear to have been flycut
away. should i follow wilson's advice and not use these heads at all? or
can i make up for it somehow by adding shims? is it an issue to some, how
is it dealt with?  - steve
