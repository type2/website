FWIW I drilled and tapped for Chevy exhaust studs. Never had a problem with them in 10-15K miles before I took the van off the road for R&R (other topics) and a Corvair injection. 

Drilled and tapped all by hand whith the engine installed. 

I recommend either a wrap of tape or a drill collar that limits the depth of the hole. 1 mistake and you'd have an expensive problem. 

The reason I went this route was in my small town I could find dozens of Chevy studs with brass nuts in all the FLAPS. Look in the "Help" brand section or the performance section. 

Also this required my pipes to be slightly drilled out to clear the studs but no problems with sealing. 

Good luck!
