Subject: Re: [T2] #$%&(-at-) Exhaust AGAIN!!

FWIW I drilled and tapped for Chevy exhaust studs. Never had a problem with them in 10-15K miles before I took the van off the road for R&R (other topics) and a Corvair injection. 

Drilled and tapped all by hand whith the engine installed. 

I recommend either a wrap of tape or a drill collar that limits the depth of the hole. 1 mistake and you'd have an expensive problem.
