Hi Folks,

Thanks for all the helpful responses!  Given the delicacy and precision of 
the project, I'm still not sure I'm willing/able/confident enough to take it 
on myself.  It seems fairly straightforward, but it's unknown territory and 
the consequences of failure are pretty expensive.

I remember a post sometime last week about copper nuts, and I deleted the 
message before I could write down the link.  It was to the Bus Boys website, 
but I can't seem to find the right page once I'm there.  The link was to a 
page that had copper nuts and 8mm/10mm step-up studs.  If anyone finds it, 
please forward it to me.

Thanks again for all the help.  I'll keep you all posted on my progress.

Best,
