Subject: Re: [T2] INFO IN THE ARCHIVES

When I have a question I hit the excellent T2 library first, and also
attempt to wade into the archives (not to mention my Bentley, Haynes and
Idjot's Guide), but really find the T2 archives difficult and time consuming
to navigate.  I once asked for assistance/tips on how to best utilize the
archive (which went unanswered) however a simple "how to" guide posted in
the archive link for best retrieving this great wealth of info would be most
helpful for the less compoodur literate.  It would save time and frustration
for the questionee and save on annoying and repetitive posts to fellow
listees.

Just my 2 cents
