Subject: removing bellhousing

I've been contemplating removing the bell-housing to replace the input shaft
seal for two reasons: I heard replacing the seal in-situ is really awkward
and I'd like to bolt up the starter and build up the oil pressure to check
for leaks before I put the engine back in. I realize it's not quite the same
as when the engine is hot.

Any advice besides draining the transmission fluid first?
