Subject: w/s washer electric pump retrofit

list,

has anyone documented a conversion to electric w/s washer pump in a
baywindow? i checked the library quickly, nothing i could see.

i know people have done it, using a microswitch in the stalk, electric pump
and modified reservoir, but i was looking for a website with pictures.

any ideas on this?
