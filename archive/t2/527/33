"Sunfrost" is the brand that comes to mind.  Our
Sunfrost is almost 20 years old, runs off our
batteries charged by a windgenerator and a bunch of
solar panels (12--2 volt cells about 250 pounds each).
When we first got the Sunfrost, which is about 12
cubic feet if I remember right, I discovered that it
would almost run on our 4--35 watt PV panels (those
were big panels back in the early 1980's), in the
summer, in western Wisconsin, with kids opening and
closing the door all day.  I was also running radio,
stereo, and some TV on the PV system, and I think that
if you were to use a similar Danfoss compressor on a
top loading refrigerator box, and didn't open it a
lot, you could run on about 100 watts of PVs and a
pair of deep cycle batteries the size of car
batteries.
One friend has a homebuilt refrig that has a fan and
thermostat to bring in outside air to cool the food if
it is colder outside the house than inside the
refrigerator.
