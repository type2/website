Snoop, Snoop, Snoop,

I'm gonna hit this one before Doktor T saddles you up and rides you to Hanover.

Disregard the Bentley and start drilling holes looking for the sweet-spot?!

You, and everyone else here are usually a little more logical about such things.

Believe me, I've fought the shifters on splits and bays and my split is down right now with a shifter issue, so I feel your pain. I'm driving a damn 626 bro.

Get your head cool, see the entire mechanical system for what it is, a system.  Replace parts prone to wear, leave non-replacement parts alone.  Clean an lubricate.  Look for the folly of others and resolve.  Have a cold one and a buddy on hand for mental appeasement. It'll come.

Later,

Billy
