Richard,

Have you tried it out yet?

Hook it up, put a vom on those two leads and see what they do!

I'm wondering if maybe one of them might be useful for hooking
a buzzer to to wire in a circuit so that you would get a buzzer
when your ignition is off and your headlights on...

Maybe the infamous European "in city" parking light addition since
they seem to be labeled "left" and "right".

Just wondering myself!

Cheers, dave
