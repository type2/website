Subject: Engine trouble, need help

I just drove my 73 bay from New Hampshire to Florida. (oldsmar).
Just before i got to my freinds house the engine started loosing power and
stalling at idle. if i let it cool down a while it would restart and run
rough.  Had to be towed the last 20 miles.  Next day i thought i better check
vavle clearences as this has been passed problem with sinking exhaust seat.
#3
Here is what i first saw. inside valve cover there is a lot of mettalic sludge
oppisite #4 exhaust valve.  check all cylinders and valve clearances are OK. I
adjusted them all before leaving New Hampshire and covers were clean inside.
Oil on engine dipstick looks clean.
put covers back on and start engine. disconnect spark plugs one at a time and
all have big effect including #4.

What could be causing this metalic spray onto valve cover?  is this how bad
valves start to show up.?
I need to try and fix this and drive back at the end of the week to get back
to school.
has anyone seen this?
any help in the Tampa St. Pete area?
