Wow, was your clamp bent, or just loose, or something?  At least on the 
Type 4 engine, I can't imagine anything allowing the distributor to pop 
"up" ... I mean, the clamp sits in a groove on the shaft of the 
distributor body, and the clamp fits flush onto the case and is held in 
place with a nut.

If my memory serves me correctly, the clamp is the same on the Type 1 
engine; only its orientation when installed is different (10mm clamp 
adjusting nut faces rear [RIR] instead of to the right).

What part of the clamp did they file down?
