Subject: Re: [T2] headlight switches

 I had to fight off the mailer demon, but here goes again:

Richard, is this the switch that someone's making in the US, as opposed to
the dreadful Chinese junk ones? Do you know if they would work on earlier
years like my 70? I'm suffering from the weak rheostat that barely brightens
the instrument lights syndrome.
How much are they going for, where can you buy them and how good are they?

Any experts on headlight switches out there? I'm trying to figure out what
models make use of the extra terminals, 58L and 58R:
