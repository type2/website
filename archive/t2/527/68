"Another thing you can do,, instead of a micro switch on the stalk,
you can supply power to a small relay coil,, take the other side of
the coil to a home made contact on the stalk,, a small gob of epoxy
holding a tiny wire soldered to a thumb tack kinda idea..... when you
pull on the stalk, it grounds to the column,, and energizes the
squirter pump"..

Wooooo, wait a second there.  That outer tube of the steering column
is carrying 12 volts DC for the horn circuit so don't expect to use it
for a ground.  Not unless you want your horn to sound every time you
squirt your windshield...lol
