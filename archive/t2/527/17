Subject: 3 generations of buses

I am going to update my belated webpages and have at least replaced my old 62 
pic taken in LA in the 70's with my 3 generations of buses.

It shows:
my daily driver the 63 dove blue singlecab
my stepdaughters daily driver 70 red poptop Westy
my new fave 87 Westy

The 87 Westy is in the shop having a heart replacement
The rods starting knocking and I am getting peninsula auto to put in a long 
stroke, beefy cam engine that should have about 30% more torque. It should be 
ready this weekend.

The rest of the site needs updating and links fixed as I ran out of space and 
have just upgraded to more than 100 megs of space.
