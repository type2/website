Or, how about on my 70, in the parking lamp first click out position, there
is a little blue light that comes on in my speedo- could it be to power
that? Tom

<I'm wondering if maybe one of them might be useful for hooking
a buzzer to to wire in a circuit so that you would get a buzzer
when your ignition is off and your headlights on...

Maybe the infamous European "in city" parking light addition since
they seem to be labeled "left" and "right".

Just wondering myself!
