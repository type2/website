Karl,

WoW!  Karl, how do you do it!

#58d is interesting as it lists not only the panel lamp, but
tail and side marker lamps?

Refs to the DIN std are here.....and someone should probably put it in the 
archives somewhere...or Richard?...on your site?

An why a separate circuit for left and right license plate lamps?

Weird, so, on the switch that Richard has, the 58L and 58R should
come on at the same time that the parking lights come on....so, Richard, 
didja check it with a VOM yet?

Cheers, dave
