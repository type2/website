Subject: RE: [T2] '79 Bus won't stay running all the sudden

Thanks to all who responded for the suggestions and help.  I purchased a
couple bottles of Techron fuel injector cleaner, and all tune-up parts-
including a fuel filter.  I first decided to crawl under the bus and
start with the fuel filter.  Immediately I saw what was most likely the
problem. The short hoses running to and from the fuel filter were pretty
badly degraded and didn't look like high pressure fuel injection fuel
hose, but just normal braided hose.  Fuel was dripping from the lines,
and this must be where fuel pressure was being lost.

I'll head to the parts store in the morning to buy a couple lengths of
hose to install on the new fuel filter.  Any advice as to whether or not
this fuel hose is extremely special, or just high pressure fuel line.
Thanks again to all,

-Ross

Hi Ross,

Check all your vacuum hoses first.  The brake booster hose coming from
the 
left side front tin is always a culprit on my Bus.  Also check the hose
from 
the oil rebreather to the big S-hose from the AFM to the air
distribution 
box in the middle of the intake manifold.  Any missing hose that has a 
bigger OD than a pencil will let in too much air, lean the mixture, and
kill 
your engine.

If all your vacuum hoses are good, check your fuel filter.  If you've
never 
replaced it, or it's been a long time, replace it.  Sometimes cheap gas
can 
cause rust in the tank, and rust flakes can get thru the fuel lines and
clog 
the filter, leading to fuel starvation.

As mentioned before, you may have some gum or varnish in your fuel, 
especially if it's been sitting for several months or more.  Dump a
couple 
cans of fuel injector cleaner in the tank, let it idle, let it run thru
the 
system a bit.  If the Bus will drive OK, fill it up with some 93-octane
the 
next time you're out and about.

Good luck!
