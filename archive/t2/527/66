Subject: suggestion for the archives - was Re: [T2] INFO IN THE ARCHIVES

A suggestion on how to improve the archives would be to include some of 
the message content in the search results.  I notice that there is alot 
of header information in the results that forces you to open each and 
every message to see what it's about.  Is there a way to easily make the 
search engine skip the header and display the body in the search results?

I know I'd love to use the archives but I never do because finding 
anything is a beast.  Has there been thought to use google as the search 
engine?  I thought they have a system that allows people to use their 
engine without subscribing to their service.  This might help to make 
the archives used more and send less repeat traffic to the list...
