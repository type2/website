Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt Dizzy Observation

I used to work there and saw so many returns (some dead out of the box) that I am very suspicious about anything electrical from Advance.... Cheapest supplier. A better part for a bit more is cheaper than a ride home on the towtruck... I usually shop for the cheapest supplier too but Advance is not in my loop... <grin!>

I recently bought a rebuilt Bosch Distributor from my FLAPS (Advance
Autoparts).
