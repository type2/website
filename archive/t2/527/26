Get over it dude.  Do you think the folks like Karl find the list interesting when the same BS comes up over and over again?  Do us all a favor and use the archives/library. Let the bigger/newer/important questions rise to the surface. It's a process, you see.

I'm sure there's other non-camper owners like me who are about tired of exploring in depth which 
Westy-widget fits your 72-only shnitzel toaster.

Richard Atwell & German Supply guys:

Any info on new FI harnesses?  My '79 cal project engine has a mildly toasted harness.  Is anyone gonna go for it with this project?
