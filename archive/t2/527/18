Subject: #$%&(-at-) Exhaust AGAIN!!

Hi Folks,

I'll start out by saying I'm frustrated.  I've been dealing with exhaust 
leaks for the last 25,000 miles (since my new rebuild was new), and have 
suffered yet another setback.  The mechanic who has had my Bus for the last 
week called yesterday and told me he's going out of business and has no time 
to fix my Bus before he closes his shop.  So, it looks like I will have to 
solve my problem myself.

The patient is a 1979 2.0L FI Westy with a 77-78 rebuilt engine -- oval 
copper gaskets at the head, trapezoidal flanges at the exhaust, no CAT or 
EGR.  The 1-2 head is missing 3 exhaust studs (pulled out completely), and 
the 3-4 heat exchanger flange is no longer welded to the #3 header pipe.

The last time I pulled my exhaust apart (last summer), I filed the heat 
exchanger flanges down so the headers would hit the head before the flanges 
did.  I think the engine builder should have taken this precaution, but 
that's more the fault of the lousy replacement parts manufacturers than 
anything.  Since I overtorqued the studs trying to get a bad part to fit, 
the studs have pulled out of the head.

I checked the archives, and the consensus (from 5-6 posts) seems to be that 
the drill/tap method is best for longevity.  In addition, there is concern 
of drilling straight so as to keep the heat exchangers flat & straight.  I 
am working in a driveway with no help, and I am tackling this problem with 
the engine in the Bus.  Any suggestions?

Questions:

1. If there are holes in the head where the studs used to be, can I just 
thread new studs in, or do I need to drill to 10mm and use the step-stud?

2. I've never tapped threads into metal, let alone into the part of my car 
that makes it go.  Which tools and methods are recommended?  What should I 
avoid so I don't destroy my engine?

3. If a weld on a heat exchanger flange is broken, can I get it welded, or 
do I need a new heat exchanger?

I'm not looking forward to lying on my back and working over my head for 
hours, but I have little choice.  In addition, I'm terrified of doing 
something that will kill my engine and leave me with no transportation while 
I get my engine rebuilt.  Hopefully the power of the Mighty List can help me 
through this challenge.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
