It's neither. It's made for Ventura in the Far East. I buy some parts
from them on a wholesale basis and will likely carry this switch,
although I'd like to learn a bit more about it first. (Richard, since
you have one already, I suppose you get to be the first "guinea pig" to
try it and let the list know how it holds up :-)  Unlike the
Chinese/Taiwanese ones sold by other vendors, which are horrible, this
one is said to actually fit and work. Ventura has done some nice repros
in the past. 

Meanwhile, I sell the genuine VW/Mexico one, which also fits and works.
