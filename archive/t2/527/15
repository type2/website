Hi Tim,

What intake are you running?

If it's the original solex dual carbs, I would suggest you double-check 
the electrical connections on the solenoids at the side and make sure 
all of the vacuum connections are good. Also verify dwell and timing. 
After that is verified, do a compression test and get back to us.

Happy trails,
