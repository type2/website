Actually I have it dirt cheap at the moment. $39 gets you not only new
canvas, but also a new set of non-retractable poles. (These can also be
used in place of the retractable ones used on later Westies but they
won't retract to store under your sofabed.) Of course for this price
it's worth it just for the canvas alone if you already have poles. Once
my current supply is gone the price will go back up.
