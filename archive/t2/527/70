Subject: Anyone need a good set of single post heads?

I have a set that i pulled off a core motor................fellow had
replaced heads thinking it was the problem, but actually had collapsed a
lifter.  So, Heads got under 500 miles on them.  Appear to be original, do
not see any other markings on them

$100 for the pair.
