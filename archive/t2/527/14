I don't know if others have had this problem but I have purchased 2 of these
Hella relays and both kept blowing fuses and eventually just stopped working
all together.  And yes they were hooked up as others used my wiring to wire
theirs up and it worked perfectly.

Or you could spend about $10 and make your own.  This was described on the
Vintagebus recently.
The parts you need to buy are a 30 amp relay ($3-4), 10 guage wire (need
about 5-10 feet, Lowes for about $5)  and a inline fuse holder (with fuse)
($2)
Matt Roberds posted a how to a while back but I am having trouble finding
working links in the archives.  It was really easy and I wired everything up
and installed in under 15 mins.  Has worked Great for me and at half the
price, I am quite happy.  Also if a part goes bad I can always run down to
Autozone or whatever and get the $3 relay or another fuse holder.  Easy
Cheeze.....

Hope this helps and if anyone has a copy of which terminals to use please
post or I'll check when I get home tonite.
