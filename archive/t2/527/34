I want to be able to actually <live> on my bus :), a fridge is the way
to have a non-rotten food supply for longer than a couple of days (a
20th century luxury). Given the poor condition of the original gas
fridge/power eater on my van and my fears of CO1 death during sleep, a
compressor fridge and 200W worth of solar panels is the only way to go.
Being able to use my Powerbook without fear of a flat battery is a nice
bonus.
There are worse ways to spend 2000 Euros :)
