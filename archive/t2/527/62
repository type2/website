whoa there.  no one said you had to be an expert to figure this stuff 
out.  It's really pretty easy.  And yes, it's true that you don't have 
to buy matched solar panels or the most efficient units to get a 
working system, but it's also true that you can waste a lot of money on 
a system that doesn't work.  A little figuring ahead of time -- both in 
the "what problem you're trying to solve" and the "what pieces do i 
have that work together to solve said problem" -- can save you a lot of 
money.

That said, now I'll speak to the "what's the skinny on the these 
fridges?".  :-)

Regarding vanagon fridges: does anyone know what the skinny is on these 
things?  From what I remember reading in the owner's manual, when 
they're operating in DC mode (as opposed to LP or 110AC), they don't 
use a thermostat, they're just "on" or "off".  This means they don't do 
any temperature controlling and waste a lot of energy.

Again, if you've got the juice (enough solar panels) and are familiar 
with how to set the fridge, this probably isn't much of a problem, but 
it's not optimal.

Also, from what I've heard, the combination LP/AC/DC fridges aren't 
very efficient in DC mode.  So again, if you're going for DC only 
(solar, etc.), look for DC only fridges.
