Too cheap to stay in business???? I would start reading the warranty papers 
on that rebuild.

Reduced mass= less heat carrying capacity. Thinner= lower strength, more 
flex. How did the heads get out of spec?? Improper machining should be 
under warranty.

Those were the lowest cost parts you could find, right?? They are indeed 
lousy and wasteful if results is the target.

But it was a cheaper way to go than fixing it right, right???? Always prior 
to removing the exhaust nuts, back them off a bit then torque them spec, so 
if they are too weak to hold spec, you don't find that out until 
re-assembly. You know upon teardown the repair or replacement will be needed.

Over torque is a lesson all novices must learn before becoming an 
apprentice. Join the club. Everybody starts by learning from such mistakes. 
The only reason we learn is if we pay the cost of the mistake.

I have many years experience with aluminum thread problems. Without pulling 
the heads and setting them up properly I couldn't make good usable repairs 
more than 50% of the time. With 3 studs to do, I would not risk it. All the 
time is wasted because they now must be pulled anyway. Trying to get around 
doing the work right risks lots of waste that could be used to found the 
actual cost of solving the issues with purely the correct application of 
specs, no matter how much time/skill/money is involved to get a result that 
needs no more fussing for the long haul.

Replace the heads with a spec set, or have these repaired by a good VW A/C 
skilled machinist.

New or good used is the easiest and least expensive. Very rare to see 
exhaust re-welds last more than a year or two. If not jigged perfectly, the 
strain will crack them in short order.

The choice never varies. Either you do spec work and get insured results or 
you compromise and hope for the best. As you are learning, every compromise 
involves risk and the best results will remain allusive.
