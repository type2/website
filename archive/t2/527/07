The Hella relay kit that is described in this link is the one that I
sell for $19.95. Incidentally, this kit just got a glowing review over
on the Vanagon list today, from another user. For the average user, it's
the best way to add a second battery. As it happens, it's also the
cheapest.

The only major scenario where the Hella relay setup is not optimal is if
you frequently run very high-drain devices until your battery is dead,
and then need to recharge it very quickly after only minimal driving. It
is not optimal for this use because it 'trickle charges' the aux battery
rather than slamming it with a big charge all at once, so if you run it
totally dead it may take a few hours of driving (recharging) to bring it
back up to full charge. 

But few people do this on a regular basis. For the other 99%, this setup
does all you'll need.  It's simple, inexpensive, effective, reliable,
and safe - a rare combination. It's an elegantly simple solution, in
sharp contrast to other more complicated "overkill" methods that are
available. Perhaps this is why it's the design that Westfalia chose to
use on models that came equipped with dual batteries.
