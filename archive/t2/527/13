Using Jim's lead as a starting point, I went looking, as I was thinking
that a refrigerator would be a nice addition to the bus for camping.  I
used tp wprk around this stuff back in the '70s when the efficient
refrigerators were drawing way too many watts to run off solar panels and
the cheap solar panels were priced in thousands.

The box of choice for me would seem to be:
http://www.novakool.com/products/r4500.htm
I think it will replace the cooler box on a '68-73 Westfalia conversion
with minor modifications to the box.  It is too tall to replace the
original icebox but I believe it will fit under the plumbing for the sink.
if the shelf is removed and it will slide right in.

The bigger problem will be powering it.  At 80F (~27C) the draw is
advertised to be about 27 watts per hour.  At 100F (~38C) (closer to
typical in our Ankh-Morpork summers) the draw is close to 50 watts
per hour.  In order to have power through the night, you have to plan on
double the solar panel for the maximum draw which means 100 watts/hour of
charging capacity as well as a 750 watt battery. This means either two
BP 350U 50W modules or one BP 3125 125W module. The 50W modules seem to
sell in the neighborhood of $500US (although this site:
http://tinyurl.com/26ouc
has them on sale for $225US at present.  The 125W modules are available at
about the same $5/600US price from a variety of sites.

That means that the total ($600 for fridge, $450 for panels, $125 for gel
battery (you WANT gel batteries here!)) cost of ~$1175US is still beyond
the whim I had when I read the original post, but I am now considering
ordering one of the 50W solar panels just for off-grid camping.

Note that the size of these panels is about 1 meter by 1/2 meter.
They will definitely occupy some roof space.  They are also not light.
Raising a pop-top with a bank of cells installed may call for an
assistant.

Note also that the ratings on solar cells are a lot like the ratings on TV
screens and the MPG figures you see advertised for cars.  50W is what you
will get from the BP 350U cell if pointed directly at the sun in the
Sahara at noon on June 21st.  Otherwise, its output may be slightly less
(like my "21 inch" monitor which actually measures 19.5 inches). YMMV. If
you want to actually run your fridge, buy (a) double the capacity for
charging reserve batteries and (b) at least 10% and usually more like 25%
more cell capacity than is called for by the appliance.

                             OOK!
