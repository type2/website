I did a bit of research on RV refrigerators a couple of years ago and 
came to the same conclusion as you did.  Well, sort of.

I came to the conclusion that the rv fridge units sold in the US (and 
the Novacool line is pretty much standard fare) aren't as efficient as 
I had heard they were, by a factor of 5 or so.  In fact, they were 
inefficient enough that using them in a bus application was far too 
costly unless you were planning on living in your bus for long periods.

That said, I dug deeper because a friend of mine in Australia (where 
they also have summers of 38-45 C magnitude) had quoted me much lower 
power consumption rates and I knew that he had done his research.  He 
mentioned the danfoss compressor as "one of the most efficient 
compressors out there for 12v dc applications".  At the time, I was 
unable to find anything available in the US that used danfoss 
compressors, although I did find one fridge designed by some folks in 
SoCal that met the lower power requirement, albeit at $1400+ (the name 
eludes me at this point).

However, Joaquim's post reminded me of the danfoss name.

A quick google search on "danfoss 12v" led me to some affordable 
danfoss compressors and listed their power draw:

compressors/Danfoss/danfoss.asp

Similarly, the consumption numbers quoted here for a cooler which uses 
the lower end of the two danfoss compressors listed above appear to be  
much more in line with the numbers my friend had quoted me (5 years ago 
now):
http://www.sea-ex.com/commercial1/camping-fridge-freezer.htm

That is to say: 25W/day in "economy" mode.  (he had actually hoped to 
get closer to 16-18W/day but he intended to mount the compressor in a 
remote location so it wouldn't inadvertently heat up the cooler.

That said, there are some design differences in the "evakool" unit 
mentioned above:  it's top loading (like a cooler) which prevents you 
from loosing some of your "cool" when you open it.  Etc.

Anyway, the bottom line is that if you design your own fridge with a 
danfoss kit, insulate it well, and make it "top-loading", and don't 
open it excessively, you can probably eek out an 18-20 W/day draw.  
This means you probably need an 80W solar panel to "break even", plus 
~50 a-h of spare battery capacity on your deep cycle.

For a danfoss DIY kit (~$300 - WAG), 80W panel (~$350), solar charging 
electronics ($50), misc mounting crap and insulation for your 
fridge/solar-panel ($100) and deep cycle (~$80 for 105 a-h), you're 
still talking $880 plus your own labor.

If you've got the solar panel "lying around" or you want it for home 
use (backup power) anyway, the resulting cost of ~$520 sounds a lot 
more reasonable.  Doubly so if you lose power a lot and have a spare 
icebox "just in case"  -- you could easily save $100 bucks in 
non-perished food on a 36 hour blackout.

*shrug*

for now, I'm going to stick to my normal cooler with ice.  It has the 
benefit that I can pull it out of my bus and it's less clutter in the 
bus while I'm camping -- especially important for us non-pop top folks 
-- and it's a seat or table to set my beer on while I'm cooking.

In time I'll probably design an insulated box for my cooler to fit in 
so that I can get more "bang for my buck" out of my ice.  This will 
also be a first step into converting that cooler to a solar fridge, and 
I'll take that into consideration when I design it.  However, I don't 
expect to be there anytime soon.

As usual, YMMV.

Happy Bussing!
