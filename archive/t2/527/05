Subject: leaking brake system?

Hi Everyone,

I have just replaced my rear brakes and went about the process of bleeding the
brakes. I started in the rear and moved up to the front brakes.

While bleeding the front brakes I happened to notice air/brake-fluid bubbles
coming out from where the master cylinder attaches to the brake servo.

I'm not quite sure what to think. The small hole, slightly larger than a
pinhead, looks so perfectly round as to seem to belong there. I have very little
mechanical knowledge but from what I've read there should be no air within the
brake system. So should I assume that the master cylinder needs replacing? Or is
there something else that I'm missing?

I've bleed all four of the brakes (both the top and bottom bleeders for the
front brakes) and although I haven't taken it out on the road yet the brake
pedal still goes halfway to the floor before any real resistence is felt.

Thanks,
Harry
