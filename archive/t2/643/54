Yeah, true.... I still watch it but I always cringe on at least one or two things that I see them do. I don't know why they keep installing TVs and Playstations in the trunk, I don't know who's going to be sitting behind their car in the driveway to play on the playstation.

I mean, it's nice that they do this for people who absolutely have horrible beat up rides, but.. oh well, to each their own.

I was pleased when they re-did the 1981 Pontiac TransAm from the first season. They didn't make it too gawdy... yes, they did include a chandalier, and a cappacino machine in the center console, but at least it saved just one more 2nd gen TransAm from the crusher.

We could probably say the same about this VW Bus.... at least it'll be on the road a little bit longer.
