While this is an interesting list, it is a bit misleading as Johnson
Controls makes a few of the other brands shown on the page - check out their
listing on the page and their website:

   Johnson Controls Inc., (Sears' DieHard, Auto Zone's Duralast, etc.), (US)

   http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/bg/

It is my understanding that they also make Optima batteries and Costco's
house brand Kirkland (as well as others).  After speaking with one of their
techs, I purchased a Kirkland battery for my 73 BMW last fall and so far am
very happy.  In addition, they have a 3 year full replacement warranty.  The
only problem is that Costco does not carry a group size 41 battery for the
bus.
