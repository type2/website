Subject: front bearing grease seal

I'm putting in my new front bearings and I can't remember which way the
grease seal behind the inner bearing faces. Does the groove face towards
the vehicle or away from the vehicle. Also is there a preference between
"high temp bearing grease for cars with disc brakes" and the jar not
labeled "disc brakes"
 
 
Thanks
