 Voltmeter (and not the best one at that)
I couldnt tell you the age of the battery since I cannot find a date
anywhere on it. It is the same battery as when I purchased the bus 2 yrs
ago.

Buy a new battery!  Average lifespan of a battery is 27 months. Most of the time, when you 
pay big bucks for a 5 or 6 year warranty on a battery, all you are paying for is the warranty.

You know the battery you have is at least 2 years old.... replace it.
