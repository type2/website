No, they haven't.  Nor in the rear quarter panels either.  Those
are "side marker lights", and they were even illegal in Germany
until quite recently (and they have to be amber front and rear
even today).  Many US spec cars that got imported to Germany when
used have those lights painted black because of this.

Yep.  Bugs too, until '73 when the huge round taillights were
introduced.  But Buses got the amber turnblinkers for '72, when
they got the large, rectengular taillights.  The little oval ones
did have red turnblinkers for the US market.

Airhowlingly yours,
