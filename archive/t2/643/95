Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming from dipstick ????

ok i was going to try this shortly once i finish doing a few things here at the house...
i was going to do just that..
put a piece of gas hose on the dipstick metal tube closeing it off though...?
and take the dipstick out and set to side...
that way i could tell for sure if it was coming from the dipstick area or yes the metal tube itself..(inside fan shroud)?
i figure that i might be able to pull the fan (not the hub) lol but the fan it self and see if maybe i can patch it with this stuff i have for patching raditors.....?
its used for metal and such...
was going to patch the whole tube..?
see if that stopped it or not... but like i said first was going to see if it is shooting out the dipstick tube and that will tell me if it is coming from the metal inside where i will have to get to it from the fan being out and reaching my hand in hopefully successful..?
 
as far as the oil breather goes i ran a brand new line last night and made sure it was good and tight so that the pressure or vaccum was correct buttttttt still oil everywhere...this morn....
 
i checked walla go and no more than i drove this morning it has shot out another half qaurt of oil....arggggggggg~!~
 
try this and check back later today ....
peace and love and thanks

Chris, there must be a vacuum on the engine, you have
the line from the oil breather to the carb intake,
that should be enough, unless the line is
kinked(pinched off)and this would cause a problem.
Take the dipstick out and put a piece of gas hose on
the end of the dipstick tube and route it to the air
filter on the carb and see if this stops the leak.
Just something to try. We did have problems with the
dipstick, is the tube cracked, remember we had to bend
it back straight and run a rod through it so the
dipstick tube could be bad, cracked.. Just a thought.
