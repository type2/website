Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

We did the same with a Chevy Cavalier one time. Over $150 to find out that it needed a $40 MAP sensor... 

Now I test everything and work my way through that way. If you ever work on a 80's Chevy - don't believe waht the computer tells you... It just hints, never confirms... <grin!>
