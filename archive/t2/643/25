MOFOCO may be better than the last time I used them. Several times I bought stuff with decent results, a couple times I placed large orders (egine rebuild kits) and the kits came with mismatched parts or incomplete parts. Sort of turned me off to them. You might have better luck... 

Yeah - as far as how to build the engine beware. I too was reading alot about 6K rpm race engines, when what I needed was something that would push me along happily at interstate speeds and last. can't afford those $3K engine builds every 30K miles... I used to ask what the HP was, now I want to know about torque vs. rpm and how long it lasts... <grin!> 

The ShopTalk guys are MUCH better at tell you if a supplier or a carb works best. The hobby has outrun my studies and I now only concentrate on figuring out where I can find out the info I need rather than what the info is... <grin!> 

I do remember this: a stock 2.0 is best suited (in dual throat, dual carb form) to a 36mm per throat carb. The single throat carbs are good too - better MPG with little HP/torque loss. The BIG carbs are great for max rpm engines, but not necessarily daily drivers. 

I saw mid-20's out of my Beetle no matter what with a stock 2.0 and 36mm Dells.

Hi Chris,

I would love to get my hands on some Gene Berg literature. I visited the web 
site, but they don't have the material priced. When I wrote and asked for a 
price list, they just apologized and said they don't have one and would be 
working on upgrading the web site. Haven't gotten around to a web search to 
see if there are other sources, maybe even used.

Shame to hear about MOFOCO. I was considering them for heads since they 
offer a performance upgrade at a low price.

I go for durability too. I've learned a lot from reading the Fischer manual 
at the recommendation of the Type 2 web site. I've seen that a lot of things 
the local VW club gurus are pushing me to do aren't good for me, like Weber 
48's, aggressive cams, etc. Last thing I need is a bus with a power band at 
6000 rpm!

Those guys had me feeling bad about putting only Weber 34's on my bus, but 
Fisher says Weber 48's are too big for VW engines anyway, and need to have 
the venturis changed to 35 or 36 to run right, so I was coveting an $800 
carb setup for nothing!

Just checked out shop talk forums. Looks like a useful resource.

Regards,

John

 www.shoptalkforums.com is an AWESOME source of performance info...
