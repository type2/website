Subject: Re: [T2] Starting problem - Update

| Small 'update' on my non-starting problem.
| I just went out to look at everything, again. The last time I tried to 
start
| it was Friday.
| I turned the key to see what happens today, it turned over very slowly, 
then
| stopped turning altogether. I turned the ignition off, waited a minute, 
then
| tried again. This time I got maybe half a turn, then nothing.
|
| Battery still shows good.
| Starter? Alt?
| Thoughts?

I would definitely check out the ground strap on the transmission.
There is no real ground return path for the starter motor other than that.
A brand new battery with extra balls won't do squat without that being good.
Also check the battery terminals for cleanliness and tightness.
If you don't want to go crawling under the middle of the bus right away, 
jumper it.
To do this, take a jumper cable from the negative terminal of the battery to 
a solid engine piece of metal.
If the problem is your ground strap, you will notice a big difference.
Let us all know.
