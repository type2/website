Brad,

Thanks for the info...sounds like $300 each is about the going rate.

Man, I sure would be madder than a wet hen if someone in a humongo SUV
used my bumpers to park by feel though.

Hmmmm maybe one of those super spark things to zap their engine computer 
if they hit to hard....LOL...

Got any pics of your bus?

Cheers, dave
