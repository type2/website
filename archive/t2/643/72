Hello Guys  Sounds like an Urban legend  like there only being 2 tennis shoe 
makers???  I would like to see the proof please.  I have found that Interstate 
batteries have lasted and had less problems than the cheapos.  I also really 
like the Optima dry cells which I'm using in my 59 panel and my 64 356C 
porsche   later and have fun  Mark dearing
