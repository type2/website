Hi Chris,

I would love to get my hands on some Gene Berg literature. I visited the web 
site, but they don't have the material priced. When I wrote and asked for a 
price list, they just apologized and said they don't have one and would be 
working on upgrading the web site. Haven't gotten around to a web search to 
see if there are other sources, maybe even used.

Shame to hear about MOFOCO. I was considering them for heads since they 
offer a performance upgrade at a low price.

I go for durability too. I've learned a lot from reading the Fischer manual 
at the recommendation of the Type 2 web site. I've seen that a lot of things 
the local VW club gurus are pushing me to do aren't good for me, like Weber 
48's, aggressive cams, etc. Last thing I need is a bus with a power band at 
6000 rpm!

Those guys had me feeling bad about putting only Weber 34's on my bus, but 
Fisher says Weber 48's are too big for VW engines anyway, and need to have 
the venturis changed to 35 or 36 to run right, so I was coveting an $800 
carb setup for nothing!

Just checked out shop talk forums. Looks like a useful resource.

Regards,

John
