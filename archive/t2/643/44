Subject: Re: [T2] Starting problem - Update

 I turned the key to see what happens today, it turned over very slowly, then
 stopped turning altogether. I turned the ignition off, waited a minute, then
 tried again. This time I got maybe half a turn, then nothing.

 Battery still shows good.
 Starter? Alt?
 Thoughts?

'Battery still shows good'....... ??   How are you testing it? With a voltmeter? Or with a load-tester?

If the battery is truly good [I totally doubt this], then look at your starter amp draw. You may have bad
battery cables or bad bushings and the armature is rubbing on the pole shoes.
But I really believe your battery is toast.
What group size is it?
What is its age?
