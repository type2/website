Subject: Auto tranny troubles

Any of you who have any automatic experience, bring it on.

I have a '78 Champagne Edition Westfalia Camper.
I bought it with the engine partially disassembled and now have it going.
The transmission was already in the bus and described by the PO as "fine".
It's drivetrain is stock from what I can tell.
Engine: GE series;  Transmission: J08;  Differential: NF 12 01 8
I just recently put the engine back in and topped up all the fluids.
I departed on the ceremonial test drive, senses focused on the mechanicals.
It was running well and seemed to be shifting well, though I have never driven
an auto bay.
It was then that I noticed I was trialing oil.
As I put it in park, the trail quickly became a large (3' diameter) puddle.
It is seeping tranny fluid from some sort of vent on the pass. side top of the
diff/axle area.
I felt up around the housing and the vent-thing was freely movable with my
index finger.
It was sort of like a little spring loaded thin metal cap with little
resistance to downward pressure.
It won't seem to tighten, and I cannot seem to find any real reference to it
in the manuals.
Speaking of the manuals, they show some sort of cover/housing over that
portion of the diff.
Mine doesn't have one and seems like it wouldn't accomodate the main mount
bolt.
Anyone who knows about the why's of the leaking, please give your assistance.
Thanks.
