Hello Japoco    What are you asking here  The first pix I cant tell what it 
is the second is a factory reman case  I can tell by the recess area where the 
numbers are and the logo before the numbers , doesnt tell us its an H case 
cause the factory would stamp the numbers to go with the  year of the bus It 
could be a later type of case which would be good  The H and B cases were famous 
for cracking and pulling the head studs. The B case is better than the H cases 
cause it has the dual reliefs valves and the bigger pick up tube .  Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing
