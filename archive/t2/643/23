Hey Chris,

What a coincidence! I'm running Weber ICT on my 1776. From tuning inf I 
thought golden brown exhaust was good, but I recently read that this color 
is good for plugs, but means lean if this color in the exhaust pipe. Any 
idea what jets I should be running?

Similarly, I've got a set of Baby Dells for a motor the same size I have not 
put into service yet. It came with several jet sizes. Any idea which one I 
should be using in it?

Does cam make a difference? The Webers are on a 100 cam, the Baby Dell motor 
is unknown, but the PO thought it was a 100 or 110, maybe even 120.

I was thinking of moving the baby dells to the one with the webers because 
it is on a bus. The other motor is going in a ghia. If I pull the Webers 
from the bus because they are too lean, they will go on my wife's bug with 
stock 1600 DP.

Thanks,

John
