I've bought stuff from Gene Berg. GOOD stuff and you pay for it. I have all his tech books and think alot of his stuff. Back when I was living in a foreign country where answers in English were hard to find, pre-Internet, and most of the folks around me had experience with Bajas and dunebuggies (where a whole season without blowing the engine was considered success) Gene taught me alot of stuff. 

Some of his technology has been explaned on but still his stuff is a great read. What I learned from him was that junk parts build a junk engine (MOFOCO was out of my picture after that, and that the stock VW systems are there for a reason. In other words a COMPLETE VW engine was a necessity - none of this throwing away the thermostat and flappers, etc. 

What I liked about his stuff was a balance between durability (important to me) and performance. 

To me Berg = Beetle Type I and Raby/Boston Bob = Type IV. 

www.shoptalkforums.com is an AWESOME source of performance info...
