Subject: Lift (Was Pimp My Ride on M-TV)

Thanks for all the info. I am pretty sure now that the Westy will fit under
the 12 foot limit that this lift has without any trouble. I have a miracle
truss building so the peak of the roof is 15 feet and the side walls are 10
feet. This will provide plenty of room for the lift and the bus in the center.
I was just worried that the bus would hit the top crossbar before it was high
enough to work under. As long as it is not over 6 feet from the frame, then it
is perfect.

The lift that I am looking at is a Rotary lift. I am also looking at
autolifters.com at there lifts. My friend has first shot at the Rotary lift
since he found it. If he does not get it, then I am going to pick it up. Save
me about $1200 on the lift itself. That will help pay for some new toys for
the Westy....
