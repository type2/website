Subject: Re: [T2] MSquirt in an upright?

Hi Andy,

My brother had a 1975 Beetle which ran extremely well with factory 
L-jetronic FI, made in Germany. The injectors are smaller that those 
used on 1.8 or 2L bus, but many other components are identical, except 
where the shape of the engine or engine compartment dictates otherwise.

A friend of mine is currently working on gathering the components to 
upgrade his 68 westy to run upright FI.

Happy trails,
