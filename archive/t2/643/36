yup sure sounds like a Torque converter seal.

the seal goes into the end of the transmission where the triple shafts
come out.  (bus depot had em)  this seal has a funny way of going in and
it is not written up in Bentley very well.

 the seal is pushed in until it is only flush with the top of the recess
in which it fits,  the normal desire is to push it all the way in until it
seats, which is when it leaks like a flood...unfortunately the engine
needs to come out to fix this.

put a new seal in everytime the engine comes out, they are cheap,  ($3-4)
also check to make sure the seal itself is not damaged, I have gotten bad
ones right out of the bag.  and they are easy to tear putting the engine
in and out

good luck
Bob

PS, make sure you put Dexron ATF in the traanny itself and gear oil in the
final drive.
