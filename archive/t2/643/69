That may be true of FLAPS batteries, but we have a club member who
used to work in a battery factory, and he says there are serious
differences between batteries made to industrial standards and
batteries made for lowest cost. He won't use a battery that isn't made
by a reputable maker.

 I second the warranty statement Karl said. I worked at a FLAPS and
the ONLY difference between the top battery and the cheap battery was
the fancy logo sticker (basic battery had a VERY generic label) and
the warranty. The top battery cost would have equalled TWO of the
cheap batteries. 2 batteries for the price of the 1 of the same
batteries + warranty.
