Well, my friend worked in the factory, and he said they would run one
batch and slap one brand sticker on them, and then run another batch,
and slap another brand sticker on those. Not sure how you would go
about getting a list of who the actual manufacturers are.

 Hard to say. But my friend did say that all the batteries out there
  are made by only a handful of battery makers.
  
  
  
  Hello Guys  Sounds like an Urban legend  like there only being 2 tennis
 shoe makers???  I would like to see the proof please.  I have found that
 Interstate batteries have lasted and had less problems than the cheapos.  I
 also really like the Optima dry cells which I'm using in my 59 panel and my
 64 356C porsche   later and have fun  Mark dearing
