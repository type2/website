Chris,

Let me know what you find out about the price of rechroming....

I called some places within 150 miles of me and they all wanted $300 
*per* bumper to rechrome...and had a 6 month waiting list...due to EPA I 
suspect.

Let me know what you find out as I still have my originals stashed away
in case it gets cheaper.

Cheers, dave
