IBTD.  All Euro Buses since they've had turnblinkers at all
have amber rear turnblinkers.  (Front too, except in Italy
where they used to be white even on early model Bays.  
Possibly more such obscure countries ;-) had other front
turnblinkers too, but about Italy I know for a fact.)

Read rear turnblinkers on late model Bays were not original
anywhere in the world, AFAIK.  Certainly nowhere in Europe
nor North America.
 
Airhowlingly yours,
