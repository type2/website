That sucks. I'd hate to be the guy with a below average one.

I just put in an Optima 34R (34 with reversed terminal for european cars).
The warranty is 36 months full replacement and 72 prorated.

I did it for a couple of reasons:

- after my double battery tray repair over a year ago I found some acid
damage (nipped it in the bud).

- my motorcycle battery leaked on my swingarm and stained it so I bought a
Yuasa AGM battery (slower discharge rate and no spills).

I've had it with wet batteries. I hate them.

I bought the Optima 34R from Sears (#27933). They were having a sale and
wrote up a price reservation because they had to wait for stock to come in.
Every week it didn't come in they tried to get me to switch batteries and
eventually they put in special order. I doubt you'll get the dufus that
served me so ask them to special order it from the beginning.

I've looked online for sales many times but they always seem to be $99 + $25
shipping which was more than the Sears price and there's no guarantee you
won't get a dud or a factory blem. Costs was inexpensive but they didn9t
have the group I wanted.

Some of you in other parts of the country may laugh that it's a balmy 43F
overnight here but this battery and the FI make for instant starts. Amazing.

It fits perfectly. A little taller than the average battery but length and
width are familiar:
