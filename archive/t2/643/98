Who built the motor and what was the deck hight 
set at? It definitly sounds like too much pressure.

phil rebuilt the motor for me....

he is a top motor builder i believe butttttttt he would have to answer the question of deck height that i dont know myself...

since rebuild there has been a slight oil slick on the fan belt and some laying in the fan rim its self...?

i thought it was coming from the oil filler cap for the longest and decided to start hunting down the problem..

in the middle of that hunting i have put duals on and took duals offf and am back with a weber again...(nethier to do with the oil problem)

i have in hunting(oil slick) replaced the crankshaft seal....,dipstick boot, and the oil filler neck cap once again has been fixed...

now that all that has been done all of a sudden there is a great great amount of oil that i am dealing with coming from the dipstick area and  i can see a even flow of oil running down under the metal part of the dipstick where it slides into the metal tube...?

the bus gives me problems lately with power also...

doesnt seem like all the umph is there that should be,,>?

i thought for awhile that i was imagining it but i dont think so the more and worse it seems to get..

soooooooo my question now is how do i fix it..?

if it is a ring i know its time to take the head off and just a guess its coming from the right side...? i keep finding a bit of oil down on the bottom of the manifold on right side even when duals were on there... some laying there..?

would a compression test show results of this..?

i got to get this fixed...?

she is my daily driver..and all i got....

besides my wifes beetle and well like i said my wifes beetle.... she needs it as well...

i may have to go get the loaner engine and install it from a friends house and tear mine apart and see whats up here...

phil when you see this holler back,....

my nerves are getting itchy...(grins)

peace and love

chris
