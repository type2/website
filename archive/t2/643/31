Subject: pimp my ride

i'm sure many of you are familiar with the MTV show 'Pimp My Ride'.

well, next sunday night (i think) they are doing a splitty.

of course if you can stand getting by all the MTV-hip-hop-in-your-
face-dont-make-me-think-television-hoopla it
could actually be somewhat interesting.

of course, what these guys are gonna say about the motor.

wonder if they'll slap in a GEX replacement? ;-)

of course i'm sure it will get lowered too. (yuck)

have fun,
