Subject: Re: 1978 Double cab pickup for sale

I found a 1978 double cab pickup here  in the Omaha,
NE.  It is owned by a widow lady her husband bought it
a few years ago before he died.  A fellow Omaha Club
member offered her $5,000 and she said no It needs
work but runs and drives.  It does use oil and is
bright orange. If anyone would like her Phone # P-mail
 me.
