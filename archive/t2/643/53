will air on Sunday. I only saw it for a split second, but they had the interior 
stripped. Usually they put on some crazy color, and some ridiculous wheels 
that I'd never be caught dead with, but it might be fun to watch anyhow.


So, MTV on Sunday. Check your local listings...

Pimp My Ride is to automotive engineering as
Military music is to music... ;-(
