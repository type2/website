  The ceiling in my shop is 12 feet tall and my cross bar lift fits fine (about 3 inchs from the roof). Depending on where and how I 
set the feet I can lift a westy (any year) all the way up. My garage at home I built with 14 feet inside ceilings, I want an extra 
height lift that are now available to get under them better. I prefer the crossbar verses the floor crossover lifts due to the fact 
that the cables etc. on the ground make it a pain to move stuff over it and is in the way if on a creeper under it.
  Also with the extra height I was able to build a loft/mezzinine along one side and the back wall to store stuff, I just with I would 
have built it bigger as it is allready full.
