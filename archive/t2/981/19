I'll second that.  We got our bus _because_ the baby overloaded our bug
and squareback.  The bus made travelling with babies and children a snap.
Need room for a portable crib?  No problem.  Daughters want to take along
another bin full of books and toys?  Toss it in!  Mom needs a quiet and
comfortable place to nurse?  The bus is it!
