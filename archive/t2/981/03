no have only checked while off.  is about 2500ohm if I remember, some
things are running together but it was within spec.

yup done that.

have checked two cyl yesterday,, plan today to go back to start as though
I had just put the engine back in and do the whole start from zeroo drill,
reset valves (these are hyd should have very wide latittiude) etc etc etc.

right now the only insult is this engine.

yes , it hasn't even backfired.

yeah it has sort of done that.

no smoke of any color that is easily visible, look real hard with the sun
at the right angle you can see a little black but not much.

bad brain held all 4 injectors open.  changed brain it stopped

good idea, will try that this morning, also plan on removing the coil
resistor block, I have high output coil for the crane ignition, so there
is a resistor block for the coil input but maybe a little more spark might
get it to kick (have pulled the crane off line and am using points)

yeah sounds pretty simple oon paper.

thanks for all the help, just having a sounding board is helpful.
