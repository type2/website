Subject: Using smoke to find vacuum leaks

After the hell I went through looking for vacuum leaks in my 78, I
came up with a concept of making some kind of smoke wand to use for
finding leaks.

Before going too far, I Googled and found this:
http://www.accusense.com/products/FlowMarker.asp

$5k. Ouch.

So I'm thinking... A coffee can, jbweld in a flexible wand, and fill
with water and drop some dry ice in.

Thoughts?
