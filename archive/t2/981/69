Subject: RE: [T2] 78 Westy - oil pump

Greg,

The oil pump is really buried on a type 4 motor. The engine mount sits
directly in front of the pump cover and can only be removed by pulling the
fan shroud. If you take your time and take note on what sequence everything
is removed, it is doable, but not necessarily simple. (Type 1 oil pumps are
a simple matter in comparison)

In all actuality, getting the old oil pump out can be the most difficult
part of the job (depending on how much gasket sealer has been used).
Rent/Borrow/Buy a good quality oil pump puller. Your curses will be
suppressed and your neighbors will thank you.

Good luck!

Hello.  I haven't fully investigated myself yet, but was wondering if anyone
could answer this off the top of their respective heads: can one replace the
oil pump (2.0L) without dropping the engine?
   
  Thanks a lot.
