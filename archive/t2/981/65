To me, the biggest plus in recirculating inside the
tank is keeping any contaminates such as water, in
suspension. When a FI bus dies from a drink of water,
it has to be a pretty large amount of water!-BaH

 extending the modified EFI
 
 It's about an inch away from the inlet, and it also
 gets held in a cup 
 so I'm sure a bunch gets recirculated.  However, the
 rest of the fuel in 
 the tank probably cools it down quite a bit.
 
 Interesting stuff...
