Subject: Re: [T2] bloody mice!!

My Father had the smae problem in his Ford Expedition at one point. He had 2
or 3 mice that would tear up napkins and poop all over the place. He put a
mouse trap in his glove box with a little peanut butter on it and he caught
all 3!

He did of course catch them one at a time, but it still worked.
