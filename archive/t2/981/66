Perhaps.  At least that is the reason I see for the return line to the
tank.  I did the calcs a while back to determine the time that it
takes 250ml of fuel to heat to vaporization temperature when recirculating
through the pump and pressure relief valve and the time came to something
like a few minutes.  Of course, if the fuel is burned off at a greater
rate it will never get to vaporization temperatures.  Moral, keep your
foot in it and you'll never vapor-lock!  :)
