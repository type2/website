I wouldn't get too worried about this one.  It doesn't seem too hard to
fab a fuel outlet fitting with two tubes instead of one.  Make the return
tube stick a couple of inches further into the tank than the outlet to
prevent recirculation of warmed fuel.

Either that, or use a surge tank like that suggested for aftermarket EFI
systems.
