Subject: Suggestion: Remote Starter

I have a remote starter, but it's a pain to crawl under the bus and
attach to the starter. So, what I did was permanently attach a wire
to the selenoid connection on the starter and run that wire through
an existing grommet (starter to battery?). I keep that wire well
insulated so it doesnt short out. Now when I need to use my remote
starter, I just open the engine compartment, connect one lead to
my wire and the other to the positive battery post. No more crawling
under the bus.

Of course the 28 year old rubber grommet crumbled when I looked at
it wrong....gotta replace that.
