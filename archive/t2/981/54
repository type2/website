Subject: Fw: [T2] Accelerating kills the engine

The carb was fine when the tank was full of rust. I've not adjusted the
accel pump  - if it was OK before the cleanout I'm inclined to leave it
alone. Maybe my petrol needs a special rust additive !

I've looked at the inlet through a magnifier and have removed all the crud.
The ball moves so I'm not sure what else there is to go wrong - at least not
this wrong.

Thanks

Phil

I have heard many horror stories about the Brazilian repro carbs.
Folks have gone through several before giving up and putting an old
German one in.

That said, it sounds to me like your accel pump, like Bentley said.
What makes you confident that it's OK and adjusted correctly?
