Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Restoration 

George, or anyone else, if I have a broken perimeter
spring in the seat is there any particular advice about
welding it?  It is, of course, thin and it is spring
steel, so I am emboldened to ask.  I do not have a
spot welder, so it will be MIG or stick if at all.
(This is a flat metal strip around the outside of
the actual springs; hope this makes sense to anyone
who has replaced padding.)

As it is, the broken end has penetrated the seat and
I'm on a pillow to get above it.
