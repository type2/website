Subject: Re: [T2] Mice....etc.

I've had mice in my bus before too. I put a bag of cookies on the top of
the sun visor so they wouldn't get them.....and they ate through the
headliner! On one bus I bought, that had sat a long time, I found one
cylinder half full of dead ANTS!?!? I love my '77 Kombi: no headliner,
no panels....nowhere for them to run to, nowhere to hide! Laters, Timo
