You wouldn't go up the down staircase--right?
Go into the door mark "Women" ?

**Thanks Terry, No, I wouldn't do those things, I'm not stupid. It seems that you missed the text I wrote. I do know why they stamped a flow arrow on the cat. The question was not "why is it stamped on there?" The question was:
   "It appears that the baffle may have been installed onto the cat. backwards, as the flow arrow is pointing towards the triangle flange, which actually should connect to the inlet Y-pipe. Is it OK to assume they installed it backwards and does direction of flow through a cat. make a difference in its function?" Does this clarification help with a suggestion?
  Thanks, Chris
