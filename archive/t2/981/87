The only problem I see with smoke is the engine fan sucking all the
smoke toward it.  If you could put the smoke into the system after
the filter (engine off) under slight pressure, maybe you could see
where it comes out.

Another method I hear talked about in locating vacuum leaks is
to spray carb cleaner at hoses and connections and listen for
the RPMs to change...but that makes me nervous.
