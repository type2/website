It is true,, you can't please all the people,,, lol 

bikes on front..
pro's
easy to get to engine and rear hatch
already have 2 bikes on the rear.. so you need more room
doesn't block the taillights or lic plate
easy to see the bikes are in place.. and you didn't forget to load them 

con's
bugs get on the bikes 


When I carry 2 bikes,, I like the front..
when all of us are [where] together.. 5 bikes on the back was a bugger.
