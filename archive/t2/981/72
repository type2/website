Subject: RE: [T2] Bug Bomb?

Jason,

Welcome to owning a bus in Colorado! You should have seen the old BustedBus
yard. It was a 24 hour wasp farm. I have found nests (both occupied and
abandoned) in every bus I have ever been under.

The only fix is to drive your ride regularly, move your parking location
often and wash the outside and underside of your bus whenever you can. For
some reason by washing my buses, wasps leave them alone. I guess they figure
they are of value if they are clean so setting up house inside is too risky.
:)

I'd avoid the poison.

L8TR,

Jon Stiles

Subject: [T2] Bug Bomb?

I have noticed that I have been finding more and more little bugs crawling
and flying around in my bus here and there. I even found a yellow-jacket
nest (old one) under the chassis this afternoon.

Has anyone actually done a bug bomb to their car after it has been out of
commission for a while?

I cannot imagine that it could be bad for me as long as I air it out well
(after the bomb is done). But I still would like to know if anyone else has
done anything like this before.
