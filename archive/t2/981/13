Subject: Mice in bus

Bernard,

I live way out in the country where people dump their unwanted pets.  We had 
a one-eyed tomcat show up one day.  To his suprise and dismay he took a trip 
to the vet the next day to eliminate his abiltity to procreate.

We feed him, and mice have quit showing up and pooping in my buses.  The 
trick is not to feed him too much : )

Good luck!

Jacques (Now, what to do about those damn gophers)
