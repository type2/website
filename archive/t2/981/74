Subject: F.I. low idling

79 Cali. Westy with 78 Fed. F.I. with cat., no O2 sensor, no electronic ignition.
   
  Problem: starts right up on one turn, idles well for 5 seconds, then idles very low, you can hear each cylinder firing, does this for 10 seconds, then dies.
   
  History: tight short block, brand new stock Mahle pistons and cylinders, leak-free heads, great compression in each cylinder (solid long block), valves set, verified zero vaccum leaks and all functional F.I. components, fuel pressure perfect.
   
  What, then, could be causing no idle?
   
  Ignition? Distributor? new plugs, wires, cap, rotor, points. Stock svda with points in spec. Dizzy does seem a tad loose (up and down) but could this cause no idle?
