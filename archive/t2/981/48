Subject: Accelerating kills the engine

The engine: Reconditioned 1600 with less than 1500 miles on it. 34 Pict-3 
Carb - aftermarket version (Brazilian ?) which isn't very old. Timing has 
been checked and is OK. Vacuum advance is working.

Engine starts fine. With the choke operating it idles nicely and pressing 
the accelerator revs the engine.

When the choke finishes it still idles fine BUT when I press the accelerator 
suddenly the engine burbles and dies. If I gently press it the engine 
hiccups a bit but can be persuaded to rev.

I have recently treated the fuel tank for rust. The fuel in the filter is 
clean.

The carb was badly sited up with something the colour of sand (it's not 
sand, just that colour) that has attacked the metal the carb body is made 
from. It gummed up everything too. I've had a couple of goes at cleaning 
things up and all the passages allow carb cleaner to be squirted through.

The inlet to the accelerator pump was blocked solid. I have cleaned this out 
and the ball at the bottom is moving - if I shake the carb I can hear it 
move.

Adjusting the fuel mix seems to make no difference.

Any suggestions ? Bentley sort of says that it's the accelerator pump but 
I'm confident this is OK.

I don't want to have to buy a new carb but suspect this is what I'm in for 
next as there must be a problem I simply can't see.

Thanks
