Why would warm fuel matter?  The stock EFI tank sent the fuel right back 
to the little cup in the fuel tank that the outlet hooked up to.  I 
think this was pretty smart because if the level got low, then it would 
have fuel that was staying local to the fuel pickup instead of trying to 
pick up fuel sloshing all around...
