Dan,

I have actually had fair luck fixing these with a short piece of steel 
tubing and jb weld if it is the actual spring itself.  I think you 
probably understand the procedure.

I figured that actually welding it would make it weak at that point and it 
was best to just "splint" it....I think I had a short piece of steel brake 
line that worked well...surely it was steel...

I fixed one like this in my champagne edition and as far as I know, it is 
still in good shape!

If it is the spring connection along the perimeter, then your imagination 
is everything!<grin>



Cheers, dave

  (This is a flat metal strip around the outside of
  the actual springs; hope this makes sense to anyone
  who has replaced padding.)
