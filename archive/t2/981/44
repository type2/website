Take your test light and connect it to the negative side of the coil and ground.

Turn the key on.

Does it light up?

A)
If yes:
Look at the points. Are they open?
If yes: Rotate the engine by hand until the points are closed.
Did the light go out?
If no:  You either have dirt/oil on the point faces OR you have too much gap like you set them on the flat,
not on the corner of the lobe or the breaker plate ground wire is broken.

B)
If no:
Are the points closed? If yes, stick a piece of paper between them.
Does it light up?
If no:
Unplug the green condensor wire.
Does it light up?
If yes, your condensor or green wire or points wire is grounded.
