Subject: Valve Adjustment

Ok so first time adjusting the valves myself.  I'm reasonably certain I've
found TDC for cylinder number one.  The distributor rotar points reasonably
close to cylinder 1 and the factory mark found on the crankcase pully lines
with the seam from the engine case.  For cylinder 1 when I wiggle the first
rocker arm from left to right that rocker arm moves.  Although the second
rocker arm does not have any movement.  When I pull the first valve up and
down it has a slight movement.  But the second valve does not have movement.

I'm following the valve adjustment guideline from here that suggests both
valves and rocker arms should have the same movement when TDC is found for
cylinder 1.  I understand the movement suggests the valves are closed.

I'm going to have a second look confirming cylinder 1 TDC.

PS.  When I adjust the crankcase pully to other positions that second rocker
arm for cylinder 1 moves.
