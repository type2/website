Subject: Catalytic converter flow only one way?

79 Cali. Westy with 78 Fed. F.I.
   
  I got a new Bosal Catalytic converter. It has the triangle flange on one side and the coupling on the other side. Generally, the triangle flange goes to the Y-pipe (inlet) and the coupling goes to the muffler (outlet). However, this cat. has an arrow on the outside baffle signifying the flow should go from the coupling side to the triangle flange side, reverse of how it should be.  This makes it impossible to install, without cutting and welding. 
  So:
  1) Can I just assume they just put the outside baffle on backwards and the arrow really should be pointing for flow from flange to coupling? I can just bolt it on.
   2) OR, if they didn't put it on wrong and they really expect you to reverse the fittings for some weird unknown reason, can I just ignore the flow arrow and install it the bolt-on way and have the arrow point backwards? SO, does it matter which way the exhaust is flowing through a cat? Is it one-way only or does it work the same no matter what?  Has anyone had this problem or bought a Cat. like this?
  Thanks, Chris
  P.S. obviously, I'm leaning towards installing it the "easy" way and ignoring the arrow. I've never seen any cat. exhaust system with a coupling on the Y-pipe and a triangle flange on the muffler so I'm really assuming they put the baffle on backwards!
