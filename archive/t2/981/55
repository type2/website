The electric fuel pump pressurizes the fuel and the pressure is later
dropped by passing through the pressure regulator.  Since flow is
involved, work is done on the fuel by the pump, and this work energy has
to go somewhere.  It goes into heat, which warms the gasoline a bit.  If
the fuel bypass is great, most of the electrical energy going to the pump
eventually ends up as heat in the fuel.

If the mass of fuel involved is great, the waste heat is radiated from
the tank and a temperature difference of a few degrees is sufficient to
move the heat back out to the air.

If the mass of fuel is small, the temperature change will be greater, and
there is the possiblity that the fuel will reach its vaporization
temperature.  Fuel vapor isn't pumped well by the high pressure pump and
the engine will run badly.

I'm not sure whether the fuel return inside a FI tank extends a distance
away from the outlet or not.  I suggested extending the modified EFI
return a couple of inches beyond the outlet to allow the use of the stock
filter.  Most of the EFI fuel returned would be recirculated, but the
difference in length would allow some to escape and be replaced with fresh
fuel.
