Subject: mice

I have had mice in my bus.

 

I got out easy.

 

When I had left the van at a dealer, We drove a new car to a holiday.

 

When we returned, we had mouse turds blowing out of the inside fans at the
front of the vehicle, could get them all out.

 

Just dealt with them for a while and cleaned up as needed.

 

I did tear apart the fan casings and turds had bloked a fan, so the fuse
would blow.

 

Cheers,

 

Alan
