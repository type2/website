Subject: RE: [T2] Valve Adjustment

I'm actually replacing the old distributor with a new SVDA BRUCK vacuum
advance from CIP1.  At this point I may be having some difficulty seeding the
new distributor into the case.  I positioned the rubber sleeve protector onto
the new distirubor.  When I position the distributor into the case it appears
to not sit flush.  And when I turn the crankshaft pully the distributor rotor
does not move.  When I have the distributor seeded correctly I'll pickup your
instructions.  Thanks again!
