Chris,

I ran an H-pipe (on another car) for years before I noticed one of the 
cats had the arrow pointing in the wrong direction.  I asked about it at 
a muffler shop and they said it was no big deal and I would never notice 
the difference.  They were right (and I passed emissions with flying 
colors).
