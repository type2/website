Subject: Re: [T2] Using smoke to find vacuum leaks

<<After the hell I went through looking for vacuum leaks in my 78, I
came up with a concept of making some kind of smoke wand to use for
finding leaks.>>

Don,
I'm not sure how you went about locating the vacuum leaks in your Bus,
but there are for sure more accurate & more efficient tools available
than a smoke generator to locate a leak.

A 20 dollar hand held vacuum pump / brake bleeder would be one of them
that comes to mind.
A 2 dollar can of vitamin E would be another.

The Dancing With The Wolves smoke generator theory looks like the long
way around the block to get a simple job done.
