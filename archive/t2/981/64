Subject: Re: [T2] Re: front tire / bike carrier

When I was living in Australia, they had "bull bars" or "roo bars" depending
on what you were likely to hit. They were great, welded up with bars going
around the headlights to allow them clear lighting, and mounted up to the
frame. I would love to see someone fab these for buses. You could hang your
rack on them.
