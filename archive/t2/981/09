Subject: Re: [T2] Catalytic converter flow only one way?

The mfg. stamped that arrow on that converter to tell you the way the
exhaust is supposed to flow into and out of it.

That's the way it should be mounted with the arrow heading towards the
muffler.

You wouldn't go up the down staircase--right?

Go into the door mark "Women" ?
