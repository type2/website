Dang, where do people find these things?

First, if you have all the original bits you are extraordinarily lucky!
You may not want to use them all, but do take lots of pictures and store
them carefully so they can be restored when the time comes!

How long has the bus been idle?  If more than a couple of years you should
do some preliminary work to make sure that the rust demon has been held at
bay.

First thing to do is replace all the rubber lines in the car.  All fuel
lines from tank to engine are critical to replace before you drive the
bus.  Hate to see a low mileage bus go up in flames.  Brake lines are also
suspect.  35 years is a long time to expect a piece of rubber to work.

Since you have all the original tin, I'd use that.  No better tin has been
made.

Compression test the engine to see if it is getting tired.  Also check the
end play to see if it is getting loose.  If things are still good in these
areas there is no reason not to run it.
