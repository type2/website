Let me just start by saying that Carbs SUCK. I had a '74 Thing and boy did I
spend a lot of time tweeking that carb. With that, I know you stated that
you pretty much cleared everything out, but if you did not in fact do a full
rebuild of the carb, I suggest doing so. It is pretty easy to do, and a pipe
cleaner and a twist tie (from a baggie) with the paper taken off work like
magic for those small holes.

Also, you may want to double check the fuel pump. That is if you have not
checked it. It is mechanical and Lord knows how the rubber in these vehicles
goes to shit after a few years. My van was working fine until I put it in
storage, then all the necessary rubber vacuum hoses and boots took a dive on
me. I had to replace alsmost everything.

If cleaning the carb doesn't do it, say because it is too far gone, then you
may have to look at replacement IMHO.
