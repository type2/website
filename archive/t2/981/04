Subject: Re: [T2] bloody mice!!- Try talc!

Ah yes, they block heater ducts, chew fabric, remove insulation for
nests, the urine witin nests rusts your van from the inside- best is to
have NO food in van when stored and scatter smelly fabric softener
sheets everywhere.  Make sure they didn't bore holes in a heat duct
underneath to get in; amazing what they can chew through. I had 'em get
in through rustout in the top of the body beam just under your front
wall, tough to see unless you take off the rock protector in front and
look up- or remove kick panels and look down.  This was due to water
seeping down from under windshield gasket rust, a common problem.  Also,
if door bottom is rusted through, they can get in (a past nest in door
bottom rotten out daughter's 75 bus door).  As mice need a water source,
they gotta come and go from your van;  sprinkle talc all around it to
see if you find the tracks to their entry points. Do not use corn starch
talc!  Don't forget to bar access to the sink trap/drain.vent line, and
we covered the air intake with wide netting when a next was found in the
air cleaner filter!
