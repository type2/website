I guess I am missing something. The series of pictures I am looking at at
the link Richard gave me do not show a special tool for bushing removal,
just that the armature above the pin is raised up and the new bushings are
put on.

From the way this looks, it seems pretty simple. That means to me that there
HAS to be something I am missing.


Also, is this just a hone for cleaning out the tube for the new pin to move
smoothly in?:
