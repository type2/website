Subject: Heading up to the PNW

I will be heading up to Bremerton, WA on Tuesday morning (6/19) for a week
to do some work. Any suggestions on places I need to see, people I should
meet and places to shop (all VW related of course)? I have already been to
Washington enough to see all the usual tourist crap. I am just looking for
anything I have not looked for in the past that may be of interest.

That is of course aside from all the great deals out there on CL.
