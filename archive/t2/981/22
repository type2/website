I think that you have diagnosed the problem.  The valve is not seating for
some reason.  Might be a tight stem, bent valve, poor valve grinding job,
poor lapping job, etc.  Unfortunately, the only way to tell is to pull the
head and look.  Pour 95% isopropyl alcohol into the combustion chamber
in the head and see where it leaks.
