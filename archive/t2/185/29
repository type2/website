VW "PEACE, LOVE, AND VOLKSWAGEN" CONTEST

The 1960s. Peace and love, Woodstock and the Grateful Dead, and road trips
in a Volkswagen. The spirit continues at the first annual Bonnaroo Music
Festival with the "Peace, Love, and Volkswagen" contest. Bonnaroo attendees
are encouraged to bring a snapshot of any Volkswagen, whether it is rusted,
busted, new, or tattooed, to the VW tent for a chance to win VIP seating. We
are also accepting hand made pictures. Throw in a little creativity, and
make us your VW. Hand made pictures will be judged on originality and photo
submissions will be randomly selected, with multiple winners from both
categories selected daily. The winners and a guest will get to spend the
evening in the VIP seating area. All submissions must be taken to the VW
tent by 12 Noon on Saturday, June 22nd. Find out the results in the VW tent.

I will be in attendance with a few others of the Moonie Tribe.  If you would
like to get in touch with us.  Email me and I will give you contact details.
