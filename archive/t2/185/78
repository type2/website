Not case. Bearings. ( My best guess from here :)
This engine needs to be disassembled for cleaning
and bearing replacement. AKA "rebuild".( Sorry :).
Too much grit in the oil circuit for too long.
Improper oil changes, no maintenance history.
Want a peak? Pull one piston and remove a rod
thru the hole.Don't drop the bearing shells inside,
or chase them with a  magnet if you do.
