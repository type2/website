Subject: Parts needed for a Brosol-Solex 30-31 carb

I wonder if anyone on the list may have the 3 parts I need for my Brosol
30mm carb.
1) 1 or 2 new accel pump diaphragms- the good red rubber type(these are the
same ones used on German Solex)
2) the little black plastic bushing that goes into the throttle plate shaft
and holds the accel pump rod centred
3) The little black clip that holds the 2 parts aforementioned together.

Any replies appreciated.
