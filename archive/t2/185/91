Subject: 79 Turn Signal Problem

Hi Volks,

I was out and about this evening and in the middle of a lane change when the
turn signals started acting up. For a few seconds they were clicking too
fast, then nothing; then the battery light came on.

When I pulled over and had a look, I had two blown fuses. Replaced them
both, and still nothing, although replacing one of them did get rid of the
battery light. I figured it was most likely the flasher unit so I drove out
to Collison Corner's place and tested my flasher unit in his bus; it worked
fine. (Drat!)

All bulbs are operating properly, so that ain't it. I also swapped the
emergency flasher switch with a known-good unit. Also checked the
turn-signal switch connections inside the steering column.

Anyone have any ideas where to look next, or am I doomed to re-rehearse my
dreaded "under the dashboard yoga" tomorrow night??? I need to have working
turn signals ASAP so I can make it to "Buses By the Falls" this Friday.

Thanks,

Happy trails,
