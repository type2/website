Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Awkward Gears on a 1976 T2



I have a '79 tranny in my 70, and have the same problem.  I don't think it 
is the bushings, since I replaced mine recently and this didn't solve the 
problem.  1st and 2nd are a real pain, 3rd and 4th are smooth as silk.  I 
think it might be the selector forks in the nosecone, but I'm not sure.  
Anyone know much about troubleshooting the 091?
