Whoa, stop. If you have power at BOTH terminals, that means the points are
open. Leave the test light on the negative side, that is the one with the
green lead going to the dizzy, and rotate the engine with a wrench on the alt.
pulley nut. Watch the test light. Every time the points close, the light
should go out. If it does NOT go out, you have a problem with the points.
Either they are not closing and touching or you have grease/oil on the face of
them.
The light HAS to go out for the secondary circuit of the coil to collapse and
send out a spark when they open again.
