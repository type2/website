Subject: Re: [T2] Horns As Usual

No tank - the compressor is the same size as a Coke can.

The horns themselves are the same size as electric horns and can mount 
under the bumper just like electric horns.

Plenty of room.

I have not actually mounted them but verified that there is plenty of room 
for everything.
