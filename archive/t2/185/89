Subject: FREE bus in NC

Hello all ,
 I have my old 70 bus for free!!! it is wrecked on the passenger door side
and just a rolling shell with back hatch. It has solid rockers and solid
sliding door runner has solid drivers dogleg, solid lower nose good front
beam. good drums.
this bus would make a great donor it was very solid. I need it out of my
yard ASAP.  It is located in Concord NC , just northeast of Charlotte.
Anyone can have it , If no one want it or makes arrangements by this weekend
or I will have it scrapped. I hate to do it but I cant have it here anymore.
 I cant cut any metal off or ship any parts , I just don't have time.
 Thanks ,
 Bryan
