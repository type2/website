I didn't up grade engine, but I did yank all my heater stuff since it was
mostly rust anyway....have a BN-4 under the front of the bus, where the AC
condenser used to live...drew intake air from holes and ducts behind the
dash, used A/C fan for air movement, ducted output into the regular heat
duct at front axle....I ski and have driven with light windbreaker and
window cracked in 30mph winds and Gusting 0 degree F on my way to
Killington,  yeah it works...hardest part is adjusting the heat, mostly it
is OFF or ON...works better when bitter cold than when there is just a
chill in the air.
