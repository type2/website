Subject: Re: [T2] Horns As Usual

Hella makes some air horns using this setup, the only thing I've heard
negative about them is since there's no air tank, there is a slight delay
between when you hit the button and when the horn actually sounds because
the compressor doesn't activate until you hit the button.

I suppose you could wire the compressor to be on all the time the ignition
is on but I don't know if that's recommended for compressor longevity.

Still would be neat to have air horns :-)

I might like the dual-tone horns from a Karmann Ghia.
