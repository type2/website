Subject: Window Rubber

Hello,
   I am replacing the rear window rubber on my 77
westy.  I have taken the window out and all, but do
you have to put some sort of sealant where the glass
fits into the rubber.  I replaced it because it leaked
and rust was forming due to the sealant where I
patched it up to the body, which I shouldn't have
done, but...  Also, does anyone know where I can find
good window scrapers for the 2 front windows.  I
bought them from the bus depot and they didn't fit. 
Thanks a lot.
