Chuck,

This guy introduced himself on the Megasquirt DIY FI list.

He has the most extensive stuff I've ever seen on the FI system
on his 914....looks to be djet though....

Instead of screwing with the Bosch(proprietary) ECU, why not consider=20
the Megasquirt($110).
The code is available on the site for the ECU and it looks to be
almost infinitely tuneable and adjustable.
I have been waiting for about 3 months for the group buy and will
switch my 78 2.0l over to it asap.

Find it here.   http://www.bgsoflex.com/megasquirt.html

BTW the new group buy just opened up!

Cheers, dave
