   By move, I mean in and out- no rotational movement.  If the pin is
oval, do you mean from rotational forces (should see rotational play) or
"thrust forces" along the axis of the crank (in out play as you
wind/unwind the crank by changing direction of movement).  My engine
knowledge of beetle days is that you don't want rotational movement and
thus egging out the case hole the bearing sits in. 
Since I have an extra running engine (at it's pull), a good spare case
and 2 core cases, I'm playing an experiment to see what will fail first
on this engine, or pull it when it's compression goes under 90 or a cyl.
compr goes, or an "expensive noise" appears or it dumps oil beyond the
qt per 300 miles now (mostly cold oil pressure or seal blowby).  John
Kleckner thinks it still sounds good except for slight exhaust leak.
I've only seen accounts of valves failing, but am curious (and will ask
the list) what else has ever failed- ie rod bearings is all I've heard
about.
