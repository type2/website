Replacing worn lifters means there is concern for the cam.
Cam replacement will require the case to be open.

Type 4 bottom ends are very sturdy. If the oil pressure/ temp
is very good, my bet is the rods are safe for a while.
It is (sometimes) appropriate to do a top-end rebuild on a type 4
Of course, a brand new engine is also an excellent idea.
