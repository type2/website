According to VW's chart the SAE 30 is almost equivalent to the 20W50.  
The heat prob is suspect is not related to your oil but rather something 
preventing proper cooling.  What have temps been i AZ?  If your ambient 
temp is already high and you are carrying a load you might be at max and 
have to take cool down breaks.
