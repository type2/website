Subject: still no spark......



hey list,,


   Well i have tried everything everyone has said to try and get spark out 
of my coil.  I still don't.  I have power at both the pos and neg screws on 
the coil, but never out of the main wire.  I even put a test light down in 
there to make sure the wire wasn't bad.  Please if anyone could help... i 
really wanted to drive my bus to bonnaroo on thursday but it looks like i 
will be in regular car :(

Just some stuff to add: I have changed the coil, checked the points, changed 
the condensor, changed the voltage regulator, checked all of the fuses and 
other misc tests....

Another question is if anyone knows what the #15 fuse is, i was reading 
through a vw book and it refereed to fuse 15 and i only count 12 fuses in my 
fusebox?

thanks everyone
