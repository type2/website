I'd have to wonder why the oil temps are so high all of the sudden. I have 
run 15W-50 Mobil 1 in mine for sometime and in all weathers and all is well.

I would be questioning if the engine is indeed making more heat, or the 
cooling (air or oil) system isn't removing the heat effectively.

It may be as simple as a dirty cooler or timing which has changed.
