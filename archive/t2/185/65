Speaking of front wheel bearings:

Does anyone know of a source for the OEM VW, amber-colored wheel bearing 
grease?  That stuff is downright amazing.  It seems to hold-up as well if 
not better than the Valvo synthetic that I'm using right now.  BTW, I agree 
about carrying a spare set while traveling.  I would just add that if you 
pack them beforehand and wrap 'em tightly in plastic-wrap, they'll be ready 
for install when you need them.  :^)
