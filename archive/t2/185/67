Subject: Re: [T2] Parts needed for a Brosol-Solex 30-31 carb


There's another part(or parts) that I would love to find a source for:the 
genuine Solex rebuild kit.  The quality of material and fit is MUCH better 
IMHO than the cookie-cutter FLAPS-marketed kits.  Is there anyone out there 
who has access to these or a similar-quality kit?  (Hello Ron!)  As for the 
parts you're looking for, if RMMW is still breathing, they should have 
them(?).  I have an older catalog, but I recall them having a decent 
selection of carb parts.
