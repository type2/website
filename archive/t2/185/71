Subject: RE: [T2] Parts needed for a Brosol-Solex 30-31 carb

reply:

   Getting Borosol Solex parts us near impossible as nobody imports them
that I have ever heard of. I've been happy about just getting a wide
assortment of main and idle jets, now if they will only cut loose with air
correction! Parts off a German Solex generally will fit but no promises. I
haven't seen a GERMAN Solex kit in at least 15 years. Even the ones I have
gotten from Germany were just repackaged Mexican kits. Royze used to make
the best kits but they also are now just using Mexican or Brazilian parts.
The best kits I have found are the OE Mexican kits. The ones I have had from
Brazil have all had shaky needle and seats and have a tendency to stick wide
open. 
   Good luck on the quest for Borosol parts. Your best bet would be to rob
the parts you need off a used one or just replace it with a new one if it is
more then a couple years old with a lot of miles on it.
