Subject: Front Axle beam swap `73 into a `71???

Hello, I have searched the libraray and archives reading up on
this...and do not have a 100% clear answer to this specific question.  

Here it is, recently was given back a `71 westy hard top I owned 12
years  ago!  Guy was cleaning house and no longer needed the bus! 
Anyhow....she is back I am getting her back on the road...she was taken
off as the front beam was rusting badly.  

Now I have a super duper clean and excellent working `73 bus beam...I
have searched the archives and am find folks that say `71-`79 is
same...others save `73-79 and others yet `72-`79!  So before I starting
imobilizing these 2 buses I wanna know a definte yes or no if I can can
completely remove my `71s beam and relace it with a complete `73 beam
disc to disc...bolt it all up and she will work?  Yes both buses are
disc brakes with power servos.

Have done beam swaps dozens of times on split buses so this is no prob,
just wanna make sure compatibility concern is answered before I do it

Thanks folks!!
