since I have FI, I have two fuel lines and I have banded one ball valve to
the frame rails one each side as close to the fuel tank as I could get
without major surgery,   debating how to put a choke cable on the fuel
pump side ball valve so I could cut it off by pulling the lever in the
cab.

that's what I did several years ago, great when changing filter and
pulling engine,  have changed a filter with a full tank of gas and only
lost the gas in the filter itself
