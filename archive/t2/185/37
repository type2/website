To be redundant, i earlier stated that " replacing lifters
is tricky business, you may need a cam ".
This means that you may find the cam needs replacing.
This requires the case to be open.
Replacing only the lifters is not always the best answer.


I don't assume the rods to be anything, you verify
the bottom through deductiove reasoning. If there is
excellent oil pressure and the case has not been
overheated or abused and has a history of proper
maintenance and if you believe your diagnosis
warrants top-end rebuild, and you trust your own
judgement,go for it.
It's not always necessary to buy a new engine
when confronted with a minor repair.
Where do YOU draw the line ?!
