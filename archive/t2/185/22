Yeah- I thought of driving to HCBF and seeing if it will do the trip- it
just made it to Everybus, where I found out that driving religiously at
50-55 mph shot the milage from 18 to 22-24!  I'm a bicycle rider- as you
increase your speed, the effort required to go faster is not linear, but
increases due to wind resistance- ie, to go from 15mph to 30mph is
triple the effort, not double!

 Oh, it's an EXPERIMENT. ( Nevermind :).
