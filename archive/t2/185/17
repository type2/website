Mike- your previous post described movement of the main bearing in
the "wind-up " direction, which is rotational. There should be none.
The main bearings are held with .001" squeeze. If not ,then the crank whips,
and causes what you refer to as "egging out the case ".
If the shim pack is too tight on the main,but there is still movement,
then the #1 main is loose in the axial direction, the thrust cut is axial.
What is happening ? The main is loose in both directions, and the
dowel pin is making an oval in the bearing ( and eventually the case )
and needs to have the squeeze fit repaired by align-bore ( cut the case to
a larger dimension and install an oversize bearing to fit. The thrust cut
is axial, and there is another bearing for that. ( If you include bearings
for crank grinding, you will soon see how many permutations and
combinations of bearings there can be for all the possibilities.)

You are losing oil pressure right there, and due to have the crank sieze.
Loss of oil pressure at the mains is starving the rods. My bet is for the rod to
fail.
236,000 miles and a quart every 300 miles ? Let's have a poll on Friday
to guess the miles left in your engine. Time to drain the Duralube and redline
it.

Oh, it's an EXPERIMENT. ( Nevermind :).
