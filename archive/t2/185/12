They make a tool that uses a whack on the head to twist a screwdriver tip.

This will translate a very firm seating of the screwdriver to to a very 
sudden twisting force at the very same time.

I have had alot of success with this tool. Harbor Freight and Northern 
Tools and many, many others have this tool. Many FLAPS and Sears should 
have it too.

The other recommendation would be to get a very large Phillips screwdriver 
as many of the smaller varieties I have used have a tip that is too pointed 
and the rest of it isn't big enough in diameter. This is my typical tool 
and it works 99% of the time.

The foil is common to find when the oil changes are done by folks in a big 
rush - sloppy.

The fuel injector is not related to your low compression.

Did you squirt a bit of oil in the questionable cylinder and redo your 
compression test?

You narrow done the problem this way. I have also heard of injecting air in 
to the cylinder from an air compressor and listening for leaks. It can tell 
you what is leaking - intake or exhaust or both.

Take off the oil cap to listen for piston and ring leaks.
