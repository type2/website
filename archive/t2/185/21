Hiya Adam,

Yeah!  I'd like to know where you found a new one too!

I had to do this little chore on my Bus last year. Really had to scrounge the 
boneyards to find one of those little buggers in good shape.

I got mine in by doing the following.  I had a friend below hold the stop and 
position it so that the "prongs" were started in the holes.  Oh, by the way, 
just prior to this we had sprayed the prongs with Tri-Flow, a lubricant.  
Anyway he pushed up on the stop and from above I grabbed the tip of the prong 
with a pair of needle nose pliers and pulled.  Gotta be careful not to break 
the rubber at this point - take it nice and easy.  Do a little gentle side to 
side circular kinda motions and it will pop up and into place.  It is a tight 
fit though!
