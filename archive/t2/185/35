There was nothing to graft to. the  doors as well as the dog legs got bent
up and to get  an accurate positioning I would have had to replace the
dogleg and cab floor, to replace those I would have had to repair the lower
b-pillar so I could weld to that. to repair the lower b-pillar I would have
had to replace the rocker and bulkhead sheetmetal  ,  so I could weld to
that, then I could weld the doglegs on then the new nose. All the metal with
the exception of the 2 front to rear beams was crushed and pushed into the
pedals and steering column.   I tried to fix it but it was way bad. a lot
worse than it looks.
