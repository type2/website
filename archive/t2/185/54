Running straight 30 wt oil is certainly acceptable - it meets the viscosity
specifications for that year's vehicles for warm climates - and won't do any
harm.  I'm not aware, however, that different weights dino oil have
significant differences in engine cooling.  In these air-cooled engines the
most significant heat damage generally shows up in the cylinders and heads.
A straight-weight oil might give you a little more "cushion" when it comes
to oil thinning, but it's not going to save the engine from destruction.

Either fix your heat problem or slow down.
