Subject: Winshield repair

I'm almost ready to get my bus painted and I've started to gets quotes.  I
can find someone who knows how to paint and repair busses properly but I
need to understand the techniques so I don't get burned on the quote.

I've got four body repair problems:

* both battery trays have large holes

  Going to ask to weld in two new pieces

* rusty hole forming at right of rear valence due to hit pre-1980.  This was
hidden by the bumper and I didn't notice it until I took the bumper off the
remove the engine.

  Not sure how best to get them to repair this.  Advice?

* some bozo key'd the whole left side in 1995 and left serious idents in the
body pretty good.

  Easy for them to figure out...

* The point of this email and worst of all, three bubbles under the
windshield are getting large and rusty and one I can start to see through
one from the inside.

What is the best way to repair this?  One guy said he was going to take a
piece of metal and bend it the same and weld it in.  Wouldn't it be easier
and cheaper to buy a replacement panel and cut out the piece that's
required?

BusDepot sells item 95 56 201 which looks like a Veng number but I can't see
it in the Veng catalogue.  This piece would seem to be the way to go but I
don't know what it looks like.  Does it include the lip that the window
rubber connects rides on?
