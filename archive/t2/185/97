I've had that happen on an old type 1 that had the stock vw pulley on 
it.  Have seen others with the problem also.  Basically the pulley works 
loose and then gets forced into the alternator front.  I have only seen 
this happen on two piece pulleys of the original vw type..  The alt 
front is rather soft metal so it chews up real quick.  You will need a 
new alternator and a new pulley as well.
