One thing that happens is the thrust bearing wears as
the engines gets older.  You claim you saw the thrust
bearing move, but you did not say in which direction. 
If it rotates, that is plain bad and you will be in
serious trouble in the near future.  If it moves back
and forth as you check the endplay, it indicates that
either the "thrust" walls of the bearing or the case
are wearing.  In this scenario, adjusting the endplay
only adjusts the play between the crank/flywheel and
the bearing.  But the bearing still moves.  While this
is not a good scenario, it is better than rotation.  

There is a mid-term solution to this problem.  Have
someone push on the crank pulley, and using a large
punch, punch the bearing thrust walls against the
case, all the way around the bearing.  Like I said,
this is not a long term solution, but if your engine
is healthy otherwise, it will keep you going.
