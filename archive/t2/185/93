Subject: no spark continued



i took the advice to put a test light on the sid of the coil that runs to 
the distributor and turning over the engine.  The light never went off like 
it was supposed to.  I didn't turn the engine over by hand i had a friend 
turn the key.  so does this mean the points are bad?  thanks
