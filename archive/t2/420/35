I have also looked into this several times, not because I have dual
batteries (I do) but because if I'm in bad weather at night the
combination of gas heater/lights/wipers exceeds my alt output and I can
run for maybe a half hour then something has to get shut down while the
batteries are recharged (usually the heater, there goes the defroster)

rather than put the alt in the same place as the current one I was
considering putting it above the engine set up like the air pump on some
engines using a similar pully arangement...it shouldn't need additional
cooling since it would be in the intake air flow.
