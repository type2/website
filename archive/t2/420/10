Subject: CHT wiring

>So, here's the scoop on this...eight feet of wire "might" make a
difference
on readings from your CHT, but remember, the idea is to have information
from
a gauge from which to make a decision about what you are doing...it's not
needed to decided how much fuel to use to land on the moon.

Don't rewire your CHT location...it won't matter. The extra lenght might
produce a bit more resistance but not enough to matter.<

Actually Gill in this case it will matter. The CHT gauge is not liek the
oil pressure and temp gauges that use 12volts. The sender on the CHT
actuaaly produces the reading from the heat. One of our NASA types on
thelist can explain it better bit if you lengthen the wire you will not get
accurate readings on this gauge, like I said it does not require 12 volts
to operate like the other VDO units do.

P.S. I agree 100% with the rest of your post about anality on the list...
