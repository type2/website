If you have the color code you'll know. These colors below are not exact because of the usual color space incompatibility between uncalibrated scanners, printers, monitors etc:

The closest approximation of the color will probably be found in an old Glasurit color chip samples book at the local auto paint shop (if they even have one). Even so, I matched up my color to the interior of my bus where I didn't think must sunlight had gone and it wasn't as close as I hoped for:

Taking the picture of both the paint and the sample in the same exposure with the camera kind of cancelled out the color space incompatibilities. The flash didn't go off but the surfaces are going to reflect light slightly differently. Anyway, you get close but you can't really use it to select the perfect paint from five shades of the same color.
