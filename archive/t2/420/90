Ok i had a friend of mine drop some stickers off to me today...
these are 36 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide...
they are made of vinyl lettering....
 
they say
Vw www.FullMoonBusClub.Com Vw
 
something like that but they look alot better than that....
 
these are going for 17 bucks a piece right now...
they are limited for the momment but maybe have more later for anyone interested...?
 
The proceeds will go to Full Moon Bus Club........
I have yellow,Red,And Blue........

I am going to try to be at HCBF this year......... if not sold out by then i will have some then.....
 
I am going to also try to have some more stickers and things also..
I will try to get some pics up of these later tomorrow when i am off from work...
.....
Let me know,.,.,.....
they are really nice....
i am installing a yellow on the front windshield of my bus tonight and then a red more than likely on the back of the bus,.,.,.\
