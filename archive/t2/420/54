Subject: Distributor Grease

Hi Volks,

I just realized that when I swapped in my new dual vacuum / dual advance
distributor I forgot to put a thin coat of grease on the distributor shaft.
A quick search for my Bosch ignition grease turned up nothing but a bunch of
questions.
Would it be acceptable to use a bit of CV grease in place of the normal
ignition grease from the little tube, or am I better off to hold off for the
real deal?
