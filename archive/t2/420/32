Hi all,

If you have an extra harness and and ECU it should be pretty straight 
forward to fab a break out box.

With the break out box you could characterize each line/pin ( voltage, scope 
picture, resistance and even current) for a healthy engine, as a function of 
warm-up, RPM and CO.

I have the extra ECU, harness, scope, VTM, digital camera and CO tester. I 
also have a very good running 77 bus to use as a test bed.

Unfortunately I also have a Karmann Ghia sitting in the garage waiting for 
paint and many home projects my wife has waited years for me to do. Also I 
have let my self get caught up in restoring old Olympus OM SLR cameras.

Too many irons in the fire. Maybe next year.

Chuck
