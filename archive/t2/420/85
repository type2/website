Subject: Single Webber on a 1800

volks,
i have a '74 westy w/ a 1800 (no FI) that has been converted from dual
solex's to a single webber. i am in the middle of a rebuild and am curious
as to how functional it will be when im done. firstly, i cannot identify
what kind of webber i have (my serial doesn't help much). secondly, i
still am not done rebuilding it but am curious if running a single carb is
a bad idea. any advice regarding a single webber on an 1800 would be
appreciated.
'74 westy in or
