Sigh.  Your premise is incorrect. 

The alternator in a 72-79 VW bus is NOT in the engine compartment.

The alternator in a 72-79 VW bus is in a small space that is more-or-less between the fan housing, cylinder head and exhaust manifold.  It is separated from the engine compartment by  several pieces of cooling tin.  The purpose of "cooling tin" is to keep hot air on one side and cool air on the other.  Guess which side the alternator is on?  Yes, the hot side.  With the exception of the air coming through the cooling duct, there is no significant air circulation in this space!  No offense Todd, but I don't think you have thought this through very well.
