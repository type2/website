I must have missed the post where you described that - and I was reading pretty closely.  

So rather than replacing the stock alternator, now you're talking about adding an *additional* alternator inside the engine compartment?  That has a whole 'nuther set of complications - primarily, how to drive it.  But I still think it is unnecessary for 99.9% of bus owners.
