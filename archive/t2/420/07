Well... I saw a Beetle that was painted "tie dyed"..... they literally
threw different colors of paint into a swimming pool,, then lowered the
car into the pool.... Upside down!

All the seams were pretty water tight , there was a few spots that the
paint seeped into the interior, under the hood, etc.

Now,, all the runs go UP.... naturally , they hand sanded it smooth, then
clear coated it.   Oh,, and used a razor to clean the windows,, before
reinstalling with new rubbers.

So,, got a neighbor with a pool?  On vacation?   Can you borrow a crane? 
I'm not saying you SHOULD ,, but I wouldn't do it in my OWN pool! LOL

The car paint actually looked GREAT,, I didn't like the look,,

It is Different!
