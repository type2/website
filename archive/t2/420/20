Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot prices to HIGH ! I Found parts way cheaper

Hello Guys  You know that comparing prices sometimesd gets very old. People 
will compare crap to something good and still complain certainly when the crap 
fails.Also as we all know VW owners are famous for being cheap(Myself 
included) But when you have all this internet shopping it just seems that people don't 
want the owners of businesses to make anything at all for their troubles. 
Well thats fine and dandy but here is what I do. 1st no warrentys, 2nd labor rate 
just went up from 50 per hour to 75 per hour, 3rd if I take it apart and the 
part is wrong or doesn't work and I have to put it back it is the same price 
as doing the job, 4th if it is wrong and it is down on the lift it is $50.00 
per hour sitting onthe lift till the right part shows up.  So go buy your 
junk(Pertronix, J C Whipme, Taiwianize crap ) and bring it on . Now that thats off 
my chest another thing that brothers me people who don't sigh their names, 
whats that about , are we supose to know everybody e mail name??? or they scared?? 
of what??   so mr or mrs. brnagn7  sigh your name it makes things more 
personal . Sorry to sound like Robert D Readford  on john boy and billy but so be it 
  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
