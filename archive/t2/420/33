volks,

since we are on the subject of vendor quality/price/reputation...  have
any listees heard of west coast machine company located in lancaster, ca.
granted they do not have the variety that other vendors have, but they
have some pretty amazing prices and claim to ship all quality european
repro's. they also charge dirt cheap shipping.
