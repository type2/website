Subject: Got to go Single Weber, only option for now...

Hey guys, after a small trip to "Maine"  Beach's, the EVIL Solex's came 
back to haunt me again, yes i was still using those %?&"$?%&$* carbs 
even after all the problems i had on my Mexico trip,
http://www.eurokitplane.com/intro.htm
don't ask me why...

After i rebuilt the top end i had to put back the Solex for testing (my 
FI conversion was not ready and i was scared of the single weber) and 
they worked fine for a few week, but now they developped another problem 
... flooding at night!!! with some heavy "backfife", puffing, hesitation 
and scary noise in the morning, It's fine after the engine as warmed up 
and i somewhat drove it a bit to get rid of the fuel...
Anyway, lets me explain why i have to use the Weber for now:

My girlfriend (who also owned the Bus!) want to use the Bus for some 
short trip with her friends, and she is no mechanic at all!!!! As the FI 
is not tested and even if it was, it is a complex system, anything can 
go wrong and i don't like to see her go on a newly installed and 
untested FI system...

So even if i know that the weber is not the perfect solution, it is the 
simpliest (mechanical wise) solution for now, we can live with some 
engine hesitation or marginal idle, but at least it will work all the 
time! (I hope)
So for this summer (very short in my case), i will use the Weber! (it's 
brand new!)

To my questions:
The small port / vaccum on this one, is it for the "advance"? (I guess yes!)
Also, can i use my "stock" distributor? (i don't see why not!)
I have many jets (idle) to play with and am ready to do so, any other 
suggestions would be appreciated.

Best regards, Ben
