That sucks.

The first attempt is to try and remove the valve.  Take out your 
cylinder and place it in a vice or a place where you can control it and 
carefully drill out the valve.  If you're successful in not stripping 
the threads congradulate yourself and get a new one.  Now just a note 
here.  These valves are supposed to be covered by rubber dust caps but 
are all to frequently removed and discarded.  Consequently the rust 
 builds up and freezes the soft and fragile bleeder valves.  I have seen 
kits for replacement caps and valves - get this if you can.  Strangley a 
new cylinder rarely comes with a dust cap for a valve.

I did a SB this summer and noted that different cylinders had different 
sizes.  Even when I replaced them they were different.  I think it just 
depends on the maker of the cylinder.
