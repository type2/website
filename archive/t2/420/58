Subject: Head/Tin Question

Ok, I've run into a slight problem with the rebuild of my 2.0. The first
question... are the heads basically the same? Meaning can I put them on
either side of the engine? The reason I ask this is I've put the heads on
the engine and now am trying to put the deflector tin that screws onto the
case and the heads and I can't get the screw holes to align. I figure this
could be either because I have the heads on backwards (but the appear to the
same even if I did switch) or I'm just screwing something up. So did I blow
my 50-50 shot at putting the right head on the right side or do I just have
to try a little harder to align the holes?
