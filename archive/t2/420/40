First of all, you can restore it or lower it, but not both!

Yes.  You can get lowering spindles, or put adjusters into the beam.  The
rear of the bus can be lowered by simply turning the splines.

> 2) If there is, which is the best way?

The least destructive is the lowering spindles.  The original spindles can
be reinstalled easily when you get tired of the wierd handling.

To do it right, a few hundred dollars.

Several vendors participate in the list  I've personally dealt with Ronnie
at oldvolkshome.com and Ron at busdepot.com and found them to be very
helpful.

I've seen some nice spray can jobs.  The brand of
paint is not nearly as important as the preparation of the surface.

If you're worried about money, forget about lowering and put the money
into getting the bus into the best stock shape as you can.  You'll be much
happier that way.
