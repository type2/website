Subject: RE: [T2] Head/Tin Question

>>The only difference between left and right is the temp sensor hole at #3
cylinder. It seems that all
replacement heads are lefts so you can put a left head on the right side.
But the factory right head does not
have the large sensor hole, it is just a tin screw hole.



OK, see that helps, duh I must have put them on right because the temp
sensor hole lined up with the large tin piece that goes on top. Whew! Stupid
me never thought of looking at that. Ok well I guess it's just a little more
work on getting those deflector plates to line up!

Thanks
