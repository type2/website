I just ran across this while surfing. I hope it makes it to the U.S.

Film Release - A vanload of New Zealanders check
out the Lean on the Tower of Pisa, run with the Bulls
in Pamplona, scam lunch at the Carlton in Cannes, drink
to excess and have indiscriminate sex in the campsites
of Europe? How kiwi is that? Sisters, Maggie and Sal
from Levin, and their mate Liz buy a kombi in London,
but they need an extra person to pay the bills. Enter
Scott from Napier, a seasoned traveller with no visible
means of support apart from his sparky enthusiasm. It's
the 21st Century, so of course there's a Reality TV
camera crew along as well, ensuring no substance abuse
or drunken sexcapade, no act of petty treachery or theft,
no melt-down or bust-up goes unobserved. The plot, ribbing
Survivor and Big Brother, is driven by the machinations
of the wannabe alpha Scott, a man rash enough to play
sisters off against each other. The actors, who now
risk being mistaken for the characters they play with
such apparent candour, share the script credit with
director Grant Lahood. Their shaggy, comically anti-romantic
road movie, shot on the run (on Super-16 and Digital
Video and blown up by the Film Commission for 35mm release),
may confirm every mother's nightmares, but it's only
likely to encourage future waves of kombi migration.
Kombi Nation is being released on August 21st 2003.
Currently it is playing exclusively at the Paramount
Theatre in Wellington. Keep an eye on the website
www.kombination.co.nz for more details.
