Subject: Re: [T2] CHT wiring

Actually it could have a big affect on the reading.  what won't have an
affect on the reading though is to use the proper thermocouple wire and to
twist it together and shrink wrap over the twist to give you your extra
length.  any better science shop should have the stuff and your higher end
geek stores also.
