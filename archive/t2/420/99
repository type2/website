Subject: Bus Depot Quality = Good!

I've said it before and I'll say it now.

  I buy it from Bus Depot, it goes it solid and it works!  Often the 
parts replace 1978 originals.  I'm restoring a 25 year old vehicle to 
be a daily driver and a camper.  I don't want junk in my Bus!

Most of us are not in this for bargains, we are in this to keep our 
ancient vehicles running!

As our Moderator said, ca we please retire this thread?  Everytime 
poor Ron see the "Prices to High" header he likely needs a slug of 
Maalox!   This has been discussed to death so we should move on to 
talking about our buses.

Thanks


BEN
