Subject: Re: [T2] CHT wiring

When I put in my CHT last year I had the same problem with the wires not
reaching the guage but falling short just inside the cab. After some
research, including talks with an electrical engineer, I determined that
adding four feet of QUALITY copper wire (I used marine grade) wouldn't make
much difference, if any. I don't have the exact figures in front of me, but
4 feet of wire adds something like .004 ohms of resistance--hardly
significant. Maybe it makes a difference in the readings, but I don't think
so. At least I think that the difference would be so small as to fall into
the error range of the guage.

Just my opinion and worth every penny you paid for it.
