a good way to test the thermocouple/gauge is to clamp the thermocouple to a
heavy block of metal and immerse the whole works in boiling water. water
boils at different temps in different places, but it is not for from 210F.
at any rate this will tell you if the longer wire makes the gauge
inaccurate, if you do this test with and without the wire extension.
