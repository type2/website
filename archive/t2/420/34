Subject: Re: [T2] Painting a Bus

very awesome ... i live about 3 hours from the beach maybe 4 in the bus....
i use to visit there often till i got married and settled down...
even lived there for over a couple of months or so once...

what i might do then is just get the bus painted solid white and take a drive down and spend a week or so after looking this guy up.../

great idea.....
peace!
