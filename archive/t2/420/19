I don't know how close you are to Myrtle Beach...

At "Broadway on the Beach", there's an open-air artist who does the most
amazing things with ordinary spray paint and an odd variety of "tools".
Absolutely fantastic scenes and space scapes, things that you wouldn't even
imagine that you could do with spray paint.  I'm not kidding.

If anyone might have an idea of how to simulate the effect of tie-dying on a
car, it might be him.
