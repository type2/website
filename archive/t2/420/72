Close.  Starters and /generators/ are almost identical.  Both have fixed
magnets with a wire-wrapped armature rotating in the magnetic field.
Generators create DC, starter motors use it.

Alternators are signficantly different...they create AC, which then needs
to be converted to DC for your car to use.  If memory serves they don't
use fixed magnets.   They have a set of wound-wire field coils around the
outside, and a wire-wrapped armature in the middle.  A current is passed
through one of the sets of coils that creates a magnetic field.
Alternators require electric current to get the field started....ever
tried to push-start an alternator powered car with a /completely/ dead
battery?  Doesn't work.


There are some clearer explainations of how alternators and generators
work both in the archives and on the internet at large.
