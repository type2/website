(Flame Suit on).... You are likely to get a number of opinions on this
question Mike. Sort of like the oil temp question. I have yet to get a
definative answer on that  one for a 78' type IV motor...

FWIW:

My 78' Westy runs on the highway (65-70mph) at 350. Occasionally gets to
400 if I am going up a big hill.  This is from the VDO unit using the #1
sparkplug to locate the sender.
