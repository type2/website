chris,

as others have already said, this problem could not possibly be caused by
the heads. i suspect you have one of two things going on. either you are
trying to out the air deflectors on the wrong sides, or maybe you have two
of the same deflector. they are not the same part from left to right - you
can't put the left air deflector on the right head and vice versa. make sure
you have a pair of deflectors that look slightly different and if you do,
then you should be able to make them fit by trying it on the other side.
