Subject: 6-rib transmission swap

I usually pride myself on being able to find my answers by myself by searching
the Internet, but I am at a loss.  (Maybe it is just a Monday.)

I have an 091 6-rib transmission from a 1976 that I want to mate up to a type
1 style motor.  I know I saw somewhere the how to's and option but cannot seem
to find them now.

1.  Can you use the existing bellhousing with the 6-rib?
2.  Do you have to shave length off the input rod?
3.  Does the nose cone need to be swapped out?

Any links to info you could provide would be great.

Thanks
