Subject: [T2] Accordian replacements

I know I saw some posts about this recently, but I will be darned if I can
find them now.
   
  I want to replace my missing accordian tubes, the ones from the
exchangers, someone had posted info about something they used to do this.
can anyone help?
   
  Thanks,
