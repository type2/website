Subject: Saw a Westy for sale

Grup, was driving home from Cw Bay the other day, and lo and behold, there was
a Bay Westy for sale in a yard for 1000.00 Can, (which is approx 1012.00 US),
but my passenger would not allow me  "stop and prod".  If I am allowed out
tonight, will go back and "look" at it, but even the fact it is standing on
it's own recognizance, must be worth 1000.00, anywhere! IT is a "bay" Westy.
