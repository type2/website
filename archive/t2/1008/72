Subject: for List Admin:  that Unmentionable site (was sound deadening)

For the list Admin- I understand not mentioning something seen for sale 
in an auction that no one asked about, but Ebay is much more, used by 
many vendors in EBAY STORE.  Would links to sales be allowed for such if 
relevant to a query for a listed product?
