IIRC, Bugs have the same location for the tanks as Things - right under the
front hood. I WISH we bus folks had it that easy. It used to take me 20
minutes to get the tank out of my '74 Thing to clean it...

I agree with the removal and cleansing. Also, I believe that Ratwell has a
great link on how to clean and coat your tank so that it is good as new.

Good luck!

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
