Subject: RE: [T2] Accordian replacements

Ed,

 

Yup, "s h o u l d" work the same. The metal vents are the same diameter as
'68-'79 accordion tubes so the seals should be the same. The accordion tubes
are constructed in the same manner for all years, so disassembly is the
same. The interior core (original cellulose covered wire screen, replacement
plastic) should measure the same diameter as well (but someone pipe up if
that isn't so).

 

To double check the sizes, drop Airhead or Jim Thompson a line or an email.
I'll update the site as soon as I do a pair of later  '72-'79 ones, coming
next month. Both my Westy and a client's '75 need to be done.

 

I'll let you and the list know when it is updated. Also if you need help
walking through it, pmail me.

 

Cheers,

 

Jon Stiles

Thanks for the reply.  Will they work on a late bus like mine?
