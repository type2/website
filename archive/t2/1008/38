Subject: tightness in steering after front end redo

After new swing lever bushings, ball joints, steering damper, tie rods, 
etc were installed by a mechanic, the bus steers ok but when I lifted 
the front to do brake pad check (squeaks) I noticed that when turning 
the steering wheel, it is VERY tight, and you can see the shaft in the 
bushings of the steering relay goes up and down a bit.  The tightness is 
not just in the center (as in too tight steering box). Is this normal 
(ie, due to ball joints, etc and will it "break in"?
