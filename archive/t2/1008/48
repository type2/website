Subject: Well the engine is on the floor...

The engine (out of my '79 Westy, it's s/n starts with GE) is on the 
floor of my garage. Now what do I do? <VBG>

The PO aid it had valve problems & I agree as it had zero compression in #2.
The VW came along with a 'spare' engine in parts, supposed to be an 
1800. I looked at the heads and one of them looks to have a bad 
intake valve (sits lower into the head and the stem is taller than the others).

This is not my first ac engine VW but it has been a long time. I'm 
using the Idiot's Guide, I ordered a Bentley a week ago last Wed and 
called yesterday, it had still not been processed let alone shipped 
so I canceled the order.

My next step is to get it into the engine stand and start taking 
things off to get to the 'bad' head. (After this coffee)

Specific questions.
I was reading last night and it looks like there is a "right" and a 
"left" heads, is that just because of the temp sender or does it 
'really' matter?
Are there 'bad' push rod tube seals out there?
Is there a specific problem on the heads that I can look for that 
would be a show stopper for me without machining or replacing the 
head? (Besides the valve seat being gone). Maybe a web site to look at?
