Mike asked:


 It looks like it is the Cold Start Valve giving me trouble, to be more
precise the plug. It slips on and off like size 12 shoes on size 8 feet.
Probably used to have a couple of clips to hold it in place but they are
long gone. I pushed it on real snug and she fired right up, but I can't do
that forever, any ideas?
