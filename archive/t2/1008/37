Subject: Disc brake pad brands

After getting new calipers, pads, etc for the front, I've had squeak 
problems which oddly, starts not immediately but after driving for a 
while. The pistons are not binding. I pulled the pads and they are ATE, 
with a lot of visible metal (brass?) in them.  BusDepot sells at least 3 
differet brands (Pagid, ceramic, some kind of metallic and "original 
equip".  Anyone have experiece with Ate and what brand is best (I'd like 
to find pads with least metal in them- In the archives, Tim Stephensd 
mentions metal leads to rotor wear, squeaks and the original pada did 
not last so long but cause no such rotor wear/squeaks?
