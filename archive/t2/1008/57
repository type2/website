 It looks like I'm going to need a budget (used) head for my '79 (GE)
2.0 aircooled engine. My "spare" head has a different exhaust, it
sits farther down 'in' the head and it's oval, won't fit.
Here is a photo of the exhaust (on the head) I have to replace.

I did take a look at what BusDepot had to offer & it's an unknown
amount of time (it's not a stocked item). At least they have some
reference to the AC head on line and they indicate that it's also
used for the AC Vanagon.

I'm going to do some calling tomorrow and see about getting this head
repaired or a used one from somewhere in this area (Olympia or
Seattle to Portland) and thought it was worth asking the list. Maybe
someone has one they can sell?
I'm on as budget so a good used works for me & I won't be paid until
next Friday so I have a bit of time.
P-mail me if you have one.

It frosts me when people refer to the 79 head as the Vanagon head.

2 TOTALLY different part numbers and valve size.

THE 79 head is a one-year-only head.

79 head part numbers:
029-101-371A left and 029-101-371B right

80-83.5 part numbers:
071-101-371A left and 071-101-371B right
