The cold start valve is labeled with an operating temp:

35:C (95:F) and/or it works up to 8s.

What allows the L-Jet engine to start almost instantly even after
sitting for a week is the fuel pressure in the fuel rail remains high
long after you turn off the engine. If you check the fuel pressure
and it drops to nearly zero after you shut off the engine there is
usually a problem with the pressure regulator diaphragm.
