Subject: Re: using ether in air cleaner to start bus

We did this in a 75 bus that did not have hoses to airbox clamped.  It 
backfired and blew the afm flapper in half.  Can't say now if she had it 
floored after I yelled "Try it!"  I feel using starter fluid just proves 
your ignition works, and if it runs a few seconds, proves 
valves/timing/compression is adequate.  Better to check for spark to 
test ignition, verify fuel pressure, and verify injectors get current.
If you must use it, it's safer to squirt it down a hose to the airbox 
AFTER the throttle plate (and don't floor it to start!).

  I spray it in thru the air cleaner, not much it doesn't take much. let
  it mix thourghly with the air, make sure your vacuum hoses are not
  clamped on, they are the safety valve if the engine backfires.
