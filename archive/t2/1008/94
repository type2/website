Glad to hear it Mike. Temporarily, just some electrical tape, then get that
bus-boys harness plug. Pretty sweet replacement item. If you can't get it,
try BustedBus.com. He has some donor harnesses you might be able to splice
in.

It looks like it is the Cold Start Valve giving me trouble, to be more
precise the plug. It slips on and off like size 12 shoes on size 8 feet.
Probably used to have a couple of clips to hold it in place but they are
long gone. I pushed it on real snug and she fired right up, but I can't do
that forever, any ideas?
