Subject: Recommended spark plugs

I fell like an ass even having to ask this, but what would be the best
recommendation on spark plugs I could get at my FLAPS? I know Bosch has been
the shiznit for a long time, but are any of the AC-Delcos worth a crap? I
looked in the Autozone, Pep Boys and Parts America sites to see what they
had, but it wasn't very clear as you can never trust the stock of the store
with what is listed on their website.

I looked in the archive, but the only thing of relevance was a gnarly cat
fight between Doktor Tim and Terry K about platinum tips. It was kind of
hard to get an answer since it seems that the good Doktor was repeatedly
bitch-slapping Terry K. over this post! I was frankly a little shocked...

I would like to get some plugs ASAP as Zoey is in BAD need of some plugs and
wires.

Also FYI, the oil leak I was having WAS is fact because my valve cover
gaskets are shot. The compression tested at 110-105-115-120 so it was
looking good to. My muffler is getting old and is leaking at the header
which is creating the sound that I mistook for the lose of a gasket at the
head.

Lastly, my power issue seemed to be due to the fact that the last time the
timing was set, the meat-stick that did it didn't bother to actually TIGHTEN
up the collar, so the distributor vibrates out of place and the timing was
off.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
