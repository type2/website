Hey Dan,

That is an awesome offer. What does it take to move the site? I'm still
going to make a donation, but I think that is a great idea. Maybe if we
raise some money we can use it to pay for someone to integrate a better
search on the archives. Currently it's pretty difficult to search
effectively, and may help people answer questions for themselves.
