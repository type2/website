Library page

  http://www.type2.com/library/fuel.htm

has entry

  Electric Fuel Pump Wiring by Scott Fraser

with link

  http://www.dolphinsci.com/relay.html

which goes to a domain squatter or, at least, something
weird that I don't understand.  Might anyone have the
correct page and/or or the correct info?
