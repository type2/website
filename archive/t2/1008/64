Subject: it started

It looks like it is the Cold Start Valve giving me trouble, to be more precise the plug. It slips on and off like size 12 shoes on size 8 feet. Probably used to have a couple of clips to hold it in place but they are long gone. I pushed it on real snug and she fired right up, but I can't do that forever, any ideas?
