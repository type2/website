 I'm not sure about the bus FI system, but on my FI squareback, you turn the
key to the acc. Position and you can actually hear two clicks and a whirring
noise of fuel being pumped to the engine. Usually when I have trouble
starting I listen for the clicks and try to make sure the engine has fuel.


 If you don't hear the noise then you know that is the starting point for
the
problem. Is that the same for the bus FI system?

No, the bus L-Jetronic is different then the car D-Jetronic.

On the bus, the engine must be cranking or the engine must be running for
the fuel pump ro run.
