I've offered this in the past, and I offer it again.  I work for a 
managed servicves provider as a Database Administrator.  I have a 
10megabit connection to a linux system in a colocation cabinet in a 
dataenter.  We have redundant power, diesel generators, big ass UPSs to 
handle load while we switch from commercial to generartor power, and we 
have 5 internet drains.  How does free hosting sound?  I could also 
provide a netbsd box (Sun Ultra5) for the list to use.  I would ask for 
nothing in return and would offer these services free to the list.
