As a Help site I would expect that if a person is looking for a
solution or product a _reply_ with a URL to that product on an `bay
store seems reasonable to me.   If your concerned about  link
longevity or mail bouncing due to the URL, be sure to write a good
searchable description of the product and provider name so the helpee
or archivee can search for on the unamed site, google products, yahoo
stores, thesamba, etc.
