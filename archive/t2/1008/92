Go to:
http://www.type2.com
then go to the Library, then Wiring Diagrams/Schematics, then Air cooled VW Wiring Diagrams Online.  The only problem may be that there isn't one for a 1975.  There are for 1974 and 1976 but not 1975.  But then according to my Bentley, the 1973 through 1975 are the same.

Hope this at least kind of helps.
