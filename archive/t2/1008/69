Subject: RE: [T2] qu. replacing shift rod grommet

Ok, I admit it. I cheated and used the procedure from the Bentley manual,
which made it pretty simple.  But in the context of all the stuff I've done
to my bus recently, it seemed pretty small, and was the last thing I had to
do before driving it for the first time in months.

I don't think it's "no biggie"! Even with the position of the plate
clearly marked, it took lots of tiny adjustments to get it dialed in
the way I wanted it.
