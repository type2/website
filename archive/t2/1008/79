Unlike Bosch, NGK plugs are either Made in Japan or Assembled in USA  
from Japanese parts (or so the plugs and box indicate).

Someone once pointed out once that the profile of the NGK plugs is  
thinner which you can see in this photo:

NGKvsBosch.jpg

This is advantageous when fitting a CHT sender until the plug through  
the engine tin on the Type 4 engine. I also think NGK plugs foul less  
easily and last longer.

To illustrate what physical differences exist I took a photo of some  
of the NGK plugs:

You can see that B5ES and B6ES and identical looking (the heat range  
differs). BP6ES has a projected tip. Note: the -11 you see is not  
commonly found but it indicates a 1.1mm factory plug gap (useful for  
CDI).

Sometimes BP6ES can be hard to find. This seems to be because it  
maybe due for replacement by BP6EY which is like the ES style but  
with a v notched into the tip. If you've been buying NGK V-Power  
plugs for your other cars for several years this design will be  
familiar to you.

If you don't know which NGK plug to use here's a simple cross- 
reference (smaller numbers mean hotter plug in NGK's naming  
convention, the opposite with Bosch):

Regular tip:

W7CC use B6ES (summer)
W8CC use B5ES (winter)

Projected tip version:

W7DC use BP6ES
W8DC use BP5ES

Sometimes vendors have trouble ordering NGK plugs by their codes. In  
that case give them these (stock numbers).

B5ES (6410)
B6ES (7432)
BP5ES (6511)
BP6ES (7811)
BP5EY (7327)
BP6EY (7727)
