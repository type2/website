Subject: Re: [T2] How many fuel filters?

ah-ha.  this might be the answer to my mysterious starting problems!

Due to time constraints, I plan to just replace the filter for now.  Aside
from the potential for trapped air and more connection points to go
bad.....is this extra filter a problem?

I know I need to replace all the fuel lines and I found the article in the
library by Shawn Luft titled "Fuel Line Replacement - '74 and Earlier Bus w/
Single Carburetor".....is it really that easy to do?  Are there any gotchas
I should know before starting?

Many thanks,
