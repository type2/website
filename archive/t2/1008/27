Richard, do you believe the TTS operates on a sliding time scale depending on the temperature? i.e. stays open 8s at X degrees trending to zero seconds at 35 degrees C (for your example)

I wonder what X degrees might equal.

I just reinstalled the TTS and CSV on my megasquirted Vanagon.  "There's no SW like HW" seems to work in my favour here.  Although I could probably keep tweaking the megasquirt parameters to improve the cold start, this made a big difference in one fell swoop.
