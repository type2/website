Eric,

Yes, the bolts you mentioned ...Don't forget to take the belt off(if you 
still have one on).  Also, at that point you should be able to lift it up 
and to your left and set it on the sheet metal where a spare battery would 
go.

Don't forget to watch for the electirical connections!

A/C instructions on Richard's site.  www.ratwell.com

Cheers, dave
