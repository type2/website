Subject: Re: [T2] How many fuel filters?

the only thing i have to add is stay away from brazilian made hose.
my experience may be an anomaly but i had a very new brazilian hose
that was the correct size burst.  there was no wear on the braided
exterior.  the hose failed from the inside out.  fortunately the
engine had just been started and i was driving away from a friends
house when the smell of gasoline became overpowering.  fortunately i
wasn't smoking either.  i replaced all the brazilian hoses w/ german
made.  again, this may have been a freak accident, but i won't put the
brazilian hoses on goethe the two tone brick in the future.  goethe is
fuel injected, so the fuel pressure is higher than a carbed engine.
