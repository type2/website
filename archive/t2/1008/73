Subject: 76 6-rib with 1776 in 71 Westy

I am finally getting to the point that I think I have the pieces to get my 71
Westy moving again.  I got my hands on a 1776 single port motor (from another
T-style fiberglass project) and a 6-rib tranny (from a 1976 Bus I had that the
motor needs to be rebuilt).

Question:

Is there anything special I need to be aware of in mating this 1776cc motor to
the 6-rib tranny (from the 1976 bus)?

What might I acknowledge in terms of performance, precautions, etc...?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
