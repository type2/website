My brother, Richard Kaiser, will be on "CBS Evening News with Katie Couric"
this evening at 6:30 eastern time. Seems an employee of his found a money bag
containing personal letters, and turned them in to Richard. The letters were to
and from a vietnam soldier who was killed in the line of duty, along with the
telegram notifying his parents that he had been killed. My brother searched the
internet for any information on this soldier, found none, and contacted the
local news station in Portland, Oregon. They in turn did a story about the
letters being found. A relative watching the broadcast recognized the name, and
contacted the soldiers mother. Long story short, she now has her letters back,
after 20 years of being missing. Some people would have thrown the letters away
when they were found, but we were raised in a military household, and my
brothers and father were in the Navy, and we were raised differently. Good
deeds are worth doing for their own sake. Getting your "15 minutes of fame" is
just an afterthought.

Thanks for letting me brag about my "little" bro.
