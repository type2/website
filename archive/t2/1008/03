Subject: UPDATE - Buses By The Depot AND Bus Depot Clearance Sale

A reminder for your East Coasters that Buses By The Depot is this Saturday!
Also on Saturday, from 2-4 pm, will be a Garage Sale at the Bus Depot ( a
few blocks away), where we will blow out a bunch of discontinued items,
customer returns, etc at steep discounts.  (There is a ton of 68-79 Bus
stuff there, incidentally.)  

See http://busdepot.com/BBD2007.htm for more details.

The weather forecast is excellent - a sunny 72 degrees, which is above
average for the year.  You can come for the day for free and meet other
local Bus owners, or spend the night for $10. We onlt have one or two
reserved camping spots left, so if you want to spend the night, go to the
above link ASAP to claim one.  Nighttime lows are forecast to be 48-50
degrees.  If you already did reserve a site, you should have received an
email from me with your site number. Please let me know right away if you
have not.

See you Saturday!
