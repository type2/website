I haven't replaced any hose recently so I've been assuming if it comes from a reputable vendor and the hose is metric it is German.

The last time I bought 5m roll of 7mm hose I got the tags that normaly come with it. A lot of hose is just cut from the roll the vendor gets so you often can't tell where it was made although some hoses are stamped Germany. Can we find Made in Brazil stamped on it?

What brands are we looking to avoid?
