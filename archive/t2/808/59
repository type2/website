I went up to the window one time with the front overhead piece for a
Vanagon air conditioner and they wanted to charge me for every vent and
knob attached to it. I stormed out in disgust sure that they were
discriminating against me because I'm white and can presumably afford it.
I forgave them a month later when I needed another part though.

 They normally have a board with all the parts prices posted.  This can be
 a bonus for some aircooled parts, since a fan shroud (a relatively complex
 part on an aircooled) is priced the same as the plastic radiator fan
 shrouds on watercooled cars.
