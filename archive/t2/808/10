Hi Darren:

I didn't use foam strips because I was concerned that they might absorb
water.

Instead, I got some of home heating oil tank supply line insulating
tubes (available cheap at Home Depot). They're made of closed cell
foam, and are won't absorb water. I cut them into strips and glued the
strips in place. They've worked pretty well. And you can make whatever
thickness you want.
