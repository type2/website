The oil FARTs get really tiresome, but tires are different. I thought 
that Yokohamas were the most highly recommended tires, but last year, 
when Ron at BD got in some new brand, I sat up and took notice when 
several people mentioned how much more stable those tires were. So 
brands, availability, and sources of tires is worthy of a frequent and 
recurring thread. Load ratings aren't, though, and as for oil ...
