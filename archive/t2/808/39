The fact that most yard emolyees know nothing about aircooleds in general and campers in particular can also work to your advantage. I picked up a good condition  early bay westy water tank for $3.50 :-). 

OTOH, the time I scored a windshield, I left the scraggly reamins of the seal to cushion the glass in the wheelbarrow. When I checked the receipt, they had cahrged me for the useless
