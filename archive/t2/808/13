Subject: Bodywork question

I recently picked up a stud welder from HF to work out a variety of 
dings and creases in the body of my bus.

There's one thing about this tool that bothers me. It is most useful 
for working box sections of the body -- places where it's inconvenient 
or impossible to slip a dolly (or clean and paint). And when it 
attaches the stud, there is going to be a small burn on the 
inaccessible side.

I'm concerned about all those tiny burns promoting rust inside, with no 
way to clean and paint them. But maybe the tacit understanding when 
using this technique is that the visible body is going to look better, 
but the panel is going to rust from the inside in time.

Am I worrying too much? Or is there something that can be done to 
"finish" the inside?

Mark
