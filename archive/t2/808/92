Subject: Fw: [T2] Heater... too much of a good thing!

I live in the Southern Oregon area.  I've got quite an adventurous spirit
(typical of a bus owner), but sometimes adventure is costly in dollars
and/or convenience.  As long as I can run inside, turn on my computer, and
post a question, I think I'll be okay.  You all seem to be so wonderful in
making suggestions and helping each other through some tricky maneuvers...
I'm really quite impressed (and very entertained by some of the topics! ha
ha).

However, can you talk me through how to "dad" a boy whose a second string
player on a losing JV football team?  Seems a lot more difficult than
smashing a worm on a hook!!  I've offered lifesavers, but uhhh.... you know.
