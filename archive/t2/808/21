Subject: middle bench seat seatbelts

my mother-in-law arrives for a visit this afternoon, so i had to put the
middle bench seat in for the extra seating.  One of the holes in the
floor that receives the seatbelt is stripped / rusted / whatevered and no
longer grips the botl.  having a 7 pass 6 seatbelt bus is OK i guess, but
i would like to be able to have the option to belt someone into that
seat.  is this another application for the timesert like when my oil
drain plug stripped the threads out of the case, or am i looking at a
more difficult fix?
