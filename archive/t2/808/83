But they are SO tucked away in there, it's brutal looking. I'm used to doing
Type 1 valves, but compared to the Bay, they look easy??

Hydraulic is really great for low maintenance driving, but with
mechanical lifters you get to monitor your valve lash so you can tell
if you are starting to drop a valve and monitor valve stretch.
