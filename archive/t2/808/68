Subject: Re: [T2] Busdepot, thou hast overpackaged my grommets 

Anytime things arrive poorly packed in newspaper I shudder, I'd much prefer
my stuff come packed in foam peanuts. Newspapers are for reading, not
shipping protection.

I've reshipped far more of them then I've thrown away, just recycle them.
Ship something once in a while or keep them in a trash bag and give away to
others that do ship stuff.

I'm always thrilled to get free foam peanuts...there not cheap and ebay
customers are always glad to see their purchase was well packed.

btw this list sure is a pain in the butt to post to, 1rst post is always
shot down for to much qouted material, 2 try ussually ends up mistakenly
going to the original poster not he list  and it's 3 or 4 tries to get it to
the list...lol
