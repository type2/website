The gray or dense black foam found in Home Depot for window seals is 
closed cell foam.  The white stuff is not. You could also use the 
crushable hollow tube with the flate side covered with an adhesive layer.

  Instead, I got some of home heating oil tank supply line insulating
  tubes (available cheap at Home Depot). They're made of closed cell
  foam, and are won't absorb water. I cut them into strips and glued the
  strips in place. They've worked pretty well. And you can make whatever
  thickness you want.
