Before I got my first bay window bus I went to our wrecking yard to
see if parts were available. After seeing several bays in the yard, I
went ahead and brought the bus home. Couple weeks later went to look
at parts, and the owner told me he was crushing them all. Said there
was no money in anything older than 85.
