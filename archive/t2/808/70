I'm the same way.  I keep the stuff in a big trash bag and use it for its
intended purpose.  I usually get more than I ship, but the extra is given
to people who are moving, etc.

For those who need the ecological solution, there are peanuts made of
cornstarch.  To get rid of them, just pour them on the lawn and turn on
the sprinkers.
