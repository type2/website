I had the same question for my body guy. He said it is almost impossible
without "factory priming" the chassis. The factory would do all the body
work, then dip the whole chassis in a vat of rust preventative.

You can do the same thing if you can spray a high volume of rust-proofer
into the area, preferably not out of a spray can. Evidently the propellant
"mists" the paint way too much. He says he "splashes" in a thin mixture when
he can.

He also said in the areas where the panel is sealed, to make sure you seam
seal the metal edges so water and air can't mix. That is your best defense.
