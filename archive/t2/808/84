Subject: Re: [T2] Heater... too much of a good thing!

You people are awesome!  I'm going to take a look  at the heating system
tomorrow.  I'll let you know if I have more questions.  Wish I would have
known about this list years ago... could have saved a fortune in repair
bills!  I have all kinds of tools, but suffer from a lack of self
confidence.  From now on, I will ask questions before I run to the "grease
monkeys" for resolution.  Maybe some things will be easy enough that simple
minds like mine can understand!  I enjoy the posts and read everyday.... and
learn a lot along the way.  Besides... the attempt at repair gives me a
chance to spend some time with my teenage son doing "guy" things (well...
I'm lacking the levels of testosterone, but I'm trying at least).  I taught
him how to fish... the next step is to teach him how to CATCH!
