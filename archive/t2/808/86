Subject: Tool I'd like to see...

My poor feeler gauge is beat to crap. All bent up and such. I've been leary
of getting another because in 2 adjustment sessions it'll look no better.

What I'd like to see is a feeler gauge that has a cast pot metal body with
fingers going around the .006 feeler part so they form a pocket. The
body/fingers would be bent at a comfortable angle to get in our rockers
without having to put our human fingers into the contortions that they
currently suffer. Maybe 60* or something.

The cast body and fingers would protect the gauge from bending and such, but
would clear the rockers handily.

Anybody else know what I'm talking about? If it exists, please tell me! I
hate regular feelers!
