Surfing Powell's.com and I saw this book coming out in Feb 06. Amazon.com
has it for $11 less. There is not a photo of the cover or a description.
But looks interesting.  I would hope that a real bookstore would have a copy
so I could look at it and see what it has.
 
Thought that I would pass it along.
