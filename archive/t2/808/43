Hi All,

Well I found myself a taco plate to use to install a temp sender in my
Westy.  I've searched the archives and still have a couple of questions.

1) Along with the taco plate and cover there are gaskets.  What order are
they to be installed in the motor?  Picture or drawing would be great.
2) Which way should the sender be pointed?  It looks like I have a 50-50
change of getting it right.
3) The taco plate I got came with an old temp sender in place.  Does anyone
know if this will work (& give correct readings) with the VDO gauge sold on
Bus Depot site?  Yes, I know you probably want the sender part number - I'll
get that soon.

TIA
