Subject: Just brought home my 77 Westy!!

Just got it home, and am starting the initial inspections. I can see the
rockers will need some help, and one dogleg, amazingly, everything else
looks really good. I'm going to drop the pan and check the gas heater to see
what it is doing etc. etc. I'm SO glad, been Westy-less for too long !!!  



Other than less maintenance, is there any real reason to switch this engine
over to hydraulic valves?
