I'm confused as to why they're split in the first place. Mechanically, early
bays and splits are quite similar. Split owners in my experience tend to be
more concerned with "correct" parts and OG / NOS stuff than bay owners are,
but that's changing. Even over the past 2 years, except for those that have
always been more about stock than modifications, the mood has shifted both
here and on the Samba regarding staying stock and even "correct".

The thing I noticed on the Samba (I've never checked in on the VB list) is
the community in the BW forum is much more personal and family-like than the
one on the split forum, or any of the other forums for that matter.

Tips, tricks, techniques, and information. Quite a bit of that applies to
both classes of busses it seems to me.
