Is your linkage adjusted correctly? I discovered that my passenger side 
flapper was not closing correctly b/c the little white nylon coupler 
would not pull the flappers tight. If I was going to redesign that 
system I'd have a crossshaft with arms reaching out to BOTH flappers 
and then have the crossshaft linked to the dash lever. That way both 
got a firm pull but then I guess that would have costed VW $1.50 
more... <griN!> I layered my neoprene on the inside of the flappers 
just as stock. No road test yet...
