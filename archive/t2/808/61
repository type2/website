Subject: Re: [T2] Heater... too much of a good thing!

Get yourself a copy of the picture of the system in the Bentley manual. 
Crawl under the bus and start identifying the pieces that are there and 
the pieces that are not there. Yes you CAN repair the whole heater 
system with the engine in place... Chris
