Here in California, there's an entrance fee (a buck is standard). Then 
everything is priced the same. $15.00 for an alternator, for instance, 
no matter what vehicle it comes from. $30 for a door, whether it has 
glass in it or not. Etc.

There is, however, a premium on recent cars, but that's not relevant to 
buses.
