Subject: Re: [T2] Friday kind of post

There are times when I want to find a specific post, which may not be
archived yet, in which case gmail is handy because I am archived
there. But for general questions, I find the topics recur so
frequently that there are almost too many posts in the archives to
read so that it is not necessary to have the latest archive updates.
