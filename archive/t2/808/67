Subject: Re: [T2] Fresh Air vent seals

Actually VW tried to save a buck by using one less cable and flapper 
door arm. - the 74 I just pulled apart DID have a lever arm for each 
vent flapper door- my 78 has that #*&$*&%$ nylon coupler that can split 
or let the "slave" flapper close with less pressure.

  Is your linkage adjusted correctly? I discovered that my passenger side
  flapper was not closing correctly b/c the little white nylon coupler
  would not pull the flappers tight. If I was going to redesign that
  system I'd have a crossshaft with arms reaching out to BOTH flappers and
  then have the crossshaft linked to the dash lever. That way both got a
  firm pull but then I guess that would have costed VW $1.50 more...
  <griN!> I layered my neoprene on the inside of the flappers just as
  stock. No road test yet...
