Subject: Re: [T2] pic-n-pull question

A couple more details about pic-n-pulls:

There is often a core charge; it works like any other core charge.

Places here offer a guarantee for a premium. It's very straightforward. 
You pay the premium, and you can keep coming back until you get a part 
that works. Pointless for some things, but very useful for others (an 
alternator, for instance).
