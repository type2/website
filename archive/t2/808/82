I dunno about tip-top, but I do know this thing pretty well. In this case it
was a matter of not having a drill handy. I even had my right angle adapter
and everything to get those buggers out. AND the right sized bolts! Heck, I
think I have just about anything short of a new engine under the rear seat.
heh That's one of the things I love about this bus. I can fix darn near
anything on the side of the road and get going again in a short time.

She'll go again, if for no other reason than she doesn't trust her Volvo.
Even though I know that car pretty well too and would actually trust it at
least as far as the bus. We've had the Volvo for nearly 5 years, and the bus
2.5.

One thing I must say: I'm glad this didn't happen half way to Cali or
something. Would have sucked to be in the middle of the mountains on I70
with no cell signal...
