My local guy (I have not been there in a few years) says just go look and come
back BEFORE you remove ANYTHING. Talk price first. Had a lot of busses then. I
found a child's cot and carried it down to ask the price and that seemed to
piss him off even thought it was not attached to anything.

I bought a lot of stuff there but have no idea if any busses are left. He went
on a crushing spree.

Another place in town had one bus, same policy. Splitty rusting away. The
lower deluxe trim was still salvageable ( may have been in the bus) anyway I
asked the price and he gave some ridiculous figure.I said for that price I got
everything including the jailbars. He said no, and I left. Prolly still there.
