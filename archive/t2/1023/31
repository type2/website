Subject: 1977 baywindow Middle sill or rocker panel???

I cannot locate middle rockers, but in looking at pics of them, it appears that they are nothing more than an L shaped piece of straight sheetmetal. The pics I've seen don't appear to show any bends in them, but does anyone have one handy to check and see if there is anything magic about them. I was thinking I could just bend some sheetmetal to the size needed and weld that in.
Thanks,
Courtney
