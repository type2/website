You shouldn't need the rev limiting rotor, the 04033 will do. I thought
I was going to need to grind a 04033 rotor when fitting a Pertronix then
I noticed that the magnetic collar was sitting up a bit relative to the
sensor. Sure enough once I was able to seat the magnetic collar all the
way down no grinding was required!
