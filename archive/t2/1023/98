Subject: Oil temp sender location

Can I hook up an oil temp sender, anywhere else than the "taco" plate on the
bottom of my 1800cc Westy motor?

On what do manufacturers suggest auto trans fluid changes?  Since there is no
"combustion toxins" to contaminate it, just friction factors, and since it can
be "read" as bad by different color, or smell, why do some reccomend
30,000KMs, and others many other distances for re/re. I can see changing the
filter, but that to is a no go until you take the pan off and drain all fluid.
No air enters so only internal wear contaminants and heat to worry about.

Just a Friday question.  Thanks
Sid
