Subject: '74 Westy 1800cc heater flapper valves

I cannot get a clear picture from my Bentley manual, nor from my Haynes, so,
does the passenger side flapper have a pipe that connects the flapper valve at
the top to in bus heating ducts, or does it go at the bottom of said pipe, on
the end of the heat exchanger?  Is that also the case for the drivers side?  I
am putting this together on engine stand as much as I can, and some parts may
be 'hiding" in my garage.  Thanks.
Sid
