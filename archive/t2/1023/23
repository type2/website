Ever since I sold my '78 last month I've been looking for a new VW.  The 
  initial plan was to get a type 3, but being a bus guy like I am I 
couldn't pass this one up.  The 1600DP  drives well, and the bus is in 
overall good shape.  Being a late bay guy I know little about the type1 
engine and early bus.  It's going to be a fun trip.  I had a blast 
driving it around all day yesterday.
