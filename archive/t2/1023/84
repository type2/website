Subject: [Q] Bay Window Paint Scheme

Greetings-

I'm restoring a '71 (bay window), but *really* like the earlier 
(splitty) paint schemes -- the curve on the front is cool.  Does 
anyone have photos of a bay window bus that's been painted this 
way?  I don't know if there's a way to make it look right, but I'd 
like to see some pictures.

-David
