Wayne -

If memory serves and upon checking my old parts fiche reference, the 1979
left coverplate is a one-year only animal, so Paul's "quick fix" may be your
only alternative.  I did a quick check of my parts stash database and
unfortunately I don't have this piece right now.  Gonna look for some this
weekend at the local Pick & Pull.  I have them (used of course) from time to
time.
