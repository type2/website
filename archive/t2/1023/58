Subject: Re: 1977 baywindow Middle sill or rocker panel???

In my experience, the middle rocker is only on the cargo door side of the bus.? Must be to reinforce the sliding door track.? If I remember correctly, the middle rocker is not a flat piece, but has bends toward the front like the sliding door track.? I have pics somewhere.
Also, the original had 3/4?" or so holes in it most?of the length,?the replacement did not.? This is not necessary or visible once installed.? I got mine from the Depot.
Big Job.? Good luck.
