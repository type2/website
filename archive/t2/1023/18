And when the complaint is that the o-rings only lasted 60k miles it's  
not guaranteed any sealant will allow the next batch to last longer.

Dow Corning 111 Valve Lubricant & Sealant was a popular silicone  
based band-aid fix used by Porsche engine builders. While the engine  
was leak free when built, they found out that it shrank Viton by 5%  
and caused regular silicone o-rings to swell and deform.

Push rod tube o-ring are easily changed on a Type 4 engine in an  
afternoon. If you want a leak free engine, the service life is around  
50k miles.

The only reason to put in a sealant is if you can't seal the tubes on  
their own because of damage that prevents the o-ring from sealing on  
their own.

About 1-2 years ago I saw photos from an engine builder who (probably  
panicked about his reputation and) put Loctite 518 on the push rod  
tube o-rings. I wonder how that customer is doing now...
