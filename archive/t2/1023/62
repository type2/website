Subject: LM-1 for $299 while supplies last

Innovate is coming out with the LM-2 WBO2 meter very soon and all  
LM-1's have been discounted to $299 through this select vendor:

http://titanmotorsports.com/lmdiairame.html

FYI. For several years the list price has been fixed. While some eBay  
sellers have discounted the unit, Innovate has refused to provide  
support/warranty unless you paid full price through an authorized  
reseller.
