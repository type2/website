hey guys    Don there isn't a local Vw shop near  you???  If there is then
that's who you should be supporting just as Greg  is with Scott. I keep a
small
inventory of bosch parts here at my shop just for  this reason.I can also get
just about anything I want overnite. Getting good  quality parts has been a
chore anymore,but I have been getting good stuff for  some time (knock on
wood)

That is why my bill from the Bus Depot runs me more than I expect because I
order a spare.  Or I didn't really need the AFM  or fuel pump I ordered>  Oh
well I have the spares ready to go.  I always look for that obscure Bosh decal
on a garage.  Or the Porshes and VW's in front!!  I see it and it makes my
heart  go.  Back to the FLAPS--   I have had good luck  (although it is
sometimes good and sometimes bad-  (helps to really know what you want-- ie
part number-- and brand---BOSH)   > but the same applys to VW parts guys too.
Bus Depot been good to me and thanks to the list I am aware of a few others
now. Peace
