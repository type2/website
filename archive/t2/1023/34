Don't feel too bad...My turn signal indicator light
isn't workin' today...But I know why...Temps are
about 15 F outside...When it warms up the light'll
be back...That's just the way it is and I'm not about
to crawl under the dash to find out any more...
BTW, the turn signals do work...It's just that l'il
lite... ;-(
