Subject: [Q] Engine

Greetings-

I'm in the middle of a '71 Westie restoration (maybe you've seen some 
of my other posts).  Anyway, I'm thinking engines and am considering 
an 1835cc to be built as a balanced/blue-printed engine.  My mechanic 
is recommending a custom shop to do the work at a cost of between 
$4500 and $6500.

This sounds high, except when I think about a "kit" costing around 
$1800 - $2000.  If parts are 1/2 the cost of a completed engine, that 
means that a ready-to-go engine should cost from $3600 - 
$4000.  Throw in the fact that this engine would be balanced and 
blue-printed, and suddenly this doesn't seem so bad (at least on the 
low end of what's being pitched).

Thoughts?

P.S.  I forget the name of the shop, but believe it's in Tennessee 
(Nashville area?).  I also recall the first name of the builder to be 
Mark.  Who knows, he may be a part of this group and will respond 
directly.  For what it's worth, the custom shop being discussed comes 
*highly* recommended.
