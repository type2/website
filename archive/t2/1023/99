The PO of my bus painted the pop-top when he repainted the bus.  The 
paint is at least 15 years old, and has held up fine.  No problems with 
cracking.

I prefer white for the tops, and one of these decades I will repaint 
mine white.  There are a number of marine paints that work well for 
fiberglass.

Good luck!
