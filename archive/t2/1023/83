Subject: Re: RE: [T2] Auto Parts Stores Rant

Well as much as I support the local guy, I also shop at the big stores. To say
in general that all Napa, Canadian Tire, Shucks, Pepboys etc parts are crap is
nieve. Do you really think that these guys make their own parts? Of course
not. My brother refuses to buy from CanadianTire because he says their parts
are junk. Gee, last time I checked the box they handed me said Bendix on it
for the brake pads I was replacing. Their price was excellent. For rebuilt
stuff, they have a standard warranty that everyone else has. They offer me the
options of what price I want to pay and I take my pic. Of course shiny new
parts from Germany are awesome, but if you look at your parts, many times they
are Brazil or Mexico VW, not German. Sometimes we don't have choices as parts
are NLA, or our budget doesn't allow us to buy NOS worth it's weight in gold
original parts. In fact, my starters and alternators are rebuilt by the local
small shop and usually check in at around 50 bucks. He stands behind his work
too, but so do the big boys in my experience.
Help, I'm starting to rant, and I'm starting to contradict myself, and I can't
shut up. :-)
