Hi Courtney,

You may live in Canada, but IIRC you live on the wet coast where the  
buses are relatively plentiful.

Here in the east, the CT stores aren't nearly as accommodating, and  
my local NAPA charges an arm and a leg. Luckily I have GermanSupply  
on the speed dial of my cell phone, but even Scott isn't immune to  
suppliers who send bad parts his way. He's always made good on them  
promptly though, and gets lots more business (and referrals) from me  
that way.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
