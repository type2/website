Subject: dist rotor pertronix

esteemed list:

I have a 205E dist. on a '72 T4 engine with a pertronix installed, but 
no rotor.  I have heard about grinding down a rotor to fit but curious 
if there is one that fits normally that I might purchase. . .

Bus Boys lists the rotor for '72 bus as Bosch #04 016 for $28.85 (rev 
limiting?) but Jim Thompson's page shows #04 033 as a substitute which 
is cheaper. . . although none of these will fit without grinding. . . 
any suggestions appreciated!!

TIA,
Will A.
