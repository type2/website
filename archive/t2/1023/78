I'm in  the middle of a '71 Westie restoration (maybe you've seen some 
of my other  posts).  Anyway, I'm thinking engines and am considering 
an 1835cc to  be built as a balanced/blue-printed engine.  My mechanic 
is  recommending a custom shop to do the work at a cost of between 
$4500 and  $6500.

This sounds high, except when I think about a "kit" costing  around 
$1800 - $2000.  If parts are 1/2 the cost of a completed  engine, that 
means that a ready-to-go engine should cost from $3600 -  
$4000.  Throw in the fact that this engine would be balanced and  
blue-printed, and suddenly this doesn't seem so bad (at least on the  
low end of what's being  pitched).

Thoughts?

P.S.  I forget the name  of the shop, but believe it's in Tennessee 
(Nashville area?).  I also  recall the first name of the builder to be 
Mark.  Who knows, he may  be a part of this group and will respond 
directly.  For what it's  worth, the custom shop being discussed comes 
*highly*  recommended.



hello David   I don't know if I am who you are talking about or  not.  I do 
this kind of work and my name is Mark ,but I am located in SW  Virginia.  The 
cost of such motors depends on certain things, do you have a  core motor to get 
the external components off of, such as exhust, heater boxes,  all tin work, 
,  Cost will vary considering the case(new or used), which  heads are chosen, 
or other custom parts are required, also what type of carbs  are used etc.  
You are better off estimating high than low   .  let me know if I can help
