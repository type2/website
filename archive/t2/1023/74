Subject: [Q] '71 Front Seats

Greetings-

I am in the middle of a '71 Westie project, and am thinking about 
changing the front seats.  I'm interested in headrests -- has anyone 
put these types of seats in a '71?  Also, I understand that later 
model buses had a swivel seat option.  Anyone tried this in a '71?

P.S.  I'm also looking for a vintage trailer (two-wheel).  Anyone 
know of one available?  (I like the single-wheel tear-drop style 
better, but don't like the speed limit.)
