Subject: Rough running..

Hey guys.. having issues... All of a sudden.. My 72 bus. 2.0 solid  
lifters, Dual Solex 32's (type3) It started to not run so well..  
Before this.. its been running great, i go to salt lake from ogden  
every day. Descent power, no stutters etc.. Till yesterday, Just  
starting to feel like its falling on its face..  I can slowly  
accelerate, then if i try to get the rpm's high enough to shift into  
2nd, It feels like its not getting gas? just like someone unplugged 2  
cyls or something. I went ahead and did the valves today. I pulled the  
carbs, Rebuilt them, they were missing a screw, i think it held the  
venturi in place? i placed a set screw in there so that they were not  
moving anymore. put it all back together.. seems a little better, but  
when i accelerate sitting in the driveway it used to just rev right  
up, now if i rev it it goes up, but starts to pop and fart out of the  
carbs.. I just dont see how it can be running great one day and so bad  
the next, oh, one thing that seems to help while im driving is if i  
pump the gas a little but.. seems strange?? Checked timing.. timing is  
strange... hard to describe. but i know its about where it should be.  
I know i dont have the exact dizzy i should, but it is vacum advance,  
I have some 009's but I  liked the way the vacuum advance works..  
maybe its not working now?? im not sure.. Any help would be appreciated.
