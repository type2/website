Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Tin Puzzle

Jason asked:


 I am in the process of putting the PS of my engine back together after
having to do some major surgery on the head.

 Is there a diagram that will help in putting all the tins back together in
the "correct" order? Last thing I want to do is put something together that
I will have to take apart again.

Not that I know of.

Easiest way is to take another engine apart :)

If you were close to me I could show you. Or I have a few complete engines
you could disassemble to see how they go together.
