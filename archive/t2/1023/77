Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Engine

Hello David...I drive a 1971 also ...I am doing my
engine this spring from a Top Shelf Builder in the
Seattle area....New block, Balanced, New heads,1776cc
(wall Thickness very close to Stock 85.5mm)..$1800ish
for long block(no tax)...I am able to do the Swap and
fine tune the motor...I may put a Counter balanced
Crank in the mix....this motor will have mild Engle
cam...30mm oil pump....Maybe buy your parts and have
your crank, rods, flywheel,and clutch assembly
balanced on your own...We are lucky here in the PNW
still some very good VW shops still around (knock on
wood)...I would like to know the 4500.00 price, is
this turn key with dual carbs ...that price would buy
alot of Motor out here...Tony
