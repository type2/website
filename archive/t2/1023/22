Subject: Re: strange turn signal brake light action

Check ground connections. I would first check your tail light  
grounds. Your right rear light assembly may have a bad ground and it  
may be effectively grounded through the brake light bulb and it is  
circuit (you may notice a dimly pulsing brake light). As soon as you  
hit the brakes, potential on the ground side of the turn signal bulb  
pulls up and your turn signal relay goes to double-frequency mode  
(usually indicating a bad bulb), because of reduced load.

If your brights do not stay on, measure for proper voltage and ground  
at the head light relay. Could be a corroded ground as well. If you  
are not into electrical trouble-shooting, twist all the fuses in your  
fuse box. Slightly corroded fuses can cause strange behavior.

This could all be a consequence of not using your bus for 6 months.
