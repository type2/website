Subject: B pillar repair piece for 77 Bay?

Just like the middle rocker, I am also wondering if anyone has seen the
replacement bottom 6 inches or so of the B pillar as a repair piece? This is
the pillar between the front doors and the sides of the van. I can't see it
anywhere on-line. I might have to have it made I'm thinking. Anyone?
Thanks,
Courtney
