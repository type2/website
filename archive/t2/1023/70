Subject: Re: GEN light stays on?!

>1 - How is the generator light supposed to be properly wired. It stays
on all the time when I'm driving around, but I keep a trickle charger on
the car when it's not in use so I don't really know if it's losing a
charge. The light just stays on all the time.

The generator/alternator light is supposed to be joined between the +ve
from the generator/alternator and the +ve from the battery. It glows to
show that the voltage from one of these two is lower than the other.
There is a wire from the regulator to get the alternator voltage. The
battery voltage is tapped from somewhere up front (should be on the
wiring diagram).
