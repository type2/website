Subject: RE: [T2] Auto Parts Stores Rant

I love Autozone. They rent tools and you get 100% of your money back when you
return them. I use them for things like oil/shop rag/liquid wrench etc etc etc
etc. Also with 5 purchases over 20 bucks they give you a 20 buck gift card.

But I would never ever consider buying an auto part there except maybe bulbs
and batteries. Even with the watercooled I had over the years
Autozone/Napa/Etc would have parts in stock that I could use but I'd rather
get the quality OEM/German parts.

If anyone has a local store that actually carries VW parts, support them as
much as you can because they will be gone. I wish I had given more business to
our local store before it shut down.  Also - as far as the online vendors,
figure out which ones can get you stuff the fastest. And for common tune up
parts it just makes sense to get additional new parts or keep the parts you
replace so if it fails you already have the replacement.

Expecting the nationwide stores to carry quality parts for old VWs is like
expecting McDs to serve filet mignon.
