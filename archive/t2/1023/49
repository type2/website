Subject: Auto Parts Stores Rant

I hate Napa, Autozone, Checker, etc.

Not a single FRIGGIN ONE of them had a decent dist cap and rotor. None of
the caps would fit. The clip shoulders are way too high. Rotor barely sets
on the shaft, etc etc.

It is seriously pathetic that none of the chains can carry decent stuff.
It's like a bunch of monkeys pulled some poop out of their arses, mashed it
together, and the stores stuck it in a box.

Can you tell I'm seriously pissed off right now?

I can make the Guac's symptoms WORSE by putting crappy cap and rotor on. But
I have yet to make them BETTER. I'm going on 3 weeks now without my bus. I'm
tired of having to mail order decent parts, wait a week, etc.

Maybe tomorrow I'll hit up Blazers. Hmm...
