Subject: '79 Engine Tin

I have a '79 bus with an original A/C compressor... I am planning to remove
the engine in the spring and while it's out I am going to remove the old
compressor.  I'll need to replace the tin on the left side of the motor (it
has a cutout for the compressor) - anyone have a spare piece they are
willing to part with?

TIA,
