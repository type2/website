I do not Know what kind of motor you have in mind,but
6500.00 would buy 3 motors I would trust to Drive to
the Moon....I also think a 1835 in a bus leaves the
cylinder walls too thin.and will take away from
longevity....But I am sure you can get someone to take
the $$$$$.....VW Motors are Dependable....Good
luck...Take your time...and ask lots of questions...Tony
