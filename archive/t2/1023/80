Mark-

The shop I'm dealing with is Airkooled Kustoms in Meridianville, 
AL.  (They are the ones helping me search for an engine builder.)  I 
don't think you are the guy I've been hearing about, although that's 
no reflection on you, certainly.

Unfortunately, I don't have much to offer in the way of auxiliary 
components.  The motor I'm replacing "died" -- broke a piston rod and 
drove the broken joint into the case.  The other components were of 
questionable origin and remaining service life.  I'm wanting my bus 
(when complete) to be a daily driver, and I'm wanting to have 
confidence in it.  As such, I'm wanting to "know what I have", and 
thus thinking a new engine.

The only specification that I'm aware of with what's being proposed 
that could possibly justify the high-end price ($6500) is that the 
engine would be balanced to tighter tolerances than "normal".  I'm 
not sure what that means exactly, perhaps you could shed some 
light?  Is it that pistons, for example, should be within a certain 
number of grams of the same weight?

TIA

-David
