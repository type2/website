Subject: Re: [T2] sealant for pushrod tube seals >>> NONE

Since the only thing I had access to was silicone RTV and I don't want a 
messy cleanup next time, I went with oil for this change.  As of now, 
the bottom of the engine is dry, which is a welcome sight.  Should be 
interesting to see how long it lasts.  I'll document this and the next 
time they start leaking I'll post a message up.  I used the brown seals, 
which I believe are the Viton seals.  The previous ones were red, not 
sure which brand.  I *think* they came out of the gasket kit...

Thanks!
Mike
