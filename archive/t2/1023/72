Subject: Sliding door maintenance...

Hey guys,

    I want to make sure my sliding door is in good shape and doesn't fall off
like in Little Miss Sunshine. My sliding door does slide easy, but it's not
necessarily smooth. It feels as if the rollers are uneven. I've greased them,
and that did help some, but it just doesn't feel as smooth as it should. I'm
sure (just guessing here) when it was new, it probably slid just as smooth
(more or less) as a modern sliding door on a minivan does now, right? The
other thing is, when I attempt to close the door, I have to push hard, one
hand on the handle, and the other hand pushing the rear of the door against it
so that when it closes it properly latches the rear of the door as well.

I also notice that when I try to open the door, I turn the handle, and
literally... 4-5 seconds will go by and then "click" and the door slides open.

I find it very difficult to close the door from the inside as well.

Are there any adjustments that I need to make or any typical wear parts that I
need to replace?


Thanks guys!

Todd
