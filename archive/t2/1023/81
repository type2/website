Tony-

Thank you for the input.  The $4500 price being discussed is low-end 
for the proposed engine ($6500 high end).  That being said, even the 
$4500 is supposed to be "a lot of motor" -- turn-key, balanced, 
blue-printed, etc.

No, I'm not excited about paying $4500 - $6500 for an 
engine.  However, I am excited about getting an engine in which I can 
have confidence.
