Subject: solid lifters on a hydraulic-grind cam?

List, 

What are the possible future ramifications of running
a set of solid lifters against a cam designed for
hydraulics?

I'm running solids in my 1.8 against a reground hyd
cam that was sold to me as a "universal grind" - seems
to be fine (about 20k miles on it now), so im
wondering if i can just pop this extra set of solids
i've got into the bores of this 2l im rebuilding
rather than try to score replacements for the one or
two that have gone soft.


tis, 
clark
