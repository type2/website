Let me suggest you phone up Bob Mc Donald of The Boston Engine Exchange.
I talked to him twice before deciding to have him build an engine for our 
'71.
The engine he built for us is as reliable as the day is long.  In the 5 or 
so years
 since he built it nothing more than routine maintenance has been needed.
I'd say it's at least worth a phone call or two.  www.bostonengine.com
