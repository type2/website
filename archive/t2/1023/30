Subject: Engine Tin Puzzle

Hi Gangie,

I am in the process of putting the PS of my engine back together after
having to do some major surgery on the head.

Is there a diagram that will help in putting all the tins back together in
the "correct" order? Last thing I want to do is put something together that
I will have to take apart again.

TIA
