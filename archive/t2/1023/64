Subject: GEN light stays on?!

Hey guys,

     I've got a 1973 VW Bus with an 1800cc motor. I've recently replaced the main harness with a 1972 harness. I've also replaced everything behind the dash with my own wiring that I bought from "It's a Snap" while doing the best I could to re-wire the original fuse block as correctly as I could. 

Everything works, the headlights, parking lights, brake lights, reverse, gauge lights, etc. The rest of my gauges seem to work correctly, the fuel gauge, the oil pressure light, etc. 

Now, I've put together my gauges from a variety of different VW Busses. I have my generator indicator light in the gauge cluster itself (at about the 7-8 oclock mark on the gauge). I seem to recall though, that the generator warning light was actually on this little black connector that plugged into the face of the gauge cluster. I don't have ANY wiring hooked up to that little connector (there are about 5 or 6 connectors on it). Since I was basically starting from complete scratch with this Bus, I bypassed a lot of things that I felt were somewhat unnecessary. I am not questioning the VW engineers, but looking at the wiring schematics were rather daunting, and anything that I felt I could simplify, I did.

Like I said, everything works, is properly fused, and or relayed.

I have two questions:

1 - How is the generator light supposed to be properly wired. It stays on all the time when I'm driving around, but I keep a trickle charger on the car when it's not in use so I don't really know if it's losing a charge. The light just stays on all the time.

2 - What is that other connector / light indicator that plugs into the face of the gauge panel? 


Thanks!!!

Todd
