Subject: RE: [T2] [Q] Bay Window Paint Scheme

David,

This opinion is from my training as a fine artist and designer.

The best way to paint a bay like a splitty is to buy a splitty. Honestly it
looks really awkward because of the horizontal line that runs all the way
around the mid-line. It isn't proportional and the splitty curve is in
direct contrast to the more modernist design of the bay.

I'll p-mail you some photos of a bay I bought for parts, then crushed.

Subject: [T2] [Q] Bay Window Paint Scheme

Greetings-

I'm restoring a '71 (bay window), but *really* like the earlier 
(splitty) paint schemes -- the curve on the front is cool.  Does 
anyone have photos of a bay window bus that's been painted this 
way?  I don't know if there's a way to make it look right, but I'd 
like to see some pictures.

-David
