 Wayne -

If memory serves and upon checking my old parts fiche reference, the 1979
left coverplate is a one-year only animal, so Paul's "quick fix" may be your
only alternative.  I did a quick check of my parts stash database and
unfortunately I don't have this piece right now.  Gonna look for some this
weekend at the local Pick & Pull.  I have them (used of course) from time to
time.

> > I have a '79 bus with an original A/C compressor... I am planning to
remove the engine in the spring and while it's out I am going to remove the
old compressor.  I'll need to replace the tin on the left side of the motor
(it has a cutout for the compressor) - anyone have a spare piece they are
willing to part with?

There are 3 different versions:

1) 74-early 75 with the pre-heat pipe connection.

2) 72-73 and mid 75 to 78 and 79 Fed.

3) 79 Calif.

He needs to specify if his 79 is Fed version or Calif version.......

I can post pics on the Samba of them, if anyone wants to see them.

I believe I have 1 and 2.....
