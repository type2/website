I think one of the best diagnostic tools is a vacuum gauge... for carbs, it
doubles as a fuel pressure gauge.

It is sooooo easy to install a vac gauge, and it can tell you state of
valves,, timing,, fuel economy...

A valve seat drops all of a sudden...

ignition coils can be a bugger to diagnose... but they seem to corrupt all
of a sudden.. it would be nice if they just failed!

when I have these problems,, I install a dwell meter,, a vac gauge,, and
strobe timing light.... once I know that the vac is high and steady.. the
dwell is at 50.. and the timing is where is should be,,,, then I start
scratching my head,,,
