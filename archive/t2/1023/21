Subject: strange turn signal brake light action

hoping for a quick diagnoses on this.  just got my 75 engine back from
the rebuilder and have been out cruising around for the past two days.
 the weather's been perfect and the cops have been either less than
observant or feeling especially generous since i have not been pulled
over yet due to my expired tags.

in attempt to remedy this breach of the law i went to get my safety
inspection.  i failed.

i put in a new turn signal switch and now both my left and right
signals work.  before only my left had functioned properly.  the right
or passenger signal would stutter and so on.  with the new switch now
both signals work fine until i put on the brakes.  when the brakes are
applied the right blinker and brake light flutter and stutter and
carry on in a manner that will get you failed (-at-) a safety inspection.
oddly enough my brights won't stay on either.

this is a new switch on the column.

where should i start looking first?  this is an easy fix, right?

please be an easy fix.  i just got goethe back after six months of her
not running and now she runs and drives better than she did when i
first met her three yrs. ago.


thanks for reading my meandering prose,  feel free to add
presumptuous, pompous, pitiful.
