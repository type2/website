Wayne,

Back when we had a 79 I ran into the same situation.  I welded on  some 
pieces of thin steel (from my local hardware store) to get the basic shape I 
needed and them trimmed the repair to exact shape and size upon 
installation.  Of course the last step was to give that piece of tin a good 
coat of paint.
