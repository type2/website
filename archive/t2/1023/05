Subject: Re: [T2] '74 1800 alternator bracket

Sid asked:


Can some one send me or point me to a place where I can see what a '74 westy
1800 alternator bracket looks like?  That part was missing from my motor,
and now I am at that installation point, and cannot find a pix in any of my
mauals, because I believe it bottom mounted differently.  I can't find one
here where I reside, and  if I could get a pix, I could fabricate one.  It
is the one "hidden" behind the tin, and is usually only seen through that
little adjustment "plate" where you adjust fanbelt tension.  A digital
picture would be great!  Thanks.
