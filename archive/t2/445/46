Subject: cam gear numbers - anyone?!

Does nobody know about cam gear numbers?  I know many of you have put 
new cams in your engines.  There's gotta be someone out there that knows 
about cam numbering.  This is a completely stock rebuild, so I'm not 
doing anything fancy here... more info below.

thanks,
Mike
