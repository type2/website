this is confusion caused by type 1 versus type IV. the sump plate on a t1 is
in the middle of the sump proper, away from the dipstick. on a t4, what is
commonly referred to as the sump plate (also called "inspection plate") is
right in the well where the dipstick also lives.

a trivial note: it seems this inspection plate has a purpose other than
holding the 914 sender - in europe you find t4 motors with factory installed
"block heaters" which replace this plate. i have never laid eyes on one, and
i am surprised we never had them here in the great white north, but in
nordic europe they are common, i have been told.
