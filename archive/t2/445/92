Subject: Oil temp gauge-make your own $12 dipstick version!

I am the originator of the "Meat thermometer" dipstick oil temp gauge-
About $12 at the market.  I believe that senders bolted to the sump
plate give incorrect readings, since the plate can be washed with
rain/slush and carry away more heat letting the oil seem cooler at the
bottom than it really is.  
   I used the tiny gauge with the sender tube attached to the gauge.  I
just put one in my daughter's 75 bus. It is only about 1.25" across and
sits on the left dash surface behind our inspection sticker, held down
by a tiny piece of doublestick tape (the good 3-m Clear kind). You can
leave it on all the time and replace the little button battery once a
year.  Nifty to see how hot the engine still is 3 hours after parking-
and explains how it can help keep the rear bed warm in winter camping! 
     The case is designed to split to replace the battery, and it was
easy to pop the sender tube and clip the wires where they solder to the
chip.  Using a multi-wire shielded cable (Home Depot- I use it for the
oil pressure gauge and tach also) I extended the wiring to go down the
dash side where it screws to the bus, behind the kick plate, and down
under the bus to the rear.  The sender tube is too short and I used a
piece of 5/32" brass tube (hobby shop) slid over this and epoxied in
place with about 2.5" of the original sender exposed.   Prepare the tube
by cutting a piece of brass plate about 2"X3/4"  and drilling a 5/32"
hole near the end.  Sand/round in nicely as this is the part you grab to
pull it out.  Solder it to the tube with about 1/4" left sticking out
one side; over this goes a piece of tubing to prevent kinking of the
wiring.  Remember to add the tubing over the wires if you are not using
a conenctor or solder joint above the wiring.  I probed the sender hole
to measure the distance to the bottom.   Cut the brass tube so the "Stop
plate) at the top plus the overlap lets it equal an insertion about 1/8-
1/4" off the bottom.  Mark the overlap on the sender tube.  The extended
wiring is soldered to the sender wires (staggered to make it thinner),
and wrapped by a bit of tape. Then it is all glopped up with epoxy and
slid down the tube, including epoxy where the wires come out the top. 
Wear gloves for this part!  I keep the original dipstick to check the
oil, as it needs the flat edge ground 1/2 way in to give a reading.
