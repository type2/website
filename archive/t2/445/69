Do check the prices at CIP1.com. I found them to be the best for VDO gauges
even before their 5% of web order and they have the "nla" 10x1 hose
(sometimes out of stock but currently in stock).

Not sure. Give Walter a call and find out.

* The 914 plate is special in that it also has a cover that keeps the air
flow under the bus from cooling the sender and throwing off the reading:

Your case also need to have this cutout in order to get an accurate reading:
