Oh yeah!  This Babelfish translation sounds like the instruction 
manuals to old Japanese model cars I used to try to put together...
"(Possession) Higuchi store way over  rider (classic) Ota way over 
rider (D ground U)
Item headlight + plated foil cap  wrapping paint + seat cover + plated 
foil cap + emblem of wrapping  paint + outside
Interior paint + lining re-covering + sun light/write visor + tail  
lens cap"

Very informative.  And:
"Dress rise of interior "

And my favorite:
"It is just one example of the customer whom you  conclude at this 
corporation.
The full order which pursues your originality is possible."

I want one.
