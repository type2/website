Subject: 72 Elec. Weirdness

Anybody seen this problem: Turn off key, motor continues to run and horn 
blows. Turn key back on, horn goes off and motor still running. Use gear 
and clutch to stop motor, turn off key, all things nominal. I will be 
looking over the wiring diagrams and do a bit of looking around, but if 
someone else has seen this particular weirdness, please provide the 
fault/solution. This is a bone stock 72. Thanks,
