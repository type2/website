I'm assuming it's because the sump plate sender is being cooled by the air 
passing over it...  Yes, the thermocouple is in the end of the sender and 
immersed in oil, but it's still in contact with the rest of the sump plate 
sender, which is being cooled.

*shrug*

From what I've seen, the senders react significatly different and give 
significantly different readings.

If someone has a spare VDO oil temp gauge, i'd be happy to do a more 
rigorous analysis once i get the windshield back in my bus.
