   Thanks for that reminder David.
    The little yellow fuse dangling by the coil is the 3 Amp fuse I was 
referring to in
    my last post. It is inline with the ignition wire and 
    serves to protect most of the circuits activated by the ignition switch.
    A good, inexpensive safety measure for even a standard setup.
