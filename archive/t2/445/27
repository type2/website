Hi All,

   I have an ok running 2.0 ltr motor that was in my '75 camper.
I salvaged it from a running bus that had 50K miles on it.

  The compression is better than 100 lbs all the way around.

    I DO NOT have any FI parts for this motor. Please don't email me asking
for FI parts  as I do not have any.

    I believe however the lifters need to be replaced with solids or they
should be rebuilt as the motor runs erraticly until the lifters pump up.

 Comes with alternator, sheet metal, flywheel, disc and pressure plate.

 I would like to get $300 for all the above.  Email me with questions

  Pickup in Cleveland Heights, OH 44118

Mark
