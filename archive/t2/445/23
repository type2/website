Subject: Oil Filters??

My 1970 westy w/ 1776 has a full flow oil filter installed. I've always used a
Bosch oil Filter #72174. That's what was on there when I got it, so that's
what I've always used. This filter is for a 88-91 Jetta. Here's my question:
    I'm having a tough time locating one in town. The place I usually get the
from is out and won;t have any for a while. Can I use a filter from my FLAPS
(Fram, etc.) vs. the Bosch filter or am I asking for trouble.

BTW I'm not trying to start some long mean thread on oil filter types here. A
yes or no answer would do it for me.
