FWIW, I've found the sump plate sender reads significantly cooler than 
other senders on my type-1 engine.
Other senders i've used:  dipstick sender and pressure relief valve 
sender.

Also, tapping the sump plate isn't as big a deal as you'd think.  (I 
hemmed and hawed on it for ages then finally just did it and it's been 
fine).
