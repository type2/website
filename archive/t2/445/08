Subject: Fw: [T2] MegaSquirt on westy?

Hi Mike,

 I already thought of a stock FI-system, but our buses never came with FI in
Germany (only dual solex). Naturally you can't get a catalytic
converter-setup(spelled right?) for the bus. The only FI-system that bolts
right on is the one for the Porsche 914/4 2.0 liter engine. Those are very
rare on junkjards. (Sure one could still buy them at the Porsche-dealer, but
they are sort of expensive.). I think I'll try the Megasquirt-system.

Did you already have a FI-engine? If not, how did you mount the fuel line
back to the tank? What did you connect to the coolant-sensor-input? I'm
thinking of a CHT-sensor. Since german buses came with heads without
CHT-sensors, what would you do: Drilling a hole in the fins and attaching a
sensor or using the sensors that are screwed under the spark-plugs?

Thanks a lot,

Timo
