Subject: OIL LEAKS

Hello everyone,

It has been a-little while since I last posted a message and am feeling kinda
left out.
I know that this has probably been asked a few hundred times but anyways...
What are the common places for oil leaks? i know about the valve covers and
pushrod tubes
but is there any other common areas that are typical oil leak spots?

Thanks for your help.

Darren
