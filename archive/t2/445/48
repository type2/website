Subject: Re: [T2] cam gear numbers - anyone?!

Mike,  You are right, most of us older builders check
the numbers on the cam shaft gears, like the one I
just finished putting together, it had a cam with a -7
stamped on it, lobes shot so I had to get a new cam,
the new cam was like you said no numbers on it, so I
had to give it the roll test to see if the gears were
compatable. The test is to put all the bearings in the
distrubtor half of the case, oil well and install the
crank and cam shaft, turn the crankshaft around two
times each way, the camshaft should remain seated, if
it kicks out change the gear on the crankshaft and try
again(I might add I have extra crank gears to do this
with). I hope this made some sort of sense to you. It
was easy 20 years ago to get a matched gear set, not
now.  Phil
