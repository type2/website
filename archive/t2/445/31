Hi Doktor,

LOL, that sounds like a real crowd-pleaser. Does the horn work normally 
otherwise?

I have not seen this problem in a bus. (Disregard all hypotheses from 
this point forward if all you want is direct personal experience)

But... I had a Volvo 240 that I wired fog lights into, and I soon 
discovered it wouldn't turn off with the fog lights on. You could 
bump-start it with no key if you switched the fog-lights on. Of course 
you couldn't drive it very far with the steering locked, but it would 
start.

I would suspect the ignition has been rewired somehow and when the 
engine is off there is a voltage differential that is powering the coil 
through the horn. The fact that a live wire from the horn travels up 
the steering column helps support this theory.

Happy trails,
