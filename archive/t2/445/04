Subject: CV joints on VW Bus: changing the allen key

I have to change all the rubber boots on the cv joints on my bus which I use on dirt roads in Kenya. I hate the allen key / hex bolts in there. The socket slips, I bust my knuckles and if I'm out from base there is no-one with the tools to remove them. Can I change them to ordinary bolts???? What should I look out for? any warnings if I try to do this.
 
Last time I had to change them I had a CV joint self destruct at 9500 ft above sea level in the Aberderes National Park and had to get towed down 6000 feet resulting in brake failure...fun trip.
