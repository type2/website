Out-of-the-box idea:  AAA Gold membership tows for free for 100 miles.  
If you are at all inclined to be a 'goldmember' (which ain't such a bad 
idea for a Bus pilot...) and you don't want to tow things habitually 
with your Bus or Jetta, (I don't) then let them do it for you.  Just an 
idea...

Good morning,

Can someone please advise a safe, legal & affordable way to tow a scrap
Jetta for 100 miles ?

I have located a nice scrap 1987Jetta for 60$USD that I'd love to keep 
for
spare parts, however it needs to be towed to a good storage space.  It
seems to have four good tires and could probably be towed on all fours.

I will tow behind my bus or behind another Jetta.  Are tow bars 
available
for purchase?  Are straps w/ some lights legal on the highway?  All help
appreciated.

Thank you,
Shawn.
