Richard: I had the engine in my Westy fill up with fuel, to the 
extent that when I removed the valve covers of the engine on a test 
stand, my shoes got washed. I was running the stock fuel pump and 
dual Kads. I never did determine the cause of this.

Could you elaborate a bit on your post? Why does the electric allow 
flow but the stock doesn't?

Thanks, jack
