Subject: Oil temp sender/sump plate

Hey all,

It's come time for some gauges for the bus. I am planning on oil temp, oil
pressure, and cylinder head temp. I have been able to find everything
including, the NLA from VDO, oil pressure sender hose adapter so I dont have
to cut the tin. What I cant seem to find is the sump plate for the oil temp
sender. I dont want to have to drill and tap my current sump plate but would
rather find the one that I think came off of the 914's. Does anyone have a
source for these. I checked Pelican Parts but they didn't have them. Is this
something that I will have to find in the salvage yard? Is this the same thing
found here at BusBoys http://www.bus-boys.com/bbvdo.htm#tempoil , third one
down for $21.94?

Thanks for any suggestions.
