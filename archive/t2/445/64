I would suggest wiring your radio to a non switched/constant 12v source
under the dash. If I remember correctly this is the way they were wired from
the factory. I think the cig lighter is non switched but dont hold me to
that. That way you dont have to have the key on at all to listen to the
radio.  Just make sure to remember to turn it off when you exit the bus.
This is the way mine is wired and it works well.
