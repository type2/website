Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

Hi Todd,

First off, stock configurations are covered in EVERY bus manual. Every 
aftermarket fuel pump install is going to be different, so a mechanic 
looking for a problem (fuel system or electrical system) won't be 
completely familiar with your one-of-a-kind setup. (Ie, where does 
*that* wire from the coil go? Hmmmm...)  I'm not always the only one 
working on my bus.

Secondly, an electric fuel pump might not stop running when the bus 
does. This summer I installed an electric pump in my 2L upgrade engine. 
On my maiden voyage I had a fitting come loose on one of the carbs. The 
engine died, and I coasted to the roadside to discover fuel pouring out 
on the road, and lots of steam (fuel vapour) coming out the rear vents. 
Luckily I was able to get my family out of the bus and turn the key off 
before anything tragic occurred. If the engine had a mechanical pump, 
the fuel flow would have stopped as soon as the engine died, and we 
would have been at a far lesser risk.

Note to self: Next time, try to get the bus engine installed in time to 
take a maiden voyage without the family and a full load of camping gear!

That's my experience, YMMV.

Happy trails,
