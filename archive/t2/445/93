Subject: RE: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

Yes I use one on my typeI engine.  Cheap insurance.  Its pretty darn
simple, but works.  Watch out though, the first one I got was calibrated
to some temp much higher than 227 F (what it should be).  Good idea to
test in boiling water before installing.  Also a good idea to wire it to
another light besides your oil light (like you did) so you don't have to
wonder when that light comes on!
