Subject: Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

Hey guys,

     Quick question. Whenever anyone asks me about suggestions they can
do to make their car run better, etc, I always suggest switching to an
electric fuel pump instead of the mechanical fuel pump. (For carbureted
cars). Now, I just want to make sure, because I'm using them in ALL my
carbureted cars right now... is there any reason why a mechanical fuel
pump (other than push starting) would be better than an electric fuel
pump? 
Seems to me, an electric fuel pump is totally the way to go, better
starts, no loss of fuel pressure or vapor lock or any of that other
stuff.

Just curious..


Todd
