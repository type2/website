In my limited testing of three senders on the same VDO gauge and 
nominally similar conditions, i found the temp dipstick to read the 
highest temperature.

the pressure relief valve sender read ~5 degrees lower than the dipstick.
the sump plate sender read ~15 degrees lower than the dipstick.

If one assumes that:
	-the temp dipstick is reading the "real" oil temp (???) 
	-the sump on the t-iv gets the same cooling as on a t-1 engine
	- 240-250 is an acceptable temp for a t-iv engine (???)

225-235 is probably the max you want to be reading off your sump sender.

That's a lot of assumptions though.
