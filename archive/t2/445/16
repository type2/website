I have had 2 things cause this on my 79. 1 is the temp sensor II. the
other is an afm that had a worn area on the contact and caused a
certain range to get a bad connection and "lurch". The sensor is a
small device on the drivers side of the engine that screws into the
head. It has a single wire connection. It is tested by measuring the
resistance (in ohms) at particular temperatures. You might want to try
and see if the little bugger is loose (especially when hot) which
would cause a bad connection.

anyone who has horror stories about FI has simply not spent the time
to read the FI section of the bentley. It's a very simple system that
can be tested completely with just miminal tools. if you don't have
the bentley, get it.
