Off the top of my head:

	* Oil filter -- I currently have a leak here on my '76.
	  This type of leak should be easy to remedy - do an oil
	  change, and replace the filter, making sure to clean up
	  the sealing surface on the case, and get a nice film of
	  oil on the filter gasket before installing the new filter.
	  Make sure no old gasket material remains on the crank's
	  sealing surface.

	* Oil screen fitting -- On Type 1 engines, I think there is
	  a gasket on the oil screen plate (someone please correct
	  me if I'm wrong; it's been about 12 years since I worked
	  on a Type 1 engine).  On the Type 4 engine, I think there's
	  just a single bolt that holds the oil screen; not sure if
	  there's a gasket on that (I've only had my Westy for a bit
	  over a month now, and haven't pulled mine off yet).

	* My mechanic says that there's a seal at the oil cooler that
	  can go bad, and has suggested that this could be the source of
	  a minor leak that my '76 has.  It's apparently quite difficult
	  to get at this seal without pulling the engine if your engine
	  is Type 4.

	* Front main seal -- You really don't want this one to go,
	  as I think it will soak your clutch with oil when it does.

	* Filler neck -- PO of my '76 had a problem with a crack or a
	  hole in the filler neck (which is plastic), which was causing
	  a total hemorrhage of oil.

	* Dipstick -- if it's not on tight, etc.  Make sure the dipstick
	  neck/hole/whatever doesn't have a crack in it (eek!).

I'm sure there are more places where we can leak.  These are just the ones
that immediately pop into my head.
