I had the same problem recently with my 76 stock FI and it drove me nuts.
It ended up being the bent elbow vacuum hose that went into the aux air
regulator.  You can see it in this picture

I checked everything fuel and electrical related.  Finally one day I was
checking my vacuum lines for the 80th time and the hard plastic elbow that
was connected to my aux air regulator came off and underneath it has started
to rot out.  Mine even got to the point that my idle was erratic and I asked
the list about it.  Once I replaced that elbow hose everything has been
running great.
