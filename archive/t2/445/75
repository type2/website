or another way to do it:

use the power wire from the "key reminder" buzzer relay. there is a wire in
the relay which becomes hot only when the key is in the ignition. if you use
that wire to power your radio, then all you have to do to have the radio
power "switched" on is to put the key in the ignition (no turn). it really
works perfectly and prevents coil burn-out, and is a better solution than an
"always on" radio, which can lead to accidental battery drainage from
leaving the radio on mistakenly.

by the way, jamie rivers originally suggested this.
