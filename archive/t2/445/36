greg,

those are really good points. the only way to wire an electric pump is with
a failsafe relay which cuts power if the engine quits. good electric pump
installs (factory or otherwise) also incorporate some sort of rollover
switch, so if the vehicle rolls, motor still running, the pump will also
stop.
