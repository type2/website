Mike,

There is a procedure for this because apparently nobody pays
attention to cam gear numbering any more.

I may be a little rusty on this but...

You lay your crank and cam in the case and rotate the crank
while watching the cam gear.  If it tries to climb out of the bearings, 
then it is too tight and you need a smaller cam gear.

I believe that there are some "backlash" numbers in the manual as well, 
just like measuring the oil pump gears to determine if you need new ones.

Sorry I don't remember more, but I think the real problem is going to be
where to get a different gear if yours is too big or small.

I would call webcam back and ask them how to tell...

Cheers, dave
