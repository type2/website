You would be surprised to find out that there are some of these Subaru
Sambars here in the US.  They were imported here from 1968-1970.  They were
air cooled, 2 stroke, oil injected, 2 cylinder, 360 cc, producing about 26
hp.

I have two sambar vans and two sambar trucks.  I am hoping that between all
the parts I have enough to restore one van and one truck. The van will be
painted like my 78 bus and I will call the bus "me" and the sambar "mini
me".

Here is a link to the subaru 360 club in the US:

Kindest Regards,

Mark
78 Bus (subaru ea-81 candidate)
69 Subaru 360 Sambar Van (x2)
69 Subaru 360 Sambar Truck (x2)
