There are eight wires on that coil. One extra is for a 3Amp safety fuse, one 
is for the deep cycle Altima charging relay and two are for the electronic 
ignition.
The inline water proof marine fuses off the yellow top Altima are for all the 
additional circuits to the added outlets, the fans and when touring, had a CB 
and a separate 250 watt linear amplifier hooked to it.

   If you ever get high Scott...one comes in handy when driving in the 
Colorado      Rockies or even to the Grand canyon. 
   This camper has been built on the advice and counsel of all the VW sages 
on the type 2 list and the general community advisors over a period of a couple 
of years. It is hoped that someone on this list will get it and enjoy it.
