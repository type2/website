Also, use the first nut or two without the washers, in order to start the
head going on. Then when You've moved it in a bit, remove the nuts and put
their washers on, then reinstall the nuts. Don't forget to torque using
the proper two patterns once all nuts and washers are on. Those washers
are special and cannot be replaced with any other washers. Be aware of
that.
