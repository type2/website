Seat upgrade as in rebuilding your seats?
Or seat upgrade as in replacing them with something newer?

'Something newer' would be Vanagon seats, since they are a slide-in swap for the 78 seats. But if you are
tall, 6' +, they will make you sit higher in the bus and you will have to hunch down to see.

You want to remove the 2 upper mattress's?   They are held in with snaps along the front edge. Undo the snaps
and slide the cushions out.

As a Westy in 78, you had 2 plaid colors in the USA: P-22 [non deluxe] was green plaid, would have been a sage
green westy and P-27 [deluxe] was brown plaid. would have been a Mexico beige westy.

The brown plaid is the toughest to find. Why do you want re-upholster the uppers?
