If you are just looking for heat while driving, Make sure all your heater 
box pipes and tubing is in tacked and sealed tight. I had no heat in my bus 
before I replaced the heater boxes and pipes. Now I have great heat in the 
bus, While driving. I have a propane furnace connected for when parked, but 
it eats a lot of propane, recommend gas heater for camping.
