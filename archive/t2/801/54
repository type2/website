Subject: Oil Pressure Switch Q

I couldn't find this answer in the archives so...

When the oil pressure switch wire is disconnected, does the light just never
come on? I take it that the switch grounds until sufficient pressure is
measured?

Mine's always been disconnected but I'm determined to get it working this
weekend. I even have a new switch if the one in the bus is bad. =)
