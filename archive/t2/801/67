Subject: new rings with used cylinders

Hi everyone,



During the past couple of weeks, I have disassembled my 1600dp to have
the machine shop take care of some issues for me. My cylinders besides
being dirty outside look great on the inside, no scoring or scuffing. I
realize I should buy all new cylinders and pistons but I lack the monies
to take care of that. From the advice of a fellow list member, I am
advised to re-ring the pistons. Putting new rings on the pistons while
using the old cylinders makes me wonder if the cylinders should be
honed. The compression was fine when I pulled the engine and the pistons
look swell as well. The question is, do I have the machine shop hone the
cylinders or do I just put the new rings on and go with the cylinders
sans machine shop? I have looked through the archives and cannot find a
definitive answer, they range from just use everything as it was pulled
to buy everything new, with everything in between.



Thank you for the input,



Max Bronsema
