Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Wind Shield - Window Removal

The front and rear "glass" sits on the outside face of the lip.

If you cut from the outside (easier access, less contortion) the glass comes
out by itself, then the seal.

If you cut from the inside (have fun down in the corner of the dashboard) then
the seal and glass come out together.

I always go outside, just preference.

My problem is not cracking/detonating the glass in the process.
