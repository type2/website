Hi folks:

I am facing the same thing.  Since August my bus has been the daily 
driver, though relief is in sight.  I had a rusty leaky mess of an 
Eberspracher in mine which was quickly removed.  My questions:

Is this technology safe?  Shutoff switches etc.
Does it use a lot of Gas?  How efficient are the BN2's
What is a BN4 and does it fit in a Westy?.

I went to Eberspracher's website and checked it out.  Are any of the new 
products available in the US and fit in a Westy?  My German was not good 
enough and the Google Translate version of the page was laughable at best.

BEN
