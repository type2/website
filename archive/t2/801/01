Something as small as a wheel puts you in the ball park for DIY
powdercoating with an old oven. A local VW friend picked up a kit

be sure to look around. Also, the 16 rims for $40 powercoating estimate is
such an incredible bargain I wonder if the same deal could be had years after
that original cost? Either way rates, minimums and costs vary from city to
city. There is no way I can even powdercoat one rim for $40 where I live.
