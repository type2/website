Max,

You should always hone with new rings. You want the cylinder walls to have a
good "tooth" to set the rings. As long as the ring lands are good - there is
a spec for this in the Bentley where you insert a feeler into the land,
problem is you need the new rings to do the measurement - then you are fine
to just re-ring. Make sure you use good rings, like Deves. Hastings are
fine, Grant are not very good. The Brazilian ones are marginal.
