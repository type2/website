I like Grant rings, they are nice and soft and seat quickly. What problems
have you had?

Max,

 

You should always hone with new rings. You want the cylinder walls to have a

good "tooth" to set the rings. As long as the ring lands are good - there is

a spec for this in the Bentley where you insert a feeler into the land,

problem is you need the new rings to do the measurement - then you are fine

to just re-ring. Make sure you use good rings, like Deves. Hastings are

fine, Grant are not very good. The Brazilian ones are marginal.
