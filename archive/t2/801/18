Hi Ben,

The BN-4 was fitted to the bus from 68-74. It is usually installed on  
the left side of the engine compartment. It will fit a westy or a  
passenger van. The BN-2 is from the beetle, the BA-4 model that was  
fitted to the 411 and 412 models. It is no longer sold new, and AFAIK  
is not available as a kit.

The technology is safe and efficient if it is properly maintained.  
(The same rules apply to your bus) Links to the manuals for operation  
and maintenance are available from the type2 library.

There's a North American distributor of Eberspacher products:

They currently sell a gas version of their diesel heater which is  
very popular with the 18-wheeler market.


Happy trails,

Hi folks:

I am facing the same thing.  Since August my bus has been the daily  
driver, though relief is in sight.  I had a rusty leaky mess of an  
Eberspracher in mine which was quickly removed.  My questions:

Is this technology safe?  Shutoff switches etc.
Does it use a lot of Gas?  How efficient are the BN2's
What is a BN4 and does it fit in a Westy?.

I went to Eberspracher's website and checked it out.  Are any of the  
new products available in the US and fit in a Westy?  My German was  
not good enough and the Google Translate version of the page was  
laughable at best.
