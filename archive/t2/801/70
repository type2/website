Subject: C.O. adjustment ?

Does altitude have an effect on carbon monoxide in the exhaust? I noticed last
night that my Bentley for 80 to 85 Vanagons has a graph for C.O. volume % vs.
altitude in the water-cooled digijet section. There is no explanation for the
chart or reference to it in the text. The graph indicates a Co% at sea level
in a range of about .3 to 1.1, at 1640 feet the range increases to about 1.2
to 2, at 3281 feet it indicates aprox. 2.3 to 3.4 . the highest level
indicated is at 6562 feet 6.0 to 7.2 .

Is there any one here with experience setting c.o. at a lower elevation then
checking it again at a higher elevation on an air-cooled AFC system? I am
curious because I live at 7000 feet and have never been able to get C.O. %
below 7.6%. My plugs typically are light brown to tan now that the engine is
broke in, indicating a reasonable A/F ratio I hope, and the engine seems to
run well. Is it that at this high altitude 7.6% is a good reading?

I'm planning a trip to Phoenix later this month and plan to take my Gunson
Gastester with me. I know it is not the best device for setting A/F ratio but
it's all I have. I'm curious to see what kind of readings I get around 2000
Ft. compared to 7000 Ft. But then again at some times of the year I suspect
Phoenix air has a C.O. % around 9.9 (SMOG valley).
