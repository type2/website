Subject: Re: [T2] Headliner removal

If you are referring to a Westy, remove all the screws around the edge. 
  Pull down the center and check for mouse nests and clean them out 
before they fall on you.  Unhook the light wires and/or remove the light 
by popping it out.  Bend down the center to "slack" the arch and strike 
one side to push the panel out of the edge moulding.

  making a mess out of the headliner.
