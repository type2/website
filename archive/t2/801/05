Subject: Re: [T2] Sandblasting cabinet

hey Guys  What we did was to use the rear cargo area in a old scrap bay bus 
cut 2 holes in the rear door for the gloves , drilled some air holes in the 
side scoops mounted a fan on the roof and a drain in the spare tire hole , ran 
some plywood across the back and presto one big sandbasting cabinet   I use my 
VW air compressor for sandblasting . Only problem has been that the glss has 
slowly been etched  later  Mark Dearing
