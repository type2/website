Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Wind Shield - Window Removal

heavens to betsy. all the response to the thread got me onto pulling one of
my windshields for some rust repair. it was pretty easy i suppose because
the gasket is only about five years old and quite pliable. i started in the
top corners from the inside, then worked back and forth across the top until
it came loose. it took about 45 minutes with real gentle pressure, no tools.
