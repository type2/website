<Has anyone tried or used the 12v ceramic heaters?>

A TOTAL joke. Neither heated anything well, nor cleared the fog off of the inside of the glass. It did create a spot in the center of the windshield about 4" in diameter that was clear. 

Want to stay warm on 12 volts? Electric blanket - 12 v version or motorcycle heated clothing...
