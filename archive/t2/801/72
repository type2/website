Yes.

At 5,000 ft. above sea level, there is 14% less oxygen in a given volume of air. At 10,000 ft. that amount drops to 30% less. Not only is the engine getting less oxygen by mass it's also getting less by volume because the atompheric pressure is lower and this means the cylinders fill up with less air during each cycle

Seems to rich for FI at any altitude. Do you adjust the AFM using the bypass screw only? If so, you'll only tweak the %CO. You need to adjust the wiper to really dial it in:

If that's your tester I wouldn't use it as a basis for making adjustment unless you can compare it to a calibrated tester at the shop first.
