>Volvo's home. There's a short somewhere. I had the GWB idling and jumpers
to
the volvo. 13.46 or whatever volts would drop to 11.3 if I turned the
starter on the Volvo. And STICK THERE even after I removed the key until I
pulled one jumper clamp up and then put it back on. Really odd. Something's
shorting and stays shorting until power drops. A relay maybe? Hmm... The OD
relay's been bad for a while... Anybody got one?<

We had a Volvo 480 with a similar infuriating problem .. we tried everything
new alternator, battery etc etc ..

It turned out to be the "Megafuse" which was an 80Amp fuse on the output of
the alternator which had broken down and had high resistance ..
