Y'all,

The flimsy shreds of buscontent I'm going to tie this togther with involve
today's earlier thread about the levels of "maintenance" listmembers are
willing to apply to our buses.

The guy who sold me my first bus has evolved to early 80's subaru vehicles and
their unique folklore.

As I sit here, hoping it stops raining long enough tonight to bust another
panel's worth of spraypaint on my bus, I can't help but know that some of you
will appreciate the parallels of this man's saga with your own.

An excerpt:

"First there was spray paint. Along came the Cherry Bomb. Next there was
bigger wheels and coil spring boosters. Then there was body modification:
bolted in street signs for structural integrity."

Good writing, bad engineering, great site, enjoy.

Billy
