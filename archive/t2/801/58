Subject: Looks like JBB in a Jeep?

Well it seems that my engine is seized.  78 Bay with 2.0 and Fuel Injection
all factory and 255000 plus miles.

 

It just gave up the ghost today, on my way to church, I walked the last 2
miles.

 

So..  

 

Should I get an engine from here or just run with a new one?

 

Should I get a rebuilt one or rebuild this one?

 

Well..  here we go again..

 

David.
