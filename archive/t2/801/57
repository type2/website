"I am getting ready for next week in pulling the engine/tranny to give 
it a
once over and work that over.  I do not want to totally tear it all 
apart."

Well if you have the ability an knowledge to do the above.. why not do
the
brakes/shocks yourself?

Brakes are pretty easy cept getting the drums off the back can be fun.
Shocks... just hit the bolts with PB blaster and let it work in for
a while.. get your shocks from the bus depot.. bolt em on.
