Hi Dan,

There's a guy in SE Pennsylvania who scraps out vanagons... He sells  
a good pair of used front seats for $200US, shipping not included.   
Email Chris at: JordanVw(-at-)AOL.COM

There are two caveats to the Vanagon seats, BTW. Firstly, they're  
about an inch taller than the stock seat. Only a problem if you have  
really short legs or a very long torso. Secondly, they don't recline  
as far as the late-bay seats, which may bother the passenger if they  
like to nap on a long drive. Since the driver's seat doesn't recline,  
I'd put one there regardless.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
