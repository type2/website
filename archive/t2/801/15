The same company is now called Espar and they have a US headquarters and
numerous US distributors.  Their heaters are available in gas or diesel but
be prepared to spend about $1,000 or more to get one.   Every once in a
while, I call a distributor up and see if I can talk him down.  FWIW, I've
watched eBay and Espar units rarely come up for auction, never saw a
gasoline model yet.  However:  the new ones do not use the battery to run --
only to fire it up.
