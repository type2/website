I have a standard 78 bus but have a canoe on the roof, for safety I had it
measured and WITH the canoe it was 7ft 3in.   consider the canoe is a
little bit higher than the Westy poptop 7 ft would be a REAL TIGHT fit but
as long as things like door openers etc weren't in the way you should be
able to shoehorn it in. but to be on the safe side I would go with 7ft 6in
doors myself  more if you want to actually work on your bus inside.
