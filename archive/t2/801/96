<wow.  $1000 seats.  just when you think you've seen everything.>

$2K for front seats... I onyl paiud about $2500 for the whole dang bus... <grin!> 

Anyhow money saver idea: buy used seats for $50 a pair and have them recovered for $??? and be money ahead. 

Anyone had seats recovered (not slip on covers) and what did you pay? I have upholstery (raw upholstery fabric) and 2 Vanagon seats. Local guy told me $40 to retape a seam on my convertible top (my cost $2) so I fear the worst - price wise...
