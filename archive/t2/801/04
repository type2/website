Subject: Re: [T2] Stud, lower engine mount

Hi Stan,

I've been through exactly that with a 5 rib/2L combination. Double- 
nut the studs and crank them out with a wrench on the lower nut. It  
shouldn't be too difficult. That way you'll know the depth for  
certain. And you're going to have to pull them out eventually in  
order to replace them.
