Subject: need an FI air filter housing bracket

Does anyone have a good bracket to mount a Fuel Injected Air Box to? I 
need one to convert my '74 to fuel injection.

I've been looking for one for a while and haven't come across any FI 
buses to cut one out of.
Let me know your price (or trades).

Alternatively, I saw a kit on a 914 that eliminates the stock airbox on 
an L-Jet system. It had an adapter to connect a cone style (K&N-like) 
filter on the AFM. Anyone have experience with these?

Of course there would need to be a method to secure it in there....can't 
have the whole thing just flopping around connected to the throttle body.


thanks
