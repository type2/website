Hey folks. One last call for anyone who is going to JBB this year. The dates
are Oct 14-16 in Harpers Ferry West Va. The KOA will be releasing the
unreserved sites back into their pool TODAY. If you are planning on coming
make sure you call the KOA and reserve your site today. This way you will
guarantee that you will be in the are of all the other crazy VW people. If you
have any questions feel free to email me at toby.gun(-at-)verizon.net

See you soon

Sharon
