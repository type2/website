my chassis number is 220 2049568
   M codes
02 049 568 E
226 133 025 508
41 4 7862 UD 2215 21

i'll look for both J and G switches... but where in the heck is the 
part # on the switch???

i like mike's idea, but swaps are few-between here. i might start by 
resoldering the spare's ground wires on, but my skills at the iron 
ain't too hot.  mike, how did you get apart/reassemble the things? i 
would guess drilling out  the rivets is a start.


oh, one more thing - what size are the screws that hold the t/s 
switch in the housing, and the housing to the column? i se the 
bentley says m5, etc, but what pitch/thread?
