Subject: Leaking Windshield

Hey guys...

	Well, I'm a bit bummed... the windshield in the bus that I bought a
month ago.. had a cracked windshield. Well, it's been raining heavily here
in Florida so I decided to replace it with the windshield that I bought from
the junkyard (sad story).
Anyway, I removed the old cracked windshield and there was almost no rust at
all. There was a little pool of water at the base of where teh windshield
meets the car (before the ridge that the gasket hooks onto, but on the outer
side). It was slightly brownish water.. and it came right off the paint with
a scott towell. In any case, I installed the new windshield and I managed to
install it without putting a single crack in it. 

	BUT... I decided to wash the car and wax it.. and realized that
water is STILL leaking through the windshield. How can I prevent this? I
didn't use any window sealer.. was I supposed to? I'm using that window
gasket from West Coast Metric. It seems like a very good quality gasket..
the Cal-Style.
