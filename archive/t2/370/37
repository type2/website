Subject: Re: [T2] Rocker Arm Studs

I bought a set from Fat Performance after I stripped one of mine and could 
not locate one anywhere else.  I must say they are the most fantastic rocker 
arms studs I've ever seen.  They are oversized and take a different nut, but 
fit through the stock retainer, and I have to wonder why Volkswagen didn't 
use this setup from the git go.  But the really great thing about them is 
that you can use the oversized rocker arm studs to hold on bolt-on Fat 
Performance cylinder head covers.  They are not super cheap, but not super 
expensive either as I recall.

Later!
