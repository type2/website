Subject: Northwest spring fest was awesome!

For any of you who attended,  I thought the spring festival was a good time!  Great weather, More cars than I have seen in a long time.  Venders from all over the place,  Made this year meeting one of the best I attended in while!  I think the Northwest VW Club deserves a Thank you for an  awesome show.   Paul.
