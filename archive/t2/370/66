Hi There

I am just going to wire up a reverse light to my VW.  I am a complete novice
with electrics and with VW reverse light electrics.  I have the service
manual but any advice and step by step instructions would be greatly
appreciated before I go do it in the next hour.  Cheers Guys (oh and Gals)
