Subject: Need: 68-71 Camper Interior near Portland, Oregon

Hi,

I have a 70 camper and am looking for a nice, decent condition, westphalia 
camper interior.  Preferably with original vinyl on the seats.  I really 
only need the:
Z-Bed
and the sink with ice cooler(fridge)

my seat behind the driver's seat is pretty decent as well as my cabinet.

Hoping to find someone near Portland, Oregon so I can pick it up.  Please 
contact me if you can help.


Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
