Subject: SLIDING WINDOWS

Hey guys,

	A couple people on here asked me to let them know what the sliding
windows looked like and how I liked them after installing them on my Bus.
They wanted to know I guess because they were considering putting them on as
well.

Well I took pictures so you could see what it looks like. I know I'm not
supposed to send pictures to the list, but if you e-mail me back, I can
forward them to you.


Thanks,
