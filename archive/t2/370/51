We must have it made here where I live in Arkansas...the local vw 
dealership guys actually help support the Eureka Springs show, and it is 
the parts manager that handles it all.

He has spent as much as 20 minutes helping me go thru the EKTA to get
a special part I needed.  Yes, he will laugh on old stuff sometimes, but I 
already pretty much know what is laughable before I get there.

Keep trying...you may end up with a counterman that was there when there 
were aircooled engines....watch for aircooled cars in the employee parking 
lot!

Cheers, dave
