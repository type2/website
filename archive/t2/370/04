Cool!

Anyone in Kalifornia done this yet???

I'm interested....but need to find out more...started
reading the web-page...

wondering how much more efficient you can be? and
power...sounds cool..am thinking for both the '78
westy...and my '66 mercruiser140-powered '66 Land Rover.
Have been planning on installing chevy throttle-body
injection on that beast instead of the geared webber...
