I poured the first half of the mold last night. :O)

I'm low on RTV, but when I pour the second half, I'll have a mold of your
original caps.  I'll use castings (pulls) from that mold to make a number of
cleaned-up masters for another mold that will be used for production runs.

As soon as I get the first mold finished, I'll send your originals back to
you; then when the second mold is ready, I'll send you some "new" bumper
caps cast from it.

Thanks for the loan of the original caps.

I'm still waiting on the following, if the folks who offered loaners are
still interested:

- Fuse Cover
- Westy Clip
- Radio Plate

I've also got a cool idea for a 3-gauge bracket, but it's going to take some
engineering to get it just right.  The usual gauges are 2 1/16" in diameter,
right?  Anyone remember how deep they go into the hole?

And now I'm looking at a project making fascia and clear buttons for
Empeg/Rio automobile MP3 players... life's interesting. :O)
