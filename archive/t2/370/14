Yeah, there grounded and all cleaned up with my Dremmel tool. My rear passenger 
bulb housing is sloppy loose and I want to replace it with something sound. 
This is the second one thats been in there as I already got one from the bone 
yard and cleaned and installed it. Any suggestions on a new bulb housing I can 
buy that will fit in the taillight housing? I've seen the selection at the 
local auto parts stores but they look iffy. Thought maybe somebody had done 
this before and could suggest a particular brand/part#.
