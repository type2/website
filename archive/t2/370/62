check out the material theat vdo make the cups out of not just a plastic
maybe a mix of polly and graf?

Thanks.

The material will be a urethane resin.  I haven't decided on the coloring,
yet.  Graphite might be a tad expensive as a filler.  When I have samples of
the prototype ready I'll post here.
