When I was looking for these recently my first "stop" (via the phone) was my
local VW dealer.  They didn't have them and didn't seem interested in even
trying to help.  After calling a couple of other dealers I finally got a
part guy that remembered the air-cooled Volkswagens and he offered to tap
into the VW computers to see if any were available anywhere; they weren't,
and I ended up getting a couple of used ones from a VW repair place.  The
ETKA shows the part, but doesn't indicate a part number, and a search on the
part number comes up "part number unknown."
