Never ask them that way. Phone or come armed with the part number, they'll
reply with a description and whether or not their depots have any in stock.
If they ask you for what kind of vehicle and you detect the "3rd degree" say
you are running an errand. The only defense they have towards not helping
you is that they are a--holes.

I finally lucked out and found a nearby dealer with a parts guy who owns a
79 bus and doesn't mind searching ETKA. Sunnyvale Volkswagen on El Camino
near Wolfe. What a difference compared to those jerks in TX that outright
lied and told me ETKA only lets them search back to 1983.
