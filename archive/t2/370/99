Subject: Re: Oil Temp Sender

I've received one response to my earlier query about the
oil temp sender, and that person said that i won't get
any kind of accurate temperature reading on the top
of the case. I kind of thought that might be a problem.
It seemed too good a solution to actually work.

So now I'm thinking of putting it in the sump plate where
my old VDO was. The sender I would use for that is a little
bigger though, and I'm not sure about clearances there.

This is what I need to get: http://www.74westy.com/oil.temp.sender.gif .

Would that fit ok underneath the case? The only shorter probes that I
can get are 1/8" npt, and I don't want to put that in a thin metal plate.
