Well, the *easiest* way to remove it is to use the tool for the job, which
is an inside puller.  I believe many FLAPS will lend you one for free, or
you can rent one at the local tool rental place.  It's about a 1 minute jog.
I guess those other ways might also work, depending on cicumstances, but I
haven't tried them.

No, the pilot bearing lives in the end of the crankshaft.  No bearing in the
flywheel itself.

The hardest part for me was getting it out since it's kind of hard to get
to.  I used a seal puller and basically destroyed the seal out.  Getting the
new one back in place is easy.

FI seals, large O ring and felt washer for the flywheel, check out the
thermostat and flaps function.
