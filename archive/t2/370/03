Yes, they are real 3/4 inch red oak that I had left over from building 
an addition on my house.  I used the original plywood as a subfloor, 
and assembled the floor in my basement by hand.  Then I turned it over, 
flattened all the nails, and put in stainless steel screws from 
underneath to pull the whole thing together.  Then brought it out to 
garage, sanded, and put two coats of marine polyeurethane on it.  Very 
solid and durable, a few scratches here and there, but it's held up 
well for the past 3 years.  Thanks for the compliment
