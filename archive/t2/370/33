Or a Corvair... (I hope this project turns out as good as the folks I have 
talked to that have done it before).

Worry not folks - no VW bus will be harmed in this project. All bolt in and 
modified Corvair stuff. Everything VW will be bagged, marked and saved for 
later when VW busses are worth $60K with a stock drivetrain and $2500 for a 
Trans-Vair powered one... <grin>

Let's see - my estimated completion date is 2013...
