Subject: Help! 68 Brake lights

Volks,


I just returned from attempting to get my Camper inspected on it's virgin
trip out of the garage. Spent a few hours getting the running lights working
properly, with the help of a wiring diagram. It was wired correctly, but
after cleaning and checking all connections, started working properly. Also,
replace the black wire that goes from fuse 1 to the ignition switch. Thanks
to the helpful procedures and pictures in the library.

I have a 1968 Camper. I am unable to get the brake lights to work. Fuses are
all good. Press the brake warning light and it lights up. Running lights
work. Blinkers work. Emergency blinkers do not work. Horn does not work. My
owners manual indicates that the first fuse powers the brake lights,
blinkers, horn and I'm assuming emergency lights. In following the wiring on
a chart indicates that the inside grey wires on the rear tail lights
(running off of the 7th and eighth fuses) are running and blinker and the
outside black/yellow, black/red are brake lights (running off of fuse 1).

Does the ignition and/or the engine need to be on for the brake lights to
work? 

Can anyone shed some light on this. I don't know where to go at this point.

Thanks,

Matt
