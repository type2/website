Subject: Leaky Doors???

Ok, sorry for all the e-mails. 

	One more question... I have all the proper window gaskets and such
installed on the front doors. Now, my question is.. that after the REALLY
REALLY heavy rain storm, I noticed a little bit of water starting to pool at
the bottom of the doors (I have no door panels so I can look inside). Now...
I DO have the door gaskets installed, and they're installed pretty well too
and definitely keep a good seal. I was wondering if... it wouldn't be a good
idea for me to drill maybe 1 or 2 small holes in the bottom of the door so
that the water could drain out if any happens to get in there? Is this a bad
idea? I would of course sand the area down, and re-paint the inside of the
holes, etc. It would be to prevent the base of the door from rusting now.

You could say.. "well, the door has lasted this long without rust... what
makes you think you need to do this now?" well, the way I see it.. my
finacee loves this car, and I seriously doubt she's EVER going to get rid of
it. She keeps a picture of it in her purse to show her friends and
co-workers. So, I'd like to do whatever I can to make it last for a LONG
time.
