Matt,

My best guesses.


1. If blinkers work, rear brake wires and lamps are OK since they are one 
and the same. Also part of the the flasher function is working.

2.  It seems the output from the emergency flasher relay (J) pin 54S is is 
not active or the wire (black red/stripe) that connects it to the turn 
signal switch(G)pin 54S is open. The green brake light wire runs in the 
emergency flasher relay (J) on  pin 54 and out pin 54s to the turn signal 
switch (G)pin 54s.


3. The ignition needs to be on for the brake lights to work.

4. Inop horn most likely another prob.
