Subject: [T2] T2 - 1982 Vanagon 1588cc Air Cooled - Air Filter System -

Thanks once more Tim Doktor.  Just to clarify:

I therefore have no direct link from the air housing to the carb', which I
should have.

The hole is plugged but I'll double check.  The carb' gets no DIRECT link
from the air filter housing because this control valve on the carb isn't
there.  There is no other direct link possible.  All the other links to and
from the carb come via the vacuum unit on the ignition distributor and the
throttle damper.  The air to the inlet manifold is filtered and all holes on
the carb' are plugged or hosed.

That's exactly what happens but in colder weather.

Not 100% on verifying the mixture but I kinda get where you're coming from.
The air going through the carb' is clean though so that's one less thing to
worry about.  I'll try to work through the last part and get back to you
once I've followed all your advice.
Many Thanks for your diligence
