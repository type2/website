Subject: 2.0 engine questions

Hi!  I recently rejoined the list after the purchase of a 78 westy. (used to
have a 73 and a 79) the Westy is a nice unit just has not had a lot of
mechanical attention.  So I hear noises (pilot bearing) and don't see any
flaps for the cooling housing.  I pulled the engine and naturally found a few
other minor details that will need attention.

Questions?

1. how is the best way to remove the pilot bearing outer casing?  That is all
that is left.  I read the archives and it talks about a. pilot bearing puller,
b, paper towel soaked in oil, and c) grease and a smack of the hammer with a
socket properly sized for the opening...  So any recommendations?  I have the
flywheel off.  Is there a bearing in the flywheel?  I see a small case where
the pilot bearing passes through....

2. I bought an oil temp gauge and plan to install it in the sump.  Where do in
drill the hole?  does it need a nut welded on the back side of the sum plate?
I can either tap the sump,(seems a little thin to me) or weld a nut on the
back side.  your input and suggestions?


4. how tough is it to replace the pilot shaft seal in the tyranny?  while I
can see it....


 3. Anything else I should do while IO have the engine out?  clutch looks
good, I will be replacing all fuel lines, cleaning and painting the tin,
replacing air/intake main\fold hoses, front and rear main seals, por 15 the
battery box areas, sealing up everything I can to provide a good cooling
system.  What else?

Thanks!
