Just got my engine running finally and it seems to
hickup every once in a while in the lower end of the
RPM range, but not the same as if I were lugging the
engine, its just about one second that it studders. 
Also, its taking 6-10 seconds of turnover to start the
engine, while before I took the engine it always
started up in the first second or two.  Is there
something wrong with my cold start gear?
