The fan speed is the same as the engine speed. Cool air is drawn in from the
outside via the vents at the top rear corners of the body. The engine
compartment needs to be sealed to keep surrounding air heated by the exhaust
from entering the fan.

The air is blown over the oil cooler and each cylinder. Pieces of tin exist
to direct the air over engine parts.

This seems overly complicated. There are tricks that performance engines use
to drastically lower the CHT (Porsche style fans, Aluminum cylinders, etc)
but the costs are prohibitive.

If your driving style drives the temps too high you either need to slow down
or build a cooler engine from the start.

The visual test for the original alternator was the 70A model had fan blades
on the pulley otherwise you had a 55A model. Not sure what a new 70A looks
like.
