be as simple as the speedometer cable being loose where it inserts in the
back of the speedo. That's what mine was . It's important to get it lined
up right when you insert it and tighten the collar ring properly. It can
feel tight but isn't really if your not lined up.You can reach around from
the left (facing it) under the dash and get your hand on it. If the speedo
needle 'chatters" or bobs a bit that's probably the problem.
