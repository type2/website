But Scarborough is cool.  Greg, do you know the folk song (and 
Simon & Garfunkel tune) "Scarborough Fair"?  I wish there were
something like it about my place of birth.  But "Are you going
to Dinslaken Fair?" isn't really something I expect to hear 
anyone sing anytime soon :-)

SCNR, TGIF, airhowlingly yours:
