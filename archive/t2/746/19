Hiya Kurt,

You're looking for Trafton's Foreign Auto Service out in SE Portland (15570 
SE Stark - 503.253.2055).  Bill Trafton has been around since the beginning of 
time and has a pretty loyal following.  I'm not sure if he is a magician, but 
he does seem honest and knowlegeable.  I wouldn't have any problems with 
hiring him to work on my VWs.  One thing is certain, his customers all seem happy - 
a good sign!
