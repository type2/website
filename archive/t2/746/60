that would make it an 010 tranny (1975-1979) that is the second gear
brake piston cover..
  there are not one but two seals on the outside of the seal and two more
on the inner side...  I would not pull this out until, unless you have
these seals. you are likely not get it back together.
   Bentley only shows the 003 transmission which does not have that cover.
there are two pretty significant springs in there...I am not sure I would
remove this if you still want to shift.  there is a "C" clip hopefully
holding it together, but....

  are you sure that is where it is coming from, I've never seen that cover
leak.  more common leak site is the torque convertor seal
