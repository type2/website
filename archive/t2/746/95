Subject: Looking for trouble shooting help!

I have a '72 Bay Window that is beginning to experience some problems.
My first thought is that I have either a burnt or broken a valve
(mulitple??). On my drive to work this morning I experienced some
smoking from the left side of the engine near the valve cover (smoking
was coming from under the engine). Along with the smoking came a
rattling/clinking noise but only when I accelerated, when I was idling
it was not as pronounced. Now to my questions for the forum.



-          I am approxiamtely 10 miles away from home, should I chance
it and possible incurr more damage than is possiblely already done, or
have it towed?

-          It is possible I am completely wrong about the valves and I
have a more serious issue? I am experiencing engine performance issues
as well (it idles just fine but have noticed a drop off on pwer when I
step on the gas pedal).

-          If it is the consensus of the forum that it is a valve
problem, how difficult is this normally to resolve and what should I be
looking for costwise?



My last request is that if anyone is going to respond to my crisis, that
you include my email address in the response. My company has recently
cut back on the type of emails we can receive and I most likely won't
get your response if you only respond back to the forum.



Thanks in advance to those who can help me out!



Chris
