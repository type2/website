Subject: Troubleshooting brake vacuum booster

My owners manual says the light on the dash should light up when pushed if
the vacuum brake assist is working, and it does not.  The truck is hard to
stop.  Not that my foot has to travel far to feel the pressure, but it takes
some serious legwork.  The pads were checked and were 75 %, but according to
Muir my brakes should be as good as any sportscar.  It has what looks like a
new master cylinder.  Any ideas where to start?  I'm sure it shouldn't be
this much of a workout to stop.

Thanks a bunch, Nik
