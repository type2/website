Subject: Window rubber for sale at Bugout

I have some extra new window rubber that I have purchased and not used.

68-79 Louvered window seals - 231845413 - quan 4

68-79 Rear side window w/o vent - 211845341 - quan 2 - no molding groove

I will be at Bugout on Sunday and would sell these for $10 each. If 
interested, pmail me and we can figure out how to meet.
