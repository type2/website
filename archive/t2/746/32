Subject: Re: [T2] re: Hubcap is stranded in KANSAS!

I'm a relatively new bus owner and I live in Kansas City, MO, which is sort of close to Manhattan (KS). I have contacted the current holder of the hupcap expressing my interest in carrying it for a bit.
 
I'm not real familiar with how the passing around of this relic works, but I am planning on going to the VW show in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in August. I understand this is a pretty big show with people from all over the country convening. That would be a good spot to pass it off, maybe even to a "left-coaster".
 
Anyway, if anyone has any comments on my thoughts, let 'em rip!
