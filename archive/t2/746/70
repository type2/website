Subject: [T2] Tune-up Freq with Bruck 205; Bosch Qual Decl

78 T2, 2.0 Liter Fuel Injected, Federal.
    
Q1:  Why am I getting < 1500 miles per tune-up
Q2:  Confirm Bosch quality is declining.
     
Have reviewed my maintenance log, and note the Bruck
205 SVDA Distributor I have been using since Late Feb
2005, is only getting only 1200 to 1500 miles per
Tune-up.  A tune-up includes hardware cap / rotor /
spark plugs / points.  Was using 009 before with
AccuFire, and got a couple of thousand miles per
tune-up.
   
Parts used:
Bruck (Germany) VWC-043-905-205
Spark Plugs BOS-W7CC.   Tried BOS-W8CC once, not a big
diff.
Cap BOS-1-235-522-056
Rotor BOS-1-234-332-215
Points BOS-1-237-013-044
Cond BOS-1-237-330-220
Replaced the Bosch wires with a set of BOS-09171 late
last year (2004).
   
I'm trying to use quality stuff.
   
7.5 BTDC, 46 deg dwell on meter.  Engine racing
advances 30 or more degrees.  So that seems to be
working.  Driving-wise, the 009 was slow to respond
when accelerating from a stop.  This Bruck 205, which
is much closer to the original distributor, is
noticeably more responsive.  And way more powerful up
hills.   Karl and others were correct.  SVDA is better
than an 009 on my 78 T2.
    
We did run about 500 miles with an AccuFire in the
Bruck 205.   Needed to perform some "engineering
modifications" for it to fit, but there was that short
period-of-time when an Accu-Fire was used to get the
bus running and back on the road when we broke-down
while on a trip.
    
Any clues why I'm needing such frequent tune-ups?  
     
I continue using the Bosch brand name, but their
quality is slipping.  I base that statement on visual
inspection of their parts, and a noticable decline in
quality.  Have a Bosch rotor whose top-mounted
conductor was glued-on crooked.  And one of the Bosch
spark plug wires was defective on the cap side. 
Replaced the coil last year with another Bosch Blue
coil.
    
Guidance requested please, oh great and wise T2
Guru's.
    
Absent substantial guidance, I will probably perform a
Tune-up sans points, and go back to the el-cheapo
Accu-fire, and drive until another tune-up, gauging
the number of miles driven.  As cheap as the Accu-Fire
is, it works.  I did have one go bad once, but we
installed it with the rotor whacking one of the wires.
 Duhhhhhh!   Or like Homer Simpson says:  "DOH!"
