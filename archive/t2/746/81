Subject: Ignition Switch problems - SOLVED

A big thanks to all who helped with my problem. Ignition switch was 
fine, but my starter was toast. Thanks to Karl for his troubleshooting 
help and to Jack for his offer of a loaner starter to see if thats was 
the problem.

One question: This starter is only like 15 months old. Is there 
something wrong with me/my bus that is causing it to eat starters??
