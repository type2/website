Subject: re: Hubcap stranded in NY

I'm in Fairfield County CT about an hour out of Manhattan.  Problem is that
my bus (or me for that matter) isn't going very far from home this summer -
but let me know if I can help.

...Are there any list members in the NYC area who could rendezvous with  

David and get the hubcap back into circulation? Ideally it would be  

nice to see the hubcap head out to the west coast for a change.

 

If you can help, please email vwwestyman(-at-)yahoo.com, NOT me.

 

Happy trails,
