Richard,

Thanks for clarifying that.  BTW, what is the part number of the switch you
showed?

The contact doesn't exist on the factory wiper switch but does on the OEM
version you can buy these days. This is the SWF replacement:

Noticing too many wires? So did I. I can't find red/black and brown in the
wiring diagram and look...there's an extra contact:

Dave Bolen thinks this switch is for the intermittent wipers on the
Champagne Ed II bus.
