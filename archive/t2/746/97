Subject: Re: [T2] Troubleshooting brake vacuum booster

Have you tried following the vacuum hose all the way from the brake booster to
the engine, inspecting it carefully and looking for potential leaks --
especially where rubber hose sections meet metal tube sections?  If you've
never replaced that hose, you're bound to find some sections that are in
terrible shape.
