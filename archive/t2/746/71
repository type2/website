Be sure it is not running down from the dipstick boot, a more likely
location to leak. Or a rear main seal being slung by the fan to other
locations.  If your gasket is really leaking, then replacing the
gasket is the proper repair.

 Can anyone offer information regarding the gasket or sealing method to
 stop an oil leak where the oil filler tube bolts to the crankcase? A
