Subject: Re: [T2] Tune-up Freq with Bruck 205; Bosch Qual Decl

From Cliff Rhoton:

78 T2, 2.0 Liter Fuel Injected, Federal.
Q1:  Why am I getting < 1500 miles per tune-up

 ...... is only getting only 1200 to 1500 miles per
Tune-up.  A tune-up includes hardware cap / rotor /
spark plugs / points.  Was using 009 before with
AccuFire, and got a couple of thousand miles per
tune-up.

 Parts used:
Bruck (Germany) VWC-043-905-205
Spark Plugs BOS-W7CC.   Tried BOS-W8CC once, not a big
diff.
Cap BOS-1-235-522-056
Rotor BOS-1-234-332-215
Points BOS-1-237-013-044
Cond BOS-1-237-330-220
Replaced the Bosch wires with a set of BOS-09171 late
last year (2004).

I'm trying to use quality stuff.

I am a little puzzled.  Are you needing to replace ALL those parts every 1200 to 1500 miles?!?

Exactly what is going wrong with them?

Cap and rotor and plug wires on my 77 Westy have over 200,000 miles on them. I change the Bosch plugs every 
60K to 75K just because, and no, they are not Platinums, just W8CC's. The only non stock ignition I run is 79 
Cal Bosch electronic ignition.

Bosch ignition parts on Mercedes also go 200K to 300K all the time.
