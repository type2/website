Bill Trafton. I thought it was called Trafton Foreign Auto, but its:
Trafton & Maier Foreign Service
15570 SE Stark St
Portland, OR 97233
(503) 253-4621

I haven't had him do anything on Hapy, though I'm planning on having
him do my front end (ball joints) when I can scrape the cabbage
together. I have spoken to him on the phone. He has given me 2 accurate
diagnoses over the phone for what my condition was without hearing the
engine - just on my descriptions. Free accurate advice for some bum on
the phone he doesn't know from Adam - me like. From the Portlanders
that I know, everyone has had very positive things to say about him. I
haven't heard one negative comment.

Good luck on whatever you need done,

If you want the world to be just,
