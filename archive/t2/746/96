Subject: Web pages updated, new parts and a price list

The May update is up, well actually its May and June in one, I have under
the weather with my back for almost a month, so only 8 pages this month. I
have updated the parts page, added a price list page, and a .pdf file of the
price list you can right click on and D/l if you want. There are still some
parts we can fab that are not on the pics but most are listed on the price
list. Later and enjoy. Oh they doing maintenance on the server this weekend
so if the pages don't work just try again later, they will probably do it in
the wee morning hrs. Laters
