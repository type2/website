Richard,

 

As always you've got good info - thanks!  

 

A follow-up question though... I have a '79 bus - what are the colors for
the wires that I should be looking for to hookup a windshield wash pump?

 

Regards,

 

Wayne

'79 Westy

The most recent SWF switches for our busses (at least the 74-79 ones) have
the contact as well.
