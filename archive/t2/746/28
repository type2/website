Hi all,

If no one else is able to do so sooner, I can pick it up (in my bus, of 
course) on the 25th of June and take it to my new home in Southern 
Oregon or anywhere on the west coast that it eventually needs to go.  
I'll be in Ashland, Oregon the end of June; the Wine country and 
Sacramento, California the end of July; and possibly Olympia, 
Washington sometime in August.  Whomever it may be that makes these 
sort of monumental decisions...just let me know if I can help.

Jeff
