Subject: Windshield Washer Switch - was pump

Listees,

I was doing some searching for a windshield washer switch and found part
number 211953513K that was listed for '74-'79 busses (GoWesty has 211953513K
for under $40).  Richard Atwell mentioned 211953519G from bughaus.com.
Does anyone know the difference between these two parts?  

TIA,
Wayne
'79 Westy
