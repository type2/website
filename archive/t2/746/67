Hi Volks!
I've got a road trip report from Wilmington, NC to Asheville and back to report sometime soon. First things first, though; I'm driving to the other end of the state, to Cape Hatteras, to get married. I guess there'll be a road trip to report there, too. However, once again there's first things first. 
Hoping it's not an omen ~~~
I was driving from home when, no more than a tenth of a mile away, Karla just died. She'll turn over, but she won't catch. Pouring a little gas in the carb, and she'll sputter until the fuel runs out. After too long, I determined that there was something amiss with the fuel pump. It's an old school kind that is on my '67 upright. I got a clue when I noticed the line from the pump to the carb was dry, but the kicker was when I was reaching toward the front (front is front) bolt of the fuel pump and an inch and a half long, bullet shaped silver rod clattered out from the goo. I guess the fuel pump spit it out, and there's thusly no fuel delivery. I gotta pay my buddy at Silver Lake VWs (I know some of you know Darrell the Great) to slap a fuel pump in for me while I sell my sweat to wage slavery. After the work day, I'm high tailin' it to Hatteras. 
Wish me luck! For the Bus, that is....:-) Not the wedding! No fuel pump needed there! :-)
See you all online in a week!
