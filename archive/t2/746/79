Subject: Are the Archives indexed by Google?

After a few quick tests and quick searches of the archives it seems
the archives are indexed by google.

http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/123063.html

Any reasons other than privacy through obscurity that this is the policy?

Are there any current blocks to search engine indexing? I didn't see a
robots.txt file.
Creating a page which links to each of the entries would probably add
them...??
As they have an incremental URL it seems easy enough to generate...
