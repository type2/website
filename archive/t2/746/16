Ok, to remove the cabinet you'll want to remove the two screws behind 
the driver's seat, the screw underneath the tank in the left cabinet, 
and also the screw in the left cabinet on the left wall that holds it to 
the fridge unit.  Then, go ahead and cut the drain pipe in the right 
cabinet somewhere in the middle of the pipe so you can join them 
together later with a pipe coupler (you don't *have* to do it this way 
if you're able to pull the whole thing up through the floor, but I'll 
let you experiment with that).  Next, you'll want to undo the U joint 
underneath the sink to separate the plumbing from the sink - watch out, 
cuz there will probably be water in there.  Disconnect the water hose 
from the city water hookup, and take off the outside vent which will 
make it easier to move the piping around.  You'll also want to 
disconnect the power to the water pump, the pump ground, and also the 
gas line to the stove (if you have one).

The whole unit should now be free and you can pull it out.  Careful that 
you don't pull off the formica on the fridge as you pull out the sink 
unit.  I think I remembered everything...

I just put everything back in my 78 last week so that's how I know ;)

enjoy,
Mike
