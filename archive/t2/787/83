Subject: Still struggling with VDO oil temp install

Hi Folks,

I thought that once the wiring was hooked up for the VDO oil temp 
gauge, I'd be home-free, but I've run into a snag and need some advice.

Based on discussion on this list, I decided to go with the oil drain 
plug sender (VDO 323055D) for my stock 1600 engine.  I drained the oil 
and pulled the original drain plug and tried to install the sender, but 
it wouldn't go.  The sender is longer than the standard plug (see 
http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2005-8/1069151/Drainplugs.jpg), and it 
hits up against the metal oil screen.  The vendor says that he's sold 
this plug to hundreds of owners of 1600 engines and has never had a 
complaint.  So what am I missing here?  I suppose I could remove the 
oil screen, but I can't believe anyone would run without the screen, 
which is the only source of oil filtration in these engines.  What have 
the rest of you done?

Thanks for your help.

See you on the road,
