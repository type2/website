My guess:  one-year-only and Fed version is different from Calif version.
Limited to one-year-only status raises the price.

Not that I know of. Appear to be made the same as 78 and back. 
Maybe it is a claim added on to the one-year-only status to justify the price? 

> Last longer ? (better materials).

Not that I have seen.....

79 Calif is required because of the O2 sensor.
