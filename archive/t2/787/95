Subject: Re: [T2] finally picking up my engine from Boston Bob

Instead of rebuilding our OEM motor in the 69 Westy hardtop, we bought 
a brand new MexiMotor  and pulled the parts need off the old motor and 
bought a few new (old) pieces from Mark Dearing, and put the whole 
thing back together again. I was fortunate to have a good wrench turner 
with me, of course, so the labor for R/R of old/new was less than a 
case of Yuengling.

Total cost, I think, was around $1900 total...for a NEW motor.

I think our ROI will be better this way.

Just my 2.704 centavos. YMMV
