I agree, the hatch is a big plus. I would not be able to work on mine without
it. Get a good fuel injection system and it will be just as good as carbs, if
not better. Carbs have their troubles also. Many on this list can tell you the
benefits of fuel injection over carbs. For one thing you are limiting yourself
a lot by wanting disc brakes and only carbs. This only covers a few years of
the early 70's. If you decide to go fuel injected, then you have the entire
70's. The later the year, the better the camping equipment. Stoves, powered
fridges, powered sink, etc.

Not sure about the weekender question.
