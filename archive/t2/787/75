Subject: Heading out for BNNTA#20...

Hi all,

We're about finished packing up our Transporters for the trip to "Buses
Nowhere Near The Arch #20" tommorrow morning.  The Rangers opened the gates to
our group campground for the convienence of any early arrival, and there are
already Buses camping there tonight!  I can't wait to get there in the morning
to set up camp.  We just heard the latest weekend forecast and a huge high
pressure system is settling in.  They say this weekend will be spectacular,
unusually mild temps and LOW humidity for a change.  They are predicting sunny
skies with an occassional cloud, low humidity levels, daytime highs in the
mid-80's and night time temps down to low 60's (excellent sleeping temps) for
the next five days!!  Perfect for camping!

Yep!  No doubt about it.  Gas won't be cheap, but most of us aren't gonna let
that extra cost stop us from enjoying the company of many of our Bus friends
and lots of nice VW's camping together on a long, perfect weekend!  So if you
can join us, throw some camping gear in your Bus (or any type or era VW for
that matter) and cruise on over to the festivities!  For last minute info and
directions to the BNNTA event, just go to:  http://www.bnnta.com

Okay I gotta finish up the packing and ice down the beverages.  We hope that
wherever you are that you enjoy a great holiday weekend, and we'll look
forward to seeing a bunch of you tommorrow!
