Guys,

I was cruising thesamba and saw this:

VW Fact #597: Late 1960s Volkswagen parts and accessories "Made in the 
U.S.A": Air conditioners were manufactured by Delanair Engineering Co, 
Fort Worth, TX.


This is where VPC(Volkswagen Products Corporation) came from.  


Some of the guys that I worked with there(eons ago) remembered installing 
their first A/C in a new Cadilac.

Sometime before the launch of the 'new' longer wheelbase model, the 
company known as 'Delanair' was swallowed up by Volkswagen and it now 
became Volkswagen Products Corp. or V.P.C. for short and their logo said 
'CCCCOOL.'

WOW!!!  and here is the cat's meow

VWOA got the pants sued off of them by some A/C company that apparently
decided that they werre violating the Sherman Anti-trust act!
Lots of interesting actual A/C info about how they were installed and how 
they worked....and more models from more manufacturers than I ever knew 
about!

Folks this one is worth reading!

It is a *large* document full of some great history...fascinating reading!
