Subject: '79 vs Earlier Heater boxes.

So from those in the know, what are the major differences between the  
previous years of heater boxes and the '79 only Federal boxes ?
 From what I have gathered so far they produce more heat and are a  
bit sturdier but I would love some other input from those with  
experience.

thanks
