Subject: Oil Loss

Recently I have noticed that I have been going through a lot of oil. It seems
that I am loosing it at about a rate of 1 quart per tank of gas. I can not
find any evidence that it is leaking out ( a couple of spots about the size of
a quarter when I park ) I would guess that I am burning it - my question is
would I burn it at this rate and not see much evidence at the the tail pipe -
because it doesn't seem to be smoking - my wife followed me on a trip recently
for about 4hrs and she said that I was not producing anything noticable
Any thoughts ?

Eric
