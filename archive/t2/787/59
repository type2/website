Subject: Enigine hesitates, sputters and dies on highway.

Cruising down the freeway at 60 when all the sudden, severe hesitation,
lurching and the stall.  Engine would restart, but would continue to
hesitate and sputter.  When I got it to the mechanic, he could not duplicate
the problem or find anything that that stood out that would cause this
problem. No worn tracks on the computer, clogged fuel line or injector,
nothing.   Tune up, road test, no problems.  Next time I'm cruising down the
freeway, same demom rears  it's ugly head.  Back to the mechanic, same
story.  Ran fine, nothing wrong that he could find.  I'm puzzled and not
sure where to look first.

 

Fuel pump?  Maybe the notorious ground #11?  I'm at a loss and could use any
suggestions.  This is a stock 2.0l FI engine with about 120k on the speedo.
Compression isn't perfect but it's still in the 105 range on all cylinders.


Cheers,


Duke
