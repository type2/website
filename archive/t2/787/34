Subject: Co-Worker is harassing me!

One of my co-workers at the office continues to harass me day in and day out. He's constantly pestering me to sell him my 73 Bus. He really wants to get one, but insists that mine is the one he wants.. hahah.  I'm trying to get some information for him on Busses and what he can expect to pay. Can anyone tell me what a GOOD year Bus to get? I know he'll definitely want front disc brakes, and I assume he probably won't want to have to deal with fuel injection. He's not the most mechanical person in the world, so, the more simple the better.

He wants a camper van, but he doesn't like those pop tops.  Did they make a camper van without the fiberglass pop top? I seem to recall it was maybe called a Weekender?

Can anyone give me a price range he can expect to pay for something that needs a little bit of cleaning up, but otherwise is mostly rust free and has a mechanically sound drive-trane?


Thanks!!

Todd
