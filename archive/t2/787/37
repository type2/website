Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring ledes from Battery

See my rant from last year here..<grin>

I can't stress enough to get the "modern" type of battery clamp rather 
than the "leaded" type....it is truely worth it!

The link in the archived post is dead, but the folks at the FLAPS will 
point them out to you when you say "non-leaded"....measure what you need 
before you go.


See ratwell.com for more info from Richard.

Cheers, dave
