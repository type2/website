Karl said:
79 ports are one-year-only. They are square and flat. 72-78 are oval.

and Jamie asked:
 Not to question Karl, but to understand a bit more, I wonder, do the 79 and 80 ports differ?

 I have seen folks install the oval exhaust on the square port heads. But I am
pretty sure you can't do it the other way around.

79 and 80 to 83.5 Vanagon ports are the same.

I have seen it written a few times about mis-matching oval and flat but I have not been able to get either one
to come anywhere near sealing.
