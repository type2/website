Subject: What a difference a holey muffler makes.

Just thought I'd pass this along.
I was noticing a loss of power going up hills, my idle seemed low, in 
my 77 Riviera.  I  parked, went back to check and see if maybe a vacuum 
hose came loose.  I didn't see anything wrong with the hoses, but did 
notice that the throttle cable was loose.  I tightened it, but the 
engine was still running a bit rough.  Since there was a filling 
station nearby, I topped off the tank, so that I could make sure that 
the gauge wasn't broken and that I was really just running out of gas.  
When I got the bus home, I noticed that I could feel hot exhaust 
blowing on my berkies from the muffler.  I found a leaky muffler, no 
wonder I could only go up the hills at 30 mph, I was losing lots of 
back pressure.

I cooled down the engine and pulled the muffler (the original set up) 
and found that the seam had opened up, and there was a nickle sized 
hole in the back that was hiding under the strap.  Since I have a new 
muffler on order, but it's not due for pickup for three weeks I thought 
I'd just patch this one.  The patch kit I got had plaster gauze and a 
polymer coating in it.  I filled in the seam with JB weld, then after 
it set (five hours later) I wrapped the muffler with the repair kit.

2 hours passed while everything set and after I reinstalled the muffler 
I noticed a big improvement.  While I still can't cruise up my local 
freeway hill at 60 like I used to, I'm at least up to 45 mph, and can 
get up to 65 on flat roads.

Once I get the new muffler, a one piece set up, I'll be checking my 
timing to make sure everything is where it should be.  My mechanic says 
the the new muffler will really help with performance.

So, with all that's been dying from old age on my van, now the muffler 
will be replaced.
