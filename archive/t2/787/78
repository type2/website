Subject: Re: [T2] '79 vs Earlier Heater boxes.

So, other than the port shape, what causes them to cost $50.00 to  
70.00 more than the earlier Heat Exchangers ? Do they actually  
produce more heat ? (more efficient), Last longer ? (better  
materials). I'm unsure about the benefits of the '79 exchanger design  
versus earlier, other than port shape.
