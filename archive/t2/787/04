Subject: Valve Gunk? (was: Lapping Valves)

Wow. I took the leaky valve out and here's what I found:

Aside from some easily cleaned up rust, there's this carbon gunk (for lack
of a better term) that's kind of like soft plastic. Toothpick went right
through it, so I'll hit it with a toothbrush and some Purple Power.

No wonder that valve was leaking.

What is up with the retainer thing though? It was split in two. How does
that go onto the valve stem without breaking anyway?
