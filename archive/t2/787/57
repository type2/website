Stephen,

That is where the engine bearer bar (aka mustache bar) attaches to the
body of the bus (via rubber mounts).  They should be present on any
'68-'71 bus, and they are welded on.  They were probably removed by
someone intending to install a type IV (or some non-vw) engine.  Or
perhaps they were rusty, and the PO was going to replace them?

You need to find your self an early bay ('68-'71) donor bus.  Someone
on the list might have one and be willing to cut them for you.  If
not, give Ken Madson (-at-) thebusco.com a shout... he probably has some.
Good luck.
