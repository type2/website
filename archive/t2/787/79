Subject: Cleaning my valve

Wow. Went through a brass and a carbon steel wire wheel and the valve still
isn't 100%. What the heck is this stuff?

BTW: If you're using a brass wheel on hardened carbon, wear gloves and
goggles and armor and... I had half the brass wheel wires embedded in my
hand! I had goggles on but didn't think the wheel would self destruct like
that. Sigh. My hand looked like it had brass colored hair growing out of it!
