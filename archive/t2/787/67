Richard,

 

Thanks for the part number.

 

I checked back with the VW parts desk and they could not find this part
number in their system.  I received an email from another list member
stating that this is a VPC number - so it may not be a standard VW parts
number or it may just mean that the VW parts guys are too lazy to find this
number in their system.

 

I guess I'm back to the rope around the pulley again.

The fiche says the part number was ZVW 219 222. This would be the VPC
installation that used the York compressor.
