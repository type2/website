It certainly could be worse... In the past I've had co-workers who  
weren't nearly so appreciative. Bask in the glory of an exclusive club!

He may not like the pop-top now... but he will wish he had one after  
camping stooped over all weekend.

The weekender is the version made without a pop-top. They are out  
there, but not as common as the pop-top version. A lot of people have  
made westfakia's using a westy interior and a passenger van.... the  
tip-off is that the x3xxxxxxxxxxx VIN indicates a true factory  
westfalia. The x2xxxxxxxxxxx VIN is a regular bus. The more obvious  
tip-off is that the factory hard-tops also had a wooden headliner,  
which couldn't have been borrowed from a pop-top camper.

Location, Condition and demand determine price. But the common  
guideline on this list is that a good runner is going to cost about  
$5K on average. You pay it up front, or invest it later in the year  
as unplanned maintenance. Prices usually drop in fall and winter and  
go back up in spring.

Happy trails,
