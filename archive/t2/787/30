Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Loss

My 245,000 mi nver rebuilt bus has such a habit- mostly related to 
driving fast-it happens only on higher rpms, and comes out of the rear 
seal likely due to blowby crancase pressure? if I keep it to 55 it uses 
a lot less.  Do you have tiny speckles of oil  visible on the rear hatch 
outside?   Also I have tired oil cooler seals that leak only when the 
engine is cold.
