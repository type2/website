Guys,

The head came from me( I'm pretty sure) and I got it by way of a trade
along with 1 partially taken apart t4 engine and two buses several years 
ago.

Looked like that when I got it....and I only had the one head.

Actually, I'm surprised it looked that good, but I suspect that it was a 
carb part or something rather than a valve that made the "dents".

Cheers, dave
