I replaced the ends with cam action terminal clamps that have a large 
pocket and screw that squeezed it into the pocket.  It includes my aux 
wire going to outlets for fans, etc.   I think WalMart may have them. 
Boat stores sell gold plated terminal clamps that include sockets for 
extra wire takeoffs.  I also cleaned and used dialectric grease on all 
the terminals going to the starter solenoid.
