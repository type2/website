Subject: Re: [T2] '79 vs Earlier Heater boxes.

Here is how the gasket fits.. as for the heater box.. I dunno..  I do know
that I have removed oval port exhaust from engines and unexpectedly found
there were square port heads....  and I said... I didn't think this could be
done! ??

  I'm having a real hard time visualizing this. Unless the pipes were cut off
the oval and square HEs and swapped...

  Any web links on this?
