Subject: Looking for : 4 15in RIM for BUS

Hi,

I'm in Montreal, Quebec.

I would like to buy 4 or 5 RIMS for a BUS, but 15 inch. since I would 
eventually convert my front drum brakes to disk brakes... Could exchanged 
them for our old 14inch rim...

I have a 1966 BUS, with westfalia camper interior.

Thanks,

Caroline or Mike at 514-765-0268
