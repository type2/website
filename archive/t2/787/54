Subject: Can someone tell me what these are?

Can someone tell me what these circled parts are in this picture 
http://www.geocities.com/spschmidt/images/question.jpg?  Are they welded 
in or bolted in?  Should my 69 have them?  If so any suggestions on how 
to get some?  The PO seems to have removed them when they put in a later 
engine.

Thanks,
Stephen
