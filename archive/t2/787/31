Subject: Wiring ledes from Battery

Volks,

About a month ago I had a problem with starting Konrad the Tiki Bus. 
Turned out that cleaning the leads going to the battery terminals was 
all it took.

I examined the leads again today, and the wiring looks pretty bad. I am 
thinking R/R.

What's the best route to take with this, and if replacement is 
warranted, what exactly is the name of this wiring piece(s).

Many grits,
Anton
