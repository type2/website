Subject: Translation needed for VW tool...

Hi again,

At the recent C.O.V.V.C. show in Columbus, OH I scored a rare VW Special 
Service tool from an older VW factory trained mechanic in the swap 
meet.  Made by MATRA, this is the tool made to quickly and precisely 
adjust/set proper toe-in on the front suspension of any early VW model.  
Very neat item, I can't wait to throw out my old yard sticks (ala the 
Muir method for setting toe-in) and put this SST to use.  There is a 
small calibration scale on the tool and the words on it are in German.  
Can anyone translate the words "VORSPUR" and "NACHSPUR" for me?  I'm 
guessing it's something like positive and negative, or more and less, 
you get the idea.  Thanks for the translation assistance!
