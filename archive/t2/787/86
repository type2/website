Subject: Re: Victor Reinz Gasket Set

UPDATE:

I went back to the shop and gave them the numbers I was given for the
CORRECT set. The set I was given is VW number 021-198-009A, but B would be
the correct set. They pulled it up and saw that was the set they thought
they gave me.

But they didn't have one.

But the counter guys were adamant about there being 1.7 head gaskets in
there and opened the package themselves. Yep. 1.7 and 1.8 gaskets.

I don't know why but cool!
