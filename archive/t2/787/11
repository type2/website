Hey Don  First time taking valves out ???  They are all like that,  works 
great.  If you noticed they are tapered small end goes down cant come out unless 
something goes wrong . the retainer  is also tapered.  I would be more worried 
about the valve face looks like it is worn pretty bad  later and have fun
