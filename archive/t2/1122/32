I don't know for sure if they would affect things that much, but my 
guess as for why they set them that way is to allow them to pump up. 
Now that they're pumped up, you should be able to now adjust them to 1.5 
turns.  You're probably not getting as much lift as you did before (with 
them set the way they are now), but whether it would cause that much of 
an issue, I can't say - haven't tested it.

Run it hard and get it nice and hot so the rings seat.  You might do a 
compression test before and after running it hard to see if there is a 
change.  Every time I've put new rings in, I've run it hard and you can 
feel the power coming in that wasn't there before.  You might also do a 
compression test just for kicks to see what you're starting at.
