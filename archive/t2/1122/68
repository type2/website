I don't think it's unreasonable and it has been done before.  I've heard 
quite a few people doing various water-cooled updates to the bus and 
have had great success.  Jake Raby built a 235HP, 3-liter type4 engine 
and stuck it in a bug, so adding a suburu engine is not unreasonable.

I would love to do a Suburu engine conversion in my bus, but 
unfortunately it is a bit of an undertaking.  That would be awesome to 
be able to cruise up hills going 70!
