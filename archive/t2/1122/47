Subject: Re: [T2] MPG low

Hi Bob,

8 to 10 MPG sounds very very low, even for a fresh rebuild. I would be
looking for a reason the engine is running rich... possibly swap the Temp
sensor, check the engine grounds and like that.

If it's fresh-motor friction causing the loss in MPG then I'd expect a LOT
of heat to be generated; what are your oil temps running at?

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
