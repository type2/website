Subject: Re: [T2] '79 EGR filter

The only ones still being made are for 75-78 Buses and 81-82 Vanagon because
California is still requiring them to pass the biennial smog test.

75-78 Bus:

81-82 Vanagon

Either one will probably have to be modified to work on your 79 (which, if
memory serves had one for Calif Models and one for Federal Models).

Both are in stock (-at-) Airhead Parts
