There was discussion somewhere (was it here or the Samba?) about this
not too long ago. According to that thread, the trick is to remove the
stop pin below "0" and adjust the needle to point to the dot down at
the bottom of the gauge. You can just see it if you look for it, but
it's below the lip of the visible gauge. Or was on the Guac.

I had debated dealing with tweaking it for a few MPH difference, or
just remembering in my head what the GPS on my old G1 phone told me.
It was easier to remember...
