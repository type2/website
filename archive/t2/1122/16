Subject: Re: [T2] Using Brake Cleaner to find Vacuum Leaks, etc.

It's a good idea to read the can when spraying "anything" into or onto
your engine.  Every can of carb cleaner I looked at says to prevent
contact with plastic, rubber, painted surfaces etc.

Straight water will show a leak just fine (will cause a momentary
increase
as the leak seals, then cause the engien to miss or die.  Won't cause
damage,
might even remove a little carbon!

Besides the fosgene gas (YES that is true), brake parts cleaner (most
types) are
flamable and catching our buses on fire is NEVER a good thing.
