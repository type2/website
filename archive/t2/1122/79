That's correct David. Most modern cars seem to be using 1/8" NPT as
well, so when looking at oil pressure gauges and temp gauges, they
most likely come with these sensors. Also if you put your bus into a
non-VW specialist shop and they determine you need a new oil pressure
sensor, if the metric sender is not available at the moment, they may
install an NPT sender, or just buy it in the first place being unaware
of VW's metric unit.
