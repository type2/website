Subject: Fuel tank felt

HI, folks.

I'm finally getting ready to install the new engine in my '74 westy, but I
need to replace the felt strips that cushion the fuel tank from its hold-down
straps. I've been looking all over for replacement felt, but haven't found
anything suitable.

What do you recommend I use in lieu of felt? (Or, if anyone knows where to get
suitable felt, where can it be found?)
I was thinking about using some high density weatherstripping foam, but
finding some in the correct size has also proven difficult.

To be honest, this has been the main reason I've not been working much on
finishing this job, and I'm tired of using it as an excuse not to get the bus
back on the road. So please take that excuse away from me. :)

Thanks.
