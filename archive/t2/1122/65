I'd guess The dreaded "hot no start" problem?  Once starter cools down, 
the solenoid can kick in.  It takes more juice to kick when hot and the 
old wiring from the ignition switch cannot provide it. Try (a) bang on 
it with a hammer (b) carry a jumper wire you touch between battery 
terminal on bottom of starter and  the one coming from up front; when 
you tire of doing this lying in a puddle, (c) run a permanent wire from 
that upper terminal back through the grommet and cap it to touch to the 
battery, or run it through a solenoid so little juice getting through 
from up front turns into max battery voltage.

I have had a starved fuel (crud lying over outlet pipe in fuel tank) 
pump heat up to not start when hot (happened when stopped for gas) that 
worked when cooled, but that is easy to check with a 4 ft wire with 
alligator clip at each end, everyone should have one of these to run 
between the pump (+) and that battery terminal on starter- you should 
hear the pump whirr and if it will not start, check for fuel pressure at 
the fuel rail takeoff T on the left.
