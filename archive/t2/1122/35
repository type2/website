Bob,

Just a thought.

I have had the same issues in the past with newly installed motors.  
After adding a pint of 44K to a tank, mileage always seems to come  
back to normal. Now I add some with the first tank of every new engine  
I install. While Bosch fuel injectors are generally accepted as bullet  
proof, they do clog and have irregular spray patterns after they sit  
on the shelf for a while. I have heard of folks storing them is little  
containers of ATF while not in use. I don't do it...
