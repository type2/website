Subject: Delta CD ignition

Hi,

I just re-installed my old Delta Capacitive Discharge ignition into my bus.
Starts way faster, seems to be running smoother. I hardly blip the key and it
starts right up. Without, it took a couple of revolutions before it would
catch. Nice improvement. This is a fairly A-B comparison. The only change I
made was to gap the plugs out to .040 per the Delta manual. No change to
timing, however I have not yet checked it. Still using the mechanical points.
