oil temps are actually lower than I would expect.  even in hot weather at 
speed barely hitting 220F

I"m wondering if the air intake is blocked somehow.

starts right up
but it does stumble a little when cold..

since I haven't "touched" anything from this same engine from "Before" 
seems like it should be in the ballpark after new bearings and rings.

can't see any smoke but is a bit of carbon on the tailpipe, but not enough 
to make it black...

am looking at idle bypass screw since it is runnig high idle, but not that 
high and should have no effect when driving only at idle.
