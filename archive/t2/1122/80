Subject: OEM Bay Steering Couplers

Just to slightly revive the on and off again thread regarding Bay Window
Steering Coupler Discs.....

After a few months of digging, digging, digging, clawing, scratching,
headaches, dead ends and even more digging I have found OEM Lemfoerder (sp?)
Steering Coupler Discs.  You should have seen the reaction I made when I
opened the box, I felt like I had found a box of candy.  Yes, the correct
"stiffness"(!).

211-415-417 OE  $35.38

VERY LIMITED SUPPLY - I only got ten pieces, but I've been promised more
soon (dunno how many, might not be much).

Not on the Airheadparts.com site yet (we're having upload issues at the
moment).  So get off yer hind end and call Toll Free 866-664-3724 (Local
805-650-2050) and order one NOW.  Tell the salesperson I sent ya.

With all that said, the bad one that Chris (Slaymaker?) sent me awhile back
was a bit softer than even I was use to seeing and I sent it off to the
Euromax owner for his review.  He's gotten with factory producing these in
Brazil to toughen up the material.  The Euromax couplers currently on
Airhead's shelf are better/stiffer that what Chris provided (could have been
old stock from an alleged "bad" production run awhile back), but the
Lemfoerder ones received today are "da kind".
You may now return to your regularly scheduled list mail :)
