Thanks guys for all the calls, emails and texts.  The short story is
that, after stepping away from the bus for about half an hour to make
the above posts and to call a couple people on the AIRS list, the bus
started right up again without a problem, and it ran just fine for the
rest of the trip and back.

My suspicion is that there was some blockage in the fuel line, and after
walking away from it for a while, it worked itself free.

Sometime this week I'm going to replace the fuel filter and keep an eye
out for this kind of issue again.  How exasperating.

Anyway, Oregon Country Fair was a blast, and I saw many a VW bus in the
campground we were in.

Thanks again,

-mike
