I would guess that should be ok because don't they say to spray that in 
a running engine?  That or starter fluid would work.

But it doesn't really sound like a vacuum leak.  If it were a vacuum 
leak, it would probably be more consistent unless the engine is 
vibrating like crazy and shaking the hoses loose.

Btw, when the engine stalls out, does it smell rich?  I'm wondering if 
the temp sensor on the head has a bad connection - that would make it 
run momentarily rich.
