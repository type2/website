	woop woop woop     pull up    pull up
	this type is *the* favourite of the expert idle-youth car 
thieves, in my country at least.
	I wouldn't want that type of thief suddenly thinking it's 
kewl to steal VW buses.  (I feel a new 'thiefproofing' thread coming 
on  ... ?)


>227 HP engine

	Vehicles originally around 50 bhp, with from 1973 disc brakes 
on the front, can be made to handle & brake OK consistent with 
engines up to, say, 100 bhp.  More fundamental mods would be needed 
to suspension & brakes, as well as the more readily mod wheels & 
tyres, if anyone wanted to cope with a couple hundred bhp.  But I 
would query whether a safe vehicle can be developed this way.  It 
would rack up quarter-mile times XY s, but could not use on the road 
(or offroad) anything like a couple hundred bhp at the engine.
	Transmission would be difficult to make reliable.  Early 
tests could grenade the transmission, making nasty messes on 
dragstrips.
	I trust matters of taste are left as beyond discussion; but 
I've hinted at reasons, not just feelings.
	We had on this list an ace Soobaroo T2-converter, who was 
able to do as recommended by H. S. Thompson viz.  go into exit chutes 
from freeways at about 100 mph; but I seem to recall he had 
controlled his lust for power down around half the proposed hp.

	A suitable radiator can be mounted in front, with finned 
copper piping in the free cooling air under the floor; but what size 
is a development project, not a bolt-on accessory.  An engine 
producing >200 shaft hp will produce c.800 hp waste heat  -  not easy 
to get rid of.

	That gives me some idea how the '227 bhp' motor has been 
used.  And the spurious precision of the '7' hints at further 
insights, featuring dynamometers  ...

	Could work out OK  ...  but also might need considerably more.

	But did the driver warm it up before red-lining it, with a 
tailpipe larger than a normal T2 muffler?

	check

	- of an eccentric kind, in an overpowered vehicle capable of 
some nasty crashes from mismatching of power, braking & handling.

	I believe fitting this motor into any T2 would be a major 
development project, and the result might or might not, in NZ, get 
registered for the public road.
	I've not even touched on the narrow power band of this type 
of very souped-up motor.  I love driving 50 bhp with 4 exquisitely 
chosen fwd gears.  The proposed '227 bhp' mosaic would not be nearly 
so pleasant to drive.
	Thus I go out behind a valid smokescreen of  'de gustibus non 
disputandum', but hope the reasons alluded to would be widely agreed.

If you must have that much HP, slap it into a more suitable vehicle.
