Actually, if one peruses the excellent Samba thread on using a Subaru gearbox
in a Sub ->VW conversion, there is a post by a kiwi with a DOHC JDM (Japanese
Domestic Market) 2.5 ltr Subaru in a Vanagon.  Since he talks about driving
it, I assume it has reg and WOF.  That thread is very informative and the
gearbox conversion looks very promising, even if you keep the VW engine. The
net cost including the new reversed ring and pinion is well within the cost of
a quality rebuilt VW box.  I expect it is way more durable and you get a 5
speed, or 6 if certain, later, models are chosen.  The Sub TY box has been
used since 1990 in most models and is common in salvage yards.  The person
doing the conversion on the thread indicates he is planning to produce a
mounting kit.  Every Vanagon I ever saw in CA pick and pulls had the gearbox
stripped out before anything else. I heard of professional crews paying for
tips of their arrival.  Big brakes, and wheel
 upgrades were done years ago.  IMHO this is a valuable step forward. jon
