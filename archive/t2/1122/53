Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel tank felt

Hey Stephen,

I used heavy duty rubber, which I have seen under marine fuel tanks. I found
squares of it for a couple of bucks at a marine hardware store. You might
also be able to use rubber gym mat material, like what they use on gym
floors.

Hope this helps.

Ned
