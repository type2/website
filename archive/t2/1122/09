Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum or WTF?

Re your timing issue- I had trouble also timing our 78 until I realized 
the advance weights were sticking and not fully returning sometimes- 
make sure it's properly lubed; mine were sticking due to rusty spot and 
lubing didn't help 'til I swapped dizzy.
    Re vac leak- Goofoff contains xylene, a nasty hydrocarbon (cancer 
causing, dissolves plastics and rubber).  I used to use it freely as a 
histolgist and have some fingertip damage due to it. Spray starter would 
work if a short shot is given; it's ether and dries instantly.  As for 
soapy water, I thought that's to see bubbles under a pressurized system; 
you'd have to add compressed air somewhere to have it work?  Re 
intermittant drops, did you check the S hose after the air filter? 
Cracks can open depending on vibration or vacuum.  That includes the 
large pieces connecting the airbox manifold to the intakes.  The 
injector seals can leak air also.  My daughter's 75 had a hidden crack 
where the booster hose connects under the car to the metal runner. If 
you can get a vac gauge on it, can you watch it when these drops occur?
