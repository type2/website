Subject: remote oil pressure locator (type-iv)

Volks,

I bought an extender hose for relocating the oil pressure switch, as one would do on a type-iv engine so that the larger sender for the gauge/switch combo can be used.

When I attempt to screw the sensor into the hose, or the hose into the block, it goes in about 3 to 5 threads worth (about 1/4 of the way in) before I can no longer hand-thread it in.  

I know the hose is supposed to be M10 x 1.0, and I also know there's a standard size which is very close to the same size.  Based on this knowledge and that it won't go in easily, I'm paranoid that the hose is wrong and that I'm going to strip the hole (or at least force the threads).

I know that at the end of the day, I can probably use use the hose and at the worst case, throw a little RTV or teflon tape on it and it'll be fine.  But I'm wondering if there'san easy way to verify it's the right size?

FWIW, the hose was purchased from a vendors that specializes in VW parts, but I know that sometimes this doesn't mean anything (either because the vendor was provided with the wrong part or through a "it's close enough" attitude taken by some).

Thoughts?

Cheers,
   Tom
