...and then I searched in the archives and found a very similar 
question being posed in 2004.  (Search on "VDO Oil Temp Sender thread pitch")

Looks like I'll be going home tonight and checking to verify that my sender
is actualy the M10 x 1.0 (hopefully by the part number).  After which I'll
be investigating whether it's a taper or straight thread.

Cheers,
