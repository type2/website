I wasn't implying that it wouldn't have any effect - it was more what 
effect you might have.  You'll most likely be getting less valve lift - 
now how that affects your engine, I'm not totally sure.  My guess is it 
will probably hurt your performance, but that's a guess.

I'd say adjust your valves and see if that improves things.  Quick and 
easy and there's really no reason not to.
