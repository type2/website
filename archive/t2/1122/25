 may always have been like that. Before taking engine out for tinware resto
 etc, it had just been tuned. Do you think I can drive her as she is (want to
 take the new baby to the beach tomorrow), or do I need to get someone with
 skills round to tune the twin carbs first?

Try a drive to the grocery store first to see if that bad running
clears up. If it hasn't been run in 4 months the gas might have gone
bad or clogged up the carb.

The engine tune you had before pulling the engine should still be good.

Disassembling the carb linkage is pot luck as to whether the
adjustment of the linkages changed in the reassembly. You can eyeball
it to see whether the throttle starts to open at the same time on both
carbs as you pull the throttle linkage up near the cable.

It might run smooth enough to get you to the beach, but on your
return, you should still check with a Unisyn and go through the basic
carb setup routine from the manual.
