Intermittent issues are always a bitch to find.  I would venture to 
guess that you might be looking at an electrical issue.  I'd try 
jiggling all of the electrical connections and see if there's any change 
in RPM.  You should also get some DeoxIT and go through your entire 
engine bay and spray it on all of the connections.

I had an intermittent connection at my double relay and it would only 
happen if I *very* lightly touched the wire at just the right angle - it 
was amazing that would make it fail.  That kinda stuff is really a pain, 
but you just gotta keep futzing around until you find the culprit.

Well, the sucking sound might be the injectors that you're hearing.  I 
think I've heard the same thing when I stuck my head in the engine 
compartment and also thought it was a vacuum leak.  A vacuum leak, 
however, wouldn't be intermittent like an electrical problem - it would 
probably be more constant.


Just so you know, you should remove all of the previous quoted text 
otherwise I'm guessing you're getting an error back from the mailing 
list server.  Your messages are probably only making it to me because 
you have me directly addressed.
