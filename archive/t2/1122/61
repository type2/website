You do not want to mix and match the two types of fittings. The tapered
hole the pressure sensor is mounted in seals by the threads progressive
tightening, like a tapered cork in a hole. The straight threaded
fitting, like for brakelines, seals against its end. If you put a
straight fitting into a tapered hole, you are effectivey ruining its
ability to seal properly. Teflon tape may help fix a bodged hole, but
greatly reduces the torque required, and the "feel" for when the sender
is tightened too much, increasing the chance of overtightening.  Just my
two cents worth, Timo
