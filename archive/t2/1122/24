Subject: '79 EGR filter

After a lot of years, I'm trying to get my '79 back on the road.  The EGR
filter is only slightly less porous than a piece of swiss cheese.  I can't
seem to locate a new one,  Anybody got a good used one or leads on a new one.
I think 79 is a one year only allpication.
Thanks,
