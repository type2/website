Subject: Anyone lusting for a Subaru conversion?

I've got a Complete used 2002 Subaru WRX 227 HP engine w/ AC pump, Alternator,
lower engine mounting yoke, exhaust pipes/ intercooler, radiator hoses etc.
and a wire loom with computer that goes with the engine.
It is / or contains all the parts that you'd get with a wrecking yard pull out
engine destined for an engine swap.
This engine came from a 2002 Subaru WRX Impreza that my nephew installed a
2.5i 2006 engine with 300 HP.
The engine that is for sale has high miles of 175,000 but the only known
problem is one split exhaust valve that killed #4 cylinder but the engine did
not suffer any failure other than low compression. The cylinder wall still
looks good and can probably be honed out and new rings installed if you just
want to install without a complete rebuild.
The full life of this engine was on Mobil One oil.
From the difficulty level of installing the 2.5i engine with the new computer
and 2006 wire loom I'd say this will be a difficult engine swap but well worth
the effort in a VW van or Vanagon. It sort of brings you into the new world of
performance.Possibly there is an install kit that I don't know about.

The mechanical install is fairly straight forward. Price for the complete
works. Negotiable at $2000.00 + Freight
