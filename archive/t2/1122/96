Hi Tom,

1) My '71 does not have an electric defogger, it just uses the heat from the
engine, and you move a lever on the column behind the e-brake. If you do
have some electric gizmo there, it certainly wouldn't show up on the wiring
diagram as far as I know.

However, I too have a black wire that is not connected to anything that is
hot. I always presumed that this was for the gas heater which my bus does
not have as it is the right length to reach where the pull-button would be.

2) My door buzzer wire I believe is gray, and is not hooked up as it can be
annoying.

3) Not sure about that one.

4) Your gen/alt light switch connection should be made to your regulator,
and on my bus it is a very light gauge blue wire. From the regulator there
should be a wire that connects to your generator. The brown wire maybe for
your backup lights, they use a separate fuse too. I have a stripped
black/white wire that connects to my license plate lamp, could that be your
"yellow/white" wire?

Best of luck,

I just got done resolving an intermittent no-start issue on my '70 MGB and
hooked up an alternator to my '71 bus :)
