That's not really indicative of a clogged tank, though.  When I had a 
clogged tank (due to piece of foil in the tank), it was more like the 
life of the engine would momentarily get sucked out from underneath you 
- like, you'd press on the gas and you just slowed down as it went very 
lean - but it wasn't an actual skip.

How stained was it?  It could also have sat for years and gotten varnish 
in the pump/filter.  I'd pull the filter off and let some gas run into a 
bucket to see if you see anything funky in there.  While pulling the 
tank isn't necessarily a bad idea (because you eliminate one potential 
problem source), it's a real pain...
