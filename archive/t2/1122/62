Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone lusting for a Subaru conversion?

Thanks again Robert.
I think you said all that before.
We all know it isn't practical, but just a fun thing to do.
After driving about 240,000 miles over 10 years in a Vanagon at 10 Milers
under the posted highway speed limit I moved on to 911 Carrera, 928GTS and a
1.8 Turbo Passat.
But I think it would be a damn fun thing for a conversion project.
I'm not looking to sell my ideas here just a bunch of parts that make up an
enough of an engine bay to do a conversion into your choice of vehicles.
By the way ...... Freight on the 525 Pound palet to New Zeland will be
$11,471.00 US
