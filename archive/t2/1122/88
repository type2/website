Subject: All the tools we need.

I was struggling with an urge to buy yet another set of tools for my
van, when I realized that I only need a select few.

So, what are they?

10 mm wrench and socket
13mm wrench and socket

Both 1/4 inch with extenders.

Perhaps someone else has thunk this up.

Please Pmail me if you know.

Cheers,

Alan
