Yeah, my daughter's 75 had a rare "dropping out" while highway driving 
between Savannah to NJ.
I laid on the back bed as she drove while engine cover was open and reached
down and wiggled various connections until we found the right one from
the doublerelay; I taped a string to it and tied it higher so wire 
stayed tight, no problem ever again; I cleaned it later with fine dremyl 
tip and crimped it tighter.
