I don't think anything about the new engine can account for this kind
of fuel consumption issue.

It would have to be a mixture issue significant enough to make black
exhaust. This would also coat the inside of your tailpipe very fast so
you can pull soot by swiping your finger inside the pipe.

If the tail pipe is good, then I'd say you haven't driven enough to
get a good reading on your fuel gauge and this is a false alarm. Gas
station attendants can fill to different levels as can automatic
shut-offs. This can really be a significant percentage when filling a
small amount of fuel. So you need to establish a pattern with several
complete fill-ups to compensate for the top-off variable.
