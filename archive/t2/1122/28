Hello,
 
I have taken them apart before. You should see a seam on each side of the heat
exchangers. The shell around the "manifolds" is just crimped together. You
have to work around the seam, bending the halves apart. I forgot what I used
to do this. Be careful, because the shell is made out of very thin sheet metal
and can deform easily. I actually sand blasted the shells of mine with the
intention of welding up the rusted areas and possibly powder coating them. I
found the sheet metal to be almost too thin to weld and frankly, it was not
worth the effort. They can be uncrimped and taken apart though. I do not
remember any abestos. If I remember correctly, the accordian tubes DO have
asbestos in them. That is what it appeared to be to me anyhow.
 
Take care.

Has anyone taken apart 72-74 heat exchangers?  And if so, how'd you do it?  I
just got a set of 'em and I'd like to open them up and clean 'em out.  I think
I also noticed some cloth in there, but I'm not totally sure - is that
asbestos?  If so, is there something that I can replace that with?
