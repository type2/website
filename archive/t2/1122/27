Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting timing

I rechecked the dizzy and found that my points had a negligible gap  
which I could imagine caused the idle issues. Gapped the points and  
the timing was steady. Reset the timing and lowered the idle and  
everything seemed to be fine.

I plan on doing a little more driving on her today to see of the  
repair sticks or if there is now a new issue to diagnose.
