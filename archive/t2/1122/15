Subject: Re: [T2] Re: fuel pump

I had that problem until I pulled it and had it boiled out and 
rust-proofed.  But I put those cheap in-line fuel filters both before 
and after the pump so I could see what was getting into it.  It got to 
where I was having to change the one before the pump weekly.  I still 
have them there but have had no more problems since I fixed the tank.  
I'm not convinced that's your problem but if you don't do it now, you 
will have to in the future.  So it's probably not a bad idea either way. 
  Good luck....KR
