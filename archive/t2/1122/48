Hi Bob,

As crappy as it sounds; I think a compression test wouldn't be unreasonable.

This could also be an ignition issue, so it certainly wouldn't hurt to get
a look at the spark plugs and see if there's a weak link somewhere.

My WBX was giving me crappy milage and poor power delivery all winter
long; I spent a lot of time trying to sort it out before I was able to
figure out that I had the timing retarded 10 degrees too far. Once I got
that sorted the power came back and the gas milage improved immensely.
What I am saying is that it might not be a hardware problem, it could
simply be slightly misconfigured.

Greg
