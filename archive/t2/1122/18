Subject: Engine back in and running - worried about carbs

Hi All,

After many months sitting in the garage unloved (Baby Ben is now 4 months) I
have just (succesfully I might add) put the engine back in the van.

First time out and first time putting one back in - '79 bay, CJ 2 litre twin
carb engine

It runs, caught as soon as the fuel got to it, but am worried about the
carbs not being balanced.... if they were far out would it run and idle?

It idles, but is a bit rough sounding - stumbles and farts - not sure, but
may always have been like that. Before taking engine out for tinware resto
etc, it had just been tuned. Do you think I can drive her as she is (want to
take the new baby to the beach tomorrow), or do I need to get someone with
skills round to tune the twin carbs first?

No anyone in the Winchester, UK, area?

Cheers guys!

Dan
