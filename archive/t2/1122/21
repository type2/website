Subject: taking apart 72-74 heat exchangers?

Has anyone taken apart 72-74 heat exchangers?  And if so, how'd you do 
it?  I just got a set of 'em and I'd like to open them up and clean 'em 
out.  I think I also noticed some cloth in there, but I'm not totally 
sure - is that asbestos?  If so, is there something that I can replace 
that with?

Any help would be appreciated!

thanks,
Mike
