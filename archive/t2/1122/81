Subject: Speedometer calibration

I've been curious for a while now about whether or not our  
speedometers can be reset/calibrated. I'm always concerned of what my  
actual speed is at any given time and have even used my GPS app on my  
iPhone to gauge the speed difference. I'd like to get mine reset if  
possible.

TIA,

-Jason
