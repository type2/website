I agree that you should have looked at the gas that came out when you 
removed the fuel pump- silty stuff is rust, brown gunk is likely 
varnish.  This letting it run a bit will also flush it and it can take a 
long time to come back.
You can look inside the tank- drain it, then cut an access port over the 
gas sender, (check Atwell's site- or I can send an emailed pic of where 
to cut about a 4" square or round hole.) Remove sender and get a 
flahlight or flexlight that can be inserted into the tank; it works 
better when dark out.  This will let you see if you have rust or junk 
rolling around that can block the outlet tube.  Note you have to look 
inside the baffle around the outlet that is supposed to discourage stuff 
getting to pipe. I had delaminated coating by a $#(%)^)PO that I 
vacuumed out of the baffle with a 3/4" metal flexhose from a gas stove 
taped to a shopvac hose.  The Vac was 30 feet from the bus in case of 
sparks in the vac.  No problems since.
