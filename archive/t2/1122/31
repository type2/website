78 FI auto tranny

have the rebuilt engine (Suburban Engine, formerly Boston Engine) and it 
runs nicely, used the same settings as on the engine before rebuild so it 
should be close to right on.   realize there are some breakin friction.

have about 200 miles on it and took it out for a high speed (60mph) run 
today for first time.  stayed cool and oil presure stayed up nicely but 
fuel mileage is pretty rough, maybe 8-10 mpg.

any ideas I should look for.

. I have checked and double checked, no fuel leaks
. timing is pretty dern close to right on
. valves were set from Suburban at solid lifter clearance although they 
are hyd lifters.  haven't reset em, but shouldn't affect fuel mileage that 
much.
. have Crane system but has been there before rebuild.


any ideas, or just more breakin.

Bob
