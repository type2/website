Hi Greg,

I think the secondary goal (after reducing bandwidth requirements) was 
to reduce the server storage space required for archiving of messages. A 
message with quotes that are properly trimmed and in context is a lot 
more valuable to posterity and more worthy of the time it takes to index 
it when a search is conducted.

Even if everyone still had all the bandwidth that they could ever need, 
this would still be a worthy goal... (IMHO)

Happy Trails,
