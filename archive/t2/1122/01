Subject: Using Brake Cleaner to find Vacuum Leaks, etc.

Hello Mike and others, I read recently you should never use brake
cleaner near hot engine parts or in any situation that might cause it to
be heated. They say don't even leave the can in direct sunlight. Read
the label, hot brake cleaner releases some nasty chemicals like phosgene
(used in chemical warfare), that can kill you or make you seriously ill.
Pass on it / Pass it on! Hope this helps, Timo
