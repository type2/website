Subject: Re: [T2] All the tools we need.

Here is what I carry in my bus. I have a small tool bag.
 
Flat and phillips screw drivers, stubby size, regular size, a small screw
driver kit, and one really big flat head screwdriver.
 
Metric wrences listed by access bob,
 
metric socket set with extensions including a spark plug socket
 
Adjustable wrench, large and small
 
Hammer,
 
pliers, both needle nose and regular
 
Channel locks
 
Vise grips
 
Dikes,
 
Allen Key set
 
electrical tape
 
wire
 
spade terminals male and female
 
feeler gages
 
flash light
 
bailing wire
 
duct tape
 
small multi meter
 
Jack and tire iron
 
a couple of alagator clips with wires
 
scsiors
 
That is all I can think of at the moment. I am sure that I cary some seldom
used tools around.
 
At home, I always have a cordless screw driver hany, compression guage,
dwell/rpm meter, timing light, extra parts, wire brush, etc...
 
You may think that you won't need some of these, but you just might. For
instance, I was driving around the beach one day a couple of years ago when I
lost power instantly. I pulled over and looked around only to find that one of
my CV joints and completly come loose. The drive shaft was hanging down away
from the rear wheel. I crawled under the bus to find that all of the allen
head bolts and backed out except for one which had snapped. The bolts were all
still there being held in place by the CV boot. I used my allen head wrench to
screw back in all but one of the bolts and drove back home with no problem. I
am glad I had them.
 
Take care,
