Some of us like the context of the previous posts (more than a single line) to
maintain the continuity of the conversation.

I'm not sure how this

	if 'quoted text lines' > 'new text line' then spam

algorithm is an actual necessary and effective spam preventer.

I will say, back in the 90's when everyone on USENET was getting annoyed by
newly released AOL users replying to everyone on mailing lists and news
groups, quoting 8 page essays (flames) with "Me too" and resending, and most
people were on 14.4 modems, this type of sanity check on quoted material made
sense.

I just don't see the value any more.
