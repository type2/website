Subject: Vacuum or WTF?

I swear there is still a vacuum leak, but with almost halt a can of  
Goof Off now coating my engine compartment, I find nothing.

I checked the line for the brake booster and it's good. All lines seem  
to be in place. Funny thing is, she seems to be idling alright for  
now, but will occasionally drop line a stone and almost die before  
catching and going back to solid. It's as if the whole system is for a  
moment shut down and then brought back up! Last I checked the fuel  
filter (2 weeks ago) I took a bath in gas, so I think it's alright.

As I listed in a previous post, my compression is 125 across the board  
and my points look fine. When I hit the throttle, she revvs great,  
thought that sucking sound still irks me.

Any ideas on the next move?

TIA,

-Jason
