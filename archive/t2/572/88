hello Guys   you can get a very nice HVLP spray gun from Harbor Frieght for 
about $60.00 I have used one for a while and it has worked great. Takes low 
pressure(15-20 psi)  so you dont get as much overspray and uses less paint . Also 
comes with the pressure regulator   later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
