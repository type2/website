from the owner's son..
""GOOD NEWS!

My parents neighbor's daughter lives about 1.5 miles
away from my parnets. She and her mom called my
parents and said that they could swear that the
vanagon was parked across the street from her house.

The police just arrived and the car looks intact. So
you may have seen it Palmer...

I will update when I learn more. This car is basically
my Mom's daily driver, so it really sucked that she
would be out her ride. Hopefully they have found it
complete....

More later.

Once again thank you all for keeping an eye out...""
