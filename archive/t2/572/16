Subject: 1977 Westy in San Diego for $1000, Needs Engine

The following was posted to the Westfalia list. He's getting ready to
part the bus out because the engine blew. From his description this may
be a good candidate for a new engine. If it's straight, solid, complete,
and recently running, it would be a real shame to part it out. Somebody
hurry and save this bus before he starts selling parts off of it!
Contact him, not me.

Our engine siezed the other day :*(
many tears later we decided to say goodbye after a nearly 2 year run
with this bus.  we live a traveling lifestyle and don't have the
money to rebuild the engine so we're going to pass on its legacy the
best way we can...by helping other vw owners complete their own buses.
