Subject: rear negative camber

All the talk of proper tires has me excited to finally replace mine...however
I have a pretty bad negative camber (top of wheels tuck in) issue in the rear,
so my tires are only riding/wearing on the inside edges. I put some new
gas-adjust shocks on, but that didn't help much, if at all (visually). After
pouring over the archives for the last hour it seems that the only way to cure
negative camber is to adjust the spring plates/torsion arms. The rear end of
the bus doesn't sag, it is a little higher in the front as typical of the bus,
but not like some buses I have seen.

My question is....are there any other things I can check or do before
commiting to doing the spring plates/torsion bars? Bentley says I can take a
pipe wrench to the diagonal arm for a small adjustment, but I am not sure that
would help any. Both my rear wheels seem to be in about the same camber.

If my bus isn't sagging and I adjust the torsion bars for camber will it raise
my bus to an undesirable hight? I will have to look for a level surface before
I can confirm my bus isn't sagging, but it sure doesn't appear to be.

Short of that is there anyone in the central NC area that has done this job
before and would be willing to help out? I don't mind driving a couple hundred
miles to get the job done right!!

Here is a decent pic showing my rear wheels tucked in:
