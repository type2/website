I bought a mighty vac style kit back in '95. I was and am not impressed b/c it always caused sucked air in around the bleeder screw and thus made it hard to tell whether the bubbles were in the system of caused by the pump. 

I have long reverted to my wife pumping the pedal, me underneath with a wrench, piece of tubing and a glass pickle jar...
