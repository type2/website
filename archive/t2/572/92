Don,

No problem getting any color in the rainbow in Imron.

You can paint fiberglass with anything your heart desires--

However--because the glass is flexable, a good urethane paint is
recommended--so it does't crack.

You might also want to check out any marine ships store for Interlux,or
Awlgrip, urethane hull paint, which is a super fiberglass paint.

The gell coat in the fiberglass is blown into the mold first when the
top was made--and this woud be a tough thing to do after the fact--
