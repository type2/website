Subject: Painting fiberglass top question

I've been watching the threads on paint, and am curious.

Do the fiberglass tops HAVE to be painted with gel coat or other
fiberglass specific paints? And if so, how good is the color matching
between a good Imron and a fiberglass specific paint?

My HiTop will have a matching color section (where it's beige now) to
the lower half of my bus (will be a dark blue).

I know I'm still miles away from that point, but it's nice to have
plans ready... =D
