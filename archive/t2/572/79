You are sadly misinformed. These commercial pressure bleeders have two
chambers separated by a rubber bladder. You fill them with fluid then
purge the fluid chamber of all air. The fluid is sealed off and cannot
absorb humidity. The fluid stays fresh indefinately.

thanks for reminding me about the "good" pressure bleeders you are indeed
correct and i had forgotten about thoses.  but i had forgotten about those
for good reason, 80% of the shops around here don't use them.  they are
two expensive for most shops, shops that are constantly looking at the "short
term" bottom line instead of the "long term" bottom line and customer
care.

this is the kind of bleeder that the doctor is talking about. (i think)

this is the kind of bleeder i am used to seeing in most shops around here.

both from snap-on, and i will make the assumption both intended to be sold
to individuals in the "commercial/professional" market.  both essentially
accomplish the same task and most shop managers/mechanics/customer don't
want to pay the extra money.  as a case in point i have a friend that is
into hondas and lives in texas.  he needed a brake bleed/flush and i
explained the situation to him and told him what to look for.  he went to
several specialty honda shops to look at their set ups before opting to
do it himself because, the shops wouldn't even show him their bleeder set
up and told him it didn't matter what type of system was used.

so to get it all out in the air these are the kind of bleeders i see
available to the commercial/professional community.  i have ordered these
approximately by cost with #1 being the highest cost.

1. diaphragm pressure bleeders

2. non-diaphragm pressure bleeders

3. vacuum type bleeders, they go at the bottom due to the over whelming
presence of the mighty-vac kits in the market place.
