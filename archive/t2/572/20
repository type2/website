Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic vs. solid lifters

Modern cars are all hyd, but I think they have all the bugs worked out by now. You takes yer chances...

Not necessarily, our '99 Honda CR-V 2.0 16v is not hydraulic. I've adjusted them twice or three times in 90K miles. 

I don't mind solids. They work - no matter what - but you've got adjust from time to time. If you don't wanna adjust, then you've got to occasionally put up with tapping lifters and possibly accelerated cam wear. End of story. 

Make your choices I suppose.
