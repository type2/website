Hello Tony    This is the same gun that a lot of FLAPS sell also just like 
the ones on the Snap-on and Mac tool trucks except those have a metal can 
instead of the plastic one from Harbor ft.  I don't really like too much of the 
tools from Harbor  all seem to be made in China   But this gun works real well. I 
did have a pressure regulator go bad and they gave me a new gun,    later and 
have fun  Mark dearing
