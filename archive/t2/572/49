Subject: Re: [T2] Horn Button Removal

Gently take your slimmest, flattest screwdriver and pry it up, inside of the
trim ring (just the black part). It is hard to get it started, and it's easy
to chip the horn button, but if you are gentle with it that's how it comes
out. You might have luck with something slimmer also.
