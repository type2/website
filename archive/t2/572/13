Subject: Hydraulic vs. solid lifters

Howdy,   After checking the archives I still need resolve on this.  My bus
engine is getting rebuilt.  My new mechanic has insisted that hydraulic
lifters are the way to go.  But, I've only known solids, and am hesitant to go
with the hydraulic type.
     #1: Need I be concerned, or will all be ok?
     #2: Do the hydraulic type constantly make noise, such as when solids are
getting "tight" for instance?
      #3:  I was told that the hydraulic ones never need adjusting....is this
true...can I really go the next 100,000 miles without doing my valves on a
tune-up?

    I've got to head him off if I need to stick with the original solid
lifters like my bus came with.........
             TIA,   Kevin  Snow
