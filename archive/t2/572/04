one more thing I'll add, and then let Alex report back with anything
that works. The one other variable (of oddity) that alex has is the
fact that his bus is a riveria. It's a slightly different poptop, and
not near as many on the road as say westys or reg passenger buses.
Perhaps this top and a combination of Alex perhaps being more aware of
exhaust is why he has noticed this? Besides, he has to get it fixed,
Alex hasn't had the experience of a bus fest :(
