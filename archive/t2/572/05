Pop down to the local plumbing supply house and get a few "smoke bombs".
Find a stretch of road that doesn't have police or neighbors that will call
them. Wire the smoke bombs under the bus and light 'em up. Drive off with
a buddy in a pursuit car to watch from outside the bus. If you've got some
sort of leak that is allowing the exhaust to enter the bus, it "should" also
carry the smoke with it into the bus...We did this with mine a while back just
to see what the air stream was on a bus...The smoke exited from under the
rear of the bus and went straight up the back...Which is also why you 
shouldn't
drive with the rear window hatch open, BTW... 8-(
