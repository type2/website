Hi George,

I would also think that this is a good time to remind people that the 
front brakes do 75% of the stopping. Meaning that the front tires are 
subjected to a higher than normal load when the brake pedal is pushed. 
And when cornering the tires on the outside of the corner carry more 
weight than the ones on the inside.

So when you're cornering and braking at the same time (highway 
off-ramp) you can expect that one of the front wheels will be carrying 
more weight than any other two put together.

I'd like for people to think about that BEFORE they put car tires on a 
bus.


Happy trails,
