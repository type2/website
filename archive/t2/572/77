Subject: Re: [BSKA] Gas tank for 78 Westy Update

Thanks to all for suggestions and advice with this project.
Got her back on the road today with a new-to-me tank from Ken at the Bus 
Company (great to deal with).
Was able to lower the engine down (without fully taking it out,) to 
remove the tank (thanks Justin & Dave in Wilkes Barre fr the advice).
POR-15 tank restorer kit did the trick to clean and seal the new-to-me tank.
Now we just need t finish some interior projects before we get on the 
big road June 23rd.
