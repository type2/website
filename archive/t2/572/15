as you can guess this is practically a religous war. but my personal
opinion only

I have had a number of aircooled my first being a 59 bug when I was in the
military when that bug was not very old.  my first bus was a 10 year old
1960 which barely had enough power to get out of it's way going downhill
with a tailwind. (but sure wish I still had that 23window deluxe)

my current bus is a 78 auto tranny bus that I have had 12 years and has
been a daily driver that entire time.

I would never even consider solids on my bus, but

as long as it is done right, new camshaft designed for hyd, new lifters,
pushrods etc. you should not have any problems

only time mine make any noise is when the bus has sat for a few days and
then it is only for a minute or so.   however you don't get any noise when
they are getting tight either.

well almost never might be a good phrase, I check mine at least once a
year but they haven't needed touching in a couple years. the first year
after the rebuild they needed a little tweaking but after that....pretty
much nadda.

your bus your choice, I'm sure you'll get more advice than you ever
wanted. hyd will "float" at high revs but does a stock engine ever see
"high" revs???

as always YMMV
