No offense intended to anyone on the list, but this thought never fails to 
amuse me.  A 1968 Type 2 "wagon" has a  curb weight of ~2750 lbs.  A 1996 
VW Passat wagon (GLX - VR6) has a curb weight of ~3200 lbs.  And I'm quite 
confident that there is more weight on the front axle of the Passat with 
that heavy VR6 engine and the driver than on the rear axle of the bus.  I'm 
sure no one would even consider a light truck tire on a Passat.  For a 
quick and dirty comparison, my Passat has Dunlop SP5000 tires with a load 
rating of 1250 lbs, which gives me a 2500 lb capacity on the front 
axle.  This is almost enough for my 68' Kombi with the seats out (and the 
tool box, spare parts,1 gal of gas, and my 2 year old 25 lb daughter as the 
driver :-).

Now, I understand a camper model is a diffent animal.  Having maybe an 
extra 1000 lbs of goodies to drag around, not to mention the higher center 
of gravity changes the game dramatically.  But as another reference point, 
a 1998 Audi A6 Avant (wagon) weighs ~3850 lbs.  I think it is safe to 
assume that they came with "car tires".

I know we all love to pontificate about the amazing abilities of German 
engineers, but let's face it, the best solutions of 1967 are not the best 
solutions in 2004.  Progress has been made in all areas of automotive 
technology, and today's tires hold little in common with tires made in the 
60's outside of the facts that they are round, black, and we use 4 of them.

I wonder if the splitty groups have people advocating tubed tires since 
that's what the engineers specified in 1950 :-)
