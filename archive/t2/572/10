Thanks Scott! This is what I was looking for, but unlike some of the better 
vendors out there, that I don't live near they don't have it in stock. 3-5 
days for an O-ring. I really wanted to get it today and get moving on this 
thing.

Does anyone have the "Nomenclature of this Seal" Diameter, thickness, grade, 
etc.? It would really help out a lot.


Thanks,
Michael Knight
