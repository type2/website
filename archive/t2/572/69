Hi Mike,

Save your $99 and use a brush and roller. I drove a handpainted bus for 
three years and it looked awesome from 20 feet away.

Or spend bigger and get a better finish from a professional compressor 
and gun.

The Wagner gun is for housepaint and lawn furniture. If you are 
planning to also use the Wagner for your house and lawn furniture then 
by all means let 'er rip.

My $ 0.02. YMMV.


Happy trails,
