Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic vs. solid lifters

Commence Flame War...
 
People have very opposing opinions on this one...
 
I like my solids, and kept them on my last rebuild. The downside is that in order to maximize valve life you have to check/adjust them probably every 1500 miles. My commute is short, so every few months I check valves, dwell, and timing. Takes me about 20-30 min. I also get advance warning if a valve stem is stretching to the point of failure.
 
Hydrualics are not totally maintenance free, but they keep your valves optimally adjusted at all times, not just every 1500 miles. The downside is they are added complexity and when they do go wrong, they can be a nightmare (look at the archives). Installing them correctly in the first place seems very important.
 
Solids are a know quantity; with the hyds you might have a troublefree, adjustment free experience, or it could get ugly. Modern cars are all hyd, but I think they have all the bugs worked out by now. You takes yer chances...
