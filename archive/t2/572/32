Subject: Re: [T2] windsheild installation

Hi

We spent numerous attempts trying to do this.  In the end my wife came up
with the isea of winding 2 cords around the seal, one ending at the top , on
ending at the bottom.  The eal and lip were greased with silicone and you
sort of of pull one an then the other, so the the screen seated at the top
and the bottom at the same time.  It also meant that when one string missed
a bit the other picked it up.
