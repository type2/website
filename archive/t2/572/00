Subject: Re: [T2] Tow Hitch needed for 68' Kombi

Jamie, was that you I got my hitch from?  Chime in here...  I know it
was a Canadian gentleman, eh?

I'm REAL happy with the hitch I have, tho' that was pre-receiver model
and i would advise that over the staight ball hitch...  Can use lotsa
more goodies with the receiver.

Less $ than bd, too, as I recall.

Teri
