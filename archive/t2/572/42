is it re-engineer or apply advancements in auto technology to our clasic
vehicles.  everything from advances in tire design to synthetic lubricants
these have all come to fruition in recent years, when I first put radials
on my bus there was only one dealer in the area that even carried em, and
you could buy Michelins and that was that.

the 78 I have now is the only one I have owned that even had a spec for
radials.   LT tires especially have come a long long way.
