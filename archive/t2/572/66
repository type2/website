Subject: RE: [T2] Power Bleeder

I "built" a pressure bleeder using:

Bus windshield washer bottle
  (the owners manual says the bottle can take up to 40PSI) Brake reservoir
cap (bus depot $0.42) Tubing (home depot $2.00) Brass nipple (home depot
$2.00)

And a bike pump with pressure guage
(connects to the bottles inflation valve)


For less then $10.00 I have a pressure bleeder
with pressure gauge.

Works awesome and I put in a two ended nipple
so I could change out the cap end, so that it 
works with my Jetta two!!!!

Although the owners annual says the bottle can take up to 40PSI Remember no
more than 10PSI Remember no more than 10PSI Remember no more than 10PSI
Remember no more than 10PSI Remember no more than 10PSI

Good luck
