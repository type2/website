So when you're cornering and braking at the same time (highway 
off-ramp) you can expect that one of the front wheels will be carrying 
more weight than any other two put together....

WOW.. I knew my formerly a Champagne Edition was special but I did not realize that some of the busses only came with 3 wheels!!!! Must be tough to drive! <grin>

Seriously - I totally agree. Drove a friend's '78 Riviera to Crossville one day (35 miles at 65mph+). Has Cooper car tires. Scared me to death with all it's weaving and wandering from tires that were #1 - underated, and #2 - under pressure (van had been stored and I failed to up the pressure to max pressure which was still under capacity for the vehicle.
