Nope. _Specifications_ for the '79's require a minimum of 1267 lbs., as I
have demonstrated. However, I feel more comfortable with half the gross axle
weight rather than 1/4 the gross vehicle weight, which would put me at 1433
lbs., still (barely)within the rating of the 195/75R14's.

Overall diameter varies from tire to tire, even within the same manufacturer
and model. That said, the overall diameter for the Bridgestone Deuller
195/75R14 is 25.7", the _same_ as Yokohama Y356's in 185R14's. The BS spin
811 revs/mile, and the Yoko's 808. What's that? Around a 0.37 % difference?
I suspect if you bought four matching tires, and you had the capability of
making the measurements, you'd find this much variance among them.

What ply design does it specify in the manual: radial or bias?
What is the gross vehicle weight listed in the manual?
GAWF? GAWR?

Absolutely right. Always check the max weight rating before deciding on a
tire.

Right on about the uneven weight distribution, and this may have been the
thinking behind spec'ing the 1520 max load in '71, but these figures would
be the result of an overloaded axle by 101 lbs. I'm spec'd at a maximum of
2833lbs gross rear axle weight, 1433 each tire, and I will adhere to the
German engineers' specifications. I'd have to load ten 200 lb. people in my
van to approach capacity. The '71's must have different specs; the engines
are certainly lighter, as likely is the unladen weight. Can you confirm
this? More capacity available for payload increases the likelyhood of uneven
weight distribution.

Absolutely, George. We're talking specifications here. The '71's are
apparently different than the '79's. I misspoke, not having had all the
reference material at hand. My apologies.

I'd like to hear from people who have different year owner's manuals. If I
can gather all the information, I'll put together one comprehensive post
compiling VW's tire specifications for the different years (I promise, it'll
be short!). P-mail me off list.
Please include the year and all the information from the WEIGHTS section of
the TECHNICAL DATA chapter in the owners manual, Unladen Weight through
Gross Axle Weight Rear for each model. English units are fine; no need to
include the metrics.

Thanks, All.
