compiling VW's tire specifications for the different years (I promise, it'll
be short!). P-mail me off list.
Please include the year and all the information from the WEIGHTS section of
the TECHNICAL DATA chapter in the owners manual, Unladen Weight through
Gross Axle Weight Rear for each model. English units are fine; no need to
include the metrics.<<

isn't all of this info in the Bentley manual?
