Subject: Re: [T2] can I paint my bus like this?????

Well I am not too sure about how well true automotive paint would do in the
Wagner...but that is what I used to paint my high top with fantastic
results. I only used good interior house paint for the inside, but the
outside is expensive "topside" boat paint, which was a thicker type paint.
It sprays a nice pattern that is adjustable.

Here are some tips on useing the Wagner if you go that route (these may
apply to a real paint gun also, but I have only used the Wagner).

1 When you start and stop a stroke hold the gun away from what you are
painting as the gun will "spit" a little til it is flowing good again.

2 Clean the nozzle parts real good immediatly after you are done, even if it
is between coats. The nozzle will clog easily. You can get more nozzles at
HD and it comes with 2 when you buy it.

3 The Wagner doesn't do nearly as good at an angle as it does held held
straight out. Also it does much better when the little paint pot is at least
half full...I wouldn't let it get too low as it will "spit" instead of
spray.
