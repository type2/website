Dave,
I agree with you. There is no doubt a small leak would
be enough to cause headaches.

I have heard an unusual noise coming from around the general
location of the alternator. I know the sound of an alternator
bearing going south and this sounds a bit different. I've
been meaning to remove the alternator belt so as to eliminate
that as the noise location... That involves removing the gobs
of tape on the engine door though. Perhaps I will do that
after the retest with I drive with poptop edge taped and tail
pipe extended.

If i'm driving on the Interstate it seems to be the worst,
although the problem is constant at any speed. It it is not
so much the smell I notice but rather a headache later in the
day. I drive with the windows fully open at all times now and
don't get headaches but the CO detector still shows minor
readings on average. During stop and go traffic that is when
I notice the SMELL the strongest. The smell isn't inside
the bus though, it just comes around outside the bus to
greet me at open windows.

This evening I will try the exhaust pipe extension piece I
have. I've used it before, but not since I have replaced the
muffler and tail pipe section with a new unit.

Alex
