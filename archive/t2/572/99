I know I have an issue because the tires on the bus (po installed) are only
riding/wearing on the insides. Although I agree an alignment shop could
probably tell me how far out of spec I am.

When I got my NC inspection the guy jacked up the bus and wiggled all the
wheels as I watched. They seemed firm with no play, so I don't think it is
the bearings. The bushings are definately worth looking into, although I
imagine that is still a lot of work. Assuming my bushings are good, is it
really feasable that simply jacking up the spring plate will magically cure
my problem? Has anyone else had this problem resolved from adjusting the
spring plates?

Thanks for all the input,
