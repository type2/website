Subject: RE: [T2] Need NLA muffler parts

Clarification: this is not the the flat gasket with three mounting holes for
the tailpipe that exists on the passenger side of the bus. The thingy I am
looking for is an asbestos ring that slides on the tailpipe on a pre-74
style muffler (tailpie ends on the driver's side).

Got to your local FLAPS and look through their gasket selection (behind the
counter). I used some off the shelf gaskets once upon a time. Seems like
they were Mazda or Nissan parts. They were not exactly right. I had to
enlarge the bolt holes but they did seal just fine.

Take your muffler or pipe along for fit. Any good counter man/woman ought to
know what you are looking for without looking in the computer. At least let
you browse the gaskets...
