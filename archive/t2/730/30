Rich,

You will probably know nothing until you can get it dunked in a pan of 
near boiling water.

Ground sensor.  

Get pan of boiling water, dump sensor in it and wait for gauge to catch 
up.  Unless it's really cold there today, you should probably be 190+.

If not, it *is* possible that you have a gauge/sensor mismatch.

I think there is an explanation here

http://www.egauges.com/

About differences in old/new/euro sensors/gauges.

Oil temp at idle(just turned on, practically nothing).

Oil temp after a short slow drive around the block...close to nothing.

Pull the dipstick out and feel of it with your fingers!<grin>


Cheers, dave
