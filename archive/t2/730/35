The Brake Light SWITCH?  It's on the Master Cylinder,
rear of the Brake Booster, underneath the bus.  It is
one of the 2 or 3 prong switches mounted to the side
of the Master Cylinder.  Depending upon the year, of
the switches which are connected to the master
cylinder, one of the electrical switches is the brake
switch, while the other electrical switch is a Brake
Failure warning switch.
   
The reverse light has its own in-line fuse, and rests
on the left side of the engine compartment.
