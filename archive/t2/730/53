That's not exactly right. All 68-79 models have two seperate hydraulic circuits and there is an electrical switch on the master cylinder for each hydraulic circuit. On 70-79 years, these switches are cross wired so that both the 'brake light' and 'brake warning light' signals are generated. On 68-69 years these two switches are cross wired to generate the 'brake light' signal and there is a third switch that generates the 'brake warning light' signal.

To answer Patricks question on how to check the brake light wiring, you really need to get the Bentley schematic for your year and follow the signal from the master cylinder all the way through to the brake lights. Also in Bentley, Figure 4-8 of Chapter 9 has some more detail of the cross wiring of the two switches.

If you get the schematic and still have a question, don't hesitate to post it or pmail me as I recently went through this wiring on my 71.

Good Luck,
