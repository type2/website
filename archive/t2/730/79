Subject: Re:Rust removal on wheels.....

Jeremy....I think you are making the rust removal job harder than it needs to 
be.  Go
down to your local automotive paint supply house and buy a gallon of  
"Metalprep 79" and
some medium steel wool.  Lay the wheel on the ground  (the tire can be on 
it), pour some
of the "Metalprep 79" into a plastic container, such as an old margarine 
container. Wearing 
rubber gloves dip the pad of steel wool into the solution then onto the 
wheel.  Start
wiping it all around the wheel.  You don't have to wipe hard, just keep 
wiping and keep it
wet.  In just a couple of minutes you will see the rust dissolve and grey 
steel appear. After
the rust is dissolved to your satisfaction, rinse off well with water hose.  
Then mix up
a pan of water with half a box of Arm and Hammer  bicarb of soda.  Apply this 
with a
clean pad of steel wool just like you did with the Metalprep 79.  This will 
neutralize the
acid.  Rinse again well with water.  Let dry in the sun. Mask off the rubber 
tire with 
masking tape and newspaper, easy to do.   Paint with a good coat or two of 
primer
then a finish coat or two.
   I did all four wheels with a coat of primer in one afternoon and did the 
finish coat the 
next day.
   Try it, it's easy and fairly cheap, and you wheels will look 1000% better. 
 Mine
were so rusty little of the original paint color was visible........
