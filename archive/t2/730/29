very strange.

I took out the gauge.  hooked it up to a bench
power supply.  fed it 12 volts.

Hooked up some wires from ground on sensor to
ground on gauge, signal on sensor to signal on gauge.

Dump the sensor in my coffee.  I get 200degrees.  HOT
coffee!

Ok, put it back in the bus to test.  gauge gets powered
and grounded.  Signal wire hooked up.

I kept the sensor removed from the engine.  Grounded
it to a screw (ground was verified).  Signal wire to the
sensor.  I held a flame to the sensor to get the temp
up.  Friend at the gauge on the dash.  Gauge moves!

Ok, put the sensor back in the engine.  signal wire hooked
up.  gauge doesn't move.

What temp should my oil be at idle?  The gauge shows
"nothing" but the bottom end is 120.
