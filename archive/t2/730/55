Actually, you can take it with you...
A woman in California was buried in her Ferrari despite the attempts of her
relatives to prevent it...She ordered a huge concrete box made and her "in-
terment" consisted of having herself (and her jewelry... ;-) sitting in her
Ferrari
lowered into the box and the box filled with high strength concrete...
BTW, if you're ever in Linden, NJ, ask anyone for directions to the graveyard
with the life-size solid granite Mercedes Benz gravestone...
Who sez funerals can't be fun... ?-)
