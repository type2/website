Subject: Re: [T2] FI Question... Fuel Pressure regulator vacuum drop

Hi Karl,

Hmmm... Could I have installed the valve backwards? ;-)

The ECU controls the volume of fuel by injector timing. The longer the 
injectors are open the more fuel is injected. Pressure is definitely a 
factor as well, but the injector timing does affect fuel volume.

I retested the FPR and it won't hold vacuum for more than a second or 
two, then it leaks down to nothing. The fuel pressure now flickers 
rapidly between 30 and 40 PSI pretty much all the time, dropping by 
about 3-5 PSI lower as the revs increase.

The vacuum line has no affect on the fuel pressure at all. It looks 
like I/we have identified the gremlin.

Now I just need to find a replacement part.

Happy trails,
