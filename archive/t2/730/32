Subject: BRAKE LIGTH

   Hi folks, 
 
while getting my rear light housing I came across a problem.
 
I found all the "light" for flasher, parking but I did not found a "live
wire" for brake and the reverse...
 
I heard that there is a switch for the brake light... where the H*** is
it?
 
any input on how to wire the brake light... not the parking lights...the
brake....
 
regards
 
Patrick
