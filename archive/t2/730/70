Subject: Re: [T2] Need NLA muffler parts

From Marcus Schaper:

I just returned from the VW dealer after finding out that the parts I need a
NLA. Where can I get a muffler gasket ring 021 251 231 B? This is the gasket
that seals the tail pipe to the muffler on a 411/412 and early T2b muffler.
ETKA still shows the number but the parts guy says it is NLA. The Busdepot
site does not know the number

Not sure where you live,but this dealer as of today has 26 of them in stock!!
