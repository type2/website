From Kevin H. Roberts:

Is that the yellow/orange light right below and to the right of the speedometer?  Thanks...KR

Yes and no..... that light was originally red before the sun got to it!
That light is the brake failure warning light and the parking brake 'on' light on 76-79 buses.
For the parking brake 'on' feature to work, you activate it by pulling on the handle. When you do, there is a
little button switch behind the handbrake handle at 10 o'clock. Right behind the round base of the handle
pictured here:  http://www.conservatory.com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/Owner-sManual/78Type2/pg29.jpg

You have to modify the package tray to clear the button switch so the light works.
