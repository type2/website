Jim,

Thanks a lot! I found that p/n on the BD site but could not find it in ETKA
and was concerned that it may be for the later muffler. So this would be the
same kit as 021 298 051 (w/o A - this is the kit I got from Germany when I
installed the muffler)? I ordered a couple 411 sets from BD and will find
out soon ...

Try Bus Depot again - HJS (OE Mfr) did make make this available in a kit
with a metal ring, do-nut (43mm ID) and hardware.  VW PN 411 298 051 for
$3.95 from BD (If they still have or can get quickly for you).
