Now that it's warm enough to crawl under the bus (except for the 5"
snow last Saturday!), I'm finding what the PO neglected to replace and
restore.

I'm looking for good diagrams that identify, by name, the engine tin
for a 79 FI. Bus Boys has some nice drawings and identifying names but
drawings don't always look like the rusty, grime covered pieces I'm
removing. The upper tin looks ok (so far) but the pieces underneath
should be replaced.

Also found that the thermostat was covered with a layer of oily dirt
and the cable to the flaps was broken.The broken end is whitish and
rusty looking as if it was burnt. Thermostat is still good and the
nylon pulley is still there.

Any hints on vendors who supply NLA used engine tin?
