Subject: Dash mounted table

So ... I'm about to install my dash table.  I have pic of how it should look 
and it looks to be .. right on the point where the dash turns from almost 
horizontal to almost vertical - is that right?

Also - I'm kinda nervous about drilling into my dash.  It's pretty much 
flawless with zero cracks etc.. Has anyone ever had dash vinyl crack along a 
drill hole?

Also ... I have a bus depot under the dash parcel tray.  As I recall ... it 
was advertised as 68 to 79 or something like that.  But it seems that at 
some point the emergency brake handle changed somewhat and this parcel tray 
does not seem to fit as well as it should ... anyone ever install one of 
these in a 76 to 79 bus?

TIA
