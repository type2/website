Subject: RE: [T2] Vent Wing Window Seal...

Camping this weekend in my '69 Westy, I noticed that my side
vent wing
window (the one rear of the left-side louvered window, not the
one up
front) started leaking.  Luckily I had a tarp I threw over
that side
of the bus to stop the deluge.

Time for a new seal!

-----------------------------------------------
Josh,
did it leak above the rubber where the window hinges? or did
it leak below the seal, in between the body and the rubber?

One is just a new seal, the other may be an indication of body
rust in the framing underneath the seal.
