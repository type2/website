Could you cut a keg in half?  They are stainless. Albeit a pain to cut though, 2-3 sawz-all blades and a lot of noise but having to empty the keg is always fun!

A stainless steel electode is recommended in the text. Whilst this creates a 
non consumable electrode, it does create a chrome rich toxic soup which 
should not be disposed of down the drain. If a steel electrode is used the 
residue is non-toxic and can be disposed of safely.
