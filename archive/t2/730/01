Subject: FI Question... Fuel Pressure regulator vacuum drop

Hi Volks,

I've been troubleshooting two problems with the FI on the westfakia... 
It has a temporary vacuum leak that disappears as soon as the engine 
warms up; and the gas milage is only 15-17MPG.

Symptoms:
When running cold the engine produces about 6-8" of mercury, and the 
engine promptly quits. Restart it and then nurse the throttle for a 
minute, the engine warms and the vacuum eventually rises to about 12", 
and the engine runs without intervention.

Tonight I installed some fresh plastic hose and went hunting for a vac 
leak again. After a minute or two I could get 12.5" of mercury. So I 
capped off the line from the throttle body and got 14.5". Then I put 
the decel valve back in the circuit and got 14.5 again. This only left 
the fuel pressure regulator to check. I unplugged the regulator and put 
my finger over the end of the line and got 14.5" of vacuum. With the 
fuel pressure regulator (FPR) plugged in I only read 12.5" or less.

Question: Is it normal to see two inches of mercury lost at the FPR? Is 
my regulator toast? Fuel pressure at idle is around 35-37 PSI, and 
drops to just over 25 as the revs come up.

If the regulator is FUBAR then it might explain the cold start problem 
AND the poor gas milage. I like simple solutions.

If that's not it then I guess I'll have to buy another gasket kit and 
pull all the ^%$# hoses off again. Of all the FI jobs, I hate changing 
the plenum gaskets the most. If only there was a softer rubber or nylon 
hose available to make that job go easier. With clamps at both ends the 
hose would be plenty air-tight. Hmmm...

Happy trails,
