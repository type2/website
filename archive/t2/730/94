Subject: heater boxes and cat converter for sale

For sale: Heater boxes and cat converter setup for a 2 L luftboxer.  The guy
down the street is throwing them away because he is moving to St. Louis where
his bus probably won't even pass emission testing. If he is dumb enough to
throw these heater boxes away, I might as well try to sell them.  $20 for my
time (and the massage I'll need after lugging them home) and you will be
paying for shipping. Located in beautiful Idaho.
