Hi Greg,

I took the old plenum hoses to Napa and they fitted me with an
american hose size that I used with hose clamps. I think these are in
the FI lot I am saving for you.

 If only there was a softer rubber or nylon
 hose available to make that job go easier. With clamps at both ends the
 hose would be plenty air-tight. Hmmm...
