Subject: Need NLA muffler parts

Hello all,

I just returned from the VW dealer after finding out that the parts I need a
NLA. Where can I get a muffler gasket ring 021 251 231 B? This is the gasket
that seals the tail pipe to the muffler on a 411/412 and early T2b muffler.
ETKA still shows the number but the parts guy says it is NLA. The Busdepot
site does not know the number

I may also need a bracket holding the pipe which. is NLA. The lack of this
bracket may have lead to the premature failure of the seal. This bracket is
#19 in MG 2, SG 51 for a '74 Type 4 in ETKA. Is this the same bracket as on
1600 bus mufflers? Sorry, no part number.

Can anyone help out? When I installed the muffler I ended up ordering the
mounting kit from Germany. I'd like to avoid that this time ...

Thanks,
Marcus
