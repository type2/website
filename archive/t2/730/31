We have just received some shipments of tin. I have not even opened the
boxes yet, but the supplier I got the parts from is a dealer who buys large
quantities of core engines to re-sell to places like GEX (he sells them a
trailer-load at a time). This supplier is hopefully going to keep us loaded
up with tin ware. This is something I have been wanting to do for a while so
we can supply the needed parts to convert from 72-74 exhaust from 75-78. The
other need we see in Canada and the north generally, is that these parts -
lower pushrod cover plates, heater valves and hot air pipes - are badly rust
damaged. I hardly ever see a bus here with all the tin in good shape, so
there is a genuine need for a good supply of quality used engine cover
plates.

It will take me some time to get this on line, but we will be offering a tin
kit for the 72-74 exhaust conversion that will include everything needed.

Until the kits and tin pieces are online, I will happily take email
inquiries on individual tin parts.
