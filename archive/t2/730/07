Subject: 1971 VDO oil temp gauge

Hello,

I just brought VDO gauges out of storage.

Temp is 120-300 F on the gauge.

Pressure gauge and sensor work fine.

Oil temp gauge doesn't work.  Everything
is wired correct.  Signal wires are brand new
wires.

If I take the pressure signal wire and move
it to the temp gauge, the guage moves as
the pressure changes.

Switch back to the temperature signal wire
on the temp. gauge.  Nothing.

If I put a ground wire to the back of the
gauge, to the signal input, I get 300degrees
reading on the gauge.

Any ideas?  I'm on my way out the door
right now to test resistance of the sensor

Rich
