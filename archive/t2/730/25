Subject: RE: [T2] T4 bus engine in a Karmen Gia?

     Exhaust seems to be the main sticking point with any type4 into X 
conversion.  It can happen though, and it seems to be one of the easier 
conversions to work out.  I'm *thinking* about installing a bus motor into a 
early bug.  I'd look through the links below, post conversion and fitment 
questions to the type4um, and only bus engine specific questions here.  
Since this list if for the type2 baywindow, discussions around fitting that 
motor into a Ghia are really pushing it I think.

     Not trying to be a prig here, but if you are going to start searching 
in forums and stuff for your buddy, it's spelled "Karmann Ghia".  Just an 
FYI, I know you aren't the Ghia guy.
