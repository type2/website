Subject: Re: [T2] FI Question... Fuel Pressure regulator vacuum drop

Hi Jamie,

I don't have a hand pump, but I do know that I can get 15" of vacuum 
the other way. I'll test for that tomorrow and see if the leak is in 
the regulator.

The fuel pressure is definitely higher than spec at idle.

Happy trails,

I am really just guessing here,, but I think your pressure regulator is 
not
working to Bentley spec...

With the vac line disconnected,, you should see ~35psi
With the vac line connected,, you should see ~28 psi

I think your pressure regulator has a leak in the vac diagphram and 
appears to
be like the line is disconnected,, until you build more vac and then the
pressure drops off.

I think you can test it .... 2 ways...  if you have a vac pump with a 
gauge, you
can connect it to the pressure regulator and pump up 15hg,, and see if 
it holds

if you don't have a vac pump ... then put a hose on the pressure 
regulator,, and
use your mouth,, suck til you can't ,, then cap the hose with your 
tongue... in
a minute or so you should hear and feel the vac leak when you release 
your
tongue..

Hope that helps
