Subject: 81 Westy $400 in Utah

I saw this listing in the local paper thrifty section:

'81 VW Camper runs and drives , needs motor work, no
rust $400(801) 262-5250 or 661-2933..

I have a completely rebuilt engine that will fit this
with new heads, pistons and bores, cam crank, oil
pump, etc.  $1250 long block,  $1550 turnkey with
skins and heater boxes.  Also a good short block with
one head for $300.  Also fresh rebuilt Rancho tranny
$500.

Someone could make a good vacation vehicle out of
this.
