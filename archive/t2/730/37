Got to your local FLAPS and look through their gasket selection (behind the counter). I used some off the shelf gaskets once upon a time. Seems like they were Mazda or Nissan parts. They were not exactly right. I had to enlarge the bolt holes but they did seal just fine. 

Take your muffler or pipe along for fit. Any good counter man/woman ought to know what you are looking for without looking in the computer. At least let you browse the gaskets...
