Hi Karl,

Thanks for the info. My parts vanagon is about 12 miles away, so I 
haven't had time to look at the part myself.

Happy trails,

 From Greg Potts:

Would the fuel pressure regulator from  a 1988 Vanagon work with a 1977
  L-Jetronic system??

  I have one from a parts vanagon available if the swap would work.

I doubt it will work. The bay part # is 022 906 035.  The Vanagon is 
025 133 035.
The bay unit has a fuel line on each end, one in and out, with a vacuum 
line on the side.
The pic in ETKA of the Vanagon is different. It appears to have 3 fuel 
lines going to it with
a vacuum hose on the end.
