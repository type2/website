 Are you sure about this? The pressure should rise when the throttle opens.
The values are about correct (idle should be ~28), but reversed.

Correct, it acts just like an accelerator pump on a carb.
When you open the throttle, manifold vacuum drops, fuel pressure goes up, injectors have more volume of fuel.
The ECU controls the time span the injectors are open. It has no control over volume. Volume is controlled by
pressure.
