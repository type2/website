Thanks to all. But no dual battery so no fuse and the wiring at the fuse 
box is all OK.

I am going to pull the instrument console and check the wiring but I have a 
feeling that the emergency flasher switch is eventually going to have to be 
replaced. Probably should do it first but I am trying to avoid the expense.

Many folks have stated this as the best place to start to solve a bunch of 
electrical problems. This bus has been in a salt environment and I am 
finding lots of grungy connections. After 35 years, probably about time for 
a new switch, anyway....

Also the light switch, too, maybe...

When in doubt, R&R.

Thanks again.
Mike
