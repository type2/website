Try Bus Depot again - HJS (OE Mfr) did make make this available in a
kit with a metal ring, do-nut (43mm ID) and hardware.  VW PN 411 298
051 for $3.95 from BD (If they still have or can get quickly for you).
 Again , this is not to say that it's still available, as I checked
locally and none of the importing warehouses I've used in the past
show this number on their databases now.

The bracket you're looking for is VW PN 021 251 301 B.  They've been
lately made of that elusive metal "unobtainium" ;-)  I haven't seen
one in over ten years and no, its not the same as the 1600 Upright
Engine variety.
