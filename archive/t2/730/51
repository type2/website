hey guys  history lessons  LOL   was it true that grant owned 9 slaves at the 
end of the civil war while none of the southern leaders  had any.   Strange 
how many people think that the reason for that war was slavery .  Bus content  
I was thinking of being buried in my old bus  , has this ever been done that 
anybody knows about  ??  Not that I think it will be anytime soon  LOL  later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing
