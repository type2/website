Subject: VDO temp gauge

Hi,

when the signal wire from the pressure sensor
is hooked to temp gauge (for test purposes),
the temp gauge moves with oil pressure...

When the temp sensor signal wire is hooked
to temp gauge, I get no movement.

The VDO gauges are old (20+ years) so I don't
know if gauge/sensor are compatible.

The gauge shows 120-300 degrees F.  It is
VDO brand.

The sensor is brand new from the store, VDO
brand, rated up to 300 degrees F

I get 100 ohms from ground to sensor contact
with signal wire removed.

Any ideas on why the gauge isn't responding?

Rich
