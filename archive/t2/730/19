Subject: Fanbelt tensioning

Dear List,

Just tightened up my fanbelt for the first time in four years, and was 
wondering how you guys fix the pulley wheel in place so the nut can be 
undone? Managed with a small degree of difficulty, but it involved a 
screwdriver jammed into the notch on the foremost half of the pulley 
wheel and resting on the plinth for the air cleaner (its a single carb 
1600). It seemed less than ideal. It crossed my mind (a quick trip!) 
that dual carb engines probably don't have the plinth, so my technique 
almost certainly is not the recommended way. I have several manuals, but 
they don't have pictures so phrases like "use a screwdriver and wedge it 
against the top generator bolt" don't really address the problem in 
enoght detail.
