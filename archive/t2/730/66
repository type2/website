> That's not exactly right. All 68-79 models have two seperate hydraulic circuits and there is an electrical switch on the master cylinder for each hydraulic circuit. On 70-79 years, these switches are cross wired so that both the 'brake light' and 'brake warning light' signals are generated. On 68-69 years these two switches are cross wired to generate the 'brake light' signal and there is a third switch that generates the 'brake warning light' signal.

Also in Bentley, Figure 4-8 of Chapter 9 has some more detail of the cross wiring of the two switches.

and that is not right either. yes there are 2 hydraulic circuits but just
one electrical circuit.
the switches are wired in parallel. it is more obvious in the earliest
diagrams, not so obvious in the middle ones .. but follow the wires on the
later ones and you will see it.. and extremely obvious when they change to
the current track type diagrams.

the color diagrams for all years are on vintagebus.com courtesy of thom.

the third switch in the early bays is the brake light warning test switch
on the dash. "B".
