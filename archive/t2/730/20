Subject: [T2] Accufire And Bruck 205 Dizzy

FYI.   When fitting the AccuFire Electronic Ignition
Module into the Bruck VWC-043-905-205 SVDA
Distributor, you will need to use the shaft spacer,
and you will need to file the edges of the sensor body
in two places, to prevent the flat plastic plate with
4 magnets from scraping during revolution.  Also, the
Bruck has a round shaped hole in the dizzy body, as
opposed to the square shaped Bosch hole.  Result:  The
plastic bushing through which you can run the sensor
wires cannot be used on the Bruck.
    
Quality Alert:  Out-of-the-box, the Bruck 205 arrives
with points and condensor installed.  18-thousandths
gap were to specs upon arrival.  However, the Bruck
factory failed to lubricate the points contact to the
shaft.  And during installation, we paid no attention
to the lack of shaft lube.  As a result, the points
don't keep the 18-thousandths adjustment, and caused
me to break-down when en route to the Dash Point
WetWesties campout this last weekend.  We hastily
converted it to the Taiwanese AccuFire Ignition to get
the bus out of the ditch and back onto the highway. 
But not before missing the campout.  Without lube, the
points barely make it past 2 tankfuls of gasoline.
