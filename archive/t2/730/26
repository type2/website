Subject: VDO temp gauge

Hi,

Could someone with a VDO temp gauge do a test for me please?

I did some more testing.  From the temp sensor, I get
1k ohms at room temp (removed from vehicle, 70degrees F
room temp)

on the completely disconnected gauge I have:

ground to signal : 170 ohms
ground to + : 155 ohms
+ to signal : 140 ohms

my meter leads give 1 ohm resistance, so I know the
meter is working correctly.

Do these readings sound correct for the gauge?
What reading do you get from yours?

I guess the sensor is non-functional.  I get 1k ohms
when VDO tech support says I should have 600 ohms.

Rich
