Subject: Re: [T2] Paint color reference, how does it work ?

I think he meant "Paint store", not parts store. Paint mart here in
red bluff is real good with mixing my paint needs.$23 gets me a pint
made up and a rattle can to touch up with.

 Lovely P.O. gave me a color code for the non stock paint he used to on
 the body of the bus : MTK 2247A. He said I can get it in any "parts
 store". For me any parts store means Kragen but I do not think they
 carry it... So where should I go to buy that paint ??
