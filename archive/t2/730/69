Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pressure Regulator Interchange

From Greg Potts:

Would the fuel pressure regulator from  a 1988 Vanagon work with a 1977 
 L-Jetronic system??
 
 I have one from a parts vanagon available if the swap would work.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I doubt it will work. The bay part # is 022 906 035.  The Vanagon is 025 133 035.
The bay unit has a fuel line on each end, one in and out, with a vacuum line on the side.
The pic in ETKA of the Vanagon is different. It appears to have 3 fuel lines going to it with 
a vacuum hose on the end.
