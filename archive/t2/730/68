I'm actually dealing with wiring issues myself. My family room is strewn
with a massive wiring harness collection. I'm in the process of putting
together a new wiring harness for my 73 Bus. If someone can handle the
frustration of building a set of these, I bet they would make quite a pretty
penny by selling them. I for one would certainly be willing to pay $500
bucks for a full NON computer controlled electrical wiring harness for my
Bus.

I ended up going with a new kit from "It's a Snap!". They are basically the
competitors of "Painless Wiring".

Interestingly enough, there exists no kit that I know of that actually takes
the Bus's long wires into consideration... being that the motor and the dash
are on two complete ends of eachother...

The wires are nice though, they actually have the function of the wiring
printed on the wire itself every 4 inches. (or three inches or something
like that).

The kit is pretty decent, but the fuse block is pretty cheap. Basically, I'm
building my own harnesses off this kit.. since everying is in a completely
different place than it is in a normal car. I don't mind... but, I'm just
happy that everything will be new, and at least for now.. the last thing
I'll have to worry about is whether or not my wiring is ok.

What I hope to do one of these days when all my other projects are finished,
is create a NEW harness (with my newfound knowledge of wiring up cars..
hehe...) and repair my factory fuse block and fuses. I prefer things to look
stock... but for now, this will work well so that I can drive my bus, and
not have to worry about wiring issues.
