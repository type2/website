Subject: Re: [T2] Accufire And Bruck 205 Dizzy

But consider my situation.  It's Saturday.  Raining. 
My bus is broken down in a strange town.  I've walked
to an Auto Parts store, and an Accufire is in-stock.
     
The problems with Pertonics PER1847 are 3 fold, when
your bus is dead along the side of the road:  The
trigger unit is $60, and then you have to buy their
coil at $30.  AND, they did not have a PER1847 or
PER1847A in stock.  The AccuFire was on the shelf at
the auto parts store we WALKED to.  The Pertronics was
not.  Hey, I have experience with AccuFire.  I know it
works.  (Albeit Taiwan made.)  I had a broken-down bus
& trailer full of equipment on the side of the road,
and was looking at familiar hardware.  And at only
$40, it was the obvious choice for this wayward bus
owner, who was looking at walking back to his dead bus
on the side of I-5.  Anyway, it got the bus out of the
ditch, so-to-speak.
    
We were able to fix the bus without calling AAA.
     
Q:  Who is the maker of a Bruck 205?  A:  Bruck.  Q: 
Who`s buried in Grants tomb?   Ha ha ha ha.  Sorry. 
But I need a good hearty laugh about now.  My weekend
was nothing to laugh about.
   
Seriously though, all of the Bruck parts have VW &
Bosch-type part numbers.  The SVDA distributor had the
part number VWC-043-905-205.  Its Cap is
BOS-1-235-522-056.  Rotor BOS-1-234-332-215.  Points
BOS-1-237-013-044.  Condenser BOS-1-237-330-220.  All
generic stuff.
   
One thing I did not mention in my earlier T2 posting
was the bus did not work when we re-assembled it.  The
Brain plug got knocked loose somehow.  But 12 hours
later when we made that discovery, then the Bruck and
the Accufire did their work to get us, our trailer,
and our equipment home.
   
Was it Tom Sawyer who had hard luck stories everytime
he opened his mouth?  Well, I guess I am continuing
that tradition.  Sorry.
