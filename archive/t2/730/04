Subject: FI brain part number?

I've got two brains here and cannot determine their application.
Been through the T2 archive, and throughout the internet searching
for an hour+.  I give up.  Can anyone help identify these?

One has part number 0 280 000 ?82 (lable is scratched)
and also 039 906 021D.

The other brain says 0 280 000 168.

Even with 2.5 brains here I can't make sense of this.  <8*)
