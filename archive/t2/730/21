Subject: T4 bus engine in a Karmen Gia?

I have a friend with a Gia project.  He is planning to
put a T4 bus engine into the Karmen Gia.  Anyone have
any experience.  He already has a bus tranny and is
thinking of buying one of my spare bus engines.  Can
you put a "doghouse" on a T4 or will a suitcase rear
end cooling fan fit?

Comments and experiences appreciated,

By the way I am cleaning out some of my stash.  I have
some bus and Westy seats which will go to the dump
next month if nobody claims them.  Front, mid & rear
folding weekender.  If you need any other parts and
are in Utah.  Give me a call.  EFI to Westy top.  If I
don't have it you don't need it.
