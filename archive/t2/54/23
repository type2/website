Subject: oil leak due to ??? cold??

Common sources for oil leaks are..

- Oil pressure transducer
- Seals on oil cooler
- Oil filler tube

  As it started suddenly I would start with the oil
pressure transducer (sender) Look at it an see if it
is
wet. If it is.... it is leaking.
  The oil cooler is a different story. Could be the
seal or the damn thing might have ruptured on you.
  I run an 1800 so not to sure on your 1600 where the
oil pressure sender is located.. look in the book if
you have one.
  Just a starting point. Good luck!
