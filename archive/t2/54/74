I never said that they take a long time to ship

I do this frequently with the Bus Depot, and I do pay the extra couple
bucks.

depends,  $15 dollars is not that expensive when you "NEED" the part
yesterday

I always got 2 days or less when I paid for it (assuming it was in stock)
and I ask when I place the order

Well, about a year ago I ordered a sealed ball-bearing unit for the sliding door track's vertical wheel from Bus Depot.  I tried installing it about 5-6 weeks ago, and it didn't fit.  This thing cost me almost $50.  I called Bus Depot to see if I could exchange this thing for store credit, and the customer service guy went on the computer and saw all my other orders except this one.  Of course, I didn't have the invoice for it, and maybe a year is too long to expect a business to exchange a part, but I've had other vendors do it.  

don't we all do that??,  gotta garage full of stuff for my bus (or
someone elses')
