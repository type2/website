Chris,

On my 76 there's a device that sits in the brake line in the front
of the bus that gets clogged.  Kind've like a small pump that uses
the pressure of the fluid to make a connection that controls the
brakes lights.  Perhaps this is the problem?

Any more substantial (and knowledgeable) ideas from the list?
