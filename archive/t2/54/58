Subject: hit & run

i just got home from work & some a-hole did me the favor of hitting my bus
while i was gone.  no note on the windshield or nuthin'.

well i just called the police & they are on their way. doubtful they will be
able to do anything though.  just thought i would pass the info along if
anyone really cares.

i'll post pics of the damage to my website as soon as possible.

for now, it looks like i'll at least be needing the following 2 items:
1 - front right turn signal lens
2 - yellow reflector lens on passenger door

anyone got 'em cheep?

i'm so freakin' p.o.ed right now. thanks for letting me vent.
