Hey Em

You go Girl!  I've been hoping to find a set of "15 rims also for quite 
awhile (not real hard, due to availability of funds), so if you find a good 
source would you mind passing it on to me?  I know the list archives would 
do well to have it also.

I also think the advantages out weigh the disadvantages!  Have you tried to 
find LT tires for a "14?  Very limited selection and many retailers have 
actually denied their existence?! I mean less stress on engine, greater 
ground clearance and a wider selection of tire choices! Sounds like a weiner 
to me.

TIA
