I have a 77 Westy with an 81 engine.

When the engine is cold the bar that controls the flaps will not move. When 
the engine is warm I can easily move it back and forth but I can't tell if 
that means the flaps are open or closed.

Is this the correct operation. It seems my engine does not warm up very 
quickly in cold weather which would lead me to believe the flaps are open.

Any thoughts?
