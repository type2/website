Subject: breaking the cylinder glaze

How much pressure should I use when I break the glaze on my cylinders? 
I have an adjustable tool that allows me to change the pressure of the
stones..

Also, what should I use to lubricate the cylinder while I'm deglazing?

Any other tips and tricks would be very welcome!

Thanks,
Mike
