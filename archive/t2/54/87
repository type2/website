Subject: Re: [T2] Brake lights - help

Have you checked the brake light switch/switches on the master cylinder.
Take the wires off of the cylinder and use a jumper to connect the ends of the wire together, turn the ignition on and brake lights should come on.

If lights come on then switch is duff.

If lights stay off then it could be the combined brake/flasher relay
