Subject: RE: F.S. Banjo fittings for oil-pressure gauge sender installation

Hi,

These fittings are also easilly makeshifted from simple hardware. I read about it years ago on archives. I bought a 45 degree female-
female elbow and a 3 inch male-male tube. The tube screws into the case, the elbow mates to the tube and your sender unit mates 
to the elbow. It costs peanuts, like maybe 3 dollars. Just make sure you don't use teflon tape or anything that insulates the current 
transfer. I used locktite but made sure I did not apply it to the entire surface. I left 25% of the male mating surface at the tip uncoated 
so it could make proper contact. Don't put any on the female surface or it will end up covering everything.

Raises the sender unit just above the engine tin. Works like a charm and has never come loose. Looks like this. (Not positive about 
M8 but bring your sender with you to be sure like I did)
