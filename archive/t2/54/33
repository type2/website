Subject: Re: [T2] Locate the PO of '80 Vanagon ; Hyattsville MD

Don't know...

I quoted the Hollywood Video information because there was NO indication 
that the bus was from the local (Baltimore MD) area.  And the date of June 
2001 on the receipt pretty much assures that the VW was runing then, just 5 
months ago.

Now here's the rest of the story:  The Camper 'had' a Michelin XZX 185R14 
tire on it that was abslutely the freshest and newest I've seen in -6- years 
of hunting. It appears to even have the white glue from the tire sticker on 
the thread!!

OK, so what??  OK, so where did the PO get this Michelin XZX tire.  Was it a 
recent purchase, or did they have this XZX as a spare for the last 10 years 
(XZX were not available in USA for the past 10 years.  There is some rumor 
that they were being produced in CANADA)

I would LOVE to get -3- more matching Michelin XZX.
