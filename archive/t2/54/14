Dear Listees

If anyone is interested, I have about seven or eight spare, M8 x 1.0mm 
threaded banjo fittings, which can be used as part of a neat, easily fitted, 
easy maintenance installation for oil-pressure gauge sender units on VW Type 
4 air-cooled engines.

These can be supplied, together with an illustration of the complete 
installation.

Regards.

        Nigel A. skeet
