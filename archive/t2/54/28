Subject: Re: 15" wheels and Fat Boy Muffler

Not as much as you might think because the added weight is very near the
center of rotation so the rotational inertia is exponentially less than if
that weight were near the edge of the rim.

You can see this when a spinning ice skater pulls their arms in the RPM
increases drastically using the same amount of inertia.
