nothing difficult, BUT there will be fair bit of wiring involved, and the FI
system is all dependent on good wiring. you need to provide power for the FI
system and electric fuel pump. like i said, not really difficult, especially
since you have a donor vehicle with everything in place, but lots of wiring,
and some of it needs to go from the engine bay to the fuse box. it is worth
doing for the extra power, especially IF the 2.0 motor and FI system are in
very good shape.

you also want to check if the final drive gear ratio is good, perhaps swap
the engine and trans from the donor, since i believe the later trans will
work better.
