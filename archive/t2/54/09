Pilot bearing or throwout bearing.  IF the sound appears only when the
clutch is fully depressed it's pilot.  If the sound starts as soon as you
put pressure on the clutch, it's throwout.  Cure is the same in any case.
Pull engine and replace.  Do it soon if it's the pilot bearing.  If the
pilot gets stuck it will be a bear to remove the engine, and you're likely
to pull the pilot shaft out of the transmission in the process.  As for
cost, call the shop up and say "How much to replace a throwout bearing in
a '71 bus?"
