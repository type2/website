According to my own '72 wheel and several trips to the local junk yards, you 
just pry the black portion of the button off the silver rim with a very thin 
screwdriver, razor, or knife. The manuals I've read are very indistinct 
about this; I broke a whole load of the black plastic off my wheel trying to 
pry the whole assembly out, so be careful. You need to get the tool between 
the black portion of the button and the silver bit. I hope this is relevant. 
It fits later 70s buses I've seen junked, but of course I haven't seen 
yours. Good luck!
