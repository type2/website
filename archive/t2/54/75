Subject: Re: [T2] Ordering from Bus Depot??

I've said this before and here's my 2cents worth...
I like knowing where the parts are manufactured.
I'm usually not in a hurry to get parts (you get used to waiting for many 
things here in the pacific)...if I really need it fast, I do the 2day air 
(actually takes 3+)
I like the prices (and the list member discount)
I like purchasing from listees...Bus Depot, Busted VW, Aircooled,etc. (seems 
like a family business)
I deeply appreciate the valuable information from these (and all) listees.
If  someone screwedup...It will be fixed.
Besides all this...if I were in a hurry...I would'nt own a VW Bus.
Sit back and enjoy the ride...
Aloha from the Big Island!
