With our pistons, if you loosen the deck and compression, detonation
INCREASES because you lose the squish. our pistons are specially designed
and made (and expensive), right now we are making 94mm bore for T-1 ONLY.
After further work, we may make T-4 pistons also, in 94, 96, and maybe
102/103mm bores.

With those you need to stick to conventional "rules" regarding reasonable
compression, matched to cam duration. Most engines around 7.5-7.8:1.

consider the volume in the piston dish to be part of the head ccs when
making CR calculations.
