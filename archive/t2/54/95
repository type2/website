The 2.0 motor itself is effectively identical.  It's the FI that presents the 
challenge.  Besides the obvious (FI wiring harness, all the sensors, the air 
intake, the fuel pump, etc.) you'll need to figure out some things.  You'll 
need the fuel tank (FI has a return inlet as well as the outlet).  You'll need 
to figure out where you're going to install the brain box and the fuel pump.  
You'll need to rig a bit of wiring.  If you're going to use the tin from the 73 
you'll need to drill a hole for the head temp sensor above the #3 cylinder.  
And if you're using your 73 tranny, don't forget to put your 73 clutch and 
pressure plate on the new motor.  Basically, everything is do-able.  Just take 
your time and use some common sense.
