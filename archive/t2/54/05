Hi Steven and Billy,
Thanks for the reply.
I am already trying to do exactly what you are describing, but I can't get it
to work due to this grounding problem.  I may not have made myself clear in
the first post.  The horn appears to be grounded where it is mounted to the
frame.  Literally the bolt that holds the horn to the frame is what completes
the circuit.  Should the horn itself be insulated from the frame?  Am I
missing some rubber part(s) that would do this?  It works fine if I unbolt it
from the frame.
And Billy, I understand how the horn circuit works (silly as it may be), and I
understand how the horn was originally grounded.  But when I disconnect the
original ground wire from the horn, and thus create an "open" space within the
original circuit, the horn still sounds.  The horn will sound with ONLY the
12v wire connected, meaning the horn has found a new ground (without using a
ground wire.)  Hope that made sense.
The saga continues.
Thanks again.
-PM

Actually, the horn grounds when you push the button on the steering wheel.
grounds right to the column. so in bypassing this, you lost your ground.
