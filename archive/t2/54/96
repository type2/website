Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat question

With the engine hot push a thin wire (coathanger) up through the openings
in your oil cooler. You should feel the flap on the end touching the
wire, push it and see if the flap will move. This flap closes when its
warm to direct air over the cooler. When the engine is cold this flap is
open.
I seriously doubt that you have a good thermostat but you can pull the
right pushrod shield off and see if it is sucked in when it is cold. If
its broken it wil have expanded out to completely fill the steel frame
that holds it.
