Subject: Re: [T2] ahh bus fire again

I bought the engine from a guy who said it was "rebuilt." i took all the tin 
off of the engine and there was orange sealer around the base of the 
cylinders. you're right. my bus did have a 2.0 fi in it but it was a flood 
damage vehicle so the original engine was locked up. thanks for the help and 
i'll report back when i put the exhaust back on  which should be tommorow.
