Scott,

There are other mods!!  Several sites show you how
to...errr...raise the pressure in your your
control pressure regulator without taking it apart.  I took my old dead
one apart to see if it would work....it would.  buyer beware!!!

if anyone is really interested you can buy a "rising pressure
regulator" from several sources...adjustable too.$$$$

Get this book....tips on increasing performance....etc

Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management 

Basicallly you are limited by the same things that limit a carb with a
fixed venturi size.....and the most importatnt.....there is a limit to how
much fuel you can get through a fuel injection valve.....even if it is 
open all the time...


Nice timing diagrams in the book.   No, it will not help troubleshoot very
well, but it does have a good description of the overall idea...


Cheers ,dave
