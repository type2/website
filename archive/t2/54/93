Hi everyone and Happy Turkey day to all.

I have a 1980 Westy I am rebuilding and have hit a stumbling block on the
2.0l re-assembly.
I cannot get the intake runner (rubber) sleeves back on the air distributor
and runners. When I remove the air distributor and put the sleeves on the
runners, I cannot then slide them back onto the air distributor to connect
them.

Any help/advice would be appreciated
