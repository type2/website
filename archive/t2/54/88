I did it too a few years ago and yes it works well. It can break off if 
knocked around alot.

Instead of thread locker (Loc-Tite) get a bottle of hydraulic system 
sealant (also made by Loc-Tite). It is used just like thread locker but 
seals up hydraulic fittings wonderfully. One bottle will last you years!

I'm sure there are other brands too.
