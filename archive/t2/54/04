Subject: Tire Dating Numbers

Over the years I've accumulated several spare tires.
Recently the NTSB published the serial numbering sequence that discloses
the date of manufacture of a tire.
I'd like to select the freshest of these tires ,use it as a spare on my
Vanagon and discard to older tires.
Anybody happen to save the information on this numbering method.
