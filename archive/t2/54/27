Subject: Re: [T2] pilot bearing problem?

We had fun with a 1600cc '70 Westy one time that ate about 5 of these 
bearings in 20 miles.

Turns out on of the cross shaft arms bent and was allowing the bearing to 
get off center with the pressure plate.

Took a while to understand what was going on.

When I went through my Type IV Beetle build-up I replaced the bushing for 
the cross shaft, added a stronger full welded cross shaft (was not 
necessary), replaced the input shaft seal, the crankshaft seal, and greased 
the gland nut bearing (in my case the bearing was part of the flywheel - 
because I am running custom parts). I would also do some serious 
consideration and take a good look at the clutch plate. Does it need 
replacing?

If pulling the engine is a big deal to you, do it all so you don't have to 
do it again anytime soon (especially in the dark parking lot while taking a 
weekend road trip - been there, done that).

Be sure to look closely at that cross shaft.

Ciao!
