Subject: Oil sensor thread repair

Fellow and sister bussers:
In the grand tradition of El Dumbo, I stripped the oil pressure sensor
thread on my Type 1 engine case.

Can anyone enlighten me on repairing the damage? I assume it there is a
possiblity of a helicoil repair, but since I have never done one, any
information (parts, procedures, precautions, etc) would be IMMENSELY
helpful.

Many thanks. Steve Leonard
