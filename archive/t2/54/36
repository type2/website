Subject: RE: [T2] pilot bearing problem?

pulling the engine on a 71 is soooo easy.. if you knew how easy you would 
kick yourself for paying to have it done... i mean we are talking about a 
van with a slighty bigger than usual lawn mower engine.you need a socket 
set, a jack, and a few small scraps of wood. i know how it can be 
intimidating the first time.. just follow the instructions in your manual.. 
once you have the engine out you can replace the bearing and whatever else 
you have the money for.. alot of people will tell you to replace everything 
you can at once which is a good idea.. if money is a problem just replace 
what you can, as you will learn the engine pulling job is so simple you can 
replace those other items as you have the money. one more thing.. once you 
get the engine out you might want a little help getting that gland nut off. 
it is torqued on at like 220 foot pounds so invite a hefty friend over for 
coffee, pbr, or sodie pops... you will need a 36mm socket.. and a good 
cheater bar

go for it!

P.S. if you have time, might i suggest taking off the engine shroud just to 
clean up a bit and "have a good look round"
