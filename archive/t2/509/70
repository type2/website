Subject: Steering looseness

Hi Everyone,

The steering on my bus is fairly loose, the steering wheel turns ~ 4-5 inches
before the wheels actually start turning.
Now, I had all four ball-joints replaced (as they really needed replacing). And
following the "Idiot's Guide" determined that the swing lever arm is not moving
up and down while the steering wheel is turned left to right.
So, my questions are: 

Before adjusting the steering box is there anything else I should be doing? 
Should I also replace the steering dampner? How does one know if it's shot?
Is there anything else that would make the steering so loose?


TIA,
Harry
