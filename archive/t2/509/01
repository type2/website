Subject: VDO Gauges for Sale

Hey guys,

        I hope you don't mind if I plug my eBay auction. If you do,
please let me know and I'll stop. Every bit of money I make from stuff I
sell on eBay goes right back into my Bus! Anyway, I have a set of gauges
(complete gauge cluster) for a VW Bus, but.. it's for the one that comes
with the EGR, and catalytic converter. What's weird about it too is,
there is actually a light for the EGR and for the CAT individually?!
Never seen this in a car before. I bought it like 3 months ago when I
knew very little about my Bus, I thought maybe it would work for my car.
Well, it would, but you know.. it's not original for my 73. I paid $16
for it at the junkyard. The gauges are immaculate (I cleaned the cover of
course) but they're in really good shape.
