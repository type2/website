Hey Todd, keep your head up...alot of us have been slapped around by ADMIN.
Keep living freely...but when in Type 2 land just do it more cautiosly...or
pad your back side in prep for a spanking.
MOST IMPORTANTLY keep lovin' and sharin' and bouncin' down the road in your
BUS (got the bus content in)!
Todd, some of us around here just wear a grin all the time and some have
forgotten how to...my advise...keep grinnin'...:-)
