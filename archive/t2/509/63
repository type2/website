Subject: Are bus owners friendly?

This new guy, Todd M Jaspers, just got his bus 4 months ago and is excited
about fixing it up and becoming a part of the Vdub community. So he finds
Type 2 and joins the list and sends a post with an eb*y auction link...a
no-no that he has appologized for. This guy is getting bludgened with emails
from listees for trying to take advantage, price gouging and other lashings.

So, this is what we want a new bus owner to think of the Vdub bus
community...I mean one mistake deserves an all-out lashing?

I own four Vdubs and have always been proud of the VW community and how it
sticks together and is eager to help. I honestly did not know you could own
a VW and be mean-spirited until I joined this list. Now, I'll probably take
a beating for saying this, but I really think we need to lighten up. You
know, I think a good rule of thumb would be to take a look at your bus...you
should now be smiling...and then write your post.

Didn't someone once say, "Can't we all just get along?"
