Subject: ETKA CD & praise for thebusco.com

Quite some time ago I purchased one of those ETKA CD's that was floating
around everyone's favorite auction site and I've been trying to get it to
run properly under Windows XP, but nothing seems to work.  Does anyone have
any idea on how to make this work?

This guy is great!  He got me all of the hard to find pieces that I needed
for my 78 to 74 exhaust conversion and didn't charge me ridicules prices for
the stuff.  He even had the very hard to find 79 only tin piece and
alternator bracket!  I'm a very satisfied customer!
