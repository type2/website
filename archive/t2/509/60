See if you can track down Guerin in Lisboa. I don't know Portuguese and all
I could find on Google was a Guerin auto  rental agency. The name plate on
your bus suggests the camper conversion was done by a company called Guerin
though. You may be able to find more info on a localized search engine.

Doesn't look like much room for a bed up there. The top appears to
basically "just cover the hole". A decent sized sleep area would need a
pop-top that covered some of the solid roof area as well, like the Riviera
conversion I just bought http://www.phorce1.com/bbb8/DSCF0139.htm.
