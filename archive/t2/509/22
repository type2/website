Subject: Any Ramona, CA list members?

Hi,  I was wondering if anyone on the list lives in the Ramona, CA area?  I
ordered some VW parts from a guy named Chadd Magee.  I believe he runs a
business called gobug.com. I'm wondering if anyone has delt with him?  I
found out about him on thesamba.com classifields.  If you have delt with
him, please email me off the list.
thank you,
Keri
