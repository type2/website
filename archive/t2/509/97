Subject: Re: Propane Conversion

I have been mulling this type of coversion myself for some time,  What I
have seen from my internet research, is that comparably sized motors (say
2L to 2L) one would get about a 20% power loss from using propane versus
gasoline,  Soemthing about the BTUs (I am not a chemist or a physicist).
Can we afford a 20% power loss on a 67 hp engine?

I plan a subaru conversion at some point in my almost rust free 78.  The
subaru ea-81 is an almost bombproof carbed engine, also a boxer. No timing
belts.  The only concern is - can one use a spfi (single port, like a
throttle body) injection with propane? or, does one have to use a mpfi?
The subie guys on the USMB have had success with swapping both from the
ea-82 to the ea-81, but the wiring and other stuff is obviously simpler
for the spfi.  With gas, they claim the spfi on an EA-81, one could get
about 90hp, take the 20% loss (72hp) that propane could cause, and the we
are still more than the type 4 stock made.

So many ideas, so many questions, not enough money, nor time.
