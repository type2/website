Subject: buses for sale- One in PDX one in OlyWA

AQ friend of mine has a 74 rustbucket that he is thinking of parting out, but hed take a quick 800 to sell the whole thing. If he parts it out hes going top sell the parts on the samba. I have not seen the bus but its described as "runs drives great very rusty needs to be hotwired to start" I know little else, but if anyone wants a working type IV motor (not to mention an IRS tranny, calipers CVS and a steering box) that drives around on its own email me at starkmojo at yahoo dot com and Ill get you in touch with the owner. I have no stake in this.

This from the PDX craigslist. No idea about the it just thought Id pass it along.

Mechanically perfect except one sticky valve. Body staright, tinted windows, excellent auto transmission. Paint is not good, make an offer-(503)819-5684

In my own life Ezmerelda is doing good. The Franken motor is running along, although Im a little concerned about her drinking problem (300miles per qt, about twice my usual VW consumption and only getting 14 mpg in town on the gas) but she doesnt leak it, and I dont see blue clouds when I drive. When I get back from my next trip shes going to get some work done on her- rear brakes and shocks, and a full tune up and a carb balance. I feel so much better now that Im driving her again instead of the GFs rice burner.
