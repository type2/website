I now looked at the T2 fiche as well and discovered
the part number for part:

  "241 853 445"

is the same on T1's as on T2's! So the part actually
didn't change when the Baywindow was introduced.

The rest could be different though...depends on the
partnrs and a possible difference in the length of the
bars.

You can P-mail me if you like to have a picture of
this microfiche as well.


yours,


Vincent
