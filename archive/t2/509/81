It looks like I tossed the original post about this but as I recall the
question was about the part numbers ending in 445 and 455. The parts book
says that 445 is the bracket in the middle of the rear window. 455 is the
guard rail without brackets for the rear seat. And, indeed, this setup was
standard in the 241 & 244 models and was not available as an M code or
accessory. The 241/244/251 is listed as VW-Micro Bus L (presumably
Luxury). If I can be of any further help let me know.
