For those of you who suffer from the same Tim Allen "more horsepower is 
better" sickness as I do, when you find these Corvair donors, be sure to 
try to get the whole car. 1st b/c about the time you get halfway through 
the project you'll realize that you need something you left on the car, and 
furthermore you can e-bay the trim and glass and nits and bits and generate 
a few greenbacks to help your project along.

I've got a shed full of Corvair parts (trim, hubcaps, instruments, turbos, 
etc.) I won't use but plan to e-bay eventually. I expect to cover at least 
1/3 of the cost of the project if not 1/2...

My point is moving the whole car is more trouble than moving just the 
drivetrain BUT sometimes it is easier to work out a deal with the seller 
and if you can recoup some of the investment, why not?

FWIW my donor car was QUITE restorable but in the end the shell went to the 
crusher and the rest into my shed.
