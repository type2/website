Subject: Trans-vair - the long lost Type VI

Got lots of pics but they are in my camera which is at home. I'll send them 
to anyone that wants them. I plan to put a PDF document together outlining 
the process and discussion the cost and methods. The Trans-Vair kit 
instructions that I have (no doubt 20 years old) are really miserable. I'll 
also post some pics when I am done on www.TheSamba.com

The Corvair transplant used to be an economical conversion I think back in 
the 70's when Corvairs where just old used cars and plentiful. These days 
the kit is $650, the engine and tranny might be $500 unless you are lucky, 
and that doesn't even take into account repairs like tune ups, seals, 
gaskets, etc. Maybe $1500 would be a starting price...

The kit shown is the kit for the early baywindow ('68-'71) and will not fit 
the '72-'79 bus. I have totally reworked the brackets to fit my bus. LOTS 
of work. Of course if I was ordering a new kit, I'd order the right kit for 
my bus of course... It truly would be a weekend project I've been told by a 
couple folks who have done the project.

My kit was $150 (NOS), engine and tranny $150, and misc $300-$500... I'll 
have a 40 year old 65K mile engine... Worse than a 25 year old Type IV but 
my Type IV was ready for bearings and such so it was time to do 
something... I'm not altering the bus in any way and I'm bagging and 
tagging all the VW parts so I can go back to VW power eventually if I want.

I truly think the VW engine was too small and underpowered for the 
application. Not bad when the highways were moving at 55 mph but 
underpowered for sure at a 70 mph speed limit when alot of the traffic is 
running 75 and 80 mph.

I'm really a patient guy, not wanting to drive everywhere at 80 mph.

When I drop down to 50-55 mph or so to climb a mountain I feel like I'm 
really taking a chance... If I can set the speed at 65 mph and hold it, 
I'll be much happier. Had I been able to design my engine, I'd have a flat 
6 (a Type VI?) based on the VW Type IV with cooling similar to the Corvair 
(fan on top) or similar to the Porsche flat-six, and VW style heaters. It 
would be bolted to a 5 speed tranny of some sort.

Either way - be it rebuilding a Type IV or doing an engine conversion - 
life with a bus is getting more expensive but still cheaper than a NEW car...

That's still less than 4 car payments....
