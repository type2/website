You can see the tool in Bentley. It's a c-shaped circular plate that goes between the hub and the case and with the screws you turn it into a puller. You can probably make up something very similar.

It's a standard engine builder (not just VW) technique to protect themselves from bozos who overheat their engines. What I don't understand is why GEX puts them on in the first place since they don't honor their warranties.

Don't engines run a little hotter during the first few thousand miles anyway esuring they will fall off? :-(
