I looked it up on the T1(splitwindow) parts fiche,
part "241 853 445" is there and it is what you
described: the center support. The "255 853 445" is
not mentioned on the fiche...and after some searching
I know why...

The "255" part is actually not a very early part but a
VERY LATE part! ;-)

It is for the vanagon Jailbars! Yes, also vanagons had
jailbars, may be not until the 1990ties but definitely
on the early vanagons. And the 'Type 255' is a Vanagon
Deluxe microbus (vehicle typenumbering on Vanagons is
very different from the baywindow and splitwindow)

I took a picture of the 1979 Vanagon microfiche so you
can see for yourself:
