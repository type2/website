Ouch. Yeah, sorry about the eBay post, I didn't know it wasn't allowed
(obviously, it shows I didn't read the charter).

I spend about... close to 3/4s of my time helping people work on their
cars during the weekend. 
SO much so that I don't even have time to work on my own cars. I help
people change their brakes,
change their oil, do emergency repairs, welding.. EVERYTHING but on my
own car. 

Time I can spare, but money is expensive. Of course I care about my
fellow bus owners. But...
If I can get a certain amount of money for something, then why shouldn't
I?
I used to make it a business of buying and selling parts from the
junkyard. I would buy 
a Porsche 924,944, or 911 steering wheel from the junkyard (yes, they
have those cars there!!!),
I'd pay about $9 bucks, and then turn around and sell it for about
$80-100 bucks.

Or, I'd buy rare items like, a complete cowl-induction set-up from an
82-84 TransAm for $12, and then
turn around and sell it on eBay for $300. What's wrong with that?

You should see my attic. I have hundreds of rare parts from the junkyard
just waiting to be sold on eBay in 10 years.
Hood scoops from muslce cars, original Pontiac Rally wheels, camel heads,
carburetors, Corvette parts.

This one piece that I bought (the gauges) I was hoping to use, little did
I know that they were different though.. :\
