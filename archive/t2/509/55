Subject: Glass and Jailbars

In reading a post from OldVolks General recently the subject of
jailbars for glass was mentioned.

I'm curious as to why the jailbars fell out of vogue here on the
North American continent.  It seems logical to me that particularly
late bays with defrost grids would have benefited from such a thing.
Am I unaware of a series of jailbars that may have been in existance
for the late bay  glass variation?

And if they do exist for the bay body type,... who has them and how
much?
