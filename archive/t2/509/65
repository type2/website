I can see both sides of the situation and I think that
the solution is to let the Admins do their work. If
someone commits a "boo-boo" as our friend Todd did,
then the Admins should be the ones to send him a
"gentle" reminder about the rules, and the rules ARE
important, but I agree with you Duane, let's not give
a new person a bad impression of what we are all
about. So for everyone who bludgeoned Todd with
emails, why don't you let the Admins do the Adminning
(is that a word?!)
BTW, here's my obligatory bus content: I dropped a
headlight lens from my 67 on the garage floor and
shattered it, can someone recommend a vendor who has
these for CHEAP!!
