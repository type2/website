I did this to my Beetle on a bet with a friend that the starter would run 
backwards... It didn't and the car ran just fine.

I reversed the connections and nothing was hurt. With a generator you may 
need to polarize it...

Am I correct in assuming the reason the starter runs the same direction no 
matter what is b/c it is a shaded pole motor? Anyone? Frye? Anyone? <grin>
