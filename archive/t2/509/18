That statement was a bit misleading. I don't mean to say that the Corvair 
as expensive to rebuild to basic factory specs as a performance VW Type IV.

Depends on what you want to spend. I got my engine for $150 with tranny. 
Pit Stop has whole long blocks used for $300-$500. I don't know what you 
get with that... However you can do a nice rebuild yourself for similar to 
a VW Type IV engine I think. Just shop around.
