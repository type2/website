 From the charter:

http://www.type2.com/type2charter.html

"Do not try to promote your eBay auctions or other auctions on the
list. We filter heavily for this. If we want to know what is for sale on
eBay we will go there and look."

Obviously we don't filter as heavily as we used to, but that's beside the 
point.

My personal opinion is that if you paid $16 for the instrument cluster, the 
thing to do would be to offer it up on the list for $20 or less, because 
you care about your fellow bus drivers and want to help them out.  Of 
course, if you choose to extract maximum coin at an auction site, I can't 
stop you.  Just don't ask me to sell you
