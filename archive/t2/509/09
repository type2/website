Subject: Covair Conversions

I would think that since the corvair had a much shorter production run then
type 1/2/4 motors, finding parts for a Vdub with a Corvair conversion would
be even more challenging and costly.

Right now on E-bay there are 42 Bus/Vanagon's, 105 bugs, 29 Karmanns, 3
things.. and other weird stuff. That's (C)  200 vehicles.  There are 16
covairs.   sort of the case & point of limited part resources.

With current mods affordable and available for our beloved VW power plants,
does it really make sense to wedge a GM Corvair motor into a type II frame?
Or Subaru for that matter...

I guess I may be in the dark never having driven one.  I've got a stock '78
westy automatic.  The FT engine will go 80 or better if I "have to", but
then again it's a Vdub, so... why?....  It's the Karma...

as a side comment... we don't exactly have LA traffic in South Dakota.  Most
of it still looks like "Dances with Wolves" ... we can see the horizon's
landscape till it drops of the curvature of the earth and most likely count
all the traffic between here and there.
