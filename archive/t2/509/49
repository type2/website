Bob, List, et al...

Yikers!!  I've had that happen on the '72 Weekender - for no apparent
reason, just driving along and light on, oil temps start to rise,
strange spattering on the rear window...

And yes, there IS a woodruff key that may have been shot into orbit, and
the woodruff key "may" have munged it's keyway on the crank, and/or on
the hub holding the fan.  When mine did that little trick I was
returning from a buddy's place at about 11 p.m. at night, and about
one-third home, fortunately I had cell coverage and he brought me a
spare hub AND the key of his seized up 914 motor.  We bolted it all back
together on the munged keyway (swearing the next time it's apart, it
gets a build-up of JB Weld), and once home I loctited the bolt.  That
was several years ago, and the whole mess is still holding together,
INCLUDING the by-cracky genuine VW impeller hub seal that I paid the Big
Bux (tm) for when I built the motor in 1987.  I kind of figured it might
be hosed and was expecting it to start oozing/dribbling or something,
and it would need to come apart for a replacement, but it never did.
Now that the motor has been replaced by a 2260cc Type 4, I'll just put
that on the memo-to-self when it gets looked into...

Happy Friday all!
