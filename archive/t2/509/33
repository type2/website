volk

  just had a peculiar occurence,  while cruising at about 60 on I-70
couple days ago I heard and felt something that was like hitting a rumble
strip in the road, but no change in engine sound or power...???
  noticed alt light came on, ?? did I throw a fan belt, started looking
for decent place to pull over, I have a spare belt with me.  then noticed
the oil temp was climbing (have temp and pres guages) was quite cold out
so didn't climb fast but got off at next exit and whipped into gas station
and turned off the engine

   looked in the back and the impeller (fan) was off the crankshaft, the
center bolt was laying in the bottom of the fan. OK this is a new one.  I
had put this engine together about 35k ago.  well was bitter cold and I
was racing a snow storm, so just put the bolt back in and torqued it down
tight.....engine started right up and quickly cooled down. so got back on
the road..

   Got home today and everything seems fine, checked the bentley and it
really doesn't say much...this is a cone shaped fit.. don't remember and
it doesn't show on bentley drawing but is there a woodruff key in this
joint, and is there something I should be checking or did it just work
free and I shouldn't have a problem???

thanks
Bob
