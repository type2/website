Anyone know where I can get a starter adaptor to bolt on the right side
of my engine so I can run it on the engine stand before I install it?
Thought I saw one in a magazine recently but can't seem to find it.

I have an ancient one made from a VW magnesium trans case but it
interferes with the flywheel on my 70 engine.

Thanks,
