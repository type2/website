Subject: New engine (again)

Hey folks...

Back in October when I got the new JCS rebuilt engine for my '76 Westy, 
I promised to post my experiences with it...

Well, on Thursday, I picked up my Bus from the shop with another new 
JCS rebuilt engine.

I'll condense the story to: Old oil cooler from original engine was 
leaky and wasn't replaced when the new engine was put in.  Went into 
Buslab to get that taken care of (had to pay for the part, but the 
labor was covered under the engine warranty), found additional leaks in 
the process (oil filler tube, some of the case nuts).  JCS replaced the 
long block without any hassle whatsoever, and it was swapped in last 
week.

You can read the non-condensed version here:

So, while my initial experience with it was "new engine leaking" (FWIW, 
the engine was running like a top at 500mi), I'm pretty pleased with 
the customer service I've received.  I have nothing but good things to 
say about Steve and Marco (-at-) Buslab, and it sure seems like JCS's 
customer service is top-notch, as well[*].

[*] Now, granted, Buslab was the middle-man (Buslab sources all of 
their air-cooled engine rebuilds from JCS), so maybe that influenced 
the quality of service.  But, on the other hand, they didn't even 
require inspection the leaky engine before sending up the new long 
block, which has gotta count for something.

Now, given where the leaky engine was leaking, anyone care to venture a 
guess as to what the problem may have been?  My guesses are:

	* Insufficient case sealant (I've heard that Type 4 engines
	  require a lot of goop in the seam, etc.)

	* Faulty oil pressure relief valve, causing excessive case
	  pressure.

I'm not sure I'll ever find out for sure, but I am quite curious.
