Subject: Re: [T2] Corvair engines and complete cars

Location, location, location... Seriously. A Corvair isn't worth the fuel 
to go get it around here for some folks. Believe me this car donated 
everything it had to donate!

With the junkyards around here there is little or nothing "collectible" in 
them. With what you have in your junkyards you ought to start buying and 
stripping these parts you mention. I have no doubt you couldn't make a NICE 
living e-baying the parts off to fund your VW endeavors. By the way I'd 
just love to have that Fiat 500. Had one in Italy when I lived there.

(Would love to have the Healey, Jag, Merc, etc. etc. too). There is a 
single VW bus in the yards around there. I was roasted about 10-15 years 
ago and body wise is TOAST. All that was left was a tranny. It was gold 
plated to those guys too. Rather than deal in volume, those fellows try to 
make a retirement fortune off of everything they have...
