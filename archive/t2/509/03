Early 411/412 heat exchangers will work very well for this. They have no
heat sink material on the manifold pipes, so if you remove the outer sheet
metal, all you have left is a pair of pipes. Bus heater boxes have a large
cast aluminum heat sink around the 2 manifold pipes which will undoubtedly
radiate heat toward the underside of the engine if you remove the outer
sheet metal of the heat exchanger. I have seen people do this, but I must
say I don't think it is a good idea.
