I don't know too much about carbs, but it sounds like you have your 
vacuum advance/retard lines backwards.  The vacuum line that goes to the 
throttle body should go to vacuum advance.

There is not supposed to be any advance vacuum at idle.  The way that 
the vacuum advance works is when the throttle is *cracked* open.  When 
the throttle plate opens just a little, the hole is exposed to a vacuum, 
and then advances the timing.  This helps the engine speed up.

Again, there is no vacuum at idle on the *advance* line.  This is why 
the Bentley has you check the timing at different speeds and with the 
vacuum advance line connected and disconnected.  One is to check the 
centrifugal advance, and the other is to test the total advance, 
including the vacuum advance.  Don't just disconnect the lines, then 
you'll just mimic an 009 and get crappy performance (oh... did I say 
that ;).  Get it working right and you'll be a happy camper!

granted, this could be totally different on a carbed bus, so ymmv, 
however it's great to see that you're trying to figure this out. 
Knowing what's going on helps a ton!
