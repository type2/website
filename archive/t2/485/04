I just went through this a few months ago. There are two types one with a 
painted black glass frame and one with a chrome frame. My observations are 
that the chrome frame ones don't rust as fast and look better. I found 
several in my local junk yard in non rust condition. After a bit of haggling 
I paid only $10 for a complete window. If only the seal was not $60 and was 
easy to install on the frame (use lube). They are also for sale over at 
thesamba quite often. I don't think you can get a new one. I also repainted 
the frame before I put the new seal on it. I may have POR-15 the frame as 
well... can't remember.

Hope this helps,
Brandt
