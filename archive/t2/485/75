Subject: Re: [T2] Propane heater

Shawn,
I used to have a Mr. Buddy, Heat TV is what I called it as we just watched
the fire burn as it warmed up the bus. If you go that route. Use the BBQ
tank size propane tank as it pushes more heat out than the small bottles and
saves you money in the long run.  But what everyone says is true.  IT will
cause condensation in the bus.  And an open flame isn't real safe.  Not bad
for warming up bus, but always had me worry to much when sleeping.

On that note I upgraded to to a propane furnace the exhausts to the outside.
Same model they put in the big RV campers.  You can check it out at

Hope this helps,
Snoopy
Toasty warm when the furnace is going... :)
