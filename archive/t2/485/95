A good sanity check is to pull the plugs to see if you're running rich.  
If not, then you're probably ok.

Off the top of my head, I'd say 15-16 highway is "ok" and 12 in town is a 
little low.  But the first thing people are going to want to know is:

    are you fuel injected or are you running carbs?  If carbs, which?
