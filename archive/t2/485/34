Subject: Re: [T2] Brake light switch replacement-2 switches???

verify that all of your grounds are functioning properly & that all of 
the contacts are good & clean before looking at the switches.

most of the problems i have had with brake & tail lights have been b/c 
of bad grounds or corroded contacts.

YMMV,
