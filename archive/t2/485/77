Subject: Camper mods and innovations

The Brahmin class of type 2 owners are those who have original or 
restored buses and Westys. I find that when I look through the dozens 
of bus sites on the web, this social elite is well represented.

I'd like to put together a web page of oddballs -- people who have 
created their own campers from an unconverted bus, or who have altered 
their stock conversions in one way or another.

Here's what I am interested in:

Custom-made/homemade casework
Home-brewed solutions to the problems of furnishing HVAC in a bus, 
standing or moving (these can be off the shelf, but cannot have come 
from the dealer)
Upgraded cabin and exterior lighting
Altered and enhanced sleeping arrangements
Improved or simplified refrigeration
Innovations in storage, especially those that prevent rattling of gear 
while driving
Improvements in electrical system
Homemade awnings and sidetents (sidetents that are purchased and then 
altered for use with bus count)
Custom water systems (tanks, spigots, sinks, drains)
Anything that makes a VW camper more convenient, fun, or pleasing to 
the eye or mind

I am not interested in:

Lowered buses

If you have a web page that shows anything from the list above, or have 
things that you've always meant to scan and post, or know of someone 
else's page that fills the bill, would you clue me in so that I can get 
started on this?

Many thanks!
