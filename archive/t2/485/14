By the way, if you're curious about it's condition, you may want to check
the compression of the 4 cyls. Also check the color of the plugs. What
kind of fuel setup do you have? Dual carb? Single Carb? I'd probably
change the oil too... I usually like to dump a half-quart of Transmission
fluid (Dexcron III) in with the oil. The hydraulic fluid usually helps
soften up the seals (which causes them to expand and prevent leaks)..
like the valve seals, etc.

Heheh, yeah, actually.. I own 4 Pontiacs right now. I actually used to
have an 82 TransAm about 5 years ago. 

We have:

2002 Jetta 1.8T (Wife's car)
1997 Pontiac GrandAm GT (my car)
1987 Pontiac Fiero SE / V6 (in the driveway)
1984 Pontiac Fiero 2m4 SE (at the parents house)
1981 Pontiac TransAm WS6 (in the garage)
1973 Volkswagen Transporter (in the garage).

I'm a certified Pontiac Nut. I originally bought the VW Transporter for
my wife because she loves Volkswagens.. I just thought she was crazy. But
having owned this car for the past 6 months, it's really grown on me...
it's totally weird, nostalgic, and just plain fun to drive. It's pretty
relaxing too because, well, it's soo insanely slow, that you don't really
bother with trying to get anywhere fast. You just drive where you want,
sit back, and relax.
