Subject: Re: [VB] '65 trans/clutch slipping?

I heard an interview with Dick Army the other day on the telly. He made a
quip to the effect of you can say just about anything you want about someone
as long as you end it with "God bless em".

Took the first drive in the bus in 2-3 months the other day.

I'm getting very little power in 1/2 gear, and when I try to wind it out or
do anything else with an amount of torque, I'm getting a massive vibration.

I'm assuming my clutch is slipping. I'm thinking it's possible that my
flywheel/clutch were fouled during the time it sat.  My wife cleaned the
engine with simple green/garden hose & it's doubtful that she was extremely
careful, god bless 'er.
