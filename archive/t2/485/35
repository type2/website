Subject: GEX Engine in my 71 Westy

I bought a 71 Westy in Feb. 2002 and have almost 11,000 miles on the GEX
engine since I got it. The PO told me that it had about 500 miles on it when
I bought it. So far so good. I didn'tt know the historoy about GEX before I
went off and bought this Westy but I didn't sleep too well after I heard all
the stories. I wanted to replace the enigne but have decided to drive it and
baby it.

1600 DP w/ pict 34, SVDA from John at  Aircooled.Net and Compufire ignition in
it.
