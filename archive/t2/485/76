Yes.  Each switch has three contacts which are numbered 81, 81a, and 82a.
if you connect a VOM set for continuity between terminal 81 and each of
the other two contacts you should discover that one is open when the
brakes are off and the other is closed.  Depressing the brakes should
reverse that.

On buses since 1967 there are two brake circuits.  Each switch "looks at"
one of the circuits.  In combination they also feed a simple logic circuit
that lights the "B" bulb on your dash if one circuit fails.  If one of the
switches needs replacing then I would replace both.  You don't need to but
they are $5 switches and its a 5 minute job followed by 1/2 hour of brake
bleeding.  How often do you want to spend that 1/2 hour?

                             OOK!
