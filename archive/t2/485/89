I'm over fifty, my friend. There are some things that I'm not 
genetically programmed to "get." Pierced body parts, hip-hop, "edgy" 
beer commercials, lowered buses. If it wasn't in the Whole Earth 
Catalog, it's probably outside the realm of my comprehension.

But since it isn't Friday, I will close by saying that the people on 
this list (and on the vintagebus list) whose opinions I trust almost 
all agree that lowering a bus a bad idea mechanically.
