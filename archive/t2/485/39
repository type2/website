Subject: Re: [T2] Propane heater

Hi Shawn,

I have read a lot of replies on this one and since no-one else has 
mentioned it I will now deliver my usual propane-heater 
dissertation.....

Chemistry:
In chemistry class we learned that Propane + O2 = CO2 + WATER + heat

This means that when you burn propane to heat your bus, you use up 
oxygen (That part HAS been mentioned). What wasn't mentioned on the 
list was the water. Prolonged use of a catalytic heater in a bus in 
winter will result in a layer of frost over the entire interior of the 
vehicle.  Or worse.

History:
I ran a propane heater in my bus through the winter of 99/00, when I 
could not get the BN-4 heater working in my 73 westy.  I used about 25 
lbs of propane from December to March.  Every time I used the heater I 
put water vapor in the bus, and this made keeping the windshield clear 
very difficult at -20 Celsius. Once I arrived at my destination I would 
turn the heater off, and as the bus cooled frost would form on the ALL 
interior surfaces. Next day I would light the heater for another trip, 
and as the interior warmed I would find the whole bus would have it's 
own fall of dew. This would then absorb into upholstery, etc, or I 
would soak it up with paper towel.

Repeat this daily through a 12 week winter, and you will see that 
propane catalytic heat is not a very good solution. A furnace works 
much better, as the exhaust products will be properly vented outside 
the vehicle, leaving warm dry air inside. A propane furnace will cost a 
lot more than a heater, but won't leave the water vapour and CO2 from 
its exhaust in your bus.

Happy trails,
