Subject: '65 trans/clutch slipping?

Okay,

Took the first drive in the bus in 2-3 months the other day.

I'm getting very little power in 1/2 gear, and when I try to wind it out or do anything else with an amount of torque, I'm getting a massive vibration.

I'm assuming my clutch is slipping. I'm thinking it's possible that my flywheel/clutch were fouled during the time it sat.  My wife cleaned the engine with simple green/garden hose & it's doubtful that she was extremely careful, god bless 'er.

Anyone wanna back this theory up?  Is there anything I can check out before pulling the engine again (#3)?

Double checked engine mounting bolts, lug nuts, tranny mounts already.

To the archives now,

Thanks,

Billy
