Subject: radient aux heater

If you go camping in an area with "shore power" ie
you can plug in to AC then I would say use a oil
filled
radient heater. A good friend of mine uses one and it
is an excellent, quiet heat source. She uses her's in
a westy with the top up with no complaints from
anyone.
  I have yet to find anything as good as a vented
furnace
if you dont have a hookup.
