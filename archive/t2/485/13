Subject: RE: [T2] EGR and Vented gas cap

There's been a number of discussions on this subject. IMHO here's the deal:

1) EGR was added to satisfy emissions requirements (to reduce NOx I think).
2) It has the additional side effect of reducing combustion temperatures.
3) Lower combustion temps may increase head life (depends).
4) Lower combustion temps will definately reduce power and fuel economy.

In theory, if you're willing to give up some power and fuel economy to
achieve better emissions and longer engine life, then EGR is a good thing.
The problem with EGR on our busses is that the implementation was pretty
half-assed. The filters clog and rust in a few weeks, the manifold injection
plumbing clogs within a year or so and the mechanical valve wears out($$$).
Then you're driving around with no EGR, but you think it's keeping your
heads cool. Your head temp gauge probably won't show much difference though.

I've tried with and without (I have to bolt it on to smog in a major left
coast state that shall remain nameless). I operate without it now, but I did
carefully contrast before and after performance and valve adjustment
requirements. If your valves need to be adjusted a lot every time, you're
probably running too hot, which I did see (my daily commute involves a
couple very large hills). The temp issue is not an issue except at or near
full power, so you can easily manage it by never going full throttle for an
extended period. I limit myself to about 3-4" vacuum for a hill climb. I
also use 89 Octane gas just in case to prevent detonation.
