Subject: gas mileage

we're all about ready for a run to baja in the 75 westy. i've been getting
such bad gas mileage and couldn't be seen by mechanics in the area for
diagnosis (they're working on BIG jobs). the shop i spoke with say not a
worry - that 12 mpg in town and 15-16 in the highway is what is to be
expected.

is it?   - steve, hoping all pemex's on 1 are open...
