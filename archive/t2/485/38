ok it should be a Fuel injected.
you should have at least one vacuum line to the brake booster,  the 77auto
tranny is centrifugal advance and doesn't have a vacuum line. (ignore
this section of the Bentley)

stock is a combo of both Vac/centrifugal, there is a page in the library
that lists all the dist.  Steve is the Dist guru and he is temp off list.

I would search high and low and put the Fuel Injection back in, the auto
tranny doesn't work worth beans with the carb.  they get in each others
way it seems.
