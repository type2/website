I have a mid 80's VW Scirocco 1600CC Complete Engine with tranny, Injection,
Alt, dizzy, etc. Complete and in good shape, ran when removed, approx 100K
miles - will trade for other car/motorcycle, parts, tools, etc - or
mechanics labor for head gasket replacement - or $95. Other trades
considered - Thanks!
