Subject: Re: [T2] Side Vent Window Frames

> I have a newly acquired '74 Micro... Just spent the weekend tearing it
 apart for a resto and found some unsalvageable parts.  I have vent
 windows in both the driver's rear window sections which are very rusted
 at the bottom.  I need the frame to bus and the frame to glass, are
 these only available used?  Any suggestions on where to find them?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Used from a wrecking yard bus is the only source I know of. I try to pick up everyone I
find that are good but I have not seen any worth buying in about a year. I did have a set of 
3, 2 lefts and 1 right, that I put on that auction site.....only sold the 2 left ones. Still have a right.
They are getting VERY tough to find. The bus windows were chrome and the Westies are black. 
I find some with nice frames but the lower pivot pin is broken because it rusted at the shaft.
I have a couple of those..... nice frames and seals, but the pin is sheared...in chrome.
