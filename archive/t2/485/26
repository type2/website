Subject: EGR and vented gas cap

Okay seems like I will not worry about reconnecting the EGR. I just
wanted to see if others thought I should. I did read the archives and
mostly understand the operation of the EGR. I didn't see conclusions of
what lengths people should do to or not to have it working and why. I
won't worry about it then, thanks for the help.

No comments on the vented gas cap hmmm. Does anyone else use them?
