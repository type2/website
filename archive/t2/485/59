Not sure if it's possible, but I'd like to know, too.  The door panels 
on my Westy are warped in a few places due to water, and I'd like to 
flatten them out.

I've considered using the existing panels as patterns, and taking them 
down to Tap Plastics to having plastic panels made.  But I'd like to 
preserve the original vinyl covering on my panels, which is in 
excellent condition (I've considered matching green corduroy as an 
acceptable alternative if I can't reuse the old vinyl).

(FWIW, I plan on recovering my kick panels in black low-pile automotive 
carpeting, and replacing the rubber matting on the seat pedestals with 
the same.)
