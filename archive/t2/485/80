Subject: "special" tail light lenses?

Folks,

Without pointing you to that "unmentionable" auction site, has anyone
seen the "smoked" or completely red tail light lenses available in the
aftermarket?

These are sold for 72-79 buses, but also fit my Puma and they might
look good on it.  Just need to know if anyone has actually
eyeballed these in person, or know of a local(in the U.S.) place to get 
them.

Thanks, dave
