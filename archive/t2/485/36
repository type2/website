Hi Todd,

GEX got popular by selling to people who buy motors based on the ads 
they see in magazines.

If Big Ad = Good motor in your mind, then GEX is good. Unfortunately, 
that's not all there is to it. Good motors need to be properly 
assembled with known good parts. GEX spends their $$$ on advertising 
rather than QA. The big ad sells some motors, and they use the proceeds 
to buy more ad space.

Magazines know better than to offend their best-paying customers, so 
they don't mention the GEX problems in their editorial pages. 
Subscriptions don't bring in nearly as much revenue as premium 
ad-space, you know.  But: When was the last article published that 
featured a car with a GEX engine in it? None that I know of. This 
should tell you that the editors do know what's going on, but they know 
who butters their bread, and keep it quiet.

This list helps people break out of notions like "Bigger Ad = Better 
Product" with real-world stories and first-hand knowledge. We may not 
always agree on lots of topics, but the discussion is ALWAYS 
educational.

That's my $.02, YMMV.

Happy trails,
