Subject: Motor problem?

Hello all, this time it's my 79 bus that needs help.
First the history, 2000 fi stock motor with about
25,000mi on rebuild(no it's not a gex). has ran great
until about six months ago. Then it started to
hesitate while accelerating I did a full tune up,
still didn't help, I replaced the 009 dist. with my
worn out stock dist. no change. finally I replaced my
stock for the 009 again doesn't change. I have just
bought a SVDA dist. from aircooled.net still same
problems. 
   OK this is what its doing and what Ive tried. It
hesitates while accelerating, at speeds over 60mph it
feels like the motor is going to fall apart. With all
the dist. changes I thought my stock and 009 dist.
weren't advancing enough. I can't get the timing and
RPMs to settle down. I've checked for vacuum leaks,
I've done a complete tune-up. Compression is well
within specs(110#). It still runs like crap. I time it
to 5 degree's advanced then the rpms jump to
1200-1300, I adjust the idle screw to lower idle down
to 800-900 and then the timing goes to 5 degree's
retard. so I adjust timing again and the rpms change.
it just won't even out. 
    I've tried all I can think of. So if anyone has
any ideas please let me know.
Thanks,
Shawn Reed
