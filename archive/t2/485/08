Todd ,

Thanks for the email of hope. I am going to pull this engine very soon and 
hope to find better than expected situations. I can already see missing 
parts of this and that. I just want to know about the good experiences with 
the engines and then I want to know what are the major problems to look for 
without saying complete tear down, although I think it is inevitable for my 
piece of mind.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
