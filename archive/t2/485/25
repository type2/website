Subject: distributor o-ring

I just noticed that the distributor o-ring you get in the gasket sets is not
the same as the o-ring the vendors are selling.

The gasket set has a true distributor o-ring: it's flat on the inner
circumference. The aftermaket ones are a regular o-ring and reportedly make
it hard to fit the distributor.

Does anyone know where to get proper o-rings? The dealer?
