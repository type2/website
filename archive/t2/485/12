You are probably right and that is what I will have to do.

>(sorry, bad joke)


No I don't believe in Pontiacs, HAHA! I have heard that joke so many times 
that it is offensive...when someone doesn't ask.
Normal Questions are:
Do you have a black car?
Do you own a Transam?
Where's KIT?
Do you everget dizzy staring at Kit's Light? MY answer is no because it runs 
my battery down to leave it on.

Now I think I can leave it on if I use a solar charger for my Battery.


Thanks,
