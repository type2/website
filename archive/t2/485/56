Subject: Mystery tube in '71

I've been wondering about this for years. There is a 3/16 " O.D. copper tube
running the entire length of my bus that has been cut off at both ends. It
starts in the engine compartment on the drivers side, goes forward through the
firewall and follows along side the heater box cable tube to the front of the
vehicle, into the area above the front removable pan where all the other
cables go, and finally into the space between the front skin and the kick
panel roughly in front of the accelerator pedal and is cut off there. It looks
neat enough that it might have come from the factory that way but it could
also have been added later. I've had the bus for 15 plus years and it was that
way when I bought it. Any ideas what this might have been for? It's a '71 bus
with stock single carb upright engine.

Sincere Thanks,
Bill Moon
