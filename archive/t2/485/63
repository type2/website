That's the sound my horn makes everytime I move the steering wheel!
It's the spring below the wheel touching the outer column.
When I remove the spring, all is well.  Can someone tell me what the function of this spring is...and, am I missing something..shouldn't it be OK for it to touch any metal..
I did just put the column back together and I can't find any extra parts left.  Doesn't make sense.  Any similar experiences or knowledge?
thanks, -Chris 73 Westy
