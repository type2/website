So is it OK to tee the hose off the canister into the crankcase
breather hose?  this is not going to force any gas fumes into the
crankcase or vice versa?  Which one has more pressure or if they both have
pressure at least will there be no problem either way?
What if there is no hose from fan shroud to canister and thus no
pressure from canister?
I can't find the hose off my shroud that's supposed to go to canister.
Where is it?  There is one poked into my shroud front below the distrubutor
but is this it?

I dont know how became the self appointed gas tank ventilation guru but
before we go any further what engine are we talking about? When ever you
post a question to the list it is imperative that you give as much detail
as possible or necessary about your bus, year, engine, modifications from
stock as well as where you are located so volks close by can help.

There should be 3 hoses we are discussing here. Two are about 1/2" in
diameter and the third is vacuum hose size. The first big hose runs from a
port on the fan housing which air blows out of while the motor is running,
to the canister. The next big hose runs from the canister to your air
filter. If you are going to run this system teed into you crankcase vent I
would install one way valves in the hoses try a marine supply store
plumbing section if FLAPS can't help. The third smaller hose runs from the
t in the tank vents to the canister.
