Worth it?  Depends on how much it is selling for (I didn't look).  I think a panel like that shuld be worth around $20 in this day and age.  I bought two similar ones at a swap meet for $15/ea.

Do you mean hook one to each battery?  That would work.  But don't think 170ma is going to do squat to replenish your aux battery.  It would take ten hours of charging to replace one hour of using a small dome light.  Panels that small are really only good for maintaining a full charge on a typical auto battery.  They are about the right size to charge flashlight batteries though.  That panel would charge 10 flashlight batteries in series in about a day.
