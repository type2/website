For what it is worth I HIGHLY agree with the other listers: be careful with 
the CO. Don't rely on the heater tricks to keep you safe. Remember that CO 
is cumulative too - it builds up so even if you are going outside and 
coming back into a dangerous environment, you can still get poisoned.

Read all the safety warnings.

In small places like my shed or the bus I use the heater to warm up the 
space and then often will turn it off while I am in the space. My shed 
doors don't seal well and I leave a window open in the bus. I really prefer 
electric heaters for long term heating of the shed, bus, or other smaller 
spaces.

I'd like to think there is truely something safe like the "ventless" 
fireplaces but I don't trust those either... <grin>
