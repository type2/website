Well, I have checked the spark (yep - I have one), checked the double 
relay grounds and power - both there.  I have traced the buzzing back 
to the fuel pressure regulator.  I am going to try to obtain a pressure 
gauge tonight so I can see what I have.  The fuel lines feel like fuel 
is running through them - for whatever that is worth.

Thanks for all of the tips and encouragement, I'd appreciate any more 
help, wisdom, etc. and I will let the list know how this ends.

Thanks,

Dave
