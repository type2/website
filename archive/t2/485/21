Wow, that's all that I can say. How can a company become so popular, with
such a poor product?

Like the Michael Knight, I too bought a fixer Bus that already had this
motor and transmission in it. 

For me, this GEX motor is good enough to get me around town. It works and
the more I drive it, the better it runs. As far as I'm concerned, I'm
going to treat it AS well as I would any other motor in any of my cars.
Fully synthetic motor oil (well, APOs that is), new spark plugs, wires,
etc. 

So... I guess, the deciding point will be, whether or not the motor can
make it past 2,500 miles. If it does, and it still SOUNDS as good as it
does today, then I might have gotten lucky. I bought an odometer from the
junkyard, and completely took it apart, setting it back to 0. I had put,
maybe 20 miles on the car at the time, so I stuck it in the car, so I
know how many miles I've put on the car since "I" purchased it. From what
I understand, the motor and transmission were installed about 4 years
ago. At that point however, the P.O. was working on the Bus itself, got
it painted, and then started putting in the new windows. He installed the
windshield, cracked it, got upset, and put it in storage for 4 years.
Then I came around... and bought it off him. So, from my understanding,
teh motor has LESS than 100 miles on it from before the time I purchased
it. It probably has about ~400 miles on it now including the 323 I have
on my odometer. 

In the MEAN while... I'm going to continue to scrounge the junkyards for
a 2000cc block and heads. :)


I'll just have to wait and see.
