Subject: used parts

""I have vent windows in both the driver's rear window
sections which are very rusted at the bottom.  I need
the frame to bus and the frame to glass, are these
only available used?  Any suggestions on where to find
them?""
Here are some sources you can check out

Rudi Schaffner has a large cache of parts. Very well
organized.. give him a call or shoot him an e-mail.

--Likewise for Ken .. they both will ship and these
parts arent so big as to be killer on shipping.

---Then of course you can dig through the Samba site.
