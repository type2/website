For those familiar with the Crane units, which is the better
unit to get? The XR700 (Street Ingitions) or the XR3000 (Performance
Ignitions)?

Each one of the above lists Domestic 4,6,8 cyl (700-0226/3000-0226)
and Import/Universal 4,6,8 cyl (700-0231/3000-0231). Which would
I use for a stock distributor?
