Phil,

Best thing is to first make sure that your coil is wired correcctly.
Check that the numbers on the coil match with what bentley says about the 
positive and the points side.


Red goes to Positive and black goes where the green condensor wire used to 
go.

Doublec check this!

When is say positive, I mean the same place that power is sent to your 
coil, not just what the coil is marked.  Too many people have their coils 
wired backwards....so check first!

BTW, it runs better if the coil is wired correctly.

Cheers, dave
