Subject: Carb Q for my 71

The 1776 came with a pair of new (not even installed yet) spanish
Weber 40 IDFs.

Aircooled.net's site states,"Dual carbs do NOT need chokes, no matter
where you live. Centermount carbs do, dual carbs do not." While I
don't plan on driving the 71 in the snow (that's where my 73 thrives),
it *does* stay below freezing in the winter here. No chokes?

Also, any comments on the different carbs available? Would I be
happier with the Solex kit?

Thanks!
