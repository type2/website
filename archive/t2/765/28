John, the gap between your switch cluster and the steering wheel is too 
great.  You must loosen the (no doubt non-factory, standard hex-head M8 
bolt) and adjust the gap until the cancelling device works and the horn ring 
connects.  Then go buy the break-away/shearing bolt to replace the no doubt 
non-factory bolt currently holding it up so that you won't impale yourself 
in a front end collision you are fortunate enough to survive.

Since I had the nose of the 78 replaced my signal lights won't cancel and my
horn doesn't work - I have 3 cars and not one working horn.  These problems
both occurred at the same time - they must be at least indirectly related.

I just replaced my old horn with a new one - the yellow and black wire is
getting power - there is no power at wire that clips on under the horn
button - should there be? Doesn't the power go from the fuse box - to the
horn - out the other side of the horn - up thru the steering column and gets
grounded with you press the button?

In my 60 the wire coming from the horn goes right up the centre of the
steering column - in the 78 that appears to not be the case - is that right?
It comes up thru the side somehow.

And my signal lights don't cancel.

Could it be that my steering wheel is on 180 deg wrong - and that's why the
signal lights don't cancel and maybe in the process the wire under the horn
button is broken off inside somewhere?

TIA
