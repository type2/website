My crystal ball is a little cloudy, so I going to
ASSUME you have 75 and later bus WITH fuel injection.

If yes, that is the fuel pump.

If not, then the next time you ask a question, PLEASE
give the year of your bus and a lot more info.....
engine size, fuel system, etc.

 Okay so while I was poking around the engine I gave
 it good inspection
 for the first time since I bought the van a few
 weeks ago.  The fuel
 lines are a mis-match of various repairs over time
 and will be replaced,
 but I am not sure of a few things.
 
 Coming out of the bottom of the tank is about 1 foot
 of line then a
 clear filter the line rounds up to a metal
 "something" (about a 1 1/2
 inches diameter and 3 or so inches long) inline
 mounted near the
 transmission.  It comes out of that and on to the
 engine compartment.
 
 What is the second metal inline device? Is it an
 original fuel filter?
