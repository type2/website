Subject: Hankook Bus Tires Back in Stock

Just a quick note, for those who have had trouble due to the sporadic
availability, that the Hankook bus tires are back in stock again.  At least
for now. Hankook never seems to "get it" that if they'd only allocate more
of them to the U.S. market, we'd buy more! :-)
