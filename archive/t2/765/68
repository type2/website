The distributor is easy to find. I was just looking for the vacuum can.

So far I've know of 3 sources:

- Bus Depot for the genuine German can for late 76-78 bus
- Autozone for the unit Dave bought
- Btlmex for the beetle unit I located.

The 110 number Dave was referring to in the archives is the part number of the vacuum can arm. Sometimes there is another part number on it which is the Bosch part number for the whole can.
