Subject: Oil again

I've been using Castrol 5w/50 Syntec fully synthetic oil lately cause I got 
a great deal on the stuff - Costco sells it by the box for like $23.00 Cdn 
for maybe 6 litres or so - the same stuff at Crappy Tire is over $7 per 
litre - so what do the folks think about running 5w/50?
