Subject: trailer wiring

After seeing a few posts on trailer wiring I went out and bought one of 
the little black boxes, and it only took about 15 minutes to wire it 
up.  Now I can "legally" use my little trailer for more than just runs 
down the street.

I love this list, lots of good information.
