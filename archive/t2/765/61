But what are your ambient temperatures?

My ambient temps are 90F+ and I may run 240F-260F..even when I slow
down to 60-65mph. My last Interstate run I encountered a major
thunderstorm and the ambient temps dropped to the 70's and my oil
temp dropped to 220F. I've since adjusted my dwell/timing, so I'll
have to see what I get now.
