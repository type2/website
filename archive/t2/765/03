Besides being inexpensive, rubber is flexible and there is a lot of vibration going on. Even the FI buses with their steel lines have rubber sections all over.

The older beetles used a hard line from the fuel pump to the carb.

What I like about the steel lines is that there is less rubber in the system to replace. I find fuel line expensive at flaps so I use less expensive brake lines instead.
