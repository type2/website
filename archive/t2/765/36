Thanks Richard and Bill...

I really thought I was getting the right calipers on the right wheels, per 
the boxes they were in.  I could have mixed them up, but I exepect I marked 
them with some of that white-out marking pen that you use to correct typos 
on paper.  It makes it easy to write on just about anything, and although it 
is not permanent, it lasts a long time...

No problemo - just pull them off and swap them around.
