Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Q for my 71

I agree with Jason. Try them first. They seem to warm up real fast
compared to my weber progressive. I have heard that one throat per
cylinder is the ideal for buses. I myself have just installed dual
DRLA 36's on my 72, so I have yet to test that theory.

If you should decide to chuck the IDF's, I could probably trade you
for something else.
