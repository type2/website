Subject: How to tell if engine is seized.

Hello List. First post, first bus, first question.

I was given a '72 Microbus and I was told the engine is seized. I
don't know if I believe them so I'm trying to turn the motor. I've
fixed up 3 bugs so far, and on a bug you just turn the nut on the fan
pulley and if it goes round, the engine is good to go.  A type 4
engine obviously doesn't have this nut. How can I spin the engine?

Thanks in advance!
