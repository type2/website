Steve,

My 78 runs lots lower on oil temps, but the bumper and rear are awesomely 
hot.

30 minute run on the interstate at 75-80 and I can't even touch the 
bumper, while oil temps are about 210F

hmmm, just thinking about it, I wonder if a little wing up on the top side 
might help that....not enough to look ugly or bizarre, but just enough for 
a little air direct downward.

Cheers, dave
