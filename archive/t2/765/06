I you mean Pertronix, the red wire goes to terminal 15, black goes to terminal 1. However, it's possible to have the coil wired backwards so you a) you need to check which terminal is getting 12V from the ignition switch and b) wire your coil up correctly because when the coil is reversed the spark is weaker.

Some confusion is created by Pertronix because the insulated terminals used are both red! See photo:
