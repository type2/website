The 050 mechanical dizzy has about 26 degrees maximum total advance at 
about 3100 RPM's as measured by Cirello Magnetos, 703 Randolph Ave. in 
Costa Mesa CA back in '92. German 009's measured out at about 24 degrees 
at 2300 RPM and Brazillian 009's 21 at 2600.

There are a couple of articles on the type2 website in the library. 
Check it out.
