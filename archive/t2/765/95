Subject: Re: [T2] Oil again

I just switched to this oil recently myself. First thing it did for me
was eliminate temperature creep. Unfortunately it also gives me too
low of pressure at hot idle. Karl recently discussed this oil as not
true synthetic. So once I deplete existing stock I will switch to Red
Line or Mobil 1 once I figure out if Mobil 1 is true synthetic or not.
