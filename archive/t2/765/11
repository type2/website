Phil,

On a slightly different note my the wiring on my bus was a right
mess.... my only advice is get a labelling machine and put labels on
all the wires. Any wires that have been so kindly draped across the
fan housing and are brittle due to the heat replace and shroud in some
conduit. Check all the engine bay wires for cracks and replace as a
daft electrical problem can cause hours of pain.....!

Richards site has links to bus wiring diagrams (www.ratwell.com) and
Bently has them aswell.
