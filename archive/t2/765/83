That isn't really an option in my books anymore... I thought it was till last
year.
I priced the $29.99 per day truck to take me <one way> home from Halifax to
Toronto... it is 1200miles

$2200 cdn dollars,, at todays rate is ~$1800 u.s.a dollars.. plus fuel,
insurance, taxes, etc etc etc
Unless U-haul is a lot cheaper in the USA..........
I can do a lot of fixin on the spot for that !!  I don't have to do my repairs
in my own driveway.

I have never rented anything that cost what I was told... that $30 per day car,,
for 3 days cost me $300.00!

Just my experience..
