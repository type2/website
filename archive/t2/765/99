Hi all,

Conserning the tranny-sound... Installing a new tranny is expensive and
considering we are going for the long trip... If not necessary to change it, I
would like to leave as is. Here's the more detailed description:
I changed tranny oil some weeks ago, I don't know if the problem is related?
There is a noise when we are driving about 90 kms/h, in fourth gear when I
release the accelerator pedal a little, we hear a deep and continious GRRRRR. I
have to play with the accelerator pedal a little to reproduce the sound. No loss
of power, bus drives very well. This noise has been there for quite a while, but
maybe it's louder now than it was before - or the engine-sounds have become less
noisy after adjustment? Anyway, when I drive very slow, just about to stop, and
I press the clutch pedal, there is a wob-wob-wob sound. I don't think this sound
has been there before. Shifting gear has always been a bit difficult but I
learned and have no problem with it. CV's and wheal-bearings have been changed
and are ok. My mechanic says the sound comes from the tranny and he thinks we
can drive with it for a long time. But we do worry a bit, since we are going to
drive about 10.000 kms. Are trannies cheaper in Turkey? ;-) I don't mind leaving
it if the risk of a breakdown is low, considering the high cost to change it.
And it's part of the adventure, I guess.

Any futher advice? Tranny guru's?

Bart
