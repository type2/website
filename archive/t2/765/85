Hello Bart

I can not tell you what is happening with the tranny and I think that you 
could help the tranny 's gurus if you are a little bit more presice in the 
noise of the tranny, this time I just want to wish you a nice trip to 
Turkey, I have a little envious since I am not sure if I have the courage to 
do that kind of trip. A friend of mine by far more adventurer than me always 
says that all is in the mind, if you think that a posibility of tranny 
faliure could be part of the trip you already have half of the way covered 
so my wish to you is something is going to be wrong with your bus it happen 
in a safe place where you can fix it.
Good look from the other side of the world.
