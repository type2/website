Might still be the gap.  There is a little copper spring-finger that makes 
the connection to the horn wiring.  It may be longer than the working 
distance for the cancellation mechanism.  In fact, I used to bend the finger 
on my 1977 until I figured out the true cause!

You might try wiggling the assembly up the steering tube.  Mine was so loose 
it kept falling down as I drove!

My turn signal will not self-cancel but the horn works
fine. Is there another reason (other than the distance
problem mentioned) this would be so?
