Subject: Re: [T2] Horn won't beep - signal lights won't cancel

Hiya John,
"Could it be that my steering wheel is on 180 deg wrong - and that's why the 
signal lights don't cancel and maybe in the process the wire under the horn 
button is broken off inside somewhere?"

You certainly have to consider this as a possibility.  Do this...........make 
a really sharp turn, like a 180.  Does your turn signal cancel then?  If so, 
then you can be sure that the canceling cam was installed 180 off.  I'm not 
sure how that might affect the horn though.  A much more likely possibility is 
that your horn ground has come disconnected at the bottom of the steering 
column.  If so, that's a real bear to fix simply because its so hard to get to.  
However, it is do-able, just takes a lot of patience and contortion.
