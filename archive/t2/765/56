Subject: advice on running hot.

I have been fighting what I think is an overheating problem in my van I will
give you a brief history.

1977 Westy European spec. 2litre

Around Easter the engine started running roughly and started to leak oil from
the flywheel end of the engine. I decided to pull the engine replace the
flywheel oil seal, pushrod seals, oil cooler seals, oil filter gasket, oil
filer gasket, exhaust sealing rings (copper).

I also fitted a pair of dellorto 40's. They where a little tricky to get setup
but they seemed to run after a little tinkering they seemed to run better, the
plugs showed no lean or rich mixture. I checked for air leaks at the
manifolds, and brake servo take off, (thatbs why I need a replacement rubber
boot see other post) and can't really find any.

I would have been happy but the oil leak has returned and the engine seems to
be running hot. I fitted a gauge and dipstick sender and checked it against a
boiling kettle, and the oil is running at around 110-115C. This doesn't worry
me too much it is that the engine smells hot and the bumper gets really hot.

I want this fixed so I don't worry about driving in the van for more than an
hour.

So any advice please, also can you after driving for longer than 30mins feel
the rear valance and bumper and see how hot it is.

Cheers
Steve
