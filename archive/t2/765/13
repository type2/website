Subject: Horn won't beep - signal lights won't cancel

Since I had the nose of the 78 replaced my signal lights won't cancel and my 
horn doesn't work - I have 3 cars and not one working horn.  These problems 
both occurred at the same time - they must be at least indirectly related.

I just replaced my old horn with a new one - the yellow and black wire is 
getting power - there is no power at wire that clips on under the horn 
button - should there be? Doesn't the power go from the fuse box - to the 
horn - out the other side of the horn - up thru the steering column and gets 
grounded with you press the button?

In my 60 the wire coming from the horn goes right up the centre of the 
steering column - in the 78 that appears to not be the case - is that right? 
It comes up thru the side somehow.

And my signal lights don't cancel.

Could it be that my steering wheel is on 180 deg wrong - and that's why the 
signal lights don't cancel and maybe in the process the wire under the horn 
button is broken off inside somewhere?

TIA
