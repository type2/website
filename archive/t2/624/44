Anytime Rob atleast you are home now. I called a wlittle while ago and left 
you a message on the cell phone, I figured the battery was dead. I tried 
your house and the line was busy. Glad to know you got home. If you need 
some help let me know.

Hint when looking for a flexplate try some engine rebuilders if you can't 
find one. AVP told me they would install one on a longblock if I bought one, 
they have them from Auto cores. Guess how many auto cores are converted to 
manuals. Many more than the viseversa approach.

Good Luck,
