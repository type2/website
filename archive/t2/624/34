Richard asked:


What fuse?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is in EVERY FI bus. But it is only for the backup lights. It is the junction point for the B+ to feed the
double relay so it knows the ignition is on.

If you want, I can take a pic of it in my 77 Westy and my 78 Westy.
