No trip report yet. Buried here at work.

Here are the (VERY few) pics I took with the digicam. I spent more time
playing with my new toy the MiniDV video camera.

However, I don't have firewire on this computer yet so I can't pull the
video in <sigh>.

The "overview" pics are pretty crappy because they were taken with a
2megapixel snapshot camera from WAAAYYYY up on the hill. I'm hoping I got a
better view with the video camera's zoom.

But look at all the buses!

I was gonna circle the known buses but blowing up the image blurred it to
uselessness.

P.S.

No "sleight of camera" on the vertical straw. I actually walked to the
truck to get the camera and it stayed as it is shown.
