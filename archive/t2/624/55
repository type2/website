Then that makes sense of the last post I made. But I can't find the fuse. 
Did the older tranny used a vacuum switch to work the lights? The switch 
seems to be in the shifter or it is at least a mechanical/electrical switch, 
no vacuum of course the older auto tranny could be the same way and no 
vacuum. The only thing I know now is that my lights work and play with the 
shifter flickers the lights.

Will let you know where I find it if I do,
