CAn you say deja-vu? I went through the same headache.Stayed up late into 
the night pondering... Busloops -hehe. That's funny. Must kill FLAPS...check 
dual relay...coil?...points?...condenser? cap? rotor? can't be -replaced 
those- getting spark. Why no fuel pressure? signal comes from solenoid 
during starting , thenn..... AFM? hardstartrelayoilpressuresenderBRAIN? how 
much? a lot...hope it isn't...couldn't be...how could it? You've got to be 
joking. $42,000? For a wingnut? O.k., here. I don't know...start replacing 
everything... at least you'll have all new parts when you get done...it's 
bound to be one of those 5 octilion parts...how does one read that 
cockamamey wiring schematic in Chapter 3? It looks like phreakin' 
hieroglyphics...So, it was the fuel pimp afterall...you idiot... you 
switched the connectors...can't even do a crimp on correctly...how do you 
expect to maintain this rolling heirloom if you cant even....SHEESH!!! And 
you thought you were mechanically inclined when, in acutality, you were 
maniacally inclined. Yet, you kept at it and, eventually, as Inspector 
Clouseau would ssay, "The case is Sol - Ved."
