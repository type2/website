Subject: Beating it to DEATH...Happy Dance in Progress

Okay I hate to beat this one to death or kick a dead horse or what have you, 
but....

Confusing because the fuse receives the power from the coil by way of that 
wire. But the fuse leads to the reverse lights not the relay, so to 
speak(type). If you took out that fuse the lights would not work but the 
relay would.

Yep I got that. If the fuse is out, the power would still make it to the 
relay, because the fuse holder is a branch off of this direct feed between 
the + side of the coil and 86c.

Verifying by it.

This is the part I now realize "in-line " is referring to the power wire to 
the reverse lights, however the fuse is not "in-line" to the relay. It is 
"branched", there is no "in-line" fuse between the relay and the coil. 
Therefore it is not needed by the relay just the reverse lights. If you look 
at the diagram and go to S21. Erase the fuse. Is it needed now?

I don't think I need to change what I have, except for the bad double relay. 
If the wire, from the coil to the fuse, was on the opposite side of the 
holder from the wire to the relay that would make a difference. The wire 
from the coil to the relay is not "fused". The wire from the reverse light 
switch to it's power source is. I still have not found that though.

Thanks Karl you helped me figure it out again,
