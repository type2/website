Subject: Why it just died

Meine Alten Comaraden,

It was the fuel pump.

I was in a hurry and didn't want to wait on the shipment of a new one.

So,

like an eejit, I went to my FLAPS and bought a hecho en Mexico "Bomba de 
Gasolina," for 200 frogskins.

Now,

the "Bomba de Gasolina" takes lug connectors, whereas, the superior 
German-made Bosch pump (which, btw, lasted 26 years and 3 engines) took 
spade connectors which were insulated (can't beat German engineering).

Anyway.

I must've somehow switched the leads -silly me.

So.

There ya' go.

I would like to express my deep appreciation and sincere gratitude to 
everyone who took the time to help me with this latest crisis.

Gross Gut,
Oliver Klothesoff
