Subject: Oktoberbus isn't that far away

Either driving or time wise.  If folks can drive to Arizona to camp, why
not drive to South Carolina.  That's right, it's that time of year where
like-minded folks get together and camp during the second weekend of
October.

Sez it all and more.  Bring your best hallowe'en costume, a bucket of
candy, some decorations for your bus and relax and enjoy!
