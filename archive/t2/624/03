Subject: adj hyd valves at 0 or 7.5 btdc? please clarify

Hi,
thanks everyone who answered my question about adjusting hydralic valves.
A couple of you said to line up the mark on the fan with 0 (with the rotor 
at the #1 cylinder).
Then turn 180 degrees (rotor turns 90) counterclockwise.
Why do I line up the mark with 0 instead of 7.5 since thats what I set my 
timing to. Also, is it important for my timing to be perfect before I do 
this?
thanks,
Kyle
