Group,

I just cleaned what felt like 25 years of crud, algae and lichen from the
fiberglass pop-top of my new (to me) 79 Westy and boy does it look better.
Problem is that the top has the 'fuzzies' and I need to find a solution.  I
searched the archives, read many of the old emails and the tech articles.
lots of ideas but there doesn't seem to be a consensus are what to do.  So,
I've like to pose a few questions:

1- Any thoughts on how to temporarily protect the top while I'm searching
for a solution?
2- Is there a consensus on what the best approach should be to protect and
maintain a good looking top?
3- Anyone ever get this done professionally at an auto body shop?  Cost?
4- Anyone ever get this done professionally at a boat yard?  Cost?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,

Wayne
