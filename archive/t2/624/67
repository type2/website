Subject: Re: [T2] Fiberglass Top Resto

My pop-top was very bad and had the fuzzies. I searched for the best
solution and while many suggested that re-gel coating the top was the
"right way" to do it, the cost was high and I was afraid it would make
the top too heavy to lift.

So having maintained a vintage boat, I knew that boat paint was the way,
for me, to go. I used Interlux primer and bright side enamel paint
(avail. at West Marine.  Used a foam roller to apply, and then a fine
(for polyurethane) foam brush to smooth it out. The luggage carrier
(Vanagon) I brough down my cellar. I did sand the top first and filled in
a few void with 2-part boat epoxy - which you can get a $15.00 trial kit
from System Three.

The top of the pop-top came out great, However I did get some runs/sags
on the sides, although you can't see them once you back away a few feet. 
The paint is thick, thinner is available and it might have made the job
easier, because these sags occur after a little while.  Maybe I was
trying too hard to get a thick coat. I did two coats.

On the removed luggage rack, I painted only one side at a time, keeping
that side horizontal - it came out great. 

A skilled painter would get perfect results.  Hiring a boat yard worker
who has painted boats might be a good idea if you want it perfect, but I
would not hesitate to do it again.  I set up a long plank along the side
of the van - way better than moving a ladder.
