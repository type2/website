Okay so it is not too dark here with a Halogen Mag-Lite. I couldn't find the 
wire leading to or from the Automatic Transmission under my bus. I did look 
long and hard at the wiring in question. The fuse did not get tucked under 
the lip. I am 99.9% sure it is not there. This is what I found:

From the Starter/Solenoid - 2 wires in a loom, 1 bigger than the other Red, 
the smaller 1 Red/White.

across to the fuel pump, two wires there - 1 Brown(to - side of pump), the 
other Red/Light Blue(to + side of pump)

through the body to engine compartment, 4 wires there - 1 bigger than the 
rest Red(to 88z), 1 Brown(to ground at fire wall to 85), 1 Red/White(to 
86a), 1 Red/Light Blue(to 88d)

at Double Relay - All connections to terminals above and Red Jumper from 88z 
to 88y, Black wire from 86c to + side of coil.

But key on Reverse Lights work, key off Reverse Lights off.
