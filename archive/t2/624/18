Well it has been long enough since I messed with "el Verde". Today I came 
home at lunch to help find the bolt size that Rob Henley needed to get back 
on the road. As I opened the deck lid he called and told me not to bother he 
picked up some and was going to try. I shut the deck lid. I think I heard a 
sob.....

I started thinking about the fuel pump harness again. I talked to Mark 
Dearing about it today nope no fuse there, I had asked Richard Atwell the 
other day about it I was still confused and I could not find one, Scott 
Lyons sent word that there wasn't one there in the circuit from his memory, 
and many many others have offered their help and advice. But I got home 
after work. The kids were gone and so was wifey, just me myself and some 
VWs. Pleasant moment suspended by a perplexing problem that would not let my 
fuel pump work. I open the back hatch and picked up where I left off back in 
first week of August. Double relay tested bad then. I tried again by the 
directions Greg Potts offered and nogo on the double relay. Then I tested 
the pump again be running a jumper from the + side of the battery straight 
to the pump. BINGO! It was so nice to here that light swirling sound. I 
didn't quit though, I put a switch in the line to act as a breaker for the 
pump, connected the power again, key on, with remote starter in hand. She 
turned over and over and over then puff......puff.....puff...puff..puff. 
puff.......twisted the dizzy. Vvvrrrooooommm! Like clock work I hit the 
timing close and she was running. WOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO!

Now I just need to get that relay and work out the kinks, doesn't idle well 
as of yet. But beyond idle she sounds great.

Thanks to all that helped I really appreciate it,
