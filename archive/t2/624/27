3- Anyone ever get this done professionally at an auto body shop?  Cost?
Professionally I have painted 3 westy tops , I sand then epoxy prime then 
filler prime then paint with a quality paint.  I've also heard you can get marine 
paint and do it yourself. I haven't seen one done that way so I don't know 
what is better. Sanding it is the key to getting it right. And buy quality 
products.
