Hi Wayne,

With a good quality marine enamel the results for a do-it-yourself job 
are outstanding.

Interlux premium Yacht Enamel is just such a product, it goes on easily 
with a brush and roller and does an EXCELLENT job. At $30cdn/Quart, it 
had better be good!!!

1. Clean the top thoroughly.
2. Sand lightly with 220 grit paper.
3. Wipe the roof down with a thinner-soaked rag to get rid of the dust.
4. Paint., sand lightly & coat it again.

There should be enough after 2 coats on the roof to paint the bumpers 
at least 1 coat to match.

I painted my top three years ago and it still looks great.


Happy trails,

Group,

I just cleaned what felt like 25 years of crud, algae and lichen from 
the
fiberglass pop-top of my new (to me) 79 Westy and boy does it look 
better.
Problem is that the top has the 'fuzzies' and I need to find a 
solution.  I
searched the archives, read many of the old emails and the tech 
articles.
lots of ideas but there doesn't seem to be a consensus are what to do.  
So,
I've like to pose a few questions:

1- Any thoughts on how to temporarily protect the top while I'm 
searching
for a solution?
2- Is there a consensus on what the best approach should be to protect 
and
maintain a good looking top?
3- Anyone ever get this done professionally at an auto body shop?  Cost?
4- Anyone ever get this done professionally at a boat yard?  Cost?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,

Wayne
