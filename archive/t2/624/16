My suspicions are all but confirmed.  Its a faulty rebuild.

The good news is, the rebuilder will make good on it - including the 
R&R, which I suffered through last weekend.

Thanks to all who provided suggestions , recommendations, condolences.  
I think perhaps Don Tuleja hit the nail on the head when he said:

"http://www.longenterprises.com/remachined_sliders.htm

Maybe?"

I've forwarded this info to my rebuilder, plus info on the evils of GL5.
