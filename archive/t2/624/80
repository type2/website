Hey Paul, do you have pics of that hitch? (Paul's got it now)

I've got one that bolts to the bumper bolts and runs side to side now. Very compact but it will never handle what the big hitch would. I think I'll use this one (I seldom haul much weight anymore) but if I need abetter hitch I'll build a bigger one again...
