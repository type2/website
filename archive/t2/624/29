Hi,
thanks everyone who answered my question about adjusting hydralic valves.
A couple of you said to line up the mark on the fan with 0 (with the rotor 
at the #1 cylinder).
Then turn 180 degrees (rotor turns 90) counterclockwise.
Why do I line up the mark with 0 instead of 7.5 since thats what I set my 
timing to. Also, is it important for my timing to be perfect before I do 
this?
thanks,
Kyle

you want to put it with 0 first to make sure it is (-at-)TDC then once there then go back counteerclockwise to 7.5 degrees..... crank it up check timing and turn it up to about 20 - 30 degrees.......

make sure that it is at TDC though make sure the #1 piston is at top... also yes there should be a groove( small V..feel with index finger) on the back of the rim of your fan.... a notch.....

good luck... 

peace
