You guys are great. Please get the word out that Bill is doing much better
and with any luck will be home tomorrow. The release papers have been signed
just need to get some lose ends done. And we are planning to be at Busses
and Balloons for 1 nite...probably Friday in the Vanagon (can have the
portapotty!!!) Driving there will be the easy part and will need everyone to
fawn when time allows while there.
I love all of you as does Bill. Your wonderful thoughts and strong energy
have kept us going this week.
VW people are the absolute top banana's.
Gotta go to bed...Please forward to everyone and everyone and everyone.
Janet
