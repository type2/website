Subject: Another 14" AT- Timberline AT

Recently rated top SUV tire by Consumer Reports
after measuring braking distances, feeling the
ride, stopping in rain, etc.  Available in almost
every 14" size you may desire for your bus:
LT195/75, P225/70, P205/70, LT27x8.5.

This looks to be a Bridgestone tire, branded
Timberline rather than Firestone to avoid recent
bad press.  Don't know if they are available at
Firestone stores, but they were at a discount
tire shop in my neck of the woods.
