Sean,

When it was new, your bus had an engine that had solid lifters.  After 25
years, no matter what it says on the odometer, I would not trust it.

The way to tell for sure is to pull a lifter out and have a look at it.
Remove a valve cover, undo the nuts that hold the rocker shaft on, then
remove one  of the pushrods and its pushrod tube.  Then take a dibbler (a
magnet.... onna stick![1]) and pull the lifter out.  If it is solid, then
you have solid lifters.  If it has a number of bits, then you have
hydraulics.

The second best (and much easier) way to tell is to pop the valve covers
off one fine morning and have a look at the gaps.  Basically, check the
gap on all your valves.  If none of them have any gap, then you have
hydraulic lifters.  If any have *some* gap, then you have solids.

If you have solid lifters, 15,000 miles is far too long between valve
adjustments.  Look in the type2.com library or Muir or Bentley for the
procedure.
