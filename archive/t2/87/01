Volks,

Do you know..... it is hard to give up on a dream, but....

John is right.  I have a roll in the basement that is enough to redo the
upholstery on a whole bus.  My dream was that some day I would acquire a
low-mile '78 deluxe westy.  I doubt that will be the case within the
foreseeable future, though :-( If you have one and want this, let me know.
I think that John sold it to me for $12/yard (John, let me know if I am
wrong) and I will turn it over for that, but I want it to go to an
end-user, chasing a dream like I was.  I do *not* want to see it on any
auction site in 2 months!
