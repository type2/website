Wow at that price my remaining stock is probably worth $3000, and what
Dolan has is easily worth $500.  Like I said folks this stuff is rare.
I wouldn't mind trading a full bus worth for a bus worth of the brown/beige/
black/green found in '78 and '79 Champagne and beige deluxe FWIW if
anyone has any of that new.  That is the only color they but in the late
Bus westy I think has even a modicum of taste.

Somebody better take Steve up on the $12/yard.
