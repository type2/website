Here's tech specs.

I agree.  Yet, for some reason, load ranges are
not always consistent.  I've seen so-called C
rated tires with less load than "SL" rated tires
of different sizes.  I don't recall which tires
in particular, but I recently saw a load-rated
195/75 that had less max load than a SL 225/70. 
So check the tire sidewall, folks.
