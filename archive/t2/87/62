That is, unless a PO didn't realize there were hydraulics in the engine, or
know there is a difference between a solid-lifter engine and a hydraulic-
lifter engine, and set the gap like it was a solid lifter engine. I have
seen people do this. "I set my valves to .006" like it says in Muir, and now
my engine runs like crap. Any ideas?" Yeah. Read the whole book.
