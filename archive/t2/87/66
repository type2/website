Subject: engine stand from Bus Depot , follow up, help needed

hello all,

well, i was able to get that bracket attached by
putting a long screwdriver through both holes and
forcing them to line up, then had to hit the screw
through with a hammer. it worked, and seems to be all
good, but i'm still annoyed that i had to do it at
all. i bought the engine stand to help with a project,
not because i wanted a project. i dont think i'll be
giving EMPI anymore dead presidents.( whats up with VW
parts "made in china" anyway!?)

i would still like input as to how the Type IV engine
bolts onto this stand. if anyone has a picture of this
stand with a Type IV engine on it that they could send
that would be good too. thanks a lot.

BTW- no disrespect to the Bus Depot is intended by
this email.
