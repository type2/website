Subject: Exhaust nuts

Hey Snoopy
I found that stainless will still sieze to a steel stud.  There's a fastener
place not too far from where you live that has Brass nuts.  M&M or something
like that off the exit towards your place from the airport (Remount?).  I
bought a lifetime supply and if you can wait for snailmail, I'll send ya a
set.  Let me know tonight and I'll mail 'em out tomorrow.
