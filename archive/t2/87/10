Subject: Re: CHT Gauges

Chad,

Sorry I haven't responded any sooner.  This list is so busy these days that I 
hardly have time to read it any more.  Mostly I just lurk.  HI EVERYBODY!

I've had a CHT gauge on my 1600 for some time now.  I installed the sender 
under a stud bolt (closest to the spark plug) in order to keep it from 
wearing out every time I checked compression.  It wore out anyway, so I 
pulled the engine and while it was out, had a stud welded on to the #3 
exhaust pipe.  Now it's real easy to get to, but the temps read higher -- 
about 350 degrees or so.  I think in the other location, it ran about 300 
degrees on the flats, higher on the uphills, lower on the downhills.  250 
sounds low, but as the saying goes, YMMV.  You go with what's right for YOUR 
puppy.  Averages are for bean counters.  Do you know anybody (or anybody's 
bus for that matter) that is just "average?"

Anybody heard from Isaiah Hanback?  You know, the list member from Wisconsin 
who rode the list hard a coupla years ago with questions about his new (to 
him) bus.

Don't forget the Dead o' Winter Campout hosted by Peach State Transporters 
February 1-3 at Cloudland Canyon State Park in North Georgia.
