The same kind as those yes, from the factory in Brazil. I saw the ones
on ebay, and think that the prices are way to high, so I figured there 
must be some demand out there, and have found a better deal than what ebay
is offering.

As Steve has noted they are not street legal in the US, so caveat emptor.
If you live in a big inspection state these may not be for you,
unless you don't mind swapping the assemblies often.

Thanks,
