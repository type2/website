Labor-intensive yes, very expensive...relative. Yes, it would cost lots of
green to do this if you're using all new parts. Then again, Boston Bob and
Jake Raby aren't exactly selling bargain basement engines either.

Search for "Vortec VW Bus" and you will see a guy who put a 4.3-liter Vortec
V-6 bolted to a Porsche 959 transaxle into a Loaf. How he dealt with the
catalytic converter problem is with a custom exhaust system. His cat lives
under the left-hand battery tray, his muffler under the right, and he loops
the exhaust pipes around the engine.

Interesting idea: Detroit Diesel has a little automotive engine in 2.3l,
3.0l and 3.8l. The little one puts out over 100hp. One of those looks like
it would tuck into the hole in the back real nice; engine adaption to the
transmission is your responsibility, since Kennedy doesn't have an adapter
plate for it.
