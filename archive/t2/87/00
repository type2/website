Nicholas,

As part of your research, I thought I would throw in a sad data point.
This is partly "the law" and partly "they can fail you if they want to",
but....

I bought a set of aftermarket tail lamp buckets and lenses from a local VW
shop back a bit and installed them.  The next time I went in for safety
inspection (VA, required every year, basically a lamps and brake
inspection), I got failed because of the lenses on these.  As it turns
out, to be legal in the US of A, all light lenses after 1966 must be
registered with the U.S. DOT and have a DOT symbol and approval number
cast into the lens.  Most foreign lenses do not have this stamp.

Now, it took an inspector who I believe set out to fail my raggedy bus to
catch this and your milage may obviously vary, but before you import or
install these, consider the temperment of your local inspection team.
