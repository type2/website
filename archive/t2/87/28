Subject: More spark plugs!

I got a message right after my post in which I wrote 
the legend for Bosch spark plugs. It is *not* correct, 
and I do not have all my Bosch stuff right here to write 
up a complete and correct legend for the Bosch spark plugs. 
There is a much deeper meaning to them, also explaining 
single or multiple electrode, electrode material (copper/
platinum/silver etc.)
