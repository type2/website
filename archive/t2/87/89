Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI engine?

I apologize for my incorrect posting.  I had my 1776 that I just got
finished recently in my mind.  My screw up.

And believe it or not a few listees that will go nameless had to pmail with
the rudest most cussing out for this mistake..................

I feel that my posts and help I give are generally helpful.  It is a shame
that a few faceless cowards resort to using the internet to talk to another
listee in  a manner that they would not do face to face, or, trust me, they
would be spitting teeth.
