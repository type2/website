Actually, I have some of this as well.  About half a roll remaining, maybe
less.  I don't think it's on my website, so mostly it gets sold to people
who call and ask if  I have it.  I've been selling a section large enough to
recover either 2 front seats, or the rear seat bottom and back (but not rear
mattress), for $99.

Incidentally, this pattern looks pretty good on the Sage Green '76-79
Westies too; not the "correct" plaid but it includes the same colors only in
different proportions. (Both plaids use the same shades of yellow, orange,
and green, but not surprisingly, the pattern for the yellow busses is much
heavier on the yellow, whereas the pattern for the green busses is heavier
on the green.)
