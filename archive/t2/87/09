Subject: Spark Plugs

1600 SP type 1 Engine

I have been reading the recent posts on spark plugs, and............

I pretty much decided to stay with W8AC plugs for my buses, but will use 
the platinum in a pinch, if necessary.

I really do not have any specific reason to feel as though the platinum 
might be less than optimal, other than my "observing" what I "think" is a 
tendency to see them get dirtier faster than I see with the W8AC.

Mark Dearing posted about a "trick" using the W7BC plugs as used in a 
Porsche 356, 912........... ??

Mark, can you expand on this, or might others have some insight as to what 
the trick might be, and the benefits of same, if any ??
