Heh. I remember those days!  And then...I got a craftsman professional
series ratchet.  I have a 1/4 and a 3/8 drive.  Feels great in the
hand...and, after...oh..5 years now? I still havent had a problem with it.
I used to kill a ratchet in 3-4 months...I havent changed how I use'm
either.

I leave the old style in the tool box in the shop for light duty stuff...

(of course, there are arguments that one should by snapon or
whatever...but the pro series from craftsman is still affordable, even for
a then-unemployeed nineteen year old..)

....david
