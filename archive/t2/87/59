Barry,
If you working on a bay ( 72 right?) try and find some foam from a Vanagon. It
is wider that than any bay foam and the thickness would be just right. I
remember my grandparents replacing some foam bedding in their full size RV and
it was real expensive. I thnk they even drove the NJ from CT to find someone who
had the right stuff.
