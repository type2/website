its more  work then you think, 
the front nose clip  is special, 
the front floor is special
I even think the dash is made diffurent to hold the heater
plus the  water hoses from front to rear

the best way is to forget it, but if you really HAD  to do it you would need 
to buy a complete front clip, doorpost forward plus at least the bell housing 
for the tranny to mount the Golf engine......

easier to buy a vanagon !
