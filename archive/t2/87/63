Jim,

Sean's original post read:

Note that Sean specifically states that (a) "the engine's very strong" and
(b) it "makes no clattering."

It is certainly possible to adjust solid lifter valves to hydraulic valve
specs, but if you do, the engine will not only not be strong, it will not
start!  It is also possible to adjust hydraulic lifter valves to solid
specs, but in that case it would not be possible to say it makes no
clattering.

From his description, all he needs to know is how to find out which type
he has on a running engine.  Note that checking for gaps under the rockers
is labeled "second best."  Checking clearances, checking pushrods,
checking rockers, etc. are all second best to actually pulling a lifter
and looking at it, but they are also all a lot less work.  Any proxy
measurement is inferior to direct observation, but in many cases it is
very acceptable substitute.
