Subject: Seat Covers - '72

Hey Ray, I  looked at the seat covers on my '72 Westy's two front seats last 
night.  Both are worthless.  As soon as I touch them, the vinyl breaks 
apart.  So, I 'may' pull both seat covers for patterns.
Yes, you are right, I must take pictures and make diagrams.  Thanks for the 
reminder.

But first, I am going to try to fabricate a set of 'pull over' seat covers.  
(The rear seat(s) will be a snap to make since I have been practicing my 
sewing .)

BTW. I pulled apart some front seat covers from a '77.  Green vinyl and 
fabric.  Just TWO pieces for the back, and TWO pieces for the seat.  What a 
great design!!  Nothing really difficult or complicated.

Just the hard paper edging at the bottom of the seat vinyl confuses be.  I 
don't know of a suitable material substitute for that.

On the way home last night, I stopped by a carpet/mattress store.  I asked 
the owner if I could snag a mattress from the pile he was discarding 
outside.  I was looking for, and I got, a foam mattress.  Now I will have a 
single piece of foam that I can cut to fit over the engine compartment (sans 
any cabinetry back there.)  [[ A hint for the list ]]

I want a ONE piece cushion for the part over the engine compartment, 
covering the spare tire void also.  In a pinch, I have two engine 
compartment cushions that I could build up to a single unit, or just make 
two bolsters for the ends.

I don't know how this will work, since the snagged mattress, 100% foam, is 
very heavy.  Perhaps if I cut 2/3 of the foam out of it, the weight will not 
be too bad.

This immediately frees up some original dark vinyl from the '70 Westy donor 
full width rear seat, and jump seat and a dark brown spare tire cover 
(inside).

And a FULL, pristine non-deluxe'72 Westy interior (yellow vinyl); everything 
back of the driver/passenger seats, plus some extra yellow vinyl pieces.

So I am off to explain to the wife about the mattress in the back of my '78 
Westy.  Perhaps I can say 'now the '78 Westy sleeps SIX'!!

Barry sends  TGIF

(PS. The wife said the '72 Westy goes this Spring time, so I have to get my 
kicks right now...)
