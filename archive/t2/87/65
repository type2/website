Subject: Re: [T2] engine stand from Bus Depot!!  Rant

I actually don't have the stand bolted together in the pictures. I just
have the upright set over the bolt. I have had it together and it
went fine. If you need me to take a close up of where it bolts together
let me know.  Do you still have the slip with the shipping weight
on it.
