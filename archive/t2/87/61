Please remember that just because they are hydraulic lifters and that the
rockers do not move does not mean that all is well..   most of these vans
have excessive preload on the lifters and the stuff is flat worn
out...........this is shown in the Bug Me video that is done at Jake Raby's
when he shows the hydraulic camshaft.........all that preloading puts a lot
of strain on the contact surfaces.
