I'm a longstanding supporter of the '78 as well mostly because my dream
westy is a '78 Champagne as I love the color, the one year interior dash,
etc.  But to be honest nothing at all wrong with '76-'77 as a Westy or
any other bus goes.  Same bus or westy layout, so you adjust the valves,
WTF.  All in all anything post '76 is box stock about the same bus.  The
'78 and '79 passenger come with the sliding windows and get rid of the
seat partitions for a bit more open and modern feel to the interior but
all in all it doesn't really matter, those years are the peak of air cooled
VW transporter technology IMHO, I've liked my Vanagons but they really
don't have enough advances to justify the weight and resulting short
engine life IMHO.  The '79 exhaust stuff isn't yet that hard to get as
new Dansk is still available though the square port head cores are just
a bit harder to find nice.

Crap I wish I'd never raffled off that Champagne.  Anyone got a one owner
one mint garaged with 78k miles, I'll trade you even for just the body for a
same '77 standard, and you can keep your hydraulic lifter engine.
