Howdy,
I may not understand the need or particular use of a block heater in this case, so excuse the following if that is the case.

For many years I drove a diesel powered vehicle in very cold conditions and would be unable to get it to  start on the coldest mornings. There were some fancy ways to defeat the problem, but the best (simplest, cheapest) was to mount a standard light bulb under the hood and run an extension cord to a 120 source at night (or a 12 volt bulb powered by the house bank). This kept the engine from getting super cold and it
started easily every time.

Hope this helps.

Kindest Regards,
Chris

I'm badly in need of a block heater for my '76 bus.  I've looked high & low on every website I know (cip1.com, bus depot, etc) and nobody has them.  Not very surprising as how many people drive their busses in the winter?  That is, true winter, Canuk style.
