Sewing is FUNdamental!!  First of all, I have this old Singer from my mom, 
and the wife just doesn't understand why I keep this non-functioning thing!!

Well, now I can show her how nice I can sew two pieces of scrap material 
together, and she asks the next question, "why . . .?"

And honestly, I have  to figure my man hours at a negative figure, since I 
consider this therapy.  You know, I figured out about three years ago that 
if I can go to a junk yard, hack and crack on any vehicle I come across for 
a 6 hour period, and only have to pay $20 for a bunch of parts that are 
worth $50, then I am money ahead.

I was going to replace the front seat covers with Ron Salmon's setup,
but after I bought all the material, I decided to first try to make some 
fron tseat covers.

This way, I will match the front to the back.

Don't.  The mattress  was much too heavy.  I am trashing all the mattress.  
I cut the cushion form out of the mattress foam, and really made a mess.  I 
don't mind cleaning up, so it was no  problem for me to sweep the garage 
floor five times last night!!

and the mattress did have al 'old man' cigarette smell, which I am sure 
would permiate the Westy.

There was an auto upholstery shop in PA that I drove by,  then caem back to 
it.  I checked inside, and it was like a garage atic shop, but the single 
owner/worker was making some Jaguar seats.  We got to talking, and he GAVE 
me a whole bunch of upholstery foam.  I have been piece using this stuff for 
four years, and I still have a smattering left.

I may use the foam from the top bed of a late Westy that I got along with 
the material, but I think is might not be wide enough.  We will see....  
More experimentation is needed!!
