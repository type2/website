Subject: Favorite Online Used VW Parts Sources?

I'm working my way through our 1978 Westy's front suspension and I found 
two broken torsion bar leaves. Of course my mind jumped to the spare 
front suspension beam I junked about 15 years ago... grumble-grumble-grumble

I called one place that had sent me a catalog way back when and it 
sounded like I could buy the whole bundle for $60 then both upper and 
lower bundles for $60 and then when I called it turned into each leaf 
for $60... LOL! I told them no thanks... I have a local source that 
would gladly sell me cooling tin screws for $60 each. Last time I 
visited the local place years ago he told me how VW bolts were getting 
hard to find. He wanted to charge me by the bolt along with some rusty 
tin i wanted. Gotta make a living I understand but.... ;)

What are your favorite online used parts sources?

'78 VW Westy (Corvair implanted)

Project status: all of the front suspension is cleaned and rattlecan 
painted. My six year old and I have the beam itself about 70% cleaned 
and painted as of bedtime last night. Am looking for two replacement 
shock bushings for my KYB shocks that I R&R'd. Ever Goggle for shock 
bushings? Everything but shock bushings in the search results. I have a 
balljoint press tool worked out, just need to make it, will share the 
plans with you volks when I have it done. Also have a bushing install 
tool worked out, also need to make it and will share the plans.
