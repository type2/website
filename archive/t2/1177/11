Subject: Re: [T2] looking for battery hold-down solution

"Problem is now that there are no more battery hold-down brackets."

I have always put mine in a battery box and let it just sit there. I
am sure it shifts around but I have never had issues, at least not
with my battery :) There were no hold downs when I got the bus, I
believe 7 years ago, and it had already been relocated to the left
side. Two years ago I had a fiberglass shelf created for the battery
to sit on as the original metal part is NLA.
