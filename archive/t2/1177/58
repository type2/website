on the bench you can disconnect the solinoid from the starter motor (it'll 
become obvious) and apply power to the solinoid directly (from a battery 
or battery charger) then trigger the solinoid - clamp it down and keep 
fingers clear.

the gear should pop out, then return, smoothly.   not the only failure 
mechanism, but the easiest to test.  (the others are probably worth just 
swapping in another starter - but you can look in the bellhousing hole and 
look for odd wear and metal bits on the flywheel teeth..)


I've disassembled and cleaned them up before.....but not much 
recollection.   I think it was pretty straight forward.
