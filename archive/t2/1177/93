I'm not suggesting that the original poster should pull a trailer on the
route, but the bus is rated to tow a considerable amount of weight.  If the
U-Haul dealer looks up the specs as found in the owners manual, he will see

Towing Capacity (manual transmission)
trailer w/o brakes 1322lbs (600kg)
trailer w/brakes    2645lbs (1200kg)

Again, not a recommendation, just don't count on the dealer turning you
away based on rated capacity.  They would almost certainly rent a 4'x8'
trailer.

I also agree with the I-80 route, which is how I delivered my 1968 from San
Francisco to Chicago.
