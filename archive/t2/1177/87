You'll be doing regular valve jobs at those temps until you have a 
sunken seat or the seat just falls out - been there, done that.. killed 
two separate sets of heads at those temps.  This confirms what Jake Raby 
always says in that our engines are misconfigured.  Based on how many of 
my friends have to get valve jobs, I totally agree.  I haven't played 
with timing too much yet, but the only way I've found to provide 
significant temp drops is to run lean of stoich, but it's not something 
you can do easily with the stock EFI.
