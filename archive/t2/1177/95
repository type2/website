Tim has a real good practical point there, I sort of presumed Lauren already
had a hitch.  The bumper ones are terrible, even if they include the strap
that goes over the engine crossbar, that isn't a lot better.  Need to find one
of the sort that bolts between the frame rails.

The T-II rear bumper is not designed for towing. The
factory tow bar bolts
directly to the rails that the bumper mounts to. I would
not use the bolt
to the bumper universal hitch that U-Haul will rent you. A
4x8 trailer
with just a 1/2 ton load could start warping the bumper, uni-hitch
loosens, bad new first time you hit the brakes......going
downhill.........trying to make a little time with momentum.... when you
see
the brake lights flashing at the bottom of the grade....
