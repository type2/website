Thanks, Jamie. I will be interested to see what you find when you retard the
timing. I have read of people using anywhere between 28 and 32 degrees BTDC as
the maximum centrifugal timing. To get 28 deg. you would probably have to
tweak the centrifugal system in some way to maintain a reasonable idle timing.
I know I read somewhere how to do this but I don't recall the method. I know
you could change the springs but I'm sure I saw another method.

Yes, that is what I meant by scatter.

Martin.

vac disconnected max advance is 33 deg

i didn't see any "scatter" ... assuming that means the timing isn't solid ,
steady..
I did have that distributor on a machine, and it ran to about 8500 rpm before
any point float occured..
