Subject: offical cry for help (1 fixed- 1 in progress)

today is the day i learned that the dizzy turns clockwise...no kidding i
always thought it was CCW. I never pulled the cap off to watch him turn....99%
of the time i am alone in the garage (and i thought of making a sideways
periscope to see what is happening in the engine compartment when i turn it
over i just have never gotten to making it....;))
So after 2 min of troubleshooting i came to the conclusion i still have lots
to learn. I fired the green monster up and my god he runs a lot smoother. i
can only get the timing in the 20 degree range so i suspect i need to adjust
the valves and re try. I doubted myself (about my engine build) but all it
ended up being was a simple swich-r- roo. Thanks guys!!!
next time i will send 2 emails, i realize how complex it could get. Next is to
find out why my coil is grounding.
The issue is when i put my green wire from the dizzy onto the coil (ter. 1), i
loose all voltage to the front of the van....that being said there is a rats
nest next to the fuse box and i plan to retrace all wires and check
connections. Yesterday everything worked fine and he would turn over but not
start (coupled with an incorrect spark cables - i mean really!! Clockwise!!i
hate myself right now...)
Has anybody ever seen this where the coil is grounded out and power is lost to
the front?
Thanks to all who helped me.....i was at a point where i was getting fed up
because i had a lot on my plate. But now got new wind in the sails and i am
going at her today!! Wheather is getting nicer here in Canada and camping
looks like a possibility!!!
Again thanks


Frank
