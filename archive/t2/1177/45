I'd be tempted to try to roll-start the bus and see if the sound still 
happens to rule in/out the starter.     (might have to get the gear to 
dissengage first..).

This could be because of a bad starter bushing (probably less likely, that 
usually just causes the starter to be slow), a sticky solinoid, or a bad 
flywheel to gear engagement, maybe from the starter being loose, or the 
flywheel being loose (or an oring flywheel on a non-oring crank), 
or....dunno.


Solinoid/gear mechanism could just need to be disassembled and cleaned up? 
Dunno, this isn't a failure that (amazingly) has ever happened to me on an 
aircooled.
