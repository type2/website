Subject: window lift channel '68 bus driver's side front

Hi!
I need to replace the window lift channel, driver's side, on my '68 bus.

Who's your favorite parts source for such things?

BTW, when the old one rusted and failed in 1999, I clamped it up with a 
couple of binder clips, and it has lasted all this time!!!  Now it is 
75% rusted away, and the binder clips can't hold on much longer!

Thanks!

your mate,
Kate
