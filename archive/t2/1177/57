What did you do to make it run smoother?  Have you verified that the 
rotor is pointing at plug #1 when the #1 cylinder is at TDC firing 
position?  Are you able to get it to around 7.5 BTDC when adjusting at 
idle? (I'm assuming this is a late bay as I can't remember what you said 
it was)

The valves won't affect the timing, but I'm guessing that you're just 
talking about them making a lot of noise or running roughly?  It think 
you said this one had hydraulic lifters?  These adjust differently than 
solid lifters.  When you adjust them, you'll turn the distributor so 
it's pointing at the #1 cap post (to adjust 1) and you'll tighten the 
adjuster 1.5 turns past contact for both valves.  Then turn the crank 
COUNTERCLOCKWISE 180 degrees (90 degrees of distributor rotation) so 
it's pointing at the #2 cap post and adjust #2 valves, then rotate 
counterclockwise until pointing at #3 and adjust #3 valves, etc.

Yes, I'd start that new email thread now as I'm already confused as to 
which bus is which ;)

Also, make sure you include type2(-at-)type2.com as you replied just to me 
instead of the rest of the group.

Thanks!
