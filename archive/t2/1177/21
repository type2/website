Subject: distributor selection

I have a 2.0 L , hyd valves, ED block, Reman Vw-Canada. Stock fuel injection

it is in a 74 body, manual trans,  running with 18.5 in of vacuum,

I am trying to select the best distributor to install.... and initial timing
setting...

I have on hand ...
021 905 205P ... with points , single vac can , many miles on using this
distributor
I am using oldvolkshome.com that tells me to set timing at 7.5deg BTDC (-at-)
850-950 rpm (Man Trans),  w/strobe, vacuum hose connected

also, I have a 021 905 205N with pertronix , dual vac.
oldvolkshome.com says 10deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s)
connected
I have a few miles on this dist.  but I set it at 7.5 BTDC

also, I have a 039-905-205C stock electronic ignition ,, module, and coil
79 Cali 2 L
oldvolkshome.com says 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950 rpm (Manual Trans), w/strobe,
vacuum hose(s) connected
some reason i can't get it to fire with this set up,, so I have set it aside
till I can figure out what that is about,

I was leaning toward the Calif ignition,
I am using the pertronix, but I think I need to adj my initial timing,, as I
set it at 7.5 BTDC... and looks like it should be 10 ATDC

I don't know for sure it is pertronix...  it has a red, and black wire and
black box inside that resembles what I know about pretronix

I wonder if I can put the pertronix in the single vac distributor
I wonder if I should NOT connect the retard part of the dual vac distributor

I really Wonder why the same engine has a different timing setting..
 so,, should I set the timing to the engine,, or to the distributor..?

I am going to swap around some stuff tomorrow,,  so I was looking for a bit
of guidance on initial timing setting
