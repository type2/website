Good post - the neatest rear disc setup I've ever serviced was the 70s 
Volvo sedan/wagon. It had a conventional disc in the rear and then it 
used the inside of the disc rotor as a brake drum for parking brake shoes.

I've done the four wheel drums of course. They were awful after deep 
water (heavy rain) and after the first panic stop. What I've always 
liked about discs were their ability to shed water and cool faster.

Surprisingly - despite doing some light towing (generally 1000lbs or 
less) in the TN mtns - I've not had alot of trouble with the front 
brakes fading. Contrast that to my CR-V which has done the same towing 
on the same mtn roads and it experiences much more heat fade. I know the 
CR-V is primarily a FWD and the front does most of the braking - but it 
also has vented rotors. I haven't studied my bus brake proportional 
valve any yet. is it like the MkII watercooled VWs which had a valve 
connected to the rear suspension which regulates the rear brake 
pressures? I don't recall anything like that back there - but I've not 
worked on the rear half of the system in a long time -it's just been 
there dangling it's tires in the air for years. I know all about the 
front suspension now - ALL about it... LOL!
