Good advice from other. A few points if I might add: 
- I too think the I-80 corridor is less mountainous (with less aggressive drivers) than the I-70 route over the Rockies. Or consider some non-interstate US routes. Google Earth give elevations, which is pretty helpful. 
- Be careful not to lug the motor (ie, keeping the RPMs too low). Too little engine speed can be worse than too much. Here is a link on engine speed ranges and other things: http://tinyurl.com/7dnx7qa
- Do a bit of research on the trailer, capacity and proper hitch. The U-haul people, although somewhat cautious in my experience, may do some harm when installing the hitch, being unfamiliar with vee dubs. Putting your stuff in a crate and shipping it cross country might be a safe alternative. I cringe when I see a bus towing anything. 
- Build a few hours into the trip to pull off under some trees and take a break if it's really hot out. Bring a book, a guitar, meditate for an hour or so... If the dipstick is too hot to the check the oil, the engine is running too hot. 

Good luck and enjoy the trip.
