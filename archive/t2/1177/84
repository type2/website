Chris, the guy is dead full of shit or trying to make a big profit off people,
R-12 has actually gotten MUCH cheaper last couple of years, down to barely
more than R-134a (which is going $15-18/lb in AK.)  R-12 goes somewhere around
$20-25/lb on ebay, sometimes you see a deal for less, but you can always find
4, 14oz cans well under $100.  And you can legally purchase it if you take the
test (can do it online) and state you have a recovery system, or I think to
purchase it to "resale" to a licensed installer.  30lb can sitting at $550
right now, nearly over, probably will get to $650 or so, 1/2 full can sitting
at $175.  Now it was up there at $60-80/lb a few years back but oddly
supply/demand has ruled out here, the market has become so narrow that in the
modern internet world there is a ton of it (NOS) around comparatively.  Since
I think 134a becomes illegal to OTC sell here in a year or two, probably time
to speculate on the market with it, I
 recall a bunch of friends who turned handsome profits with cases of R12 back
when.  I had a couple of 14oz we had paid a "ridiculous" $4-5 each for (had
been $2.99 for a long time) that I know were selling around town for $40 each
there for a while in the late 90's.  Also had a "mini-can" of R-12, 10lb I
think and it held fine for a good 15 years or so, I believe you were supposed
to store them inverted though, valve down.
 
Most vintage car guys now days
recharge with R-12 again because it works so much better, and if you restored
the system on your $50k vette/stang/whatever you might as well have the system
work and look correct without adapters when the difference in price to filling
with 134a is only $50 or so.  But still doesn't make it worth it to me with
the bus, like I said if I had a DPD under dash unit, maybe I'd do it, but
otherwise not worth the effort.

I talked to my employer's heating and
cooling tech this morning. We got to talking about Freons and he told me that
a 30 lb bottle of Freon R-12 (New Old Stock now of course) is $2400 - that's
twenty-four-hundred-dollars...
