Subject: Re: [T2] Front Spare Holder fell off

I mounted some small rubber blocks on the top of my front bumper, so
the spare tire (on the mount) was actually resting on the rubber
blocks. This way the weight of the tire is on the blocks and the mount
will not pull through the metal of the chassis.
