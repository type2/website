Can be done at military convoy speeds. Take your time, pull over for
traffic following.

I have loaded a full cord of firewood in my Kombi. Stuffed full to the
headliner. Just pumped up the tires and drove very carefully 35-40mph for
a few miles. With half that weight of goods have driven over 500 miles
several times, just lots of 3rd gear up the grades.

Keep your eyes a 1/4 mile down the road, anticipate lots of extra braking
distance when pulling trailers or just with big loads.

The T-II rear bumper is not designed for towing. The factory tow bar bolts
directly to the rails that the bumper mounts to. I would not use the bolt
to the bumper universal hitch that U-Haul will rent you. A 4x8 trailer
with just a 1/2 ton load could start warping the bumper, uni-hitch
loosens, bad new first time you hit the brakes......going
downhill.........trying to make a little time with momentum.... when you
see the brake lights flashing at the bottom of the grade....
