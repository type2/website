Don't your rotors come off of the front bearing hubs too? I have torn 
down my front beam completely now and sandblasted everything except the 
beam and repainted it. Was surprised to find that the hub/rotors 
separated so easily.

I also started thinking about vented front rotors. I figure the rotor 
would need to be the 5x112mm pattern. Then the new caliper would either 
need to bolt to the stock location or an adapter plate.

As for rear disc brakes - my van has a proportioning valve. Not sure how 
to re-engineer that without alot of smoky sliding stops as I tried to 
find the traction threshold to see if the braking was balanced. - - - Or 
am I thinking about it too much? ;)

The CB Performance kit I put on my Beetle ages ago was pretty simple. 
Type III hubs (that model had separate bearing hubs from the drums), 914 
rotors, custom caliper bracket, 914 calipers, possibly Golf E-brake 
cables. Once I bought it I wished I had cruised the junkyard more. Still 
it worked right out of the box, I was single and had some spare cash 
then, so in that way the kit was nice...
