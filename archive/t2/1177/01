Subject: Plastic alternator ring

I think it was mentioned that the plastic ring that goes around the 
alternator is available again, or was that just the alternator 
adjustment hole cover that was available?  If the ring is available, 
could someone point me to a vendor that stocks it.

Thanks!
Mike
