I believe timing at full advance is more meaningful than timing at
idle, whichever distributor you choose.
Thus you would rev up to around 3200 rpm or so and see what your
timing light says. Hopefully the manufacturer of the distributor
provides full advance timing numbers, usually around 28 BTDC or so.
