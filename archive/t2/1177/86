Subject: Re: [T2] distributor selection

I did a test drive,, 350km,, at about 120kmhr ,, and at one point I tried to
catch an R8 Audi , didn't make it,,lol,,, but did see 145kmhr on the GPS for
about 5km
40L gas, 350km = 11.4 L/100km , or about 24.6mpg

single vac dist, points, 50 dwell, 7.5deg BTDC ... lots of fun!!
the CHT was showing normal... but maybe a touch hot..??  it always ran at
about 425 ...
I think I want to do another run with the timing at about 5 deg BTDC and see
if it lowers the CHT, but maintains milage, and power.

Then I am going to slide in a Calif electronic distributor, set at 5 deg,
with the retard vac port omitted, just to see what is up with that one.

any comments?
Thanks for your help
Jamie
