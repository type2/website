Subject: Front Spare Holder fell off

I was noticing the front spare holder seemed a little loose.  I took of 
the cover to tighten the nuts holder the tire to the bus.  Then I 
figured I'd take it off to pump it up.  I had one nut loose when the 
whole thing came off the bus -  rack and all.  Glad I was parked!

I was shocked to see that the rack had been held on by some flimsy 
looking expansion fasteners with 3/16" bolts!  The holes in the skin had 
enlarged and -- FOOP!

I'd like to put the rack back where it was, due to the 4 ugly holes and 
lack of the VW logo on the nose.   The area where one would put proper 
bolts through is sealed off on the other side of the duct-work which 
looks immovable.  Likely why the PO used blind insertion expansion 
fasteners.  And they worked for 34 years!

Does anyone have an idea of decent expansion fasteners needed to 
reattach this rack?

Or, perhaps a VW logo?
