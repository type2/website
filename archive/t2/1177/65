Subject: Re: [T2] '74 bus rear brake question

I'm of the WTH would you camp as well.  Balance would be all the hell off
unless done well, parking brakes always a PITA on rear discs no matter what
the style, and even if you are packing 150hp or so in there, front upgrade
would be better first.
 
Which in fact I've been considering as I stared at
the '77 yesteday.  At 96k miles it needs discs, I threw the old ones on my
Ammco 4000 to clean em up, but they  are too thin after turning.  I stared
blankly last night at the disc wondering if I could machine it into a hub to
slip on a set of vented Eurovan rotors I seem to have sitting on the shelf for
some reason, though I also have a set of Audi G60 calipers and rotors off an
old 200...
 
As an interesting and likely possible rear upgrade, I know for
fact that Eurovan drums will bolt on Vanagons pretty much without
modification, just fit under the 14" rim, and are bigger, and self adjusting
of course.  That might make an interesting ugrade on a bus...

Hi, scoggy here.  On my
'74 Westy, is it possible, and how difficult is it..to
put..VW rear disc
brakes on this machine?  I have the rear dissassembled and
the bus on jack
stands..and after a few..'cold beverages'..started to ponder
this
question..and thought I would throw it out to 'the knowledgables", on the
list, and work from there. Thanks
