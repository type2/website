I mounted airhorns and compressor on my R90/6. Used a relay to feed direct
from the battery. Worked just great.

I find the dual tone electric Fiamms as used stock on later models to be
VERY loud, besides being stock on not just /7 and later Airheads but on
dozens of Euro vehicles.

For the /6 and earlier, get an extra horn holder like the one you got and
you can use 2 to mount the Fiamms. I don't think the relay is necessary
for the very rare and momentary use of horns. But it will help to insure
full bright max output of HOOOOONNNNKKKKKK.

You can get a pair of the Fiamms with wiring and relay as a kit for $35 or
so at any NAPA. Remove the chrome covers and they look dead stock. Or
leave them on for a touch of bling, as you will.

The three horn system from a Mercedes 600 will part the waters if you are
being chased by armies.
