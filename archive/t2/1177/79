Subject: NEED engine compartment interior sheetmetal (from parts hulk)

So I've decided to pull the dealer installed COOL A/C sytem on the '77 Westy. 
I mean I live in AK now, and even the last time I tuned it up about 12 years
ago, it worked only as well as it worked which wasn't that great.  If I had a
DPD under dash unit, I'd install it, but I've decided this isn't worth the
weight.  Plus I used up my last R12 with that recharge.  So this leaves me
with the usual butchered rear driver side sheet metal that cleared the York
compressor.  If anyone has a parter sitting about and could send me a chunk of
the engine compartment that will fit in a 12x12x6 flat rate box, I'd be real,
REAL, grateful.  The chunk there in front of the VIN in the compartment is
what I need.  I'd be willing to Paypal about $40 to cover the flat rate, the
good bimetal sawzall blade it will take to extract and pay you for a 6 pack of
your favorite brew.  If anyone can help me out, please pmail, the only bus
graveyard up here features one of
 those "thinks bolts cost $60 each" idiots.
 
TIA
John
