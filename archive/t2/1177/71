Hi Lauren,

I also live in the suburbs of St. Louis.  Small world!  But I ain't moving...

Is this Bus a station wagen or a heavier Campmobile?  It'll probably tow the
small trailer (if it isn't loaded too heavy) okay on flatter ground, but
you'll be stressing the motor pretty severely climbing to over 10,000 feet on
I-70 in the Rockies.  You should either choose I-44 west toward
Albuquerque/Los Angeles and cut up towards SFO (the most level route), or I-70
almost to Denver then up I-25 to I-80 and then westbound to Salt Lake City and
SFO (next best route).

Don't be tempted to keep up with modern traffic on the Interstate, drive 60-65
and take your time, your motor will thank you if you don't push it too hard in
the heat.  Do not take a lot of weight in the trailer or you'll be asking for
trouble...  Find a good mechanic who knows Type 4 engines and pay them to dial
that engine system in to perfection before ever starting out.

Have a great (and safe) move!

Bill Bowman

Hello everyone,

I will be moving soon from the St. Louis area to city not far from San
Fransisco, and I was wondering what I need to look over to make sure Mr.
Peabody (my 78 bus) is ready for the adventure.  I checked my Muir book but
there's not a "roadtrip" checklist in there :/  .  He is idling a little weak
and adjusting the "idle air screw" doesn't help much,  MPG is around 17-20.
I'm looking at towing a small (5x8) Uhaul cargo trailer and would like
everyone's thoughts on that as well.  Is there one route
that may be better to take than another for the journey? I'm thinking about
taking 70 straight out there since I have family I can stay with in Colorado
Springs, but I also need to keep in mind the incline of the mountains and
summer heat since I'll be traveling in June or September.

Thanks,
Lauren
