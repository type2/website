Hey Mark,

 

You need to stop advertising this thing. Every time it gets mentioned, there
is probably one more person buying a ticket, which reduces my chances! I've
already convinced my wife that we are taking a long weekend trip to go pick
that bus up! I think she might be more excited about it than me (that was
after I showed her the pics on your site). 

 

;)
