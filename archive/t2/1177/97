Drain the tank. Pull the outlet fitting and screen. Dismount all 4 shocks.
Stick the garden hose in the filler and crank the tap open fully. Rock the
bus back and forth vigorously until overflow. Shut off the hose. Continue
rocking until fully drained.

Now have another vehicle available. Run to full operating temp. Run a hose
from the exhaust to the filler on the Bus. Let it idle a half hour or so
and the tank will be warm and fully dry.

Reinstall the outlet with new screen. Hookup the fuel lines. Add gas. See
how it runs. If poor responce to adjustments at carbs, tear them down and
rebuilt them with new seals and gaskets.

Two sizes of fuel hose on the 72. See 2 sizes of connections at the
mechanical pump. 7mm from tank to pump, 5 mm from there to the carbs. Any
VW supplier will have both in orginal cloth covered German hose. Some 2
feet of 7mm and 4 feet of 5mm will do you for complete renewal.

I add an early FI cube type plastic filter between tank and pump. Will
catch a whole bunch of crud before it gets to the pump or carbs.
