Hi all,

I got curious last night so I put it into third gear, took the brake
off and started rocking the bus. The same awful metal on metal sound
occurred but it began to change, then the bus rolled backwards a
little bit. I continued to rock and the sound got less and less, and
then it was gone. Now I was nearly into the street so I got in and
started her up. Absolutely normal sounds again.

So, definitely that starter gear was/is misaligned or sticking. The
next step will be to pull the starter to see what is going on. Does
that make sense to others? Would having an auto parts store test the
starter be of any benefit in this situation? I do not know how to
diagnose a sticky starting gear.

Thanks.
