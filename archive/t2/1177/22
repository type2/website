Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Original Westfalia Canvas Top Color

David, I know late bays Westy's far more than early, but I've had a white '70
and '71.  Mine both had the yellow top with the fringes, though the color on
one was certainly almost gone, but could be seen in areas.
 
The color was the
same as this red 1971, whose top appears pretty original to me.  But again I'm
not great with early bay Westy details.

or on a '69

both of those
are yellow believe it or not I presume...
 
Busdepot shows it new here:

But they do sell a
beige one as well.  I almost bought a one owner from new '68 years ago that
had a beige top which appeared original.  And you can get some wild stuff, I
recall Steve Dolan got this simply wild ass canvas one time which looked like
a veritable technicolor dreamcoat, multicolor stripes and was of very high
quality, it might have found it's way onto his '73 I'm not sure.
 
For yours
although I think yellow was stock, beige might cetainly be a better choice.
 
John

My bay is a '71 and has been painted white over light
turquoise.  (Original
color was solid white.)
