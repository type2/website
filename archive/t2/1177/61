Subject: '74 bus rear brake question

Hi, scoggy here.  On my '74 Westy, is it possible, and how difficult is it..to
put..VW rear disc brakes on this machine?  I have the rear dissassembled and
the bus on jack stands..and after a few..'cold beverages'..started to ponder
this question..and thought I would throw it out to 'the knowledgables", on the
list, and work from there. Thanks
Cheers
Syd
