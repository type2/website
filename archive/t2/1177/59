Yeah, get everything situated and if you have the know-how and the 
patience, I'd make sure that all of your wires are going to the correct 
place.  Chances are you have something connected incorrectly - do not 
make assumptions because that's usually where the problem lies and you 
end up kicking yourself later.  Hopefully you don't have a short 
somewhere, because that's frustrating to figure out.

Try this - turn your key to on and remove the green wire from terminal 1 
of the coil - you should now have power up-front.  Now put the 
transmission in reverse - do you lose power up front?  I don't know if 
you knew this, but the reverse light pulls it's power from terminal 15 
on the coil and it's also a circuit that gets grounded to turn on the 
lights/charge the coil.  So, in theory, grounding the coil or turning on 
the reverse switch should have the exact same effect to your voltage 
up-front.

Let us know what's up and use this message to reply to from now on as 
I've updated the subject to be more descriptive.
