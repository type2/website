Subject: grinding and thrashing sound perhaps from my alternator

Hi everyone,

Yesterday when I started KK after work there was a grinding sound that
came from the rear. I had the windows down so I thought perhaps I just
was not use to the sounds as the windows have been up most of the
winter. I drove over to a friends house to pick up a couch with my
wife. Went to start it after loading the couch, and no go. Just a
click-click like a dead battery. I checked the battery connections, my
hot start relay, and the wires on the coil. Everything looked good so
I got back in, started KK, and the grinding came back after the bus
started. It is not apparent while just cranking the engine.

KK Specifications:
 '71 Bus,1600dp engine, SVDA distributor, Bosch Alternator (replaced
2 years ago) when my generator died.


Began driving home, about 6 miles from where we were, after about 1
mile, the sound was gone. I even had to wait for a train and KK idled
along perfectly for about 10 minutes, no sound.

This morning, I started KK and the same grinding/thrashing sound
started, I put it into reverse, backed up just fine, then I thought
better of driving it as I have a few appointments and I don't want to
be stranded today.

This last weekend I replaced the belt as the other one was pretty
loose and way past its prime. It has the proper deflection amount and
it worked great until yesterday.

Any ideas on what might be causing this? I am thinking it might be a
bearing going bad in the alternator?

Thanks,

Max

'71 "KK-Louise"
