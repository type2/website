Subject: Re: [T2] looking for battery hold-down solution

based on all of your suggestions, I think we're going to go with 
something like this:

http://www.thmarine.com/products/Battery-Trays/Strap-Battery-Trays/Battery-Holder-Tray-with-Stainless-Buckle

I think that will provide a simple and elegant solution that is easy to 
install and easy to get the battery in and out...

Thanks!
Mike
