Interesting thoughts David. Thank you again for helping with diagnosing this.

I doubt it is a flywheel issue, I have had this engine in for about
2.5 years now and have never had a starter/flywheel issue with it. The
starter seems snug.

I like the push start idea, perhaps tomorrow after work I can attempt
that. I imagine rocking the bus in 3rd gear should get the starter to
starter to disengage.

I'll do my best to report back tomorrow. Anyone else have a trick to
rule out the starter?
