Subject: Re: [T2] distributor selection

well,,, I think I am going to move it up[back] to 32 deg, 

I had it at 32 -33 ...  dual vac, 2 liter , fuel injection, manual trans 
it sat at 7.5 btdc at idle, 
starts, runs, drives ,, and has top end power

I turned it back to 28... and it idles at 2 btdc..
and it lost the top end power..
