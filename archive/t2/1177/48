Could it be that the alternator shaft has drifted towards the back 
bumper and is allowing the fan to rub the inside of the fan shroud?

I suggestion is to remove it entirely and spin it by hand and listen for 
noises or bearing roughness.

Once I over tightened my fan belt (Beetle) and it caused the alternator 
to tip towards the rear bumper enough to cause the fan to rub against 
the plate that fits between the fan and the alternator. It was throwing 
sparks and everything from the two steel parts rubbing.

I found it much easier to remove the engine and tear off the cooling 
that way. Clean and replace any worn gaskets during reassembly.
