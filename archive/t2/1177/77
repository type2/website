unless this is a leasurly trip with no time constraints go to U-haul and 
rent truck and trailer to haul bus.  could be cheaper and is U-hauls 
problem if you breakdown.

I killed a flatland bus in the Rockies many years ago, if you love your 
bus then why punish it like that.  relax.

now if this is vacation and you have all the time in the world busted bus 
is in colorado and have the parts and if you are not afraid to crawl under 
your bus in the desert and if your platimum AAA is paid up go ahead.  but 
you want your bus on the coast and you don't sound 110% confident about 
your bus why bother.

IMO and as they say YMMV
