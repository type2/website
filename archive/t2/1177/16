I'd say that they have it mislabeled - it's a car piece, not a bus piece. 
Bus dampers have the bushings for both ends built into the ends. 
type1/3/etc have only one end built in - see

that's my guess, anyway.  I've replaced a few dampers and they all had all 
the bushings they needed in them already ;)
