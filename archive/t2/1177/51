there is a very real possibility that the dizzy gear got put in backwards 
meaning everything is 180 degrees off, I have run into this problem far 
too many times to count. yes you can look down the hole and see if it is 
right but it doesn't mean the cam is not 180 off.

is very frustrating but you can either tear the engine down and fix it, or 
what I always have done just wire it up and time it 180 degrees out.

good luck
