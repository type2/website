The 28d is for WITHOUT vacuum at full advance. Then you hook up the vaccum
and it jumps up a lot, like it should. But the book procedure for base
adjustment of timing is NOVAC for the suitcase T-2's. That is US 72-79 and
aircooled Vanagon.

The resulting timing at idle should then be noted for static timing in
future.

All the differences between all those stock dizzy numbers means very
little. Us any of them interchangably, and if you set them per factory
procedure, the result is delovely.
