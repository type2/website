Subject: Looking for late-bay (79) heat riser tin seals

Does anyone know where to get the seals/gaskets that fit in the tin 
where the heater tubes pass into the engine bay?  These are the tubes to 
which the flexible hose connects which then connect to the blower fan. 
There are two of these seals - one that is round, the other is oval.

Thanks!
Mike
