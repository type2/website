Subject: Re: Front Spare Holder fell off

A few years back I had to redo my tire mount after hitting a wild turkey
with my spare tire.
Once I saw that it mounted to just the sheet metal on the front apron I
bought a new mount that attaches to the apron as well
as having two supports that anchor to the bumper.  I am pretty sure it
came from bus depot but can't find it there now.
I had to get new bolts and spacers to modify it to work with the vw rim
so perhaps that is why thy don't carry them now.

If you use the tire mount you have I would put some big washers behind
the sheet metal. Its a bit of a tight space to fish nuts and washers
into but it can be done.
