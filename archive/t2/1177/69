Hello everyone,

I will be moving soon from the St. Louis area to city not far from San
Fransisco, and I was wondering what I need to look over to make sure Mr.
Peabody (my 78 bus) is ready for the adventure.  I checked my Muir book but
there's not a "roadtrip" checklist in there :/  .  He is idling a little weak
and adjusting the "idle air screw" doesn't help much,  MPG is around 17-20.
I'm looking at towing a small (5x8) Uhaul cargo trailer and would like
everyone's thoughts on that as well.  Is there one route
that may be better to take than another for the journey? I'm thinking about
taking 70 straight out there since I have family I can stay with in Colorado
Springs, but I also need to keep in mind the incline of the mountains and
summer heat since I'll be traveling in June or September.

Thanks,
Lauren
