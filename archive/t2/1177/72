Good advise from Bill on the route, but I wouldn't tow anything more than a
tiny trailer with your bus - like those that Harbor Freight sells.
In fact, the Uhaul dealer will likely look up the towing capacity in his
system and may not allow you to rent it.

What type of hitch do you have?  You need a heavy duty hitch to pull even the
smallest Uhaul trailer.  I wouldn't use the draw bar type for anything other
than those tiny trailers I mentioned.

A better option, (though much more expensive) would be to rent a Uhaul truck
and pull a flat bed trailer with  your Westy on that.
