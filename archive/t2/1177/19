Uhh David, going to need year, paint color, etc.  Yellow is a usual bet for
late bays, both standard and deluxe with Champagne's being a notable beige
exception.  On replacement though, some people like beige more (say with a
green bus) than bright yellow, so you can always let personal preference
decide.

Replacing my camper's canvas top, and wondering if tan or
yellow was original.
Photos of tan replacements look more like gray, so I'm
thinking that yellow is
the way to go.
