Standard American hold down clamp set.  All you need is to drill 2 5/16" or so
holes for the long hold down J-bolts that just go through, and you lay the
cross clamp over the top and tighten down.  Fits anything flat that you can
set a battery on.  You can get the plastic top bar ones that expand/contract
but it is best to try to find one the correct width.
 
$5-10 any parts store,
hell probably even at Walmart.
 
Something like this, works like a champ, this
is the expandable version, most parts stores will have 2-3 and a couple length
J bolts:

I'm working with
someone that had a rusted out battery compartment so he had his body-shop do
some fiberglass work in there to reinforce the rusted out area.  Problem is
now that there are no more battery hold-down brackets.  Does anyone have a
relatively simple solution to deal with this so that the battery doesn't go
flying around?
