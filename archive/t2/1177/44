Ok,

With the belt off the sound still persists. I got the clunk, clunk from the
starter again and had to knock it with the hammer. Then she started but still
with the awful sound.

Will replacing the solenoid itself fix this issue or do I need to do the
solenoid and starter? I don't really want to drive it to a mechanic because I
do not want to damage the flywheel anymore than I already may have. I have
swapped this starter before so I know I can do it.

Thanks,

Max
