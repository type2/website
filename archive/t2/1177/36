You should support the transmission any time you pull the engine.
Leaving it hanging on the CV's is a bad thing.

Just find a place to hook the ends of a [chain | strap | cable | rope]
to the frame on either side and strap it up. If not moving it around
use a short jackstand, a jack, or a cinder block and some pieces of wood
under it. 

Easiest overall is the strap method though.
