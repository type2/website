I sure wish I could help. Don't have that tin. I will however keep my 
eyes open.

I talked to my employer's heating and cooling tech this morning. We got 
to talking about Freons and he told me that a 30 lb bottle of Freon R-12 
(New Old Stock now of course) is $2400 - that's 
twenty-four-hundred-dollars...

Back when R-12 was almost outlawed for non-techs I bought a 30 lb bottle 
and left it at my parents' house unopened. Cost me quite a bit of money. 
Over $150 at the time I think. Went back a couple of years later - never 
opened the plastic on the valve - and the Freon had all leaked out... 
the $2400 story this morn reopens that wound a little... LOL!
