Pick the distributor that most closely matches the timing curve 
specifications of the distributor used on your model year engine.

In other words, go to oldvolkshome, look at the list of buses and find 
the one that has an engine that most-closely matches your engine's 
specs.  Then look at the distributor specs for that engine and find a 
distributor in your stash (or new) that matches those exact specs, 
install it, and then adjust it according to those specs.  The same also 
applies for a brand new SVDA - there's nothing magic about it other than 
it has vacuum advance (which is important), but other than that, the 
mechanical advance for a new SVDA distributor probably isn't necessarily 
correct for your model engine if you haven't had it adjusted 
accordingly, either by yourself or by the vendor.

As far as pertronix/compufire, I'd highly recommend either unless you 
really enjoy timing that isn't as steady as it could be and changes over 
time and requires maintenance to keep in spec.  I *never* had to adjust 
my compufire over 100,000 miles!  The timing was consistent and steady 
and reliable - points are just a pain and a waste of time.
