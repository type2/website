Subject: Fuel Lines - '72 Weekender 

On a b72 dual-carburetor 1700, is the ID size 7mm? And is this the same size
from the tank > filter > pump > carbs?

Can I get this locally at ObReillybs or NAPA? If I can't get metric, will
a 1/4" line work? Or should I mail order them? As usual, The Samba gives pages
of conflicting opinions, and I leave there more confused than when I start.

Also, she hasnbt been driven since 2006. Will merely removing the old fuel
suffice? Or is some additional tank cleaning suggested?

Thanks,
Jeff
