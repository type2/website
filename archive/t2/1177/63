Subject: Re: [T2] '74 bus rear brake question

Hi Syd,

As far as i see it, they are too much $$ for not much improvement. Rear brakes
only supply 30% of the total braking power at most and the stock drums in a
late bay have lots of grab if they are set up right.

Unless you have already done extensive mods to engine, suspension, tires,
wheels and chassis, you just won't see enough difference in the end product to
justify the expense.

Also: you live in a rainy climate, where you might want to retain the more
weatherproof nature of drums... Four wet disks on a wet mountain road would
not be my idea of a fun drive.
