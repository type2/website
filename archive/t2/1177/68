Subject: Re: [T2] '74 bus rear brake question

Sorry Chris, I meant machine the hub there.  I do think either the EV or 200
rotors would work out using appropriate calipers mounted on carriers for
same.  The offsets of the rotor midlines are no where near as far on either as
the solid rotor, which would give more room for brackets, but perhaps cause
issues with the wheels.  However using modern sliding calipers with only the
"clamping" side outboard perhaps not.  I don't think either (both 11"
essentially) will fit under the 14" rim though.  If I still had an EV or an
audi I could try sliding a 14" bus rim on it to see, but I recall the 15" Audi
alloys being right up against the brakes pretty much.  I think that the EV
calipers might end up not all that much more surface area on the single
pistons than the two pistons of the Girling/ATE bus caliper so hydraulic
effort might end up about the same at least, though pushing more swept contact
area.  Would probably be doable.  Unfortunately I
 don't have any EV calipers/carriers about and the 200's G60's are relatively
massive for their time.  The G54 Girling single piston (Scirocco 16V, and
similar to Vanagon) is probably more appropriate, which is likely closer to
what an EV caliper is, clearanced for the 11" rotor.  I recall that 80's Audi
5000/200 turbo rear rotors all had a bigger centerline offset closer to a bus
but I think they are all solid rotors, and I presume integral hub though I
never replaced one on one of my 200s.  I guess one could drill any rotor with
the 5x112 pattern, but I was sort of musing a more bolt on application for the
rotor at least.

Don't your rotors come off of the front bearing
hubs too?
