All,

The SVDA thread was very interesting and informative. There are still 
points that need meditation (mulling over) which is good because the 
list should be thought provoking and spirited. Today a shiny rebuilt 
205T vac dizzy makes it reappearance in on the 1600 SP/30pict motor 
in the bus. I can hardly wait.

Good-bye 009 it has been great knowing you and I hope you like your 
new home in the spare parts box. I am sure you will rest peacefully 
there with the DP manifold boots and the carb rebuild kit.
