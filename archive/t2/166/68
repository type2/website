Subject: Re: [T2] ring & pinion gearset

	I would ask the reasons you're changing your ratio.  Increased crankcase 
stroke?  Different engine?  Different wheels/tires?  If you've added 
horsepower, I would consult a performance transaxle builder on your options. 
  I know FTC and Berg make performance parts in many different combinations. 
  I was at Berg's site looking at them yesterday.
