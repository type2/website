First suggestion is to find another shop.

Second suggestion, though it
pains me to make it, is to have a male person deal with the shop, at least
initially.  I'm amazed and disgusted by how poorly women are treated in
some shops.

A blanket $4000 estimate is a pretty obvious attempt to rip
off someone that the mechanic figures doesn't know better.
