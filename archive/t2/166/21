Peter mentioned that he had his temp sender there, and that he was looking
for a sump-type sender.  Seemed funny to me too. Not that it would be
hotter, but I would prefer the oil-pressure-regulating-area to stay stock!
I had a sump-type sender on my workbench, so he will probably install it at
his next oil change.
