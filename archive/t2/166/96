Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch install problems... Need Help!!!


It sounds like you have the disc backwards.......


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, you guys were right on the money diagnosing my "thumping" noise as a 
bad throw-out bearing. So today I pulled the engine (first time I ever did 
that!) and followed Bentley's directions to the letter. Removed the old 
throw-out bearing -- spun fine, but the facing looked a little worn -- 
replaced with a new one. Since I had everything apart, I decided to replace 
the clutch disc (old one was pretty worn) and plate. Everything went 
together fine so I put the engine back in (I'll spare you all the 
profanity).

Anyways, I start her up -- no problem. Push in the clutch and put it in gear 
-- okay so far. Start easing the clutch out and it starts making a strange 
whirring/grinding noise and the bus won't move. In reverse it actually 
moved, but still made the whirring/grinding noise.

What did I do wrong???? Any ideas???
