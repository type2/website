Subject: Re: [T2] clutch problem

I believe Steve is correct. Up to 70 [end of?], the trans does not have the
tube on the input shaft. On these transaxles you must use a pressure that has
a ring mounted on it for the throw-out bearing to ride on.
If he put a 71 and up pressure plate in, he will have a large gap between the
throw-bearing and the pressure plate that he cannot adjust out.

H.P., does the pressure plate you installed have a ring on it in the center at
the end of the fingers?

If no: No amount of washers will help this problem. The ring centers the
bearing. You will destroy the bearing and the new pressure plate if you leave
this mis-matched combo in the bus.
