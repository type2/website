Take a look at the numbers stamped on your distributor body, might be out sight unless you poke your head in and look all around the distributor. If the end of the number is .009, then you have a whole different process and settings when setting your timing. All the numbers in the manuals mean nothing if this is the dizzy you have. After you have checked, come back and let us know what you have, then someone can tell you what you need to do to get your engine idling nicely.
Peace, John Baker

Hello all, 71 Dormobile with a bug engine installed by p.o. 34 pict-3 carb. Anyway touble is engine wont idle. Check timing, (statically), valves, and some minor carb adjustments. Finally found a piece of rubber in needle and seat and replaced just in case. New line, filter and still having trouble with idle. I tried to adjust carb by using the library and the instructions and just wont idle at all with the idle screw just barely touching the fast idle cam. Am I incorrect trying to adjust this way? 

Also when I squeeze the vacuum line to the booster it seems to run a little bit better, is this normal or do I have a vaccum leak in the booster?

Runs fine while under power but dies when I push the clutch in for a stop sign. 

This is driving me crazy, any comments would be appreaciated.
