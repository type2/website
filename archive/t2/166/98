Subject: 74 heater fan fuse

Could someone check their owner's manual and let me know what amp fuse goes
to the heater fan in the engine compartment on a 74 bus?  This fuse is
actually in the engine compartment and not in the fuse panel.   I think any
72 - 79 should be the same.  Many thanks!  Greg
