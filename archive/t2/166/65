Subject: ring & pinion gearset

I need to increase my final drive gear ratio.  Bentley describes "early" and
"late" ring and pinion gearsets.  I would like to swap my late with a set of
early.  Can anyone comment on feasibility?  I suppose what I really need to
know are 1) Will the ring gear bolt up? (with the requisite heating of
course!) 2)  Will the pinion drive fit in the late model case?

TIA,
Bill
