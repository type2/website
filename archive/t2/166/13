Subject: Re: [T2] New guy with carb trouble (long)




It could be the dime-sized slug that is peened into the carburaetor's front. 
  I had the same problem before, and missed seeing the hole in the carb 
because of my lovely throttle-valve inquisitioner. It could also be clogged 
air-bleed jets.  Check and make sure your mixture and bypass screws have new 
o-rings on them too.
