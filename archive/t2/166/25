Use this opportunity to get involved with the repair
as much as possible. Try for the home-based mechanic
and request to attend the engine removal and disassembly.
Explain about the list and your intention to do your own
repairs someday. Shops won't let you do this for liability
reasons, but a reasonable old-timer might.
Get the John Muir book and the Bentley manual
and do some advance reading.
Wear old jeans and offer to fetch wrenches.
Bring snacks. Make a new friend. Take photos.
