Subject: Location of Fuel Gauge Wire in 71



I removed the large fuel tank cover to repair some butchery done by a
previous owner when replacing the fuel level sensor.  I noticed that the
original wire to the fuel gauge was sandwiched between the cover and the
firewall.  Is this the correct routing?  The wire also had a male spade
connector on the end that mated to a connector in the harness.  Is this
original?  I checked Bentley but no words or pictures.  The wire was also
shorting to ground at this point.  I have a feeling that this short was
the reason the previous owner replaced the level sensor and then ran a new
wire under the floor mats.
