John, and others:  Thanks to this recent discussion of timing, I 
think my head is emerging from the fog. I almost understand what is 
going on with advance/retard.

However, I am still having trouble with the reason why timing must be 
checked under load.

My understanding with mechanical advance is that it is tied to rpm. 
Is not rpm in the driveway the same as rpm on the road?   If the car 
is in the driveway and you open the throttle to give, say, 4000 rpm, 
the vacuum advance will be negligible because ported vacuum is 
negligible and the mechanical advance should be full because of the 
high rpm. Why is this not a valid condition for checking timing?

This is important to me because for years I have ignored the advice 
of Bentley and Muir and others who said to set timing at idle. 
Instead, based on the universal advice on this list, I have revved it 
up to 3500 and set to 28 degrees BTDC.  Now it seems this is 
incorrect.

TIA for the insights.

Jack
