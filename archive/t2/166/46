a lot more since propane has a lower btu than gasoline

inside is usually illegal for that size/volumne

actually round is better, cyl is a compromise

some considerably more. especially the carbon fibre tanks

yup

that is what most vehicle applications do.  I work in the transit industry
and LPG, LNG, CNG are popular alternative.  some buses have tanks on the
roof 15-20 ft long and 8 inches or so in diameter, 4 of these will get a
single deck, 40ft (12meter)bus about 100 miles

with a manifold, fairly straight forward and simple.  emergency shut off
valves etc.  if you put em under the bus be sure to put a skid plate under
them to protect em.

good luck, keep us up to date on your success
