   Yeah, the dude in Roswell just opened up the cam half of the case.
Didn't deal with the shrapnel in the other half, hence the early
failure.

   Odd thing about Peter's temp sending unit. It's mounted in place of
the bypass valve screw. VDO sender and gauge, but I've never seen one
located there, just the usual dipstick or sump mount. Could this account
for high temp readings?

  Nice volks.

   Yes, they are. They stayed with us (and visited Austin by the big
ugly Bus - Greyhound) while their engine was fixed. Anybody on down the
road, they are a real nice couple, good company.
