The "idiot light" sender may be a dipstick temp sender from Gene Berg
Enterprizes. Look them up on the web. They are about 20$ if I recall.

> hi all...i'm lookin to invest in an oil temp guage, now that my 1500mile
west>midwest summer travels are gettin ready to happen. i read in the
library, the post about taken a digital candy/meat thermometer and riggin it
up to your dipstick. but i've yet to find a thermometer in my small town
that i can work with. i've also been reading through the archives, trying to
find a post that i had read several weeks ago. where the person had
mentioned a dipstick oil temp guage with an idiot warning light, that ran
around 20$. but i can't seem to find this post again.
> if you have any ideas on how i can go about gettin a cheap oil temp
reading, please share. i'd prefer not to spend the 50+$ for a HQ guage, but
i guess that's actually pretty cheap compared to over heating, somewhere
down the road.
