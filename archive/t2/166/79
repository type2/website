Subject: Parts for sale

Volks,

I am down to it on parts from the '79 I just stripped. I have two items I
want to  be rid of, both of which I wanted to keep, neither of which will
fit in my over-stuffed basement.

First, there is the transmission. I have no idea as to condition, but the
DPO was driving it until she froze the engine, so I believe it to be
functional.  There is nothing obviously wrong with it other than the bell
housing full of old oil (part of the dying engine)

Second, I have the '78-9 sliding side windows.  These windows are damn
near perfect.  The seals should be replaced, tho they are intact (I
pushed them out, didn't cut the seals) and present.  They will fit any bus
from '68-79 and are a great upgrade from rusty, leaky vent wings :-)

As usual, *I WILL NOT SHIP* I will deliver within reason (like 100 miles)
and if you can make an arrangement with a DC list member to have me
deliver and them to ship, that would be fine (Hey, X, Would you pick up
and ship the trans for me if I offered you $n would probably work :-)  I
will deliver to the bugout tomorrow, if we can amke arrangements or I am
<1 hour from Manassas, and have beer... you are welcome to come by on your
way home!

I will entertain reasonable offers for either of these items.  I think
the trans is worth $75-$100 and I think the windows are worth about the
same (for the pair), but will listen to offers.
