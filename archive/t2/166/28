In addition to what Karl says, let me add that all the headrests fit all
the seats You can put a green '78 Westy headrest on your beige basketweave
'73 seats, ferinstance... ugly as sin, but they will fit!  Also, I found
some '72 seats that had the tubes in the top of the seat framess for the
headrests, bu the vinyl had not been cut (and by the time I found them it
didn't have to be, as it was badly torn :-) so '72 seats *may* do you as a
base to add headrests to.  AFAIK, however, the headrests only started in
'73, so these frames may have been a replacement from a '73.
