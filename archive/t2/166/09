ABSOLUTELY find a male! It sucks, but it seems to be common to rip off a 
female 'cause they think they can.

Your other option would be an investment of a few hundred bucks in books 
and tools and do the repair work yourself.

You've got a wonderful resource in this list. Many of us didn't have the 
option of seeking guidance like this list can offer when we learned.

My wife put together our 2.0 Type IV engine for us after my lawnmower tried 
to eat me (and almost got too fingers). I only had one hand and spent the 
first few days with a friend called Percoset so I was pretty useless.

It takes some learning, alot of care, and some patience. But it can save 
you quite a bit of money and you'll be prepared in case it ever happens again.

The only thing you will need is alternative transportation for a short time.
