H.P.

The thing is, the flywheel, the bell housing, the starter, the pressure
plate, the clutch disc, the throwout bearing and throwout bearing arm all
work together as a system.  You can mix'n'match, but it requires way more
knowledge than I have.  What follows is strictly thoughts.  I have never
doen this and would not contemplate doing it.  What I would really do is
try to exchange the pressure plate for the correct one or write it off a
an expensive lesson.

As a strict thought experiment, if I were in your situation and committed
to keeping the pressure plate, my first experiment would be to replace the
throwout bearing with the throwout bearing that matches the pressure
plate.  I would be prepared to find that (a) the correct throwout bearing
for the pressure plate you have (requires/does not require) the support
tube that the bell housing you have (does not/does) have.  I would also be
prepared to find that the clips that hold the throwout bearing to the
support arms were changed and the new throwout bearing cannot be clipped
to the arms.  I know the first can be true, tho it may not make a
difference, you may be able to run a T/O bearing intended for a support
tub sithout one. I think the second cannot, I think all the arms are the
same, but *I AM GUESSING*!!! on both counts.

Oh, and once you get the pressure plate and throwout arm to engage... have
you tried to start your bus?  does the starter in the bell housing you
have meet the flywheel you have?  Most will, but some will not.  Before
you pull the engine, you might make sure that the starter/flywheel combo
are happy together.
