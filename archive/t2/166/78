Jim,

This is the classic "hot start problem"  over the 20+ years since
manufacture, bits of corrosion have built up in every connection, reducing
the voltage bit by bit until not enough is passing to "kick" the solenoid.
You  can go thru the whole starting circuit and clean every connection and
that will certainly help, but it takes a lot of time.  You can replace the
starter, and that will help (for a while) as new/rebuilt starters draw
less energy (for a while), btut that isn't cheap on a late model bus.  Or
you can do what many of us have done.... You can install a Bosch WR1
starter relay kit.  This will reduce the required voltage and let you use
your old starter for a whole lot longer (saves money) without cleaning all
the fiddly connections (and saves time :-).

Most if not all the list vendors carry this handy item and it is less than
$10 from any of them.  A quick search of Ron's site (www.busdepot.com)
turned up:

He's selling it for $7.95, about the normal price.  You might find it at a
FLAPS that handles Bosch parts as well.
