First of all, let me say thank you to those on the list, who's advice las=
t night helped me in getting things done that I would not have been able =
to do on my own.  That being said, on to the clutch.  Installed rebuilt d=
ual port engine with new clutch (new style) in 69 kombi.  Engine seemed t=
o pop right in.  Clutch does not engage until pedal is 3/4 of the way to =
the floor, and it is adjusted all the way.  Now, I did not use a new thro=
wout bearing, and I knew I should have.  Is this my problem?  Seems like =
the bearing does not press against the springs in the clutch until the le=
ver on the transmission is pulled toward the front of the bus about 2".  =
 I can move it by hand.   ??????Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer=
