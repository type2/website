Subject: Woe is me....

Well I dropped by Buggy World yesterday to arrange having Buster towed 
in. The guy asked me what was wrong with it. I explained how the starter 
went out and it was making a racket and the puttering sound it made 
before that when it was sorta running and he tells me I sucked a valve, 
mentioned something about the heads, showed me another buses engine he 
was working on and tells me yours is the same as this one. Then he kills 
me with "it will be about $4,000 to fix it".

I just thanked him and turned around and walked out. All that without 
even looking at it. So what do I do now? I can't tow the bus all over 
town, but unless I know for sure what's wrong I don't know if I can 
afford to even have it fixed. If it's that much I'll just have to sell 
him. The worst thing is, Buster is parked at my apartment building I 
moved out of 2 weeks ago and I can't bring him to my new place so I 
don't know what to do about it now.


Any suggestions oh wise ones?
