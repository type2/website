Andy,

You know you have way more experience with the '68-72 buses than I do, so
I would choose your answer.  Ockham's Razor for buses... choose the answer
from the more experienced person!

I did have problems of just this sort with Nikki's ?69?, tho.  She put in
an engine from a bug and the T/O would not engage.  Took the engine out,
put the flywheel, clutch and pressure plate from her old engine on and all
went well after that.

H.P. Luv/Bus Gypsy,

I would do as Andy says.... certainly if it saves you from an engine pull,
it's worth a try!  From your description, it does sound as if the T/O
bearing is engaging a bit.  Maybe with more pull, it will work fine.
