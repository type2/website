Subject: Re: [T2] Tyres a write off?

There is no safe repair for a hole in the sidewall. Only holes in the tread
area. Sorry to say, those tires are now non-repairable.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quick question for those who live in urban areas where people get their kicks
sticking things into the tyres of parked cars.

Last night my Camper had the two driver's side tyres punctured while it was
parked (looks like a screwdriver through the sidewalls, as it's less than 1/2"
long in either case), as the tyres are relatively new and good, and I REALLY
don't need to be out $400-500 at the moment to replace those tyres, I was
wondering whether it would be safe and/or practical to get the tyres patched
and/or tubed, and keep using them?

I wish I'd left the camper in the work carpark, and brought the T*y*t(-at-)
commuter car home, but I was supposed to be going away for the weekend, such
is life :o(

Any information as to whether 1 - 1.2 CM sidewall cuts can be safely patched,
or handled with tubes, would be greatly appreciated.

Thanking you in anticipation.

NB: It wasn't a VW hate crime, another guy who got done told me that the
police told him that the known figure was about 50 cars last night, over two
suburbs, with 20 in our street alone, I'd still love to get my hands on the
kids, though.
