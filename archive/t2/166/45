Subject: Re: [T2] clutch problem

I think you have achieved clutch-trans mismatch. Despite the bolt holding
the flywheel to the crank, it is really part of the transmission, not the
engine. Your flywheel, pressure plate, and clutch disc must match the
*transmission*!  Use the ones that came with it and you will have no
problems, use a mismatched set and you will.
