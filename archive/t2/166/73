Subject: Re: [T2] starter

	Sounds like the same problem I eliminated last Saturday.  Like you, I had 
the intermittent starting dilemna too.  MY solution was to have someone turn 
the key while I lay under the bus, smacking the (un)holy heck out of it with 
a sledge which I keep in the vehicle for this purpose.  Sounds like your 
local FLAPS-monkey was doing the same by slamming it around their test 
bench.  I ordered a New Bosch starter from Bus Depot and eliminated the 
supernatural element to my electrical.  The new starter turns over 
effortlessly compared to my previous version.  Well worth the cost for new.  
The tolerances in rebuilds(from retailers) tend to be lacking in accuracy.  
Either take it to be rebuilt by a local electrical expert, or buy a new one.

	My fiftieth of a dollar,
	Eron
