Subject: Weber Progressive Vacuum Hookup

HI,
I am considering ordering one of those progressive
setups from bus depot and I was wondering if they came
with the vacuum hookups for the distibutor and the
brakes. I am going o be installing it on my 74 to
replace the POS Dual Kadrons that are curently on it.
TIA
Tyler
