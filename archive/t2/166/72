Subject: 205T dizzy in!

The 009 is dead. Long live the 205T!

Well, sort of. The rebuilt 205T that I got from a list member was not 
rebuilt so well. It has the wrong vac can and the dog is 180d off. 
The vac plate will move only a little if one sucks on the hose. 
However, the 30pict will not even move it. I was a little miffed by 
this and decided the dig out the old 205T and put it in instead of 
going back to the 009.  The end result is the old ( have not used in 
a year and a bus or two ago) 205T is fantastic with the new 
doghouse/SP/30P setup.  I had really forgotten how nice it is to have 
the correct vac dizzy installed.

Thanks
