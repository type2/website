I am in the process of reinstalling the canvas on my 71 Westy and was =
wondering if the leather type seam on the bottom of the canvas goes =
directly under the metal strips and the screws go through the leather =
seam or does it go to the inside of those strips towards the interior of =
the bus, with the screws going through the canvas itself.  Any thoughts =
are appreciated
Steve
