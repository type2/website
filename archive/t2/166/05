Subject: Re: [T2] cheap oil temp guage?

Chris,
I found this in my search last week.  

http://www.geneberg.com/tempdipstickhtm.htm

If you do order from them, let me know your
experience, I am thinking of getting one myself.  I am
sure several others have ordered from them, maybe they
can relay any luck - good/bad with the product or the
company.  Best of Luck,
