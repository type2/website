Chris,

See http://www.lpgas.com/what.htm.  They say that depending on air temp,
the pressure in the tank is 15-230PSIG. Actually, at -44 degrees, the
pressure would be zero, but that would be unpleasant to achieve (BTDT :-)

Becasue tanks need to be certified, having a custom tank designed would be
horribly expensive.  You are probably better off finding a stock tank that
will fit the frame of the bus.

I am not too good at physics either, but I believe that the cylindrical
nature of most tanks is dictated by the need to hold pressure and I think
you will not find any tank with large flat areas.
