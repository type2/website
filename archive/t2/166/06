Digital thermostats found at Radio Shack or Walmart.
Some assembly required ( wire to front ).
The idiot dipstick sender is http://www.geneberg.com , $20.
Different length for T1 and T2.
No dash hack, it flashes the oil lite in your dash  and still
works for oil pressure ( lite on continuous ).

> hi all...i'm lookin to invest in an oil temp guage, now that my 1500mile
west>midwest summer travels are gettin ready to happen. i read in the library,
the post about taken a digital candy/meat thermometer and riggin it up to your
dipstick. but i've yet to find a thermometer in my small town that i can work
with. i've also been reading through the archives, trying to find a post that i
had read several weeks ago. where the person had mentioned a dipstick oil temp
guage with an idiot warning light, that ran around 20$. but i can't seem to find
this post again.
> if you have any ideas on how i can go about gettin a cheap oil temp reading,
please share. i'd prefer not to spend the 50+$ for a HQ guage, but i guess
that's actually pretty cheap compared to over heating, somewhere down the road.
