Subject: Re: seatbelts for kids in a bus

I keep thinking about this for when I get the 74 back on the road.  The set
up at the moment is the middle passenger uses a "Lap adapter" which fits
over the lap belt and is anchored to the rear shelf with an eye provided by
the rear hatch.  (needs a hole drilling). These are approved but I am still
concerned about the seat collapsing  This company seem to do a similar thing
with a 3 point belt.  .

Other things I have noticed. My old Passat (B3) had the seat belt reels
built into the very heavy rear seat back.  Mother-in-laws Ford had 3 lap &
diagonal belts with the middle one built into the seat back (and it folds).
My friends VW Sharan has the middle belt built into the roof.

I am also concerned with loose padding (i.e. the bed) on the seat in the
back
as passengers can skate under the belt in an accident.
