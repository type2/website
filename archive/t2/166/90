Subject: Re: [T2] Tyres a write off?

Neale,

I will absolutely back up Karl and Ray on this... I am sorry to say I
believe the tires to be a dead loss :-(  Since this seems to be my morning
for theoreticals, however.....

First, local law/insureance regs vary... some areas have an "unisured
motorists fund" from which you might collect.  Very geographically varied,
but at $500, it's worth a phone call or two.

Second, take them to a tire shop.  None of the three of us can actually
see your tires, and someone local may have a different opinion.  They will
probably just laugh at you, but again, with $500 on the line, I'd let a
tire guy laugh at me. :-)
