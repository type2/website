Hi Guys (gender non-specific, of course;^),

Quick question for those who live in urban areas where people get their =
kicks sticking things into the tyres of parked cars.

Last night my Camper had the two driver's side tyres punctured while it =
was parked (looks like a screwdriver through the sidewalls, as it's less =
than 1/2" long in either case), as the tyres are relatively new and =
good, and I REALLY don't need to be out $400-500 at the moment to =
replace those tyres, I was wondering whether it would be safe and/or =
practical to get the tyres patched and/or tubed, and keep using them?

I wish I'd left the camper in the work carpark, and brought the T*y*t(-at-) =
commuter car home, but I was supposed to be going away for the weekend, =
such is life :o(

Any information as to whether 1 - 1.2 CM sidewall cuts can be safely =
patched, or handled with tubes, would be greatly appreciated.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,

Neale
Sydney, Australia

NB: It wasn't a VW hate crime, another guy who got done told me that the =
police told him that the known figure was about 50 cars last night, over =
two suburbs, with 20 in our street alone, I'd still love to get my hands =
on the kids, though.
