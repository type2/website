Thanks for the suggestions guys. I got some names of other shops in the 
area (Corona, Ca-Inland Empire) from list members last week and I am 
going to try them this weekend. My insurance will cover the towing so 
that's not that big a deal. I have about $1,000 saved up to get him 
fixed and on the road so I hope I can find an honest mechanic.

I have a lead on a friends uncle who is a retired VW mechanic and fixes 
VW at home in his spare time. I'm gonna call him up. I think I will 
definitely have to get my uncle involved so there is a "man" asking the 
questions. That part sucks. Oh well.

Thanks for the help and I will keep you posted. I feel much better today 
though after hearing from all you guys.

And some day I will have the tools and the books and fix him myself 
(with lots of your help) but right now I just don't have anywhere to do 
it. I can't bring him home, I'm thinking of looking for a place I can 
rent to park him. Like some cow pasture or something. Then I can go 
there and work on him all I want. :)
