I wonder how closely the surface of the sump or case follows the
temperature of the oil inside.  It seems to me that one could epoxy a
thermocouple to the ourside of the main oil gallery and get the
temperature of the oil without punching any holes.

Failing that, the oil gallery plug that faces aft on the engine looks like
a prime candidate for a temperature sensor.  I wonder why I've never seen
one there.
