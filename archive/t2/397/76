Grace is cute, Cha.  From the front, she looks a lot like Giacomo (without
the rust).

I'm beginning to think that Giacomo is missing something else, too.  Almost
every bay that I've seen pictures of has those upright bumper guard things
on the front and back bumpers.  G has none, front or back.  There appear to
be marks where such appurtenances might have been at one time, but there's
nothing there now.

Thanks for the pics.  BTW, Alyssa's cute, too. :O)
