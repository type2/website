Subject: distributors and bus for sale

Having a 1600 t1 kombi, with a 009 when I bought it
leaves me ignorant (wide open for flames there hey!)
about the vac advance ones discussed.

I have looked at aircooled.net and various other
links.  I have soldered the butterfly in my carb,
jetted up etc and am fairly happy with how my bus
runs, but am not sure if the vacuum advance would be
worth the $$$ (being in Australia I pay double $us)  I
recognise there are many opinions and high cost
options with minimal actual improvement.  Slick 50 and
those various fuel cat/ionisors spring to mind, being
the snake oil sceptic am looking for mods I can do
myself ie making my own with the vacuum pot attached
to my 009.

I am open to all experiences.


Also, there is a later bay, looks like a deluxe, looks
in good nick at the Kelly car co in Brisbane $1999 au.
 No affil etc
