ok so now i am worried?
wondering now if it may be the starter....
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?

ok heres what happened....
i replaced the clutch disk,pressure plate,and also flywheel and seals....
put the engine back in and had everything marked...
i plugged all up and should of cranked but in the night after working on it for well over 12 hours i tightened the starter bolt for all the wireing down and it twisted up onto the plug wire closest to it....

when i put the cable on the battery it began to spark and i could hear wineing from the starter and clicking kinda...(only for a few seconds)

so last night when i seen what i had done i i untwisted the wire from the metal it was touching and hooked the battery back up now at full charge cause i charged it the night before...

no sparks but yet the starter wined at me only a little and it went click click click when I tried to start it by key...

i dont know enough about starters except that i had an old chevy silverado and i replaced the starter on it once and it sounded the same way so best theory i have come up with is that when the wires were touching (course i didnt burn it up it just went out)

I burnt my starter up??

so does that sound like the starter...
i know its a needle in the hey stack but to be honest with you all i am getting tired...worn slap out~!~!~!~
i have invested over 3 grand into a bus i cant seem to get past the stop sign and now i cant even get it to crank...

i have done the job right except for one crazy question...
is there a way that i could of tightened the flywheel and presure plate down to tight? surely not i would think...?
i mean i tightened them down but i am only but so strong and didnt want to get them at all air lock tight...
i think its like 8o lbs for the flywheel and like 18 lbs or so for the pressure plate..?

thanks for all yalls help i am just stumped to death here what to do...?
