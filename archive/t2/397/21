Subject: Dual Temp Sender Data

Hi,

Today I installed the dipstick sender in the 1600 SP that powers the 
'68 bus. I went to an electronics store and bought a SPDT switch so I 
could A/B between the sender in the sump plate and the dipstick 
sender. Posts in the archives suggested the sender in the dipstick 
position would provide higher readings than the readings from the 
sump plate. My experience supports those claims.

Running 55 to 60 mph with outside temps of 80 F  running 30w oil. The 
bus is a high top and has a less than respectable coefficient of drag 
:)

Dipstick 210 225 F
Sump      185 200 F
O/P        34ish PSI

Readings are approximate due to analog gauge.

Now, what to do with the data? 225F is not a happiest place 
considering conditions. Dwell and timing are right on the mark. I 
think the motor was 1/4 quart low on oil for the test run. I would be 
easier to swallow the reading from the sump plate ,however I plan to 
remove it because I still suspect it is restricting oil flow and need 
to remove in order to collect data on O/P.

So which if either sender is giving the correct data?

Is the disparity between the two sender locations consistent with 
others who have run dual senders?

Is the oil in the two locations at different temperature?

Does the sump sender get cooled by air passing under the bus?

Does the dipstick sender pick up heat from the engine? It is darn 
close to the heat riser and generator.

Discuss

Thanks
