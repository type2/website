Subject: Top swap?

I'm waiting on a guy in Idaho to send me pictures of the '71 he has
for sale and am thinking of getting it.  It sounds like its exactly
what I want.  My only question is regarding the top.  The '71 has the
smaller cot up top, right?  Any idea if the bigger bed/top can be
swapped onto the '71?
