Not exactly Rev,

Kombi means more specifically a vehicle with a vin# starting with the three numbers 23X, X being the last digit of the model year. 

Kombis became campers, for the most part, also ambulances, fire trucks, basic passenger busses (panel vans too?).

A 22X bus would be a vehicle destined for passenger service only, and likely a deluxe.

Has nothing to do with number of seats upfront, early bay kombis had benches too.

Has nothing to do with rear seats either. It's a body style, platform, etc., not an accessory designation

Later,

Billy
