I can vouch for the improvement the SVDA from aircooled.net can do. I
saw a decrease in cruising temp not a whole lot, but noticable. The
bigest improvement is that the acceleration is MUCH smoother. right
from an idle on up to top speed. I have been very happy with it. Can't
say whether or not it will be worth it for you, but I can give a
thumbs up.
