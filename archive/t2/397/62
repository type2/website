the auto tranny should not leak......

which "gasket" are you talking about???  the torque convertor seal is
about the only thing that gets changed on a regular basis, and I change
mine when ever the engine is out....the seals are (were) avaliable from
the bus depot for a couple bucks.

 the biggest "trick" with the seals is that you DON'T seat them but rather
they only go in until the front is flush with the housing.  they are BTW
rubber/metal seals but can be easily damaged and I have gotten bad ones
right out of the box so I always buy two and check em carefully for cracks
before installing them
