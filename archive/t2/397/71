Subject: VW Classic - Sunday June 8, 2003

	Friday Greetings!

	Just a quick reminder to all - The VW Classic (affectionately
redubbed The CW Vlasic by those of us at www.savethebays.org) is this Sunday
at the Verizon Amphitheater in Irvine, CA...  I'll not clutter the airwaves
with directions and details - just google it or something, you'll get the
hits you need!

	If you had any doubts about whether or not Bays were welcome, please
rest assured they most certainly ARE welcomed, and the numbers keep growing
every year...  We may be relegated to the back rows of the show, but we are
not intimidated in the least.  Come on out and swell the numbers, folks,
"they" can't ignore us forever!

	Mike Visket and I will be there handing out "Save The Bays" stickers
- hopefully our sticker printer will live up to his word and the New,
Improved STBs stickers will be on hand...  In case you can't find us, Mike
has a white '69 poptop Westy with a very cool Carefree of Colorado awning
pasted on to it, I'll be nearby with my Heinous Yellow (very special M-code
paint) '72 Westy Weekender, now featuring 2,260cc of ground-pounding Type 4
power...
