Hello,

That have a certain tool that is sold at finer auto
body finish stores made to remove runs in hardened
paint. It has been a while since I saw one but it has
a small blade in it which you use to cut the run mark
down to the level of the rest of the paint. It works
like a miniture hand plane. You then water sand and
buff. If you have a bad run and start sanding without
removing most of the run first, it is easy to sand
right through the paint. I don't know if it is worth
the trouble to try and locate one at your local auto
paint store or not. Either way, good luck!

Regards,

David Kelly
