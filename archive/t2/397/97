Subject: weber progressives

Hi,

My Solex 34's are dying fast - no.1 is actually dripping fuel - bad news.  Any
wisdom on a Weber 32/36 progresive kit - Volkspares sell them.  Could use with
either 009 or type 4 vacuum dizzy - have both!

Engine is 82, Type 25, 2.0l air cooled.

Don't really want to go for Weber 40's - hard to set up(?) and need a choke in
wet, cold UK.  Don't want speed, do want driveability and hill-climbing
power.

All advice, even conflicting advice, welcomed.

Thanks,

Dave, London Uk.
