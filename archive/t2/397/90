I believe it's the same oil that goes in the manual transmission. You need
to remove the drop arm and put on a new seal 211 415 273A.

The workshop manual says, "using a mirror, check the steering gear oil level
(with steering in full right lock position, steering roller shaft must be
covered in oil). Top up if necessary.
