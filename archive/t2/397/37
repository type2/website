I forgot one more solution--I've been using for years to the sometimes
run problem--
And it works every time.

If the run was pretty bad--and your almost down  the first coat of
paint--stop---

The solution?

I also pinstripe--well--

So if in fact I'm in a bind--the vehicle in question gets
pinstriped--and I make sure I come up with an ornate design--and run
them right through the run---

POOF---GONE-!!-----:>)

Now you know why Mack truck gave me the name--Crazy Terry---hence the
CT--
Every Mack got striped to the max--so they didn't know which ne had a
run--or not---:>)

I can see this working out real good on a Van or a Bus---
Later,
