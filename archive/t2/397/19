Subject: Passenger Ashtray

I just removed the passenger ashtray from it's position just behind the
driver's seat to clean it (first time in 26 years?!), and decided not to put
it back since I'm redoing the panels and won't need it there

It's part number 861-857-423 (diagram #090-00, part #32).

I cleaned it up with an orange-based cleaner, which worked fine, but the
textured front and top lip of the removable tray itself now has a bit of a
reddish brown patina to it.

It won't clean off, so I'm assuming that it's just the age of the plastic.

If I spray it with matte black enamel, will this reduce it's value to
someone who might be interested in buying/trading for it?
