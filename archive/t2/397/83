Subject: Fuel line to tank?  Fuel line size?

72 Westy with 1700 motor

The picture below shows my rubber fuel hose connection to my gas 
tank.  (Picture is looking up at the bottom of the tank from the 
ground.)

Q1. Is the rubber hose "just pressed" onto the fuel tank output?  Is 
this normal? Shouldn't there be some sort of clamp on it?

Q2. Does the metal hex nut on the fuel tank have anything to do with 
replacing the fuel hose ?

Currently my fuel setup looks like this:

Fuel Tank
Short Hose
Hose "T" splitter
   T1-Hose to Fuel Filter to former BN4 gas heater
   T2-Hose to Fuel pump
     Fuel Pump
      Hose to Fuel Filter
      Fuel Filter
      Hose to carburetor (single Weber)


After hearing all the fire stories, I want to replace my fuel lines 
and remove the "T" and old BN4 fuel line.

Q3. I've seem mixed information about where the fuel filter goes. 
Does it go before or after the fuel pump on a '72 type IV engine? 
(right now my filter is after the fuel pump).

Q4. Which is the correct hose to use on a '72?  5mm or 7mm ?
