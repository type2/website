Subject: [T2]found the problem "starter" [T2]

well I ask earlier what people thought it might be in my wireing problem.

Now see if this sounds right.....
i crawled under there and realized how dark it must of been and how tired i was when automatically i seen the biggest of the wires on the main bolt of the starter had a cut on the side of it and when i had tightened that bolt down the wire turned and the cut part in it was touching a small part of the metal for one (the closest of) the two wires that plug in there next to the big bolt.

well i fixed and tried the key.
sounds like now that the starter has seized up on me... 

it must have been what i thought was comeing from the left of me was actually comeing from down and to the right of me.....the wineing sound....

well i beat on the outside of it with a hammer a bit and one time i thought it was going to let loose....

so i pushed up my small driveway only a small incline at the least....
rolled it backwards and tried to jump it.......

then i read in the muir book about how to roll backwards in third without the key turned and to see if it would unlock the flywheel....?

didnt work but it did almost turn over ...louder and better than any other time tonight.
the starter not the engine.........~!~!~!~

so dont know what i am asking except does any of this sound right?
i will go ahead and replace the starter but i wont to make sure that for sure i know it is the starter.....

to me it sounds as if it is but then again i have only been working on this bus and my first bus about 2 strong months now........

from hearing a starter freeze up on my old 1980 chevrolet silverado is what it reminded me of......./


maybe i burned the bushings up or something when the wires touched and sparked???????????????????
Thanks and peace
