Subject: Air shocks on my bus

Hey Y'all,
I have been scouring the archives this morning looking
for info on rear shocks. Here's my deal: My 71 westy
has a very SLIGHT rear sag, not really a problem until
I load it up with a few hundred pounds of camping gear
and children, then it is a pretty noticeable sag and
the rear just feels "heavy" when driving it in these
conditions. Last summer I attempted a torsion bar
adjustment, the more I started unbolting stuff, the
more confused I got trying to follow the Bentley
directions for the procedure. I actually got one
torsion plate off and couldn't get it back on for
awhile, it finally went back on and only by a miracle
did it line up where I started with it. So, to avaoid
any further messing up, I quit. 
I was considering coil overs so I went to the archives
and found another option: Adjustable air shocks from
Napa part #MA758.
 If I could get a little lift that would be great, but
I am more concerned with the load-carrying aspect.
Whaddya think, will these help me out?
