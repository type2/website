Subject: Go pack your bus

Hi Volks Folks,
    Let me remind you to go pack your bus tonight for a weekend of
camping at the 3rd annual LiMBO on Long Island.  For those of you who
are procrastinators, and haven't given a thought to the up-coming
weekend, check out  http://arasso.tripod.com/limbo/ for the full
details.  Come one, come all, children bring your adults, enjoy Long
Island's east end.  What's that? You can't find time to spend the
whole weekend with us?  Well let me suggest that you show up Saturday
night, around dinner time, with your picnic basket and a chair to use
around the camp fire that is sure to follow the meal.
    See ya'll there !
