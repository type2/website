The Bentley and the Muir manuals are a must for the first timer. Although
the Muir manual is somewhat dated it gives a very easy to understand intro
into VW's. The type2 library is also a good place to browse through for good
info. on both year dating and engine ID. For online parts vendors I've had
good luck with BusDepot, GoWesty, and CIP1 for starters. There are a ton of
sites out there once you start looking.
