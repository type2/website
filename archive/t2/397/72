Subject: FS: 2 for Bonnaroo

Folks,

I was going to take my bus up to Bonnaroo in Manchester, TN next weekend for
a weekend of camping and music, but I think now that I will stay home and
fix the bus.

If you want to take your bus up there, I have a pair of tickets for face.
Pmail for details.  Atlanta area, will deliver.
