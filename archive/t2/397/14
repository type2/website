Subject: Re: [T2] porsche style  cooling fan

Another point to ponder for those considering the 911 cooling fan
arrangement is the fact that the Porsche 911 motor is a dry sump
arrangement.  There are 14.6 quarts of oil in the system of my old 911SC 3
liter, most of which is stored in a tank away from the engine and being
cooled by an external cooler.  Thermovalves keep the oil in the engine until
warm, but after that there is a lot of oil moving around being stored and
cooled away from the engine.  This management of the oil temperature by
remotely cooling and storing it suggests that the 911 motor is nearly as
much oil-cooled as it is air-cooled.
