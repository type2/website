Subject: Shift rod parts

I was looking over the replacement parts for the shift rod at bus boys site
(http://www.bus-boys.com/shifter79.html) and reading the excellent
article by Ron Van Ness (http://www.type2.com/rvanness/transmis.htm) but I'm
unclear on the number and type of nylon bushings involved. Bus boys seem to
have the descriptions mixed up when I compare to ETKA.

From 77 1/2 - 79 it seems three bushings instead of two were used to improve
shifter feel.

I believe one 211-711-179 bushing was used on the front and two 211-711-185B
bushing were used on the rear (middle and rear actually).

Can someone confirm this for me?

Also, could anyone who has removed the nosecone on the 091 transmission
pmail me. I have a few questions...
