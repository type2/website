Anthony--

Actually the run remover is nthing more than a small piece of a body
file held into a piece of nylon block ( 2" x 2" ) by a magnet--and the
file is reversable--

You have to wait until the paint is bone dry---and in a small bucket of
water--add copious amounts of Dawn dishwashing detergent--to make the
water really slippery--
Then in small circular motions run this small file over the run---lots
of water, lots of soap---and go real easy---

Sometimes it works--sometimes it doesn't--

I don't use it anymore, because sometimes it snags on the run and will
gouge the paint down to the primer---and it will not work on metallic
paint at all---
It'll leave a zebra stripe where you have removed the run--

I now use my palm DA with 1500, and 2000 paper on it---get it almost all
the way out---and then block the rest of it with 2000--
Finesse the area--and your done.
The finished product looks much better than shaving it out, with the run
remover--

This can be found at any better body shop supply store--

<< That have a certain tool that is sold at finer auto body finish
stores made to remove runs in hardened paint. It has been a while since
I saw one but it has a small blade in it which you use to cut the run
mark down to the level of the rest of the paint. It works like a
miniture hand plane. You then water sand and buff. If you have a bad run
and start sanding without removing most of the run first, it is easy to
sand right through the paint. I don't know if it is worth the trouble to
try and locate one at your local auto paint store or not. Either way,
good luck! 
If you can't find it locally, the Eastwood Company carries it.
