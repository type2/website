Subject: clutch cable clip - buy one when you buy new clutch cable

My clutch cable went "kaaa-snap-bang" while in Mexico.

I went and bought a new cable before taking out the old one and 
inspecting the other pieces of the clutch cable assembly.

After I took out the old cable, I noticed the clip (clevis pin?) was 
worn out too.  (The entire load of the cable transfers to this little 
clip each time you press the clutch pedal). Now I had to trek 20km 
back to the parts store to get a $2 clip and delay my travels by a 
day.  I wish the parts store clerk would have suggested that I buy 
the clip during my first visit.

Moral of the story, save yourself a hassle and buy the clip when you 
buy a clutch cable, you'll probably need it anyway.

Here's a photo of my worn clip:
