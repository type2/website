 Yeah, you're right.... Woodstock was in 1969. I believe the Bays came out in 1967?? (please correct me if I'm wrong).
 
 I actually have on LaserDisc, Jimmy Hendrick's entire Woodstock performance. 
 In the first 15 minutes of the disc (before they show Jimmy), they're showing scenes from the crowd, the field... etc. It shows naked hippies jumping around in a pond, and people smoking up. But I also see a LOT of bay-window busses. The majority of them of course are the previous gen busses (splitties), but I believe I counted 7 bay busses. There were also a lot of beetles as well, and a couple squarebacks. 
 
By the way, Holland is very cool, I've been there a few times. That's where my entire family on my dad's side is from.
