Something I've found when installing stereos in older cars is that the
wiring really isn't made for a modern stereo. So many things share
that one small positive wire from the alt that it gets overwhelmed.

Haven't had to do this on my bus, but one thing you may want to do is
run a dedicated wire from the battery or alternator with an inline
fuse to protect the circuit. This will remove the load from the fuse
block and help isolate the stereo from the rest of the bus.

This will be especially important if you move to more high powered
equipment, like an amp and sub.
