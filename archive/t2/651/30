No no!, the first modelyear is 1968, so they started
production in august 1967! It is the year with all
these one-year-only items such as the inner rear view
mirror and the door handles with push-knobs, instead
of the 'squeeze handles'.

So I guess they must have been all 1968 models. I
don't see how a 1969 model could be there in time,
there must be at least a month in between runing from
the assembly line to being delivered to the customer.
