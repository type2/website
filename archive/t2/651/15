I'm assuming that you have the correct 38A generator installed in your
bus.

to go to an alternator, you need:

Alternator

The round tin (3 pieces) that goes into the fan shroud for a bug
(alternator or 30A generator)

Fan hub from a beetle (alternator or 30A generator)

Alternator stand

Alternator style fuel pump and rod (you really don't need these, but you
can't get the tall fuel pump off if an alternator is there.

Some flat copper strip to bypass the voltage regulator (big wire to big
wire, small wire to small wire)

A few assorted connectors.

If you have a bug (30A) generator on your bus, you won't need the tin or
the fan hub.
