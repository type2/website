Subject: Who has the ID-plate in their bus?

Hi Everyone,

Once more I am seeking the help of the Type 2 list for
a question that might not be so important to keep
one's bus going...but which I find very interesting in
my research of 'what is original and what isn't?' :-)

I discovered previously that late baywindow buses for
the US (and Canadian?) market do not have the so
called 'chassis plate' (also known as 'ID-plate').

I am talking about the metal tag that is fixed on the
partition behind the passenger seat. It looks like
this:

I think the plate was dropped for North America in
'74, '75 or '76. To find out which year exactly I
would like to ask owners of a Baywindow from one of
these years if they would like to tell me:

- the year of your bus
- the month it was built (the VIN would be the best
reference)
- if it was first sold in Canada or the USA
- if the plate is there yes or no

Please send replies to my personal email addres:

I hope to hear from you. Your help is appreciated in
my (may be not so important) research.


yours,


Vincent
