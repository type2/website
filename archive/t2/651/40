Subject: Re: [T2] starting prob - no key...

Ok this totally makes sense. I just want to adjust valves and see if this 
puppy can run, then get it warm and check compression, then drop and work on 
for my Westy. I like it, seems I can totally get it to run for this with 
just some wire, then come back to this bus and give it an igintion later on.

Thanks, appreciate the help.
