I got that book from the local library an read it a few years ago... AMAZING. Written in the 50's and totally applicable to today!!! It seriously left me reconsidering any "need" I thought I had to have the newest gadget. I mean sound quality (for example) isn't improving as much as the formats are changing. Yes in a quiet room you might tell a difference, but walking around with music playing in your MP3 player is not going to sound much better than a cassette recording... 

For that reason I keep my mind OFF new cars and their trendy styles and gadgets. Honestly a VW bus will get you across the state just a easily as a new mini-van. Yeah the "features" list is shorter on the VW bus but stick with one car and you will save between $300K and $500K over a couple decades. I'd rather have money in the bank to spend... Of course I also lust after the audi A4 Avant 1.8T... It's tough...
