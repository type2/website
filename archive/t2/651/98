On this 71 Deluxe that I got this week, she had no key. I pulled a door 
handle off and took to locksmith and got a key for it, and that key works on 
 all locks, which is nifty, but not on the ignition (PO  said ignition was 
 same as door locks).

If they cut the key to the wafers in the lock, it will not work the ignition.
The ignition tumbler has one more wafer in it.
You have to have the key cut to the CODE on the paddle on the door handle.
Still got the handle off? The paddle is the straight arm screwed to the end of the 
tumbler. Look along the edge of it and you should see a number that looks like 
12R345 [but the numbers will be different] Have them cut a key to that code.
