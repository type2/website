Oops, you are (almost) correct. You got in a hurry and finished up by
saying the exact same (wrong) thing that I did after correcting my
model-year mistake.

The Buses at Woodstock would have been '68 *AND* '69 models built from
August 1st 1967 to July 31st 1968 ('68 models) and August 1st 1968 to July
31st 1969 ('69 models).

For a '70 model to have been in the states it would have to have been
pre-ordered and shipped from the factory on the first day of production
August 1st 1970. Transit by ship would have taken nearly 2 weeks to get it
delivered to the port in New York. 

New models shipped from overseas normally don't hit the US until
mid-September, about 6 weeks after start of production.
