Tony,

Same thing when "they" figured out that the same thing about refrigerators 
in the late 50's as well....I mean, how many ways can you make a box that 
makes things cold...

BTW, there is actually a person named "They" who lives in Missouri...he 
changed his name legally....NPR did a segment on him about a month ago and 
it was hilarious!

It is now proper English to say "They is here."..LOL!

TGIF!

Cheers, dave
