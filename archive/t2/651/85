That was a strange thing to come upon out in the middle of the desert. It is 
about 50 miles from the nearest town between Vale and Burns OR. on hwy20 
along the Malheur River. The story is that two fisherman broke down in their 
car at that spot. For some reason one of them threw a pair of his shoes into 
the tree, to dry them if I remember correctly. The shoes were forgotten and 
the tradition of passerbys leaving shoes in the tree was started.
