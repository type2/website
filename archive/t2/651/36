Subject: kmart + sears.

When the idea of K-mart selling Craftsman tools was circulated on the
list this past week, I assumed it was a call to absurdity. Yesterday, I
saw the headline about K-mart acquiring Sears. I find I'm a bit down 
about it, and maybe living in Dali painting, and wondering if the
persistence of the bays will make them run better.
