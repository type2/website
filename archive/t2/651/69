Let me restate the number... 

75ys - 16yrs = 59 years of driving. Assuming you spend $15K on the next car every 5 years that would be $177K. 

I put that number into an online savings calculator with no initial savings, depositing $250 per month ($15,000 divided by 60 months - that is 5 years) and the account earning 6.5% interest during the estimated 59 years of driving over a lifetime. 

Would you believe you save $1,960,049.61??? 

Frankly I'd like the have about 1/4 of that in a house (3K sq ft house, lots of land)... 

WOW...
