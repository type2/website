FWIW, try getting a copy of Vance Packard's "The Waste
Makers" for an interesting study of the growth of "model
years" particularly by American cars in the fifties and
sixties...There really was no reasonable excuse for mak-

engineering changes. It was a marketing strategy to make
last year's car look so, well, last  year... ;-(
