Subject: starting prob - no key...

Listees,

On this 71 Deluxe that I got this week, she had no key. I pulled a door 
handle off and took to locksmith and got a key for it, and that key works on 
all locks, which is nifty, but not on the ignition (PO  said ignition was 
same as door locks).

Look at bently for replacing the key thingy and it looks like more of a pain 
than I want to fool with at this point. I really just want to get the eninge 
running enough to do a compression test, then pull the engine/tranny and 
rebuild for my Westy.

Is it easier to give this bus an aftermarket igintion switch? Can I do that 
without pulling the steering wheel off, etc etc? What about powering the 
engine in the deluxe from my Westy, like I said just using the Deluxe for 
parts right now and will come and put it back together at a later date. Any 
ideas?

TIA!!

Daniel
