Subject: Re: [T2] kmart + sears.

They merged, and kmart is not taking over sears.. it's 
almost slightly the other way around.  That would suck if 
we lost our craftsman tools.. I use them all the time for 
my bus.  I love being able to carry around all the tools 
to rebuild my engine in my toolbox... such a nice feeling 
;)
