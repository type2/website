Subject: RE: [T2] KONI Shock Group Buy - NOW OPEN!

I wrote up an article about the Konis but realized that I didn't post it to the list. If you are wondering why these shocks are so good read on:

Unlike most brands, Konis had VW part numbers. They were optional equipment but like a lot of options the US dealers were poor at advertizing them to prospective bus buyers.

They are not aftermarket equipment like KYBs or many other brands. They have factory mounting specs and were designed for the bus to give better handling, better ride, better braking.
