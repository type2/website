Most of the people who went to Woodstock were ordinary middle-class 
kids from the suburbs, dressed up in bell-bottoms and tie-dyed shirts. 
I would have been one of them, but I declined an invitation from 
friends to go along with them. I doubted that many people would show 
up. Not the first time I was radically wrong about something, and 
experience tells me it won't be the last.
