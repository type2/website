Subject: start with no key

It's quite possible that the locksmith didn't make the key from the code, 
but from the lock itself.  If that's the case, there's a very good chance 
that it wouldn't work the ignition, because the door locks don't have all 
the wafers that the ignition has in most cases.  Find out if he did it from 
the code, which is stamped into the tailpiece of the lock.  Just something 
he probably did not know if he doesn't work on VW frequently.  E-mail if we 
can be of help.
