Subject: RE: [T2] Radio Install Question

Don is absolutely correct about the positive lead to the stereo.

Whenever I wire a system I ALWAYS run a dedicated wire from the battery for
the head unit and various accessories.  One should absolutely put an inline
fuse onboard.  The closer to the battery the better.  Remember that the
greater the length of the power lead, the greater the line resonance that
you will hear in your speakers as you accelerate/decelerate.  Try to keep
your breaks/connections/solders as few as possible.  Every time you break
the lead, you introduce resistance into the circuit, thus increasing the
background noise that you will hear in your high end.  One hurdle that every
sound system in every bus faces is that if the owner is using the vehicle
battery for power for his/her audio equipment, is the lengthy power lead
that runs from the very back of the bus to the very front of the bus.  The
closer the power source, the quieter the system.  It may indeed be a benefit
that there is so much background noise in a bus anyway, as it masks the
feedback from the lead length.  My two cents....

Call an audio shop and see if they have any old paper manuals laying in back
for your head units manufacturer.  Audio companies try to stay consistant,
at the very least with their own products, from model to model; unless of
course there is some radically new feature, then the whole playing field
changes.  Try calling your head units manufacturer if this doesn't work.
Most outfits could care less about the documentation....  adapters and
harnesses however are a vastly different story.
