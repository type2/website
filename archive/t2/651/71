I've been waiting for Friday to send this.

    In recent negotiations for influenza vaccine between a Canadian health
    official and an American representative, it was clear that there was a
      disconnection between the American government's sudden reliance on
Canada for
      influenza vaccine despite the fact that the U.S. wants to discourage
      Americans from buying routine prescription drugs from Canadian
pharmacies.

      Not seeing the irony in the request, the American continued to press for
      the vaccine and then demanded to know why the United States would be
      charged for the vaccine when Canadians get theirs "for free."

      The Canadian official replied, "Oh it's not free, the government pays
for it"

      "Well then," the American replied, "How much will it cost us?"

      The Canadian replied, "Well, we don't know...we'll let you know."

      In frustration, the American replied, "Well, it's urgent, so just send
an
      invoice with the shipment.

      By the way...how will the vaccine be delivered?"

       After careful consideration, the Canadian official replied, "By cow.
      Twenty vials of vaccine will be tied around the neck of every cow
      that passes over the border.   Now...if you want faster delivery,
      there are some  softwood lumber trucks available..."
