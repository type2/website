Subject: RE: [T2] KONI Shock Group Buy - NOW OPEN!

I'm thinking that the average VW Westy with substandard tires, substandard shocks and 200K miles of slop in the suspension and steering must be a VERY different beast from a zero-mile-just-got-back-from-visiting-1978-in-my-time-machine-and-I-bought-this-Westfalia... 

Terrible what a couple decades of previous-owners, 10 subscriptions to the VW-rag-mags and their flawed advice to buy everything that is chromed, and a whole buch of bandaid parts with do to a good VW.
