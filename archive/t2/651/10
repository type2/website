Here in The Netherlands Splitties and Baywindows have
also become terribly trendy over the years. You see
them quite frequently in commercials and magazine ads.
Promotion campaigns also used old buses to travell
through the country to advertise their product (mobile
phones, breakfast cereals, Bacardi, ...). There is a
'bus-dealer' here in the Netherlands who rents them to
these people (http://www.europeancollectables.nl/)
I have also seen Bays and splitties used by several TV
shows that used them to film on locations.

I have the Woodstock DVD and the intro shows the line
up of cars that wanted to enter the terrain. There are
lots of old Aircooled buses there, INCLUDING a few
early Bays!!! 
Those must have been rich hippies which such a new
van! ;-)

By the way: Wasn't Woodstock held in 1969?
