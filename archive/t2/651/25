Subject: Radio Install Question

I just received a radio from a listee for our bus (thank you!).  It's a
Mitsubishi J794 Digital AM/FM radio.  I need the help of the audiophiles on
the list.

He sent a pin-out diagram as well as the two connectors for the radio.  I'm
adapting the plugs to my old harness (removed from previous radio).  But I'm
not sure what to do with two wires.  I've identified all but "F" & "G" in
the list below:

A - Right Front Speaker (+) (2) White w/ Red Stripe Gray
B - Right Rear Speaker (+) Yellow w/ Red Stripe Purple
C - Do Not Use
D - Left Front Speaker (+) (2) White w/ Blue Stripe White
E - Left Rear Speaker (+) Yellow w/ Blue Stripe Green
---
F - Light Dimmer Wire
G - Headlight Illuminiation
---
H - +12 Volt Battery Wire Red w/ Black Stripe Yellow
I - +12 Volt Ignition Wire Blue Red
J - Left Rear Speaker (-) Gray w/ Blue Stripe Green w/ Black Stripe
K - Right Rear Speaker (-) Gray w/ Red Stripe Purple w/ Black Stripe
L - Power Antenna Turn On Blue
M - Left Front Speaker (-) (2) Black w/ Blue Stripe White w/ Black Stripe
N - Right Front Speaker (-) (2) Black w/ Black Stripe Gray w/ Black Stripe

I'm assuming that the "dimmer" wire (F) is the back light feature for the
radio, but I'm not entirely sure because the pin-out diagram above doesn't
show the wire color for that pin (the wire is black w/white stripe).  The
other, "headlight illuminiation" (G) has me completely stymied.  What the
heck is "illuminiation"?!  It's a green wire w/white stripe.

Would anyone help me out with this?  I've searched the 'Net, but cannot find
anything helpful.  Thanks!
