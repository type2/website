Subject: Oil strainer (not filter) for 76 bus

Hi All,

I've been wondering, since I can't find a photo of the
oil strainer in my Bently Manual for the 76+ 2000 ltr
with fuel injection... ...what does it look like?

I'm wondering, cause by what I see when I remove the
cover for the oil strainer is well, no sign of an oil
stainer!  The engine is newly rebuilt from Bus Depot
(AVI I think).  It's a great engine.  It's my first
2000 with FI (76 drive train).  Is the strainer
missing if it doesn't come right out when I remove the
cover?  Does anyone have drawings of the this engine
area so I see what it SHOULD look like? Or is it in
the Bently Manual and I've really just blind? LOL

Please help me here.  I don't want to drive around
blissfully unawre there's to oil strainer!!!


Thanks,

Rae
