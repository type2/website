Subject: Removing doors

Is there some trick to removing the doors on a 71 Bus?  I got a 6mm allen
wrench, and it had all the helpfulness of a parka in Florida.

Is there a special tool that gives the required amount of oomph to get the
rivets out of the hinges?  Not a lot of room there for a 4 inch anything.

Thanks much.

Mike
