Jack-
You have accidentally stumbled onto some
information relating to the installation of
a performance camshaft ( high lift / duration ).
There is considerably more.
However, if you intend to install a stock or
slightly modified cam, you may follow standard
procedure and assemble the engine without
modifying the push rods or rocker geometry.
If this is not the case, you may p-mail for
additional info. ( specify cam # ).
