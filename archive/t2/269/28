Subject: CARBS FOR 2000cc

Has anyone used a set of 34 Weber ICT on a 2000cc motor?  Any comments or
advice?  Also, on my solex dual carb setup, the intake manifolds have a
round gizmo on the side of each manifold, up near the carbs, looks like
maybe a vacuum connection of some sort, what are these for?
Thanks in advance!
Mark
