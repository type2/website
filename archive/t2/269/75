*****************************
80-83 Federal Air Cooled Vanagons originally had the "nub" for the EGR
Filter pipe attachment and was never welded up.  If memory serves however,
the 79 Federal Bus used a similar crossover pipe but does not fit the
Vanagon, correct placement of all the attachment points being slightly
different.  Bus to Bus, Vanagon to Vanagon, etc.

But, my late father always said "A big enough hammer, torch and
hacksaw......."  :-)
