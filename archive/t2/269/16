Only the 2L 914 ( 4 cyl.) has a 3-bolt intake. 1.7L/ 1.8L is 4 bolts.
( The 2L 914-6 ( 6 cyl.) has 6-bolt intake manifold bolts :)
The easy difference is in the engine case- The 914 dipstick is on top
next to the breather and the bus-type oil filler location is a closed
casting.
The fan housing is also closed at the dipstick and won't work for bus.
