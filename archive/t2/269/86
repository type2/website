I can second Jamie's opinion. My 79 dropped a seat, and I didn't know
it until after it was sitting for about 2 weeks. Made a 150 mile trip
back home from the NH show, but gave up the ghost in my driveway the
next time I started her up.

I had known for awhile that the #3 cly. was a little low (90#'s vs.
120 on the rest). I also noticed that she was starting harder, and
had a loss of power a few months before she started making expensive
noises :( There is a big hill on RT 95 coming into RI and I had to
downshift into 3rd (and pull into the "slow vehicle" lane). I never
had to do that before on that hill.

I checked the timing, it was ok, so I pulled the compression tester
out, since I suspected that #3 was the problem. (I've tested the
compression about every year on this van, 3 years total.)

You might not have a problem, but a compression test will let you
know where you stand, and give you an idea of what you'll be faced w/
in the future.

Hope this helps,
