Compression test might give you a hint, and a good thing to do anyways
on a prospective purchase...  

I was baffled in my '72 when I finally got around to a compression
check, 'cuz all 4 were coming out at 150, and the best you gonna get on
a stock bus engine is 135.  Finally I recalled that the PO said they'd
put a rebuilt porsche engine in it.  Made sense.
