I have been looking at the "Jalousie Windows for a Vanagon 
Article" at:

http://www.everybus.com/dworkin/vgon_jalousie/

and would like to undertake the project. But I have a few 
questions...

1) I am assuming that the 1 5/8 radiuses be cut in all four 
corners of both sides (inside and outside of the window) is 
this right?

2) Is there a reason why the 1 5/8 radiuses cannot be cut 
prior to assembly?

3) Couldn't the inside window stock be done from a 42 3/8" x 
16 11/16" with a hole cut, and similarly the outside window 
stock be done from a 42 3/8" x 16 3/4" with a hole cut (using 
the strip widths as a guide for the hole size). Having them 
one piece would increase materials cost, but wouldn't it be 
stronger?

4) Why is there a 1/16" inch difference between the height of 
the inside and outside window stock? Is it flush on the top 
or bottom and the 1/16" stick out on another side or is there 
an extra 1/32" on top and bottom? 

Thanks,
Chris
