Michael,

You don't need a 6mm allen *wrench*, you need a 6mm allen *socket*!  Alas,
I have not seen one in 1/2" drive or i'd'a bought it, but I do have a
1/2">3/8" adapter and the allen socket plus adapter on the Sears 24" long
1/2" drive flex bar will take the RIGHT off! :-)  Make sure the heads are
scrupulously clean before you start, becuase drilling out a stripped one
is a metric PITA.
