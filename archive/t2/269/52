Subject: Was 'Synthetic Oil; Now - Engine Diagnostics

Well, the saga continues. After getting severely low oil pressure readings
immediately after filling up with Mobil1 15w50, I changed back to Kendall
20w50. I did a compression test and tune up while I was in there.
Compression is 110 on #1 and 125 on the other three. The spark plugs all
looked good--light tan--maybe a little darker on 1 and 2. Now with the 20w50
in there the pressures have improved but still seem a little low. So far I
have only done a few 10 mile runs to work and back; hardly enough to warm it
up. Tomorrow night I'll be making a 100 mile run so I'll see what the
pressures do then.

Here's the stats: AVP rebuilt 1800 long block, built on an FI case (series
GE), bought by PO from AVP, installed by me. End play was in spec prior to
installation. Running a Weber 32/36 DFEV, NGK plugs, SVDA distributor. The
oil pressure guage is VDO with a dual sender attached via a flex hose.
Currently has 22,000 miles on it. This engine has performed flawlessly since
installation. My bus is my daily driver as well as my road trip vehicle and
has never let me down, not even on a three day 1200 mile trip in 90+ degree
weather.

Here's the question: What is low oil pressure a symptom of? Could it be
simply a failing oil pump?(please!?) Or am I looking at main bearings? Are
there any diagnostics I can perform *in situ* to figure out exactly what my
trouble is?

I guess I'll really find out this weekend since we're heading towards
Chattanooga this weekend, about 500 mile round trip with some real hills
involved.

Thanks in advance,
Dave,
