Don't give up hope on finding one.  The directional switch on our 71 Westy 
gave up the ghost.  (Same for 68 - 71 model years)  If available, I was 
getting quotes for it anywhere from $150 - $170.  Last week, my wife and I 
went on a quest for this holy grail.  We spent a day just hitting every 
junkyard and VW shop that we thought might have it.  In the afternoon, we 
found one.  The shop that had it just pulled it off a parts bus that they 
had in the back and sold it to us for $30.00!

"In Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias they had  warfare, terror, 
murder and bloodshed but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and 
the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love; they had five 
hundred years of democracy and peace and what did that produce? The cuckoo 
clock."   --- Orson Welles (Harry Lime's speech in "The Third Man.", 1949)
