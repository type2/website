Hi Charles:

This is identical to the 82 Vanagon Federal setup. I am in the process
of
cleaning the EGR valve and was thinking of just plugging the system up.
Until I
replace the crossover pipe, my EGR filter setup is out.

Other than a richer mixture, what steps can I take to avoid detonation
and
improve longevity? Is it necessary to readjust the dwell or can I live
with the
stock 47-50 degrees? Currently my fuel economy is terrible (hence why I
started
scrutinizing the whole FI system), what type of mpg does one get with
your
setup?

Lastly, if I retrofit my bus with the O2 sensor, new cat, but leave the
EGR
system plugged will I still have detonation and heat problems running at
1% CO?
Or would I need to have the EGR system working? Since I am currently
cleaning
out the air distributor, I know how much crap the EGR puts into the
engine.
