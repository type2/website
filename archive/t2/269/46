The strainer is behind the plate with the one bolt and is between the plate and the oil pickup tube.  This is the plate with the bolt that requires the magic 9 ft.lbs. of and not an inch more!

In my picture you can see a new strainer, two new gaskets, and a new aluminum crush washer.  The old crush washer is on the bolt to the right and the old gaskets (black) are in the background of the picture.

The other plate, as mentioned in the other reply, has two small 10mm bolts.  Nothing is behind this plate except a $6 O-ring. Although it can be used for inspection purposes this other plate is usually used as a mount for an oil temp sender (you have to shorten the length of the stock oil dipstick a little I'm told).
