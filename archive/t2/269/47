Hard to diagnose these things "over the internet."  If you've got the
ignition set dead on (timing) and are confident that the ignition system is
up to snuff then the next obvious place to look is the fuel system.  If the
van is still fuel injected then my *guess* is that the basic fuel/air
mixture is set too rich.  Symptoms of "too rich" can be: 1) Typically starts
up OK when cold, 2) Typically starts up *hard* when warm, 3) Lack of power,
poor idle.  A too rich situation can come from a variety of causes but
frequent culprits are faulty TempII sensor, leaking injectors, AFM spring
worn out.
