Listees:

Busdriver Dave was located by me in downtown Visalia today with a badly running bus and the traffic cop breathing down his neck.

We limped it to my house and I need your advice troubleshooting. I've got all the tools/books, but I need some wisdom.

Facts:

77 Deluxe Westy, T4 FI, appears original
Newly rebuilt engine by the local bugmonkeys for 18months/3k
Won't idle.
Distributor doesn't have a vacuum can on it.
Has an aftermarket ignition system

Questions:

What do I time it to? I have to find out the distributor's part number and go by that right?

Anyone got the correct dizzy for sale? Other options? 050?

What's the baseline idle air screw procedure? I read the Bentley adjustment, but where do you start at with an unknown bus?

Dave's trying to do right by this bus, he's put $5000 into it this year, and wants the knowledge to maintain it himself. I've steered him to the list, given him my old bentley and muir books. 

Won't you help?

Billy
