Daniel,


You always have to "stretch" them slightly before you put them on.

Bentley and every other vw manual I have ever seen tells you how and 
approx how long to make them....I usually use my long extension and a 
13mm socket to hold them inside while I *gently* stretch *both* ends about 
1/4" or so....don't forget to put the seam pointing to the top side of the 
engine!

Cheers, dave
