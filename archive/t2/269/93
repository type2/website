Subject: Re: [T2] fuel tank sender install was gauge won't go to 1/1

What is the best/easiest way to cut a hole for access to this sender?

A little Dremel style tool ?

I found an online documentation someone did showing where to cut at one 
point, but do not currently recall the location. (bookmark it next time!)

Just drive until you have almost no gas at all in the tank, then do your 
cutting? Is there a fire risk with cutting out this access hole just above 
the actual gas tank with gas still in it?

I would prefer not to go up in flames if I can help it.
