The sender comes off with a tap of a screwdriver, rotating it slightly.

Mine had a lot of road dust inside. Sometimes it's not pretty under the tank
because of the opening for the fuel lines:

This was recommended in the VW workshop manual probably because it resulted
in a low labor charge for the customer.  Doing it with the engine out is
really the best way.

I agree: it's only a place for small hands.  You can't see in there very
well and you need to be able to align it right to get a good seal with the
O-ring that is under the sender.  In fact, the O-ring that's there is
probably cracked from age.

Here's what an old sender can look like:

Eddie,

Since you are used to pulling engines, go that route and give your yourself
the most flexibility, literally, to get everything behind the firewall
perfect again.

I think either way, working with the engine in or pulling the engine to get
at the tank is going to take the same amount of time but you are dead right
about the aggravation part if you leave the engine in.
