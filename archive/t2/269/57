I'm even more confused. I hooked up a timing light
(plugging vacum line) and it showed that my timing was
at about 20-30 degrees BTDC! It's statically timed at
approx. 7.5 degrees.

When I tried to move it towards 10 degrees btdc, it
would stall.

The bus seems to run great, but this doesn't make any
sense. What am I doing wrong?
