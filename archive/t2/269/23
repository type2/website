Subject: problems with 68-70 directionals

Checked out Bus Depot, and they are no longer available.  I do have the old 
switch, and will do a V.I. in a few.  My wiring was all hacked to begin 
with, and in all fairness to them, they did a pretty good job with that 
part.  My ignition is aftermarket, and takes a key that looks like it goes 
to a padlock! The wiring on the new switch is very neat, and tidy though. If 
this is one of those, becoming obsolete parts, I think I would like to fix. 
Not to mention that it would look normal again.    BG
