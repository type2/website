Subject: paint job?

Not as if I have the money to do it now, not until it's running again 
at least, but I'm curious if I could get some ball park figures any or 
you might have on a paint job.  79 westy and I want it done inside and 
out, good quality or better (No MAACO paintjob for me).  I figured I'd 
ask you guys instead of calling around.
