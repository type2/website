Subject: Release Shaft Main Bushing?

Got 2 release shaft bushing replacements.  The bigger
of the 2 bushings on the left hand side that is next
to the clutch slave cylinder is a copper one piece
bushing whereas the replacement was a 2 piece plastic
bushing with an inner bushing and grease seals and an
outer bushing.  The plastic ones seemed to move pretty
easily so you can line up the holes with the
allignment screw, but the new copper bushing now in
there will not budge to line up with the allignment
screw.  Any ideas on how to make this thing move
around?  thanks
