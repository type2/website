Hey there Volks,

Thanks for the heads up on this. I've got a AVP rebuild that's going
in my 79 soon, and one of the things i had on my "when the engine is
out" list is to replace the fuel sender. I definitely compare the old
to the new one.

For those of you who have already swapped your fuel sender and the
guage isn't reading all the way to 1/1, you might want to check the
archives.

I seem to recall that someone posted awhile back that there is an
adjustment on the fuel guage (instr. panel end). I might be blowing
smoke, so *please* correct me if I'm wrong (Karl??).

Later...
