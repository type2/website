Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel gauge won't go to 1/1

I had similar problems when I replaced my fuel tank sender; the gauge
would max out at somewhere between 3/4 and 1/1 with a full tank.  After
all that monkeying around, though, I wasn't about to go back and try to
fine tune the system!

As I recall, the sender was simply a potentiometer (variable resistor).
As the float moves, the resistance reading changes.  To get a better
reading, you'd probably have to bend the float or somesuch, so that the
resistance reading at the sender matches what the gauge expects the "full"
resistance to be.  You may want to play around with the sender wire and a
potentiometer from Radio Shack.  Since I don't have the wiring diagram
in front of me, I'd guess that it works like this:

                               ^
                              /
 +12 ----  gauge --------/\/\/\/\-----+
                            /         |
                        (sender)    --+--
                                     ---
                                      -
By using another pot, you could determine what values that the gauge
expects for various readings (you'll need a multimeter).  Then, you could
test your sender and see if it produces those values.  If the sender does
produce those values, then it is a matter of tuning the float.  If the
sender does not produce those values, you may need to monkey with the
resistance by adding a series resistor or something (depends on the
situation).

If you're up for this, more power to ya!  I just left well enough alone
with mine and was glad that the gauge didn't drop to empty after I'd
burned through only half tank!
