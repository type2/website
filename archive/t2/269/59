Hello Michael,

This procedure can be quite a PITA if they strip! I
had to replace mine due to severe east coast rust. My
luck had it that one bolt on each hindge, on each door
striped. I ended up breaking off a couple of easy
outs. Finially, after going through 3 large drill
bits, My half brother was able to remove the heads
from the remaining bolts and remove the left over bolt
ends with an easy out. I guess the ideal situation to
remove them would be to use the correct socket with an
inpact wrench and penetrating oil. Any how, I wish you
better luck than I had!

Good Luck!
