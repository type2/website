It is really best to start out with a compression test,  this, "lost power and
stalling out", is the very symptom of a dropped valve seat. 

Make sure it is hot to test the compression,, cause a recently dropped seat can
hold tight when it is cold, and then pop loose when warmed up.

There is really no use in tuning up a pooched engine,,,
