Subject: fuel tank sender install was gauge won't go to 1/1

hello list.


Isn't it quite possible to install the fuel tank sender without dropping
the engine and pulling the tank? I remember someone telling me I could do
it [pull the tank] with fuel injection in place, but now i have dual 34
ICT webers
(with the short
manifolds) and it looks way more possible. The only thing I know that
doesn't work in my bus is the fuel gague. When i rebuilt the engine, i
replaced the gas
tank with one that had a better looking sender installed, but still didn't
work afterwards. I tested the gauge and it works fine...just another bum
sender. 

so how much of a PIA (and i imagine it is) to get that sucker out with the
gas tank in place? (im not making any holes!!). i know it can be done, but
sounds like a headche. Will it just be easier to wait until the next
engine pull and do it all at once? I don't mind keeping track of my
milage.... but it would be a super luxury to have a *real* working, fuel
gauge. 


i don't mind doing more work with less aggravation. I like working on my
bus. I don't like getting aggrivated. So I will take the maximum work with
minimum aggravation any day of the week.


pulling the tank with the engine in sounds like aggravation....especially
with a FI engine.....which im glad i no longer have <:-O   

thanks all
