Subject: Transmission Fluid change... When?

Hey Everyone,

Like I mentioned in other posts, I just picked up "Bess the Bus" (78') 
about 3 weeks ago.  The owner said he had not driven her in about 8 
months.  I came home and changed the oil right away and of course it was 
BLACK as midnight.  Should I now change the transmission fluid?  And while 
I am under there what other fluid should I change or check.  The Bentley 
manual says you don't need to change the transmission fluid in a post 75' 
engine, but that can't be right.

Any ideas?   Oh.. If I do change the transmission fluid, what kind is 
suggested.  I live in Roseville, Ca and the temps go from 50's in the 
winter to 105's in the summer.

Thanks in advance,

Don Manzano -Extremely excited new owner.
