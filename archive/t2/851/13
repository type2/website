Subject: Re: [T2] Mini skirts (3 beam balance)

I bought a 3 beam balance accurate to 0.1g about a year ago. Also bought a 
digital scale accurate to 1 g at the same time. Very inexpensive, made in 
China, and quality seems fine.

I was telling a guy in my shop class about the scale and he told me an 
interesting story:

Seems his brother had an outstanding traffic ticket. Cops came to his house 
with a warrant. He invited them inside where they noticed his 3 beam 
balance. They arrested him for drug paraphernalia possession, overnight in 
jail, bond posting, etc, etc. I forget all the details but I did go home and 
put the balance in a closet.

 I was just talking about a scale for home to weigh parts. Mailing off parts 
that are more closely matched in approximate weight rather than unknown 
weights would probably save a lot of time and money. For example the unknown 
piston that weighs 6g too much.

 Here's a few to consider:

 The Ohaus Scout 4000gx0.1g scale should do nicely, although one of those
 Sartorius analytical balances would certainly make you the Alpha Geek in
 the VW engine builder community.

 "Why yes, my pistons _are_ balanced to one microgram!"
