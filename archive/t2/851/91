Too late!

Your talking about vacuum problems and running a centrifugal only
distributor,
Power issues thru all the gears,

Stop now and get a proper vacuum advance distributor,
then you'll be eliminating variables.

I know, budgets, time, whatever, but you're not going to feel any love from
the group about "hitting the wall with a 009".

Good luck,

Billy
