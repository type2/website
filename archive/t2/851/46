Subject: Vanagon rotor differences

Hello list people,
I have a California model 1982 Vanagon Westy. I am confused about 
distributor rotor nos.  Some online vendors list rotors that fit "any 
stock VW from '59 onward" , usually the Bosch number 1 234 332 215/04 
033.  Others list the 1 234 332 300/04 038 rotor for all vanagons 
regardless of federal or Calif.   Bentley clearly shows a Calif. rotor 
is supposed to be 1000 ohms resistance, while federal is 4000 - 6000 
ohms, so there would have to be 2 different Vanagon rotors.

All this is probably mute for me as I am installing a CDI system and 
must remove the resistance from the rotor anyway.  But, is there a 
PHYSICAL interchangeability issue between these rotors?
The distributor is part no.039 905 205C.

Thanks,

GG
