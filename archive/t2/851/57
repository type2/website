Subject: FS: single wheel trailer $400.00

I'm selling the little 4x4 single wheel trailer that I used to haul 
things to festivals.  It looked great being behind the van, and always 
guaranteed a crowd around your bus.

I don't have a photo right now, but it is very similar to the one in 
this photo on Samba.

Mine is boxier. Here is a drawing of the trailer from the Sears catalog.

$400 and it's all yours.  Rebuilt last year, rewired, primed and 
painted.  Ready to be loaded into your truck. It's rather heavy, so 
bring help.
