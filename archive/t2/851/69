Subject: Re: [VB] Push rod tube seals on an upright engine

Hi John,

    The answer is yes and no. Several manufactures make a spring loaded
replacement tube, that head removal is not required. They are more for
emergencies where you hit something on or off the road, and need to get
home. I used to always carry a couple in my road tool box. Caution, I have
seen them leak, or maybe seep is a better description. Not flood, but seep.
    Of course to do it right and long term, you must remove the heads.
