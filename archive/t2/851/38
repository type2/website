Subject: Re: [T2] Brake drums

Gotta crawl thru a "dusty" folder in the cobwebs of my so-called mind, but
I vaguely remember from my days of "loose" association with the owner of Bus
Boys (circa 93 thru 97) when he was exploring various configurations for
rear disc brake kits.  If I remember correctly (and please someone do
correct me if I'm wrong,) the mounting holes of the Vanagon Bearing Housing
for the backing plate are reversed (upside down) from what the 71-79 Bus
is.  This would make a difference on how/where the hand brake cable would
enter if such a swap took place (and of course IF I'm correct).  I don't
have a late Bus handy to compare with my Westy, so I can only go by memory
(such as it is)

BTW:

ATE 24.0225-2001.2 = 71-79 Bus Rear Drum

ATE 24-0225-2002.2 = 80-91 Vanagon Rear Drum
