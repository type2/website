Subject: flapper covers needed

Hey folks, I am in need of both covers that go over
the little flaps where the heat exchangers meet the
fan shroud on a 72-79 bus.  I've got an ad on the
samba but have not gotten any responses.

If anyone can help, please pmail me.  I can pay in
rolled pennies, small unmarked bills, confederate
dollars, paypal, money order, etc., etc., etc.... 
many thanks!  Greg T.
