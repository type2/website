I'm wondering what happened to Winter in the South East?

Here in Charleston (SC) we've had maybe a day or two of sort-of cold  
weather since November, and the rest of the time it has been like  
Spring.

Konrad the Tiki Bus is actually in need of a good interior fan these  
last few weeks inside because of our 75+ degree weather. Today it  
will hit 80.

My roses have bloomed on and off again the whole time. They're so  
confused...

Man...where did Ol' Man Winter head off to?
