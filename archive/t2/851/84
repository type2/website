Subject: Re: [T2]How to Ship A hightop? (just roof part)

Hi Chai,

UPS is not going to touch something that big. You will need to hire a  
shipping company. It would probably be cheaper to drive your bus to  
the hightop and bring it back on top of the bus.... at least if it  
was within a reasonable range.


Happy trails,
