Subject: Re: [T2] Speakers in front kick panels:??

We mounted our speakers in the kick panels of 2 busses- in our Westy I 
put 5x7 ovals in the outbound bottom corners using thin wood panels I 
cut to fit (surface mount the speakers and then cover with grills) ; in 
the 75 bus, my daughter and I used the stock panels with 6" round 
speakers just left and right of the little cutouts for the heat vents. 
For the right speaker, the water tank was removed, flattened (heat it in 
a oven and flatten) and placed in the lower right corner.
I can supply pics; I think my daughter's site may show the front on her 
bus page link -http://www.geocities.com/the_fider
