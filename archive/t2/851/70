Chai,

    I know your in a bind, but I don't think I would. Reason being, as worn
as the arm must be, you would have to fully weld it in, not tack it. That
would burn up the plastic innards of the ball joint for sure. Maybe even
crystallize the "Ball", causing it to break.
    BTW, was your ball joint slotted? If so did you align the slot in the
housing up? The slot goes front to rear. If it was slotted and not aligned
properly, it will bind.
    Instead of paying to tow, weld, and take chances. Why not rent a cheap
car for a day or so. I think someone is sending parts to you.
    If this is so, would the person sending the parts please contact Chai
and let him know. If I am wrong please forgive me for sticking my big nose
in.

Howard
