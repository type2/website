It's because most of the rotors fit most of the distributors.

Right.

04033 has the 5kohm resistor under the black epoxy.
04038 has the 1kohm resistor AND the tip is much wider.

Either will fit.

You'll find that the 1kohm rotor will suffice when running CDI (at  
least it won't burn out quickly like the 5 kohm rotor will).

Removing all of the resistance will help but I can't say how much  
because it depends on the rest of your wiring, etc.

I was thinking of doing a group buy for 0 kohm rotors from Germany.  
Prices probably have changed since I last looked at them but $11 (inc  
ship) was the ballpark figure for a factory rotor vs. $30 + ship for  
one cut open to remove the original resistor.

Send me a pm and if enough people are interested I'll figure out the  
rest of the details.
