After meditating on the topic I find that I was inspired to destruct a
good used piston by following St Muir advice on filing it.

What the heck -- I just rebuild almost everything else on that engine,
why save on a piston/barrel set ?

Also piston ring clearances were borderline.

Again, thanks list for all the great input. Keep the fun up.
