Subject: [T2]tire broke inward this morning on me (update)

ok heres where i am finally....
   
  i need to know if i can still use this same arm if i have it tack welded?
   
  this is only a temp thing till i can find another bus or another front end.
   
  reason i ask is i was able to get the ball joint to pop back in with lots of effort of course into the arm again as it was before... now i know the arm has got to be really loose or else it would not have popped out. Si if i have it tack welded and of course i will have to have to towed just to have it tack wedled but can this be done.
   
  i mean all the other three are tack welded correct?
   
  If so then what i will do is when taken to have tack welded i will get all the others tapped up good again also if i can. that way its done....
   
  now again this will be temp until i can get another front end or another bus one.
   
  i am looking everyday and got wanted stuff everywhere and people looking for me.
  74-79 camper hopefully FI...... but the most part a front end.
   
  heres the pics
   
  this was not easy to get it all lined back up but i did it and it is not back in the arm again....

Chai,

1) The first thing I would do is move that jack stand to a more secure
position (in my humble opinion)lol.....
