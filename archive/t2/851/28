Subject: Closeout price on Mitutoyo 70th anniversary kit

http://www.penntoolco.com/catalog/products/products.cfm?categoryID=5788

Now $199, but was $319 a year ago when the kit was introduced. You cannot buy these tools separately for this price. PennTool has only 20 kits left and I think it's a good deal.

You can read all about Mitutoyo quality vs. the other brands at http://www.longislandindicator.com/

Disclaimer: please don't send me a pm via email telling me what you think of this tool's quality or price or what you think is a better deal (send it to the list if you must). I don't care which Chinese tools are worth getting, which are worth throwing away 10x and what they sell for at HF right now. This is just a note for to those interested in this particular tool.
