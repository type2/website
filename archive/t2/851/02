I've been to the Raby website many times. No doubt his sets the bar high with everything he does.

I was just talking about a scale for home to weigh parts. Mailing off parts that are more closely matched in approximate weight rather than unknown weights would probably save a lot of time and money. For example the unknown piston that weighs 6g too much.
