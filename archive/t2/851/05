Subject: RE: [T2] Valve cover gasket sealer?

I like to use a product designed for another aircooled powerplant - aviation 
gasket sealer.  It gets nice and tacky, and gasoline/oil will not weaken its 
hold.  Cleans off easily with brake cleaner.

Hylomar is also a great sealant for places where you need the gasket or seal 
to remain pliable.

What does everyone use on the valve cover side of the gasket. anything at 
all?
I was putting my covers back so I can go back in, and was wondering if 
anyone
used anything.  It didn't leak before, never been on the road yet, at least
from the valve covers.
