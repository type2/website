Subject: Re: [T2] o/t vanagon exhaust question

<<does anyone know if a 1.9 exhaust will fit a 2.1?>>

The head ports are the same, The engine configuration is the same, the
only thing is the exhaust tubes are a different configuration, and I
suppose it depends on what year Van you going to try and hack this
system into--
The hanger's are a for smaller diameter muffler---

There are pipe supports bolted to the bottom of the 2.1 engine too--
I don't think the 1.9 pipes will match these mounting area's--unless you
leave them free swinging under the Van.

What--you find some free 1.9 pipes and are going to try and bolt them up
to a 2.1???

Wow---
