Subject: Speakers in front kick panels:??

Someone on the list told me they had mounted round 6" speakers into their
front kick panels in their Bay westy, and I'd like to do the same, but damn me
if I can figure where you'd have the room. Does anyone have pics or a
suggestion where to put the speakers? I may have to go to surface mounts or
else cut the door panels.
Thanks,
Courtney
