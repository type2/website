Subject: EveryBus 2006 T-Shirts Pre Order Info

 Howdy. It's rolling up to EveryBus time again! One of the premier bus
 events on the East Coast, the dates this year are April 20-23, and you can
 find more information here:
 http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/
 Once again, I have the honor and privilege of doing the official EveryBus
 T-Shirts & Dash Plaques for the event. I am now taking pre-orders through
 March 17th, at which point I will place the order. If you pre-order, I can
 get different sizes, from Kids' Medium, up through Adult XXXL. I will have
 a small number of shirts onsite, but those will be mostly L and XL, and
 every year those sell out within the first half hour, so pre-ordering is
 definitely in everyone's best interest.
I have gotten a slightly better deal on the dash plaques this year, so
they will be a buck cheaper than last year. T-shirt prices are mostly the
same, although the prices on the larger sizes have gone up a little. Sorry
about that, but since I only do small quantities of shirts, the costs are
higher to me up front.
 All the prices, pictures, information, and artwork are here:

 If you have any questions, just drop me an email.
 I will also be printing up more Air Cooled Search & Rescue Team shirts, so
 if you want one of those, I can do that as well.
 Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you all there!
