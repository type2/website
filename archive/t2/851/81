Subject: [T2]How to Ship A hightop? (just roof part)

anyone got a idea before i get wrapped up with fed ex or ups on the phone about what a hightop is?
    how  would  I ship a hightop if i had to?
   
  i am guessing it could happen right? 
  people ship engines everyday right? and other large items....
  i dont think the top weighs all that but its big and bulky item.... how would that come out surely not on a regular truck but heck if it made it this far i could pick it up at the local ups office....
   
  just pondering.... 
   
  thanks
  chai
