Chai,

    I'll bet your in a little more relaxed mood now! :-) There's a good guy
on the other end of that part.
    Now the fun starts, the repair. We all enjoy working on our bus's right?
Just kidding.
    I saw in an earlier post that someone had sent you some instructions, so
you got that covered.
    I can give you a little tip on actually putting the control arm in the
beam. When that time comes, take some electrical tape, and with about a 1/2
an inch showing, rap the ends of the torsion leaves very tightly together.
This will make them much easier to feed into the square hole in the control
arm. The tape will push into the housing and stay there, doing no harm.
    Double check everything, lube the beam, get an alignment, and you should
be good.
    One other thing, Did you notice that small rust spot on the lower beam,
on the right by the mounting bracket. I noticed it in pictures #15 & #16. It
doesn't look like much, but now's the time to fix it, if it is rust.
    Looks like your nightmare is almost over.

Howard
