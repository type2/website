Subject: re: [T2] Speakers in front kick panels:??

Courtney, I put 5" speakers in the lower - outside corner of the kick 
panels.

I picked the size 5" because it was the cheapest set of small speakers I 
could find at Wal-Mart.  I would suggest that you spend some extra $$$ and 
get a better fitting and better quality set of speakers from any of the 
electronics stores.

(My speakers are like $10 a piece, but they do include the speaker grills ! 
! ! .  Cheap SONY radio & cheap speakers front and back.)

It  will be quite easy to upgrade, for me.  All I need is new kick panels ad 
I can cut new holes for new - smaller - better quality speakers.  I couldn't 
have this option if I cut into the front door panels!!.
