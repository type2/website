Subject: Re: [T2]How to Ship A hightop? (just roof part)

thats what i was afraid of .....
  i was wondering so incase i found one further out west like say cali LOL where they all seem to be either there or washington.....it seems....
   
  but ohh well yeah might have to take me a bus trip soon and get me one it looks like.. family getting bigger and bus getting smaller ;;; time to add a another story on....
   
  i guess i could tow it tied down to my little pull behind trailer...~!~ possibly...
  if i had a hard top i could strap it to the top but i got a penthouse top and well that might not work to well for a 15+hour drive....
  thanks

  Hi Chai,

UPS is not going to touch something that big. You will need to hire a 
shipping company. It would probably be cheaper to drive your bus to 
the hightop and bring it back on top of the bus.... at least if it 
was within a reasonable range.


Happy trails,
