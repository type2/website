Subject: Re: [T2] flapper covers needed

From Greg Thompson:

Hey folks, I am in need of both covers that go over
the little flaps where the heat exchangers meet the
fan shroud on a 72-79 bus.  I've got an ad on the
samba but have not gotten any responses.
 
If anyone can help, please pmail me.  I can pay in
rolled pennies, small unmarked bills, confederate
dollars, paypal, money order, etc., etc., etc.... 
many thanks!  Greg T.
