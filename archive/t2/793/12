Bosch told me they discontinued the 70A version on 9/23/99. What's  
been available have been rebuilds but since the internal parts are  
now NLA (which accounts for the high core charge) they are simply  
about to dry up.

This unit was also used by Porsche but unfortunately it was the 76  
912E and since P only made 2099 of them, those dudes are out of luck  
also.

PPR rebuilt units are available through IMC. PPR tells me they will  
stop rebuilding them very soon because of lack of parts.

PFI is another large remanufacturer. They offered me $128 w/ no core  
fee but I have no idea of the quality.
