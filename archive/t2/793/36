Subject: John Brown's Buses Update

Hello Everyone,
       I just got an email from Sharon Simpson, she has lined up someone to do T shirts for JBB, Steve, who did the shirts for Natural Bus this year. However, Sharon needs to know ASAP who wants shirts and what size(s). If you want a shirt, please email her ASAP at 
toby.gun(-at-)verizon.net
Also, don't forget to call the campground (KOA in Harper's Ferry) and reserve your site-don't forget to mention John Brown's Buses. 
One last thing, would someone please cross-post this to the Vanagon list and any other bus lists?   Thanks,   Jeff
