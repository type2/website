As teachers are often heard saying "A very good question!"

A pressure guage on the gallery side of the bypass valve would probably
give some information that you could interpret.  Another, more direct,
way is to modify the "big screw" valve cover to incorporate a switch
activated by the movement of the bypass valve.
