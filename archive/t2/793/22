Subject: Friend broken down in Grand Junction, CO

Any Type 2'ers who might be able to help out a friend of mine whose  
'69 Westy has broken down (possibly major engine trouble, although  
the jury is still out on that, IMO) in Grand Junction, CO?  He's  
driving from Oregon to North Carolina.  Please contact me off-list if  
so.

Thanks!
