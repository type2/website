Avoid 10w40 at all costs. Even most manufacturers now consider it inadequate
to lubricate under normal conditions.

I used straight 30w during the winter and was quite happy. The past month or
two I've been using Castrol 20w50 and it appears to be holding up nicely.
We'll find out what it's like this winter though. Being in Denver it gets
pretty cold *cough*snow*cough* so it'll be a good test.
