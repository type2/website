Subject: Re: [T2] H4 Headlights...best?

<<<Folks, 
Anyone seen the difference between the three different "values" that
bus-depot sells? 
Are the Bosch ones *really*, *really* worth it...especially considering
you have to order the bulbs separately? >>>



Dave,

I have a better deal on headlamps for your Bus.

Get in touch with Susquehanna motorsports in Pa.

Do a web search for them--they are the first listed at Google.

They are Hella distributor's .
Their prices can't be beat and are really nice folks to do business
with.
They'll get the lamps to you in a couple of days without paying the BD's
expedited service option.

I'd consider dropping a set of Hella H-4's  into your Bus.

I think they are called Vision Plus or Xtra Lights---

Great value, and you'll be able to see where your going at night.

Don't forget to put a set of relays into the Bus so the lamps get a
direct 12 volt charge, and you won't be frying any switches.
