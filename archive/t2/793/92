Tony,

LOL!  Since I never actually tried it on my older bay, I really don't know 
if it would work or not....maybe with the gas cap off or loose?

I just didn't want him to get started down the dark side path..bwhhaahaha

Especially since I never tried it!

oh, and when I had the gas tank from hell on my 78, I drove around in the 
field awhile with a 5 gallon tank taped to the back seat and the FI intake 
and return line hanging out the side door and taped down into the 5 gallon 
gas can....worked great!


On the other hand, the Click/Clack stumper one Saturday was howto start a 
vw(carbed bug) with a low battery that is parked in a valley where you 
can't push it.

No battery jumpers or new battery allowed.

Definitely had BTDT! and knew exactly how to do it.

Cheers, dave

    Oh, I don't know about that...When I was younger and more immortal,
 I drove my MGA home with a lawnmower gas tank taped to the antenna
 and gravity fed those ol' SU's...
