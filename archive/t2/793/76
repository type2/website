Duncan,

Welcome aboard,

> Deluxe Sundial US Import T2 at VanFest in the UK

Cool, my best friend in California also has a 1970 Sundial, and a 1966
Sundial.

> questions that may seem daft but what the hell!

Go to the archives for basics on maintenance, routines, basics.  Most topics
have been done to death here, and done well.  Also read through the library.

Many will say SAE30 or 40 for summer and 20w50 in cold weather.

> When I brake I get a dull clacking noise from the righthand rear wheel

If it makes noise when you brake only, and is consistent with wheel RPM's,
it's probably the wheel in question and probably something braking related.
Brakes are a good first system for a newbie to look at.  Get the Bentley
manual, replace your rubber brake hoses NOW!  Have a look at your shoes for
wear/evenness/replacement.

Valve adjustments and oil changes at 1500-3000 miles depending on your driving
style.

Window seals are push in/out.  Cab doors are glued in, knowwhatImean?

Yes to all, and grind off any heavy rusting before chemical application.

No, primer is pourous and will rust through.  At least rattle can it.

Big job.  Many say the factory coating holds up well and is difficult to
scrape off.
Folks in the US like POR-15 quite a bit.

Good luck,
