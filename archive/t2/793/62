Which part of the nose is actually beat up? Complete new panels are NLA for
the early bays. But if it's just the bottom section (a few inches above the
turn signals to the bottom) then that piece is still available according to
a couple websites. It's listed on BusDepot for fairly cheap. (Aren't they in
PA too? no shipping!)

If you need the whole thing then cutting up another bus is the only way to
go unless you know a metal worker with skills (check out metwiz's website
for a late bay to early bay nose conversion - http://www.metwiz.com/ and
click on Bay nose conversion on the left.)
