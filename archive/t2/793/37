From Valvoline:

"SAE 40 is SAE 40 no matter what the "W" prefix number is: 5W, 10W, 15W or 20W. The viscosity (-at-) 100 degrees C is within the minim of 12.5 cSt and a maximum of 16.3 cSt."
 
"SAE 50 is SAE 50 no matter what the "W" prefix number is: 5W, 10W, 15W or 25W. The viscosity (-at-) 100 degrees C is within the minimum of 16.3 cSt and a maximum of 21.9 cSt.

Interesting possibility: two different brands may have practically the same viscosity.

>or am i safe at sae 40 even though i think its what is causing my high temps on the hotter days maybe? oil is just to thin...possibly in my thoughts here.

SAE 40 is not recommended for sub-zero (Celcius) starting so the switch to a multi-grade would be beneficial given the cold temps you mention.

20W50 can be too thick for winter but it depends where you live. I personally would use Catrol GTX 15w40 over a 10w40. The smaller the difference between the two grades the better the oil's ability to keep from breaking down (so they say, depends on the engineering, etc).
