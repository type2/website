we all have our 2 cents.. here's mine.

I agree that the busses are worth what ever youre willing to pay.  I
found mine on eBay for a buy it now of 3100.. i took it.. paid
another 1300 to have it shipped from Oregon to Maryland and i love it.

It's solid as a rock, and was done pretty well.  there were some
obvious issues but it ran well and drove well too.

I also bought this 78 for 500
to use for parts and such, and its for sale for 500.  in great shape
but with no motor.  it just needs paint and some TLC.

I also have this 68 that i paid 500 for. this was the first purchase
in the series as you can see.  i got a better deal with the green one
for 500 than this one.  but this one is in great shape now too.

It really is a matter of what you can afford and what your willing to
pay for.

I just wish i had seen that fact before i boought the others.

someone please take away some of my busses.. lol
