Anton:

I have an older (78) westy, and the clear braided hose
comes from the tank/pump, as you said, and the other
hose comes directly from the "garden hose" style
fitting on the outside of the bus (in other words, the
outside fitting feeds the tap directly, it doesn't go
to the tank. Yours may conceivably be different, since
my faucet has a switch (for the pump) *and* a tap (for
the external water)

As for the propane, we're not allowed to fill tanks
ourselves here in California (thank goodness...) the
fill-up stations have trained staff that fill them for
you - just stand well back and leave them to it :-)

I believe you can also take your tank to an RV service
shop to get it checked for integrity, before you go
for the first fill

regards

Matthew
