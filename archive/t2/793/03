Faster,

never heard of that one...might check the rear nut to make sure it is 
not coming loose.

Sure it's the shaft rather than the pulley?

I recently had a "new" rebuilt one on a T1 engine that started making a 
lot of noise...turns out the keyway for the pulley was shot...didn't hurt 
the pulley, but sure did make the keyway look bad.

Cheers, dave
