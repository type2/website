Subject: 69 Bus No spark ?

Help,

69 bus, 1600 sp.

Ran fine, turned engine off after getting to work,
evening, no start.

Checklist run, no spark observed from HT wire from
coil to distributor when disconnected from rotor and
leaning against metal of distributor body while
cranking.

Replaced Coil with new one from autozone, I watched
the guy test the new coil and he says the new one
checks out.

New coil, same problem.  Verified that the ignition
wire (15) is getting power by holding against metal
distributor body with ignition on, sparking observed.

If the points/condensor are bad would not there still
be a spark observed from the HT while cranking ? 
Could I have got a bad coil from autozone ?

Help in what to check next !
