Subject: Re: [T2] 69 Bus No spark - Resolved !

Replaced points - Bus Fired Right up, no feeler gauge
at work, used a business card, sounds about right.

Tried to replace condensor, but I'll be d*** if I can
figure out how to get to that screw, found a right
angled screwdriver, but can't seem to get it.  Gave up
and just went with the points...whoohoo it worked !

When I get it home, I'll baby her and reset point gap
and figure out that condensor...

thanks for everyone's help
