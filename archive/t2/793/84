The oil viscosity does have something to do with cooling.  Thicker oil
doesn't pass through the oil cooler as readily, causing the bypass valve
to open and allow oil to go directly to the gallery.  This promotes faster
oil warmup, which is a good thing.  However, thicker oil will actually
cause the bypass valve to remain open to a higher temperature, which
might have a negative effect on cooling.

Is this an issue?  The only way to find out is to monitor the position of
the bypass valve.  If it is fully closed at 150F with SAE 50 oil then it
probably isn't, but if it is partially open at 250F with the same oil then
the oil might actually promote overheating by allowing the cooler to be
bypassed!
