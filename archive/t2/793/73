Bob,
   Here is a quick rundown of what I would check. 
   - First check for 12v to the coil. 
   - Visually check the operation of the points and adjust
     the point gap per spec.

if this all check out, you can try swapping out the HT wire to confirm
it's not just a bad wire, but I would bet money on the points, and yes
the points and condensor need to be in good shape to create any high
voltage spark (this is both from the HT wire from the coil and after
it goes through the rest of the ignition wire path). good luck.
