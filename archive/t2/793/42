That means you've got 12V on one side of the light powered by the battery and several volts less than that on the "ground" side of the bulb coming from D+ (blue wire) on the alternator. If you check D+ at the VR you'll probably see 1-2V or less.

This means that the output from the alternator that the voltage regulator sees is low. Possibilities include:

- bad regulator not reading B+ and powering DF correctly
- battery has become disconnected from alternator
- bad battery or alternator ground
- alternator brushes or slip-rings not making good contact 
- alternator had electrical failure (diodes/rotor/stator)
