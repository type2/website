The Bosch 0 301 600 118 H4s are the best made: best reflector, sealing, fit, paint, etc.

The Bosch units are superior to anything else (with perhaps the exception to its equal Cibie). The switch from sealed beam to Bosch H4 is especially stunning to witness.

Don't factor a cheap taiwanese/chinese bulb into your purchasing decision: they won't last anyway. Take a cheap bulb installed on a 2000 New Beetle: burns out in 2 years. The Japanese bulbs in my wife's 96 Acura are factory originals and it's a Canadian model with daytime running lights.

Two Sylvania H4s at Autozone cost $20/pair. Made in Germany! :-)
