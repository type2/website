No sir, 68 are one-year-only IF you still have the 68
only wiper mechanism.

How can you tell?  Look at the shafts sticking out the
body. If they are smooth, they are 68. If they are
splined with a threaded section, they are 69 and
later.

68 arms attach like 67 and back BUT the arms are not
straight on the end. They are longer and have a 45 deg
bend. 68 arms look like these:[the ad says 67-68 but
it is from the UK, 68 buses came out in 67 so they
probably think they are 67 bays when we in the US know
better:)]

69 up arms have a hole in the center for the nut to
hold them on. They look like these:

68 arms are very tough to find anymore. I have only
found 2 pairs in the past 7 years and sold them right
away. If you need them, the UK ones are including
postage......

  Can anyone tell me if the wiper arm for a 67 bus is
 the same as for the 68
 Type II.  Am looking for a pair.
