Subject: Re: 71 fuse panel layout

Is there anywhere on the net that I might find the fuse layout for my 71
delux? Specificly The #1 (far left) blows when ever I turn the lights on.
But the light do come on,Not the running lights though ,but that might be
bulbs right now. So just trying to figure whats going through the switch
thats grounding out.

Indeed there is: www.vintagebus.com

The early vehicle diagrams (such as the '71) have the wiring layout I like 
whereby everything is laid out approximately as seen from above. :)
