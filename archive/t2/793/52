Subject: 72 Westy non-pop top headliner

Hello,

I have a 1972 Westy non-pop top, but it's missing the headliner in the back. 
In the front cabin area it has the vinyl headliner.

Should it have wood in the back?

I have noticed other hard top Westy's with wood throughout. What is correct?


Thanks, Phil.
