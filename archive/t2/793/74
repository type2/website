Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Bus Front Suspension

Even with a broken spring leaf in my old front axle, the bus rode more
or less normal - just a little softer and lower. If a bump in the
driveway results in changes in ride height, I would first check for
rust. Good chance that the beam is rusted and flexes where the arms
attach. As strong as the spring is, I would doubt that lack of chassis
lube could introduce enough friction for the suspension to stay down.

After getting it running the other day we moved it up the driveway and
a dip in the driveway to the left caused the 
driver's side of the bus in the front to pitch down hard.  It seemed to
stay down until we hit a higher part of the drive and it seemed to "pop
back up".
