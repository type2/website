Subject: Re: Type 2 Beam Interchange 68-70

Scott,

I believe 68's and early 69's have the same smaller flange-to-body pattern.
The pattern changed to a wider flange at 1970. The 1970 Beam seems to be the
rarest, since it had no power brake booster plate, but had the wider 70-79
flange style. 71-79 are all disc brakes.

The 68 beam basically has the same bolt pattern as a Split window type bus.
That is why splittie guys and gals are always looking for 68 beams for
better steering and braking.

Cheers,
