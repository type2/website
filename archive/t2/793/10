I wrote up an article on the 70A version that explains what's different:

Local rebuilders will save you the shipping cost of acquiring your  
alternator and dealing with the core fee and shipping costs but I've  
found that you have to ask them specifically what they will test and  
replace. Sometimes they don't have the parts for your alternator. For  
example, say you need new slip rings and they don't have any?

One local shop uses NTN bearings from USA/Canada another uses  
Chinese. etc.

FYI,

- alternators don't come with the pulley or backing plate
- Bosch warranty is good
- Bus Depot's photo of the AL108X is wrong
- Autozone sells Bosch reman products
