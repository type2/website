I used to be a believer in the straight-weight HD-30 BUT I had problems 
with low oil pressure this summer (new rebuild, tight tolerances).  
granted, I was running at interstate speeds on the hottest days of the 
year (100-105 deg F / 38-40 deg C).  IMHO 20w50 is better all around. 
lower viscosity when cold, higher viscosity when hot.  conventional 
wisdom says that polymers they add to make it multi-weight is 
susceptible to breakdown over time, other folks say that modern oils are 
more durable--regardless I change my oil often particularly under such 
extreme conditions.

I blew out oil cooler seals on a frozen day in NJ with SAE 30.  I think 
I will stick with 20W50 this winter in Asheville, NC. .  I know nothing 
about synthetics--so I won't go there
