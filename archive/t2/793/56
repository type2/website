I believe the German part numbers for this alternator (Bosch  
043-903-023C) were:

1 100 900 000 (drive end)
1 120 905 090 (slip ring end)

Not 100% positive. Either way 6202 and 6203 are industry standard  
bearing numbers which makes them very easy to find. 2RS1 means the  
bearing has two nitrile rubber seals for protection. These values  
should be the bearing dimensions if these is any double:

6202 15x35x11 (id od width)
6203 17x40x12 (id od width)

Both are single row deep groove ball bearings.

I think so as well if you are setup with a few tools:

- motor/pulley setup to test it (or rely on trips to the local  
rebuilders)
- pulley/press/arbor to R&R bearings
- lathe to turn the slip rings
- inexpensive source of parts (hopefully not NLA)
- HD soldering iron
