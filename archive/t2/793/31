the piece of junk off the road old man" look anymore

It pays to have a thick hide! What I find the most galling is when someone 
desperately overtakes you and then settles in front slower than you were 
going. :)

I would suggest replacing all the ignition components if you don't know 
their history. While you're at it, check that the distributor vacuum and 
centrifugal advance mechanisms are functioning correctly. One or the other 
may be sticking occasionally.
