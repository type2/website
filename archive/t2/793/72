Bob,

Points??????  No points opening and closing, then no spark.

Verify points gap and condition of points....Don't wonder, takethem out 
and look...or leave them in and look.

Rotate engine while looking...does the rotor move? 

Don't touch anything else till you get spark....consider electronic 
points.

Cheers, dave
