Subject: 82 vanagon fuel filter

Installed a dark gray plastic (standard?) fuel filter and new connecting hoses
from the stash just before the Eureka Springs event, 4 weeks ago. Monday
morning my son noticed a fuel smell and found dripping gas. In removing the
gray filter and hoses today, I found that the outlet of the filter had
cracked, and came apart in my hands. Replaced with a white filter (made in
Israel) and hopeing for the best. just a heads up.
