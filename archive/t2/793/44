the VR you'll probably see >1-2V or less.

OK, just tested it -- it said .44V! 

>This means that the output from the alternator that the voltage

Any way to check this besides buying a new one?

>- battery has become disconnected from alternator
>- bad battery or alternator ground

Things look good there

>- alternator brushes or slip-rings not making good contact 
>- alternator had electrical failure (diodes/rotor/stator)

Ugh..
