Subject: New Bosch SVDA Dizzy - Okay for Type 4 Engine?

Dizzy Commentary and Question

I understand that Bosch no longer makes the 0231 178 009 centrifugal-advance
dizzy, which had the much-maligned flat spot in its advance curve, making it
not an ideal candidate for real-world street driving. Plus, it seems that the
009's maximum timing setting at 3600+ RPM was only about 32 degrees BTDC.

One reason that the 009 was so popular with VW shops over the years was that
they were ubiquitous - it seems that every other air-cooled Veedub on the road
had one. So it was easy to know what the timing should be when you saw a 009:
about 28-32 degrees BTDC (-at-) 3600+ RPM. They all used the same points,
condensor, rotor and cap; so VW shops and FLAPS stayed stocked up on the 009
parts. And the 009 was pretty cheap - usually $40 to $70 USD.

I saw a vacuum-advance distributor on www.BusDepot.com that looks promising as
a replacement/spare dizzy for my '79 FI bus. It's $129.95 and is touted there
as being the perfect replacement for all air-cooled VWs, from early Beetles
and Buses to Bays and Vanagons. I've heard that it's made or marketed by VW de
Mexico.

The current distributor on my bus, a Bosch 0231 168 005, is a
vacuum/centrifugal-advance model with a single vacuum line. The base timing
for this dizzy is 7.5 degrees BTDC at ~900 RPM. The maximum advance using this
dizzy is 40-42 degrees BTDC (-at-) 3600+ RPM, which seems designed to increase gas
mileage at cruising speeds. (I've been running a Pertronix Ignitor I in the
dizzy for the past ten years with no problems.)

Does anyone have experience using this Bosch SVDA distributor (VW # 043 905
205) on a Type 4 engine? What is the timing setting in degrees BTDC at 3600+
RPM? Will it advance far enough? Does it use the standard 01 011 points, 04
033 rotor, 03 010 cap, etc.? What is the Bosch part number? Is it a good
candidate for a one-size-fits-all distributor?
