Subject: oil light blinks...

I have an '81 aircooled vanagon, just rebuilt the engine over the 
summer, first car/ first time I've done much mucking about with 
engines...

Occasionally when driving, the oil light will blink on for a second or 
two.  Often associated with hard braking, and possibly more likely 
during the first 5-10 minutes of driving.  It doesn't flicker, though, 
and once it's winked at me once, it'll usually stay out from then on.  
I've been checking the oil religiously, and it's at or near the top 
mark.  I also have been letting her warm up for at least a full minute 
before driving.  I know the best answer here is to buy a proper oil 
pressure gauge, but I've already spent more on this baby than I 
actually have, and am down to comparing remaining available credit with 
next month's rent, so...

Is this something I should be panicking about, or is it likely 
something like oil sloshing to the front of the sump and an air-bubble 
being picked up by the pickup tube?  Or, is it likely to be the latter 
but still something I should panic about?

Thanks,

Anton.
