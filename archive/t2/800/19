I do a forced gravity bleed.

Make sure brake fluid reservoir is full and cap off.

Attach a small length of clear vinyl hose to the bleed screw and run
through a hole in the lid of a mason jar and then into the jar. Pour
enough new brake fluid into the jar to submerge the end of the hose.

Open bleed screw.

Press the brake pedal down to the floor, not too hard. Dont know if it
will blow off the vinyl hose. When you release the brake pedal, come
up slowly. Continue to do this keeping an eye on the reservoir and
topping it off. When you start getting clean fluid, close bleed screw and
move to next wheel.
