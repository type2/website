Subject: Re: [T2] timing?

You're right except that is 28-30 BTDC, not ATDC.
Consider ditching the 009 and getting a new SVDA distributor-this one

No opening can exist to allow hot air frombelow to come up above.Is your fanbelt adjusted just right?Do you have a Hoover bit to make the doghouse cooling system work properly?Cylinder bottom air deflectors?Flaps and thermostat system? If so is the spring on the rod to hold theflaps open? Thermostat adjusted properly?Got a digital camera and a website? You could take pics and people couldtell you if they see anything important missing. There are just tons of vw'sthat are missing lots of important cooling parts.Tom70 High RoofI've got a 1600DP engine with a 009 dist.  I've been told the timing issupposed to be 7.5 - 10 degrees BTDC or, at total advance should be 28-30degrees ATDC. Can someone tell me which if either is correct and what thecorrect setting should be.  This is a factory new engine and it is running alittle hotter than is should.Thanks in advance,Gail
