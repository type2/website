Subject: timing?

I've got a 1600DP engine with a 009 dist.  I've been told the timing is 
supposed to be 7.5 - 10 degrees BTDC or, at total advance should be 28-30 
degrees ATDC. Can someone tell me which if either is correct and what the 
correct setting should be.  This is a factory new engine and it is running a 
little hotter than is should.
Thanks in advance,
Gail
