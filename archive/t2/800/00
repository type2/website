Subject: Re: [T2] poly-pro gas tanks

We've made fuel tanks for kit-cars and hot rods. Makes it easy to adapt to the size you need. Don't forget the baffles and leak check it with something besides gasoline. CHEAP way to get a gas tank if you have access to a oxy-acetylene torch or MIG welder. In my opinion given the right tools it is easier to work with than plastic.
