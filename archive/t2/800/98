Subject: Stud, lower engine mount

I've got to replace my 2 lower engine mount studs.  2L , dual carb 
engine (probably a 78?) mounted to a 5 ribbed tranny.  The studs on it 
are too short and have to be replaced.  I can get M10 X 85mm studs or 10 
X 82mm studs.  The problem is I don't know how far into the engine case 
the studs screw, so I can't measure.  It looks like the 82mm studs will 
work but I don't want to order them and then have to get the longer 
ones.  Any help appreciated.
