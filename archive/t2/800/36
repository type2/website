Hi Gail. That's about right. The total advance figure is more
important than the idle figure. If it is hot, try 27 degrees. Also
check for lean running and correct oil.

 I've got a 1600DP engine with a 009 dist.  I've been told the timing is
 supposed to be 7.5 - 10 degrees BTDC or, at total advance should be 28-30
 degrees ATDC. Can someone tell me which if either is correct and what the
 correct setting should be.  This is a factory new engine and it is running a
 little hotter than is should.
 Thanks in advance,
 Gail
