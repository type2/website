Subject: Re: [T2] Stud, lower engine mount

i cant tell you the sizes but have had lots of experience changing those studs from the same year /s youre talking bout...
be careful not to get them to long or when you go to mount the tranny you wont be able to get the nut on it from the back of the tranny....screw it in more.........works for this....
 
i dont see why you cant get the long ones and screw them  in till they stop i think thats what i had to use was the long ones on my 76 bus 79 tranny....
screwed in all the way made umm right ... if you screw them in to far at least you can take a pair of vice grips and screw them back out some so the nut wil go on and everything goes together good...from under the bus i have had to do this....engine balancing above LOL...
 
the short ones are way to short though,.... you wont get the nut on them. you cant or i couldnt screw it out of the engine enough for hang to get the nut to work so replaced with longer studs.... 
peace

I've got to replace my 2 lower engine mount studs. 2L , dual carb 
engine (probably a 78?) mounted to a 5 ribbed tranny. The studs on it 
are too short and have to be replaced. I can get M10 X 85mm studs or 10 
X 82mm studs. The problem is I don't know how far into the engine case 
the studs screw, so I can't measure. It looks like the 82mm studs will 
work but I don't want to order them and then have to get the longer 
ones. Any help appreciated.
