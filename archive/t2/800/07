What grade are you using? I use 15w50 and I have no problems with hydraulics.

It would be best to talk with Boston Bob and get his advice since he built 
the engine and can do the detective work required to get you an answer. The 
armchair pundits on this list (myself included) and elsewhere won't be nearly as 
helpful as talking directly with Bob.
Mileage is 25 - 30 K (had abit of a speedo problem for awhile... not the 
suit).  That's estimate off the top of my head. 
When I used regular oil I just used 10w40.   The last 2 changes were mobil1 
10w30.
I will contact Boston Bob and ask.  
Thanks.
