Hello John  Have you ran a compression check??  What grade of gas??  Sounds 
like the CR is too high and you might need high grade gas .  Also does this 
motor still have the 914 fan on it  there are two timing marks on the 914  so it 
is possible that you are setting it at the advanced mark which I think is red  
the TDC mark will either be white or just a O  you really need to look for 
the O as it isnt very clear  I tend to take a white marker and mark it  later
