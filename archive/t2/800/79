Subject: Shop recommendation in seattle

I just moved to Seattle and would like some body work done on my 78
Westfalia. Can somebody recommend a good shop, the closer to Fremont the
better. 
I also need to hook up with a mechanic that can take care of some nagging
problems I can't do myself (i.e., front end work). Any recommended
mechanics?
