<What's the point of cutting the outside if its the inside that's holding
the window in?>

For me it was easier to allow the blade to follow the edge of the glass than it was to try to follow the edge of the steel that forms the window frame. Also easier near the bottom where the dash might be in the way. 

That said sometimes the glass is stuck to the rubber making me tense! Push, push, ooh-ooh-ooh here it goes - will it flex and crack or fall to the ground? So far so good with a whole bus of windows and a few more to boot. 

FWIW I think the windshield is most fragile end to end. That is difficult to flex top to bottom but easy to flex and crack by pushing on one end and not the other simultaneously. My wife Holly and I try to push the windshield out at the top with a helper on the outside to catch it. Let the bottom stick if it likes so it acts like a hinge. Don't rely on it, because it will let loose and you can drop the windshield. Our glass twisted surprisingly alot without cracking when we installed it a fraction of an inch too far towards the driver's side. Thankfully the lube allowed us to move it side to side just enough that it settled into the opening (had a hump on the top driver's side corner where it buldged the rubber weatherstripping out). 

I think we're going to buy a new glass to replace our old scratched original glass in the Cabrio. It really lights up with headlights on it (the pits and scratches light up). Been told it is one of the frequently overlooked but very welcomed improvement on an old car. Friends have told me that is easy to underestimate how worn the original glass is until you've got a new one in... $150 +/- is what I've heard unofficially. First the Cabrio, then the Westy.
