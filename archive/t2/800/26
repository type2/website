Subject: 81 Westy for sale - East Coast

I have an 81 Westy that sepnt it's entire life in the West, before I got it 5 years ago.  Has not seen Winter roads since.  The van is in Massachusetts and has no rust, except for the panel behind the driver's door.  I guess that from the water filler.  
Any way, the underneath is real clean, but the van has it share of dents and peeling paint. I have had it listed for $2,400 B/O, but perhaps I should say B/O. you can see pictures of it on the Limbobus.org classified section.
The engine is rebuilt, has new 3-window Sunbrella canvas, correct Yoko tires, fuel lines replaced, motors mounts, etc. etc.  I used Mahle pistons and Cyl on the re-build. Had a great shop set up the heads and crank with rods for me.  See ad.  I got an 87 Wolfsburg weekender Westy from a friend out west, hence this sale.  I'd love to keep it and get the body work done and paint it one of the New Beetle Oranage colors, but wife would not like 2 vans too much!
Anyway, despite the rusted one panel, finding a rust free van out east is hard, so I thought someone on the list might be interested. 
Happy Trails
John
