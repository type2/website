Agreed. It's just that "powder coating" is the correct answer to the 
question "what's the best way to protect my wheels?" It's not the 
answer to the question "what's the best way to restore my wheels?" if, 
by "restore," anyone in the conversation means what the whole rest of 
the vintage and classic automotive world means.

I'm not suggesting for an instant that we ought to go concours-fascist 
on this list. Not at all. A baywindow bus is an anomaly in the older 
car world. Unlike an early to middle 70's Mustang, or Corvette, or a 
Rabbit (!), a baywindow bus is just as useful today as it was when it 
rolled off the ship all those years ago (before a lot of people on this 
list, not me though, were born).

For that reason, we tend not to worry about restoring them, but instead 
on how to keep them running and how to improve them mildly.

The thing that confuses this even more is that we talk about the 
differences between "original" German parts and inferior Brazilian, 
Mexican, and other aftermarket parts. Most of the reason we talk that 
way is that when we buy a part, we want it to last a few tens of 
thousands of miles, not because we care a whole lot about 
"originality."

I was just noticing something odd about us, as a community, and not 
suggesting that we should change our ways too much.
