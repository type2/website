The limit depended on the manufacturing and what you set the static advance to.

It turns out to be a great replacement for a 76-78/79Fed FI bus. It also works well with other models.

021-905-205P is the VW number for Bosch 0 231 168 005. It's the stock distributor

No issues except for the fact that your are installing a T1 dizzy. All this means is that you'll have to reorient to rotor from where you think it should be because the vacuum can on beetle is in different location. The end result is that the mark on the dizzy body for #1 won't be point to #1 (it will point to another plug wire).

Set your timing to 7.5 BTDC as usual. I've actually graphed the distributor and posted teh results to the list:

Compare 205ZB (the Bus Depot unit) to 205P (factory stock unit).
