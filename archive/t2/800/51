Subject: Re: [T2] Wind Shield - Window Removal

Chris,

Cut it out with a razor knife new seals(non-deluxe) are a lot cheaper than 
a broken windshield.

Razor knife is used from the outside slid down into the area between the 
glass and rubber....cut all the way around and remove the seal part that 
you cut....then *gently* push outward from the inside as the rest of the 
seal lets go of  the glass.

Same procedure for other windows as well.

This is generally *well* coverd in the archives....always look there 
first!


You probably want a helper to take it out so you don't drop it.

Cheers, dave
