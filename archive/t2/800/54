Subject: [T2]age old question(OIL)

Wanted to thank each and everyone for there replies about my question.
I finally had time to sit down and read each and every one of them and do my own figuring from there.
In the end i think i am going to go with Castrol 10W40 for both the 76 bus(3000miles+filter) and the 68 beetle(1500miles).
I know i know this doesnt agree with some of you, but for my climate and from what i have ended up having time to look over this is what i came ot as a conclusion. I guess in the end i ended up sticking with the advice first given just my Brand(castrol) though.
 
Hope i ended up making the best decison once again thanks for all of your comments and replies.
 
peace

Peace,Love&Earth
