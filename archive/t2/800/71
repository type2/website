<<Hey Terry... What were the particulars on that $15K '78 Westy
Champagne Edition? Low miles? All original? Seats still wrapped in
plastic? German air still in the tires?>> 

It had low mile's ( 42K If I remember right)
always in a heated / AC garage, and it was absolutely astoundingly
perfect.

It had factory AC on it too, which functioned perfectly.

The interior still smelled like new.

It did have the original Deutschland air in the tire's still I'm sure.

It was something to behold and drool over.

Somebody bought a real nice Bus that's for sure.
