Anton,
What is the idle rpm? It seems to me that in the first 5-10 minutes, the
idle tends to be a bit lower than with a fully warmed-up engine - at least
with carbs, you likely have injection so it may not apply. With slower
engine rpm, less oil is pumped and maybe it turns the oil pressure light on.

I'd try increasing the idle rpm a tad and not brake hard before engine is
warm.

My bus does this also 1600 upright.
When I leave the house I usually start with a 1 mile downhill with a light
at the bottom. Then engine does not warm up since it is down hill. At the
light either the oil light flickers or the engine dies alltogether. With
warm engine none of the above happens
