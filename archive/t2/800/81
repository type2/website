Chris,

Your statement about "how worn" is absolutely true.

When I first rode in mine with a new windshield, I literally kept reaching 
out to touch it to make sure it was still there...a new non-pitted 
windshield is just fabulous!....as are *really* clean side windows.

Cheers, dave

 Been told it is one of the frequently overlooked but very welcomed improvement on an old car. 
Friends have told me that is easy to underestimate how worn the original glass 
is until you've got a new one in
