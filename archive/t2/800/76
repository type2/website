Yes, I suppose there is _room_ for the "show points" crowd. But where's 
the crowd? There just aren't a whole lot of people who want to trailer 
their baywindows to shows.

Here, the discussion tends to be whether to fix cv joints with new 
boots or baggies, and there are strong proponents of both sides. They 
both make good arguments, too.

I'm not sure what to call what we do with out buses. Rehabilitate? 
Refurbish (sounds kind of Brit)? I dunno.
