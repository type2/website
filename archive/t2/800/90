Subject: Re: [T2] Sandblasting cabinet

3 sheets of OSB(oriented strand board-"flakeboard")
makes a four foot cube, I lined it with 24 gauge
galavanized sheet metal from a local heating contractor's
free scrap pile (which was mostly full-size sheets:).
Definitely cheaper than any other metal supply source.
Only the floor panel has deteriorated, and easily replaced.
It's still not big enough to fit a bumper or a door in :(

Speaking of sandblasting, has anyone on list made a cabinet out of
plywood? If so, did you use some kind of sacrificial material on the
inside to withstand the blasted sand (other than the plywood itself, of
course)?
