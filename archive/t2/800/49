Subject: Wind Shield - Window Removal

Can anyone give me some direction on how I can remove my wind shield. I
have some nasty rust creeping out from under the seal that needs to be
taken care of. I'm not sure how to even approach the removal. Are there
some tools that make it easier? I also have some windows that need to be
removed (rust repair), is the process the same?



Any help would much appreciated!
