<Well, I generally think that's right. But that's why the prices of our 
buses are sort of stuck at $4000 at the high end. We don't play by "the 
rules."

Anyway, it's worth pointing out that on this list, "restore" means 
anything from careful sanding and original paint codes to duct tape. 
That, for better or for worse, sets us apart.>

Go to a Corvette show sometime or get friendly with a Corvette guy. Listen to them talk about the details - debates about the correct chassis paint gloss - or lack there of, picky, picky picky -ness about repalcement part details (not a question of function) and big prices on alot of reproduction parts because the quality has to be just so... 

Yeah, so far the VWs are considered "starter" cars new or old with the big time collectors I've met. 

I STILL think the VW Westfalia is one of the most interesting vintage vehicles on the road. Still quite usable too. 

I'd love to have the time and money to do a "museum quality" VW Westfalia but I want my driver to have certain details "improved" (my way).
