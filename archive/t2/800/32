<Most of the time the US family would import 
their big Buick Continental or Camaro, then whenever you parked it 
somewhere you had to pay the Spanish kids not to steal the hubcaps off of 
it. A bus was too common. By the end of the tour most of them bought 
Mercedes or BMWs and shipped them home instead.>

Exactly the same where I was in Naples. US spec cars that either got such poor gas mileage that it cost a month's income to fill the tank with gas ($5 a gallon back in '91), was too large to comfortably drive in Neapolitian traffic, couldn't be fixed reliably by the local mechanics (most cars then were still carb'd in Italy and unleaded fuel was a new thing), or you simply stood out so badly that every thief in town knew where you lived b/c of the US Spec car sitting in the driveway. Folks would sell them or park them and buy something older/cheaper/smaller, more frugal or simply more expendable than their imported Buick, Ford Escort, or Camaro. 

I gave up Ford Mustangs when I left the US in 1991, I haven't owned anything but Hondas and VWs since. Like someone said once upon a time - more frugal, and more clever than the domestic competition - which is getting better though...
