rubber lip from the inside with a friend supporting the glass from the out-
side, but I don't think I'd try it with the windshield. A new seal is 
probably
a best bet for the windshield. Slice the seal on the outside with a wide
freshly honed chisel and push the glass from the inside with a friend or
two on the outside...I'd sacrifice the seal rather than take the chance on
cracking the windshield... ;-(
