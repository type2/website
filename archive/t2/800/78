Larry,

Much easier(at least for me) because of the amount of pressure that has to 
be exerted to cut thru the rubber.  

Would you rather be wielding a razor knife on the outside of the window
or trying to keep it from slipping on the inside and leaving a 12" gash in 
your headliner or dash?

On the outside, I can hold it with both hands to guide it...on the inside( 
for a 6' 4" guy that is a little more difficult.

Cheers, dave

 you cut....then *gently* push outward from the inside as the rest of the
 seal lets go of  the glass.
