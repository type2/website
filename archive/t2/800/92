I don't know.  I'd say that it depends upon the driver and how the car is
driven.  My bus is stock, so I have no experience there, but my wife's
Scion has full salt-flat-style covers with only a ~1/16" gap around the
rim, hardly enough to vent the wheel.  I'd be concerned if she did a lot
of stop and go freeway or cut-and-thrust city driving, but with more
normal use of the brakes they don't get all that hot.  The covers don't
collect brake dust and are super easy to clean.

YMMV, George
