I always thought the positive and negatives of powdercoating wheels were:

+ durability
- the lug nut seat has to be powdercoat free
- when it's marred or chipped it's not as easy to make a repair that's unnoticeable
- the wheel alignment shop equipment chips them
- a rock can easily ding the edge of the rim when the powdercoat is weakest
- the tire machine damages it when you change the tires out
- cost

Having a set of wheels painted with a real paint gun instead of a spray can looks great.

Some powder coaters don't give you a lot of choice of wheel color either so be sure to look around. Also, the 16 rims for $40 powercoating estimate is such an incredible bargain I wonder if the same deal could be had years after that original cost? Either way rates, minimums and costs vary from city to city. There is no way I can even powdercoat one rim for $40 where I live.
