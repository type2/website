Well, I generally think that's right. But that's why the prices of our 
buses are sort of stuck at $4000 at the high end. We don't play by "the 
rules."

Anyway, it's worth pointing out that on this list, "restore" means 
anything from careful sanding and original paint codes to duct tape. 
That, for better or for worse, sets us apart.
