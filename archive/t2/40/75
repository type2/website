Subject: Re: [T2] lock adjustment

Steve Sandlin, very active on vanagon.com list, says
99% of the time it is NOT your lock.  It is your worn
key.  Lube is always good, but you may just need to
have a new key cut.  Get the codes of the handles as
was recently discussed.  Cut a new key prior to
assuming the tumblers are meessed up.  

Send questions to Steve, not me.  ssandlin(-at-)lcc.net  
I'm just parroting what he said on vanagon.com.  Steve
loves VW vans and is quite reasonably priced, I'm
told.
