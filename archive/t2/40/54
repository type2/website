<< olks:

In my quest to build a bus that will haul my Hobie, I'm leaning toward
the corvair engine conversion.  I'm looking for a complete/partial
Transvair engine conversion kit for my 71 Westy.  I've got a line on a
partial used kit, but will still need other parts.  If anyone has the
kit or pieces, please let me know.

Thanks.

Try Kennedy Engineering in California...Then look up the Fitch Phoenix
or the Yenko Stinger to see what the big boys did with those parts.
