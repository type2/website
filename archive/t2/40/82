Perhaps so.  In that case, replace "take" with "understand".

The presence of a rigid and lightweight wheel on the front of a bus will
do little but ensure that an additional object will intrude into the
passenger compartment if you hit something.  It doesn't provide crush
space (it doesn't crusb before the sheet metal), so it is relatively
useless.
