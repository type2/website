There is no real adjustment there.  It might be that you have a broken
spring on the latch assembly.  If you can close the door with the lock set
from the inside _without_ pulling the outside latch trigger and have the
door stay locked, you have the broken spring problem.
The broken spring also makes the door hard to unlock from the outside and
will eventually break the lock cylinder.

The fix is on the www.type2.com website.
