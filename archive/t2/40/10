Subject: SVD windscreen wiper/washer blades

Just a short posting to let you know about a Swedish product I have had on 
my 1973 VW Type 2, since the mid-1980s and which is now available by mail 
order, direct from the manufacturers.

The SVD wash/wiper blade has a hollow rubber filler (fed by a thin rubber 
tube), with small holes at about 2 or 3 inch intervals, so that water is 
delivered to the glass, along the leading edge.

They use very little water in comparison to standard washer jets and are 
completely unaffected by wind or vehicle speed. I thoroughly recommend this 
product!

For illustations and details in Swedish, see the following website:-

Prices are quoted in Swedish Kroner for complete kits and replacement rubber 
blade fillers. £1 Sterling = 1.4 US$ = 15 SwKr.

My Swedish friend from university originally bought some for me, at his 
local car accessory shop and more recently gets more by mail order before he 
visits me in Great Britain, if I need any.

Hopefully full details of this and other windscreen wiper & washer 
innovations and accessories, will be published by the British VW Type 2 
Owners' Club; either in the Technical Information Booklets or the bi-monthly 
club magazine, "Transporter Talk".

Look at the rear-window washers of the modern Mercedes Vito vans for another 
interesting washer system, which is almost identical to that forming my 1973 
VW Type 2, pantograph rear-window wiper & washer system.

Regards.
