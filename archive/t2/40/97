Gentlepersons-
                       I'm thinking of some modifications to my van. I'm sure
there's a wide range of backgrounds out there...Anyone into wood-
working to the extent of back issues of "Fine Woodworking" maga-
zine? I'm looking for the issue with details of "woodie" automobiles.
(I've checked the archives of the magazine website).
