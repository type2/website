Subject: turn signal indicator works only in one side

Hi all,

My 71 Westy blinks the right side of turn indicator in the guage even I make
left turn. So it blinks whenever I signal right AND left... I inspected the
wiring and the wire splits off of the right to left. So I switched so the
split off from left to right, but no blinking on either of them, but I could
still hear the flasher...

Does anyone know what is happening?

Thanks!
William
