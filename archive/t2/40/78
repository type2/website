Subject: dash crack fix

About 13 years ago when I got my '73 Westfalia, there were two cracks
starting in the dash.  One was at the top headed down, and the other went
from the lower left corner of the glovebox headed down.

Back then, to stop the crack I drilled a small hole at the end of the crack,
similar to what is done with metal, like aluminum and airplanes.

It did stop further growth, but of course didn't fix what had happened and
all this time I tried to think of a way to "fix" the damage.  I think I've
now found a pretty good fix.  It's the brush-on wire insulation in a can
stuff.  I got mine at Harbor Freight and it's black so it matches the dash.
It took a little finesse with the brush, and a couple coats because it sinks
into the crack, but it looks pretty good, and better than the crack.
