Ever notice that most flats are on the rear wheels?  The front tire stands
the nail/screw up just long enough for it to puncture the rear tire!  On
my street motorcycle I run a mudflap in front of the tire that just clears
the ground.  Knocks the nails aside.

Wow!  Sounds like it was driven by a carpenter!

My Bridgestones have been hole-free as well.  I think that the highway
tread might not hold nails as well as more aggressive treads.

Which is why I carry 2 spares while on the road.  The tires are hard to
find and I'm not going to get stuck with buying 195/75s again!  If you go
out to central Nevada, you'll see two spares in every pickup.  They don't
even bother to secure them since they go through tires so fast!
