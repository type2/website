My reply to Mike bounced so I'm gonna post it since it has bus 
content.

Mike,

The '77 trans *will* physically fit in a '75, but just barely.  
It is 1/2" longer and you end up using every bit of adjustment 
range in the mounts to make it fit.  You will also need the 
earlier bellhousing to attach to it as the later bellhousing adds 
another 1/2" that isn't there and requires a different starter if 
I recall.  So it's possible but not something I'd install in my 
bus for the long term.  I'm using a '75 tranny and will install 
a taller 4th gear if I need more highway speed.  Need more 
power first though.  :)

The gear ratios in a '77 tranny (or any 76-79) are exactly 6.25% 
taller in every gear than those in the '74-'75 tranny.  Should be 
fine in a passenger bus.  

-David
