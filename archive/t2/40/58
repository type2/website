A timely post, I was preparing one of my own.

What I have (that I do not need):

A rear (FIF) crossmember for a 1600 bus, which is a tubular bracket that
attaches to the stock bus mounts and goes under the rear of the Corvair
engine.

What I need (that I do not have):

Two sets (pairs) of CV-to-Ujoint adapters.
(this is the reason for posting to the list)

Shawn, where are you located?
