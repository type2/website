Hello All      The yard sell is still on for Nov 3rd   If anybody wants to 
come down the night before they are welcome to campout at David Woods ( Capt. 
USA)  house. I am trying to clear some of the buses, bugs, trucks, and parts. 
 David will be selling toys also.  There are 6 baywindows, 3 splitties, 2 
single split cabs, 10   bugs from 59 to 74, and a vanagon.  Over 20 years of 
parts, email me of anything you might be looking for.  Mark Dearing   Salem
