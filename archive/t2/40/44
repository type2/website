Subject: Re: [T2] 009 and GEX

You shouldn't have throw away the pertronix if you ever 
get a stock dizzy. I think they are the same for either 
kind. After a "knowledgable" parts guy had sold me on a 
009(which i will replace when funds allow),i got a 
compufire kit for xmas. Right on the side of the box it 
said it was for a vac adv dizzy. He assured me that it 
would work on mine, which it has for nearly 3 years.
