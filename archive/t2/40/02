What's all this brouhaha?

In my experience, the stock distributor allows one to stomp the accelerator 
from the starting line and get a gradual increase in speed (smooth 
acceleration) thus enabling the American mindset that more power is better -- 
speed rules.  The 009, however, requires the driver to finesse the 
accelerator pedal, listening and feeling for the powerplant response.  I have 
both types of distributors, and I'm currently running the 009 because the 
vacuum advance distributor isn't working just right right now.  Dunno what it 
is, probably a little much wobble in the shaft.  Hell, most any distributor 
older than 20 years surely shows wear and tear, and declining performance as 
a result.

Bone stock is fine, but compromise is necessary any more.

No worries.  No problems.
