Shouldn't be a problem, especially if you're a decent gas welder.  The more
lip you leave the less chance you'll have of warping the surrounding metal.
Don't try to do long beads without cooling.

Why not just bolt, rivet or braze it in?  You're going for function, not 100
point restoration, so any of these will give you a secure attachment.  Also,
most auto paint stores have panel adhesive that is as strong as welding for
overlap joints.

That's wierd.  are your surfaces clean?  Auto paint stores can sell you
scotch brite to go in a die grinder that will give you clean metal real
fast.  Why not use regular gas rod?  You shouldn't need any flux welding
steel sheet with gas.  Sounds like you're using arc rods.

Why don'y you braze it, which takes less heat, or rivet it or glue it (panel
adhesive) which take no heat?
