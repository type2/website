Before you do this, consider that it is a sure-fire way to damage the
front sheet metal.  Other drivers think that the tire is a nice soft
bumper and act accordingly.  Unfortunately, the metal underneath is even
softer than the tire and will get pushed in.

When I bought my bus, the previous owner threw in a brand new tire mount
that he never got time to install.  Thank goodness for small favors!

In the Idiot Book, Muir says that the spare in front is good crash
protection.  Muir obviously didn't take physics.
