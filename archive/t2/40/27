The insulation foam on the inside of the vent flapper door has
deteriorated ...What sort of material are you folks replacing this with?

You need about 1/4" thick urethane foam. I bought a pair of cheap 3-4"
wide foam paint brushes. Disassembling one of these gives you a piece of
foam big enough to glue on the vent flapper, which is easy to remove from
the air channel. Then trim around the edge to make a good fit, but leave a
little extra around the edges to make the seal. Don't overtrim as I did
the first time: you'll just have to do it over.

This foam may be available on its own somewhere, but these foam
paintbrushes are ubiquitous at hardware stores and are quite cheap.

Good luck,
