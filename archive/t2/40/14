Subject: pic of seatbelt L-bracket?


Greetings all.  Not too long ago there was a thread on adding
retractable seatbelts to a Bay.  Many wrote that installation is
straightforward when using a fabricated L-bracket to bolt the spool to
the floor.  Someone requested a pic of the said bracket; is this
somewhere out there in Internet-land?

Many thanks
-Roger
