Subject: lock adjustment

Hey folks -- I'm trying to get the locks adjusted on
my 71 bus (Westy interior but no pop-top), and it's
driving me nuts!  I can't get the front doors (driver
& passenger) to unlock with the key.  Any ideas on
adjustments?  It's like the little device on the end
of the tumber doesn't turn far enough to unlock the
door to open it from the outside.  I have tried
lubricating the tumber and have looked for adjusters
with no luck.  Is this common on these beasts?  

I'm also having a hard time getting the little manual
lock on the inside of the sliding door to lock.  I've
heard this is common.  Any remedies?

I also need to adjust the front doors and sliding door
to close tighter.  I know there's a section in the
Bentley and one in the Haynes about this, but are
there any extra tips anyone can think of before I tear
into the doors?


Many thanks!
