 Bob,
I don't want to alarm you, but hit a cow at any speed, with or without
that spare tire on the nose of whatever, and the result will be the big
hurt !!
Perhaps that spare prevented that moo-cow from laying in your lap, at
impact !!! 

Bad Boo-Boo on the nose of your bus !!:>(   
 
 Bob Writes;

Ouch! Tell me about it! See the following links to get a look at what
happened to my old '79 Westy (the frog bus) when we hit a cow going
around 20mph, decelerating rapidly from about 45mph. The cow pushed the
tire into the nose like big sledge. The tire and mount sheared off and
rolled 100 yards down an arroyo. Bus on its side. I will never know what
might have happened if we'd had the same accident with no tire, but the
impact would have been spread out over 2 or 3x the nose area and maybe
we would have been able to drive away from it. Maybe. Certainly would
still have lost the windshield. As it was, the vehicle was totalled
(partly by virtue of the accident happening in Baja CA) and my friend in
the passenger seat got his knuckles scuffed by the incoming sheet metal.
Metal stopped 1/2" short of the driver's knuckles. 
Seems to me that the air filled rubber tire part is not rigid and might
have some elastic, crash absorbing properties. The rim certainly does
not. You can see all the good it did us though. 
Here's just the the picture:

Drive safely and watch out for cows!
