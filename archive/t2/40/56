Subject: front bench seat conversion

Hi,

There was some talk on the list in the past few months about a 
dealership installed kit that would turn a walk through(two front 
seats on pedestals into a three passenger front bench. The kit 
consisted of a filler pedestal, filler bulkhead with matching 
bulkhead interior panel, and the seat and seat back.

Does anyone have a picture of this setup in their bus or know of 
picture on the web? Does anyone have this setup that they would like 
to sell of know of one in a junked bus that could be salvaged?

Thanks
Chris
