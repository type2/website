Hi John Here
I am sorry to say but the best way to fix the locking mechanisms is to just 
pop the panels out and see what's hanging everything up.  It is a lot easier 
in the long run 
because from the inside you can lube the rod that connects the handle to the 
lock and also the rod that goes up to the button. My 68 had the same problem 
and got worse when the weather took a turn for the worse. I had to go through 
the back door
when it went below 10 degrees.  The friggin side door wouldn't work either. I 
was able to fix the front doors, but till this day the inside lock on my side 
door still doesn't work.  I have had it apart and it is something internal 
with the lock itself. The lock cannot be disassembled without special 
locksmiths tools.
