Hi John Here
I have nothing against modifications.  Just that sometimes they bite the hand 
that feeds them. I went airborne on the Delaware Memorial Bridge back in the 
80s.
My 68 bus had a 1776 with all the trimmings and a Judson Supercharger.
Damn thing nearly killed me. I like my feet on the ground thank you very much.
Add some weight to your bus. Also try lowering the old girl that might work. 
                             Good Luck God Speed and Keep her between the 
lines.
