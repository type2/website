...of course,  the chances of that screw staying on its head when you come
near it at 60 mph are pretty slim, i'd say....but if the screw it lucky
i'd still find a way in.

As for personal experence, I patched the S rated tires on the quantum
roughly 10 times...well, plugged, actually, in a little over a year since
new. (of course, that was 50 thousand miles ago, too...and the new set is
so far hole free..).

Fingers crossed, I've never had to plug any of the load D tires I've
owned. (three? sets of Y370s...even when they were down to nothing more
then a slick, and the bridgestoners that are on the 66
now.)

No real changes in driving conditions, at least between the 66 and the
quantum.  The tire-eating-monster '69..well.  She saw a LOT of extreme
terrain.

(the BSs are...umm. two+? years old now i think? at least?)
