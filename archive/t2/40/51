Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild wont start! any ideas?

well, almost everyone is asking me to double check that the ignition is set up correctly, the timing, and redo the valves... i'm away for the weekend so i'll try those when i get back... one question:

now i'm second guessing myself as to the cylinder locations...

so if i'm standing at the back of the car, looking in to the engine compartment... "back" is close to me (toward the rear of the van) front is furthest from me (toward the front of the van)...that makes number one right side front, number 2 right side rear, number 3 left side front (which is confusing cause i read muir when i first started learning vans and doesn' he harp on number 3 being next to the oil cooler? or is that in bug / uprights?) and number four left side rear...

and then the distributor turns clockwise (looking down on the rotor) and the firing order is 1-4-3-2

oh yeah reminder - 75 1.8L FI solid lifters

right?

bill
