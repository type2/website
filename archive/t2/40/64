Subject: Re; front mounted tires

A friend of ours was hit in the front of her 69 Bus by a car running a red
light from her right to the left--Her front monted spare tire landed some
110'+ away--The Police at the site said the front mounted tire saved her
from further injury--She did suffer a broken leg as the right side of her
bus caved in--The front mounted spare "appears" to have absorbed some
impact--
