Subject: 71 heater controls

Hi Everybody,
    Well, I was succesful with this week's bus project, to get the heater
controls working.  New (to me) levers and cables, some good advice and info
from the type2 list, mixed with a moderate amount of effort  (those old
cables just didn't want to come out) and now I can turn the heat on and off
as needed.  Last winter I just wired the heater boxes full on and opened the
window to adjust the temperature.  I'm sure it's going to work better this
way.
    Next week I'll just be doing some routine maintenance to get ready for
the trip from New York to Delaware for the Punkin Chunkin campout.  Hope to
see alot of you there!
