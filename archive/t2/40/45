 would come in fairly clearly.

On Thursday I left Dallas TX about 9am heading towards Austin Texas
fighting a fifteen mph head wind in my 83 Westy. I pushed on at 65-70
carefully noting my oil temperature and cylinder head temperature to
decide whether to push a little harder or back off and found that the
gauges remained about the same at any speed between the target numbers. 
I settled in at the legal speed limit of 65 and patiently watched a
multitude of rice rockets fly past me at breakneck speeds until I caught
them at the next Interstate construction spaced at about forty five mile
intervals.
I arrived at my destination some 177 miles from my point of origin and
completed my purchase of an 81 Westy for a project van.
As luck would have it the morning winds did a flip-flop and I had about
the same head winds on my return trip. I managed to squeeze in about
seven gallons of the $1.10 a gallon gas (big deal saved $1.40).
The trip as usual was un eventful and downright boring since Texas roads
are virtually straight ribbons of two lane concrete with just the
occasional turnoffs for fuel or small towns.
I had made the same trip a week before in my 1992 Crown Victoria at the
70-75 speed range and had about the same driving conditions of head wind
and beautiful fall weather.
Now that is all a very boring story but when it comes right down to
reality I just have to consider that in the trip Thursday I was the only
twenty year old vehicle out there on the highway.
I had absolutely no doubt that I could or would make the 300 plus mile
trip in my old Westy.
I had as much confidence in the Westy as I do in the later model Ford
that only has 56K on and my Westy is pushing 278K and sporting a new
engine with only a couple of thousand miles on it. The Westy has never
left me stranded anywhere in the seven years that I've owned it and I
look forward to spending a few hours occasionally packing her CVs or the
up coming task of installing new ball joints.
I'll be making another trip Saturday to go camping in the Westy and I
have every confidence that I'll have a safe trip without any surprises
unless I find 99 cent gasoline.
I also found out a long time ago that the Westy runs better on the
non-cityfied fuel that I get once I've gotten past the county line.
Happy traveling folks.
