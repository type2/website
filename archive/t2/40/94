Ouch! Tell me about it! See the following links to get a look at what
happened to my old '79 Westy (the frog bus) when we hit a cow going around
20mph, decelerating rapidly from about 45mph. The cow pushed the tire into
the nose like big sledge. The tire and mount sheared off and rolled 100
yards down an arroyo. Bus on its side. I will never know what might have
happened if we'd had the same accident with no tire, but the impact would
have been spread out over 2 or 3x the nose area and maybe we would have
been able to drive away from it. Maybe. Certainly would still have lost
the windshield. As it was, the vehicle was totalled (partly by virtue of
the accident happening in Baja CA) and my friend in the passenger seat got
his knuckles scuffed by the incoming sheet metal. Metal stopped 1/2" short
of the driver's knuckles.

Seems to me that the air filled rubber tire part is not rigid and might
have some elastic, crash absorbing properties. The rim certainly does not.
You can see all the good it did us though.

Here's just the the picture:
