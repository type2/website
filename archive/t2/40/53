Subject: WANTED:Transvair Kit

Volks:

In my quest to build a bus that will haul my Hobie, I'm leaning toward
the corvair engine conversion.  I'm looking for a complete/partial
Transvair engine conversion kit for my 71 Westy.  I've got a line on a
partial used kit, but will still need other parts.  If anyone has the
kit or pieces, please let me know.

Thanks.
