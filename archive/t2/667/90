Hi folks. Long time no post here. I'll post more about that and the 
state of my buses later.
This thread about the Bentley CDROM is something I'm interested in 
though. This was discussed a year or so ago but searching the archives 
doesn't give a really clear answer. Can the Bentley CDROM be made to 
work with VirtualPC on a Mac or not? I can install whatever version of 
Windows would be required. My interest would only be to get it 
installed so I can export all the files as .pdfs that I can access in 
native MacOS mode. I have no more machines with Intel processors and 
really don't want to get one just to access the Bentley CD. I really 
would like to get copies of the fiches though. I don't care how slow 
and/or cumbersome it is with VPC-if it works at all I'll suffer through 
the pain of doing it that way.
