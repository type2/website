Get out your multimeter and start probing. 

Are you getting 12 volts at the rear lights? 

Is one side of the brake switch getting 12 volts? Key on... 

If the switch is good there ought to be 12 volts on one side until you put pressure on the pedal and then both sides should show 12 volts to ground or zero from terminal to terminal. 

Follow the wires back to the fuse block and see if the switches are being fed power. 

You are a great candidate for a Bentley manual...
