Subject: Air Fuel Mix Adjustment

In Northern Virginia:

I talked with an air cooled mechanic (mostly Porsche and a few Beetles in 
his corall) who wiill stick a exhaust gas analyzer up the tail pipe and tune 
my AFM to the desired mixture.

What IS the desired reading I should expect him to dial in my '78 Federal FI 
stick Westy ??

Thanks   Barry sends
