yeah like in your shorts.

You know that the entire bus is a ground, right? The only place that there 
should not be a ground are on plastic parts and well your jeans of course.

you have to have bare clean metal though. No rust and no paint and make sure 
your jeans are clean too.

I'm sorry don, this stuff just cracks me up. I'm sure your a swell guy and 
all.
