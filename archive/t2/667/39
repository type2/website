Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

I am just back from replacing the power brake vacuum hose on my 71. Not only 
did it fix a vacuum leak that had probably affected the bus for quite a 
while, it also tremendously improved the braking power. Maybe PO would not 
have sold the van if this issue had been troubleshooted properly.

Disc brakes require more pressure to be effective than drum brakes. Drum 
brakes have that "self pressing into the drum" feature that the disc brakes 
do not have. Seems to me that disc brakes always need a booster. (except on 
the 595kg Citroen 2CV).

Happy braking
