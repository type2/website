Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

Peter said:

- much has been written about the brake fluid reservior - other than where
to find the little gasket that connects the filling tube with the reservior.
Any suggestions? For the moment I am using carefully wrapped electrical
tape, and well placed zip ties. (Westy driver ingenuity hard at work.)

Easy answer:  order them from your local VW  DEALER!!!!

I have a package of 6 of them in my hand..... part # 211 611 833C

And one thing tcs probably didn't think about was the reservoir on the 68-70
master cylinder. 68 is one-year-only because the tube between the upper and lower
reservoirs is metal. 69 started the plastic tube. 69-70 are two-years-only lower
reservoirs. The 68-70 master is the only ones that are 100mm from center-to-center
on the reservoir nipples. All the other dual masters are 85mm.......
If he put on the 68-70, he would need to find a good used 69-70 reservoir. And then
where would he bolt it??  The 71 master bolted to the booster. Without the booster, he looses the mount for
the master.
