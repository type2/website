But that does not really answer the question - would it still be
harder if the brake booster was not in the system.  There must be some
data somewhere about how much pressure is required to operate drum vs.
the disk.

I have no intention of downgrading my brakes or making my bus unsafe. 
But I also don't care for unnecessary complication.  I did get the
booster/linkages from the donor bus, and I WILL install the booster if
I find the brakes are not up to snuff without it.

Thanks for the info!
