No way. I'll eat a bus. I don't care how sensitive your instruments are, 12v 
dc is not enough potential. Not even your hand gripping the terminal holding 
the meter probe would do this.

I know electrons personally and they would never walk through that 
neighborhood. Some hang out after the dryer but that's it.
