Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

Well first, there is nothing wrong with the way a stock 68-70 bus stops.  
I drive a `50 beetle with cable brakes and fully non syncro trans daily in summer months
and honestly it stops fine.  Too many folks over exagerate, these things stoped great when
everything is working a-1. 
 
If the `71 with discs and a stock 68-70 MC will stop as good as a stock `68-70 I will
be a happy camper LOL....that is what i am looking for
 
What i do not want is a `71 with power brake set up that stops like a `71 without the servo !
You are correct that will stop like shit....and will not even come close to the stoping
power that a stock 68-70 will stop.  Thus why i consider using the `68-70  IF it will work
that is info I am looking for.

I understood it.

>My question is there a way to switch to another master cylinder such as the 68-70 and have normal non power brakes thus saving the $159 cost of a rebuilt servo.

Yes you can switch but where is the savings when you hit something that the booster brakes would have prevented in the first place?

>Was wondering if this 68-70 MC would work in conjunction with the front discs...

All the brake fittings are compatible. It's just a matter of mounting and borrowing push rods and linkages, etc.

I hope to never see you in my rear view mirror with the braking system you are proposing.
