Subject: Poptop musings

While pulling together all the bits and pieces of my engine rebuild, 
I've been wasting some time thinking about poptops.

Peregrine has an early westy poptop (the one from 68-? bays). I traded 
a set of carbs to a listee to get it, and cut a hole in my roof 
(thereby decreasing the amount of rust I have to clean up and paint on 
the roof). It has worked fine, but there's no upstairs bedroom (I'm too 
long to use Mike Benthin's adaptation).

Worse, the poptop scrapes my garage door when I roll it in and out of 
my garage (actually I have only rolled it in, once.)

So I am thinking about doing a full roof conversion to the later style 
and creating a low-profile poptop.

The theory is that I can take several sheets of 1/8 inch baltic birch 
(or whatever the metric equivalent is) and laminate them, staggered, to 
form a curved roof about 10 feet long. Sides will be the same material, 
but not too much of it. I don't want the sides to stand more than two 
inches proud of the roof. The whole thing will be fiberglassed on the 
exterior. On the interior, I am going to shape and steam bend a set of 
thin ash ribs, perhaps one per foot of length. The inside will be 
varnished.

Instead of a roof rack in front, I'm just going to shape a block of 
styrofoam and fiberglass it to create a low wedge to close off the 
front of the top when closed and to provide a clean line.

The problems I'm going to have to solve have to do with the poptop 
fittings, for which there won't be much clearance. They will either 
have to sit down inside the opening in the roof, or be re-engineered 
entirely.

In the end, I'm going to be trying for a roofline not unlike the later 
baywindows manufactured in (I think) Brazil.

Any ideas?
