Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

 Could liability and lawsuits rear their ugly heads if you ran into 
something with a re-engineered brake system? I am a seat of the pants kind 
of person too, but eliminating power brakes...what if you hit something and 
an insurance investigator starts looking into it?

borrowing push rods and linkages, etc.

I hope to never see you in my rear view mirror with the braking system you 
are
proposing.
