You should treat the incandescent the same as the LED. I guessed at 1/9 of
the total lumens actually exiting the lamp at a 30 degree cone. That would
put the visible lumens at around 1.3 to 5.3. Much closer to the visible
output of the LED. This could be further improved on by removing the gels
and using the proper color LED.

Thank you very much for that link!

See above comment.

Couldn't agree more. I have a feeling that the total light output is
comparable. I'm ordering some tonight, and will report back to the list.
Give me a week or three.

These particular LED's are not a single LED, but rather a number of small
surface mounted LED's. They are very small and very flat, with a coating
over them. I don't know how much you could grind off them without damage.
Different spread angles are available off the shelf.

Thanks, Gerald.
