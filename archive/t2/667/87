Subject: RE: [T2] VWTrends rumor

Is there any other way that we could get VW trend back...  By changing
name to      VWTrends and co.     and start a new issue, heh

I personally willing to get the layout done, as I'm a professional
graphic designer....but unfortunately.. Not a rich man, and far for
being a good VW mechanic...

But eh!


I did appreciate the VW trends even when it was "alive" and willing to
get it back...

Cheers
