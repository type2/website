Found it online after I sent Richard the part number. I'm a "google
fanatic" and never thought to punch it in.

This sender is a 1/8"-27 NPT. 

Is there any change there's a nut that will fit on it?

Am I going to have to get a coupler of some type and try to cut it down to
be "thinner" to avoid interfering with my dipstick?

Is there a standard size nut that will "force on"? I'm not particularly
worried about messing up the threads. The sender should be a fairly
permanent part of the taco-plate when I'm done. I do need to be able to
screw it down tight enough to get a seal though.

I have part # 801/9/1 -- the M10x1.0 sender is 801/9/3

<sigh>
