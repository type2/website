Subject: VDO Oil Temp Sender thread pitch

Anyone know the thread pitch of the VDO sump oil temp sender? I can't find
a nut that will go on easily for my "drill the taco plate" mounting.

A 10x1.0 starts but doesn't go far. A 3/8-16 fits over but doesn't really
start.

Holding it up and looking it might be a taper? Is it a 10x1.0 taper thread?
Do I just force a 10x1.0 nut on?

Also, what's the deal with the connector? What mates with it? Regular
female spade connector?
