[somebody check my math for the output of the LED --- I came up with one
number once then the numbers I put in here 3 times in a row --- may have
screwed up (cos) the first time --- or the last 3 --- yes, I used a calculator]

The only things I can find on the net indicate that "incandescent bulbs
range from 10 to 40 lumens per watt".

That would make our typical 1.2 watt bulb rate at 12 to 48 lumens

Figuring Lumens for the listed LED at it's 30 degrees using the math from
this site.

Steradians = 2 * pi * (1 - cos (.5 * (beam angle)))

this LED covers 0.21409434737017258999782874868843 steradians

(2 * 3.14)(1 - cos (.5 * 30)))

(6.28)(1 - 0.9659258262890682867497431997289))

(6.28)(0.034074173710931713250256800271103)

So if you determine the steradian beam coverage and multiply that by the
candela figure (or 1/1000 of the millicandela figure), you get the lumen
light output - very roughly!

(0.21409434737017258999782874868843)(11,000/1000)
(0.21409434737017258999782874868843)(11)

so total lumens for this LED would be 2.36

Reading further it says that actual lumens are typically higher than
predicted by this formula. But the numbers would still rate this LED *WAY*
below the incandescent it is intended to replace.

Light measurement is very subjective unless using VERY specialized
equipment though.

I seriously doubt this one is going to be proveable using "the numbers" and
firmly believe it's a "try it and see if you like it" project. Lumens for
an incandescent are measured over the entire bulb surface generally. Lumens
for these bulbs may be quite a bit lower considering only a fraction of the
surface is pointed at the gels.

It should also be noted that the light output of an LED can be altered by
grinding the LED casing to change the directionality.
