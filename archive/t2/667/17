Can't answer your question on these BD ones, they look nice. I thought about 
getting those but ended up making a trip to the Home Depot. For much less 
than those I got everything I needed plus a jigsaw to make my own.

I liked being able to place them exactly where I wanted. They are pretty 
strudy, not sure if they would hold a set of heads or anything.
