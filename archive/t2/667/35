Subject: RE: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

Most folks have missed the original post...this is a HUNK of a van...
it was going to be cut up by PO and lucky i came along to save it.
We own a lot of property and i am just looking to have some good working
brakes.  If this was a nice camper different story....I own several very early very nice
VWs....again this is a work horse on the property.
 
I am not looking to keep the stock 71 system and unhook the servo, I am looking to see if i can make the system similar to the 68-70 using the non power MC as they are very different but if I can use that early MC with the discs.. I was looking for something safe and secure...that is whatst i am asking.
I was asking will the 68-70 MC fit on the bus and will it stop like a 68-70...? 
that is the info i am looking for...
 
I am getting alot of flack and hot air but no facts....

I just finally noticed this thread. 71s are so awesome and trust me YOU WANT 
THE VAC ASSITED DISC BRAKES!!

There where times with my first 71 that I wished I didn't have them as the 
booster went out. But now on my current 71 Westy (the booster was shot on 
it) I got the vac assisted disc brakes working 100% and it's so awesome. It 
stops way better than my watercooled right now.
