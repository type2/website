Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

After reading this thread let me throw in the comment that the contact
area (where the pad meets metal) on a disc brake system is much smaller
than the contact arrea on a drum braking system.  Less than half as many
square inches.  I do not have sets of front shoes from a '68-70 bus nor
disc pads from a '71-79 to measure from but I believe that they have a
total contact area of about 28 square inches (2 * 3.1416 * 4(inch radius)
* 1.5(inch width of shoes) * .75(percent of drum covered by 2 shoes) =
28.27 square inches) of contact whereas the disc brake pads are about 6
square inches (2(inches long) *1.5(inches wide)*2(pads per wheel)= 6
square inches) of contact area.  Taking nothing else into consideration
(and there are, I will admit, a myriad of other factors), it is going to
take more than 4 times the effort to get equal stopping power from
unassisted discs as from unassisted drums.  I have never heard of a car
that had disc brakes that did not also have power assist for those brakes.
Driving a car with disc brakes without functional power assist is not
safe.  It is dangerous.  Don't do it.

OOK!
