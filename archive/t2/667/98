Subject: Brosol /009 / PO frustration

Do you have pointers with information on the Brosols ? Why is it called 
Brosol even though the carb says Solex 31PICS on it? Why do you find it 
better than the stock solex 34 PICS 3/4? Is there horsepower loss due to the 
smaller carb size compared to 34 PICS (assuming that 31 / 34 measure some 
jet size). Who sells/builds these ?

I was going through the pile of workshop receipts of the PO yesterday and 
realized that he had so many parts changed/rebuit within the time frame he 
owned it (three years). He seemed to never be happy with the engine 
performance. Four of the repair bills say something like "customer says car 
does not idle/engines runs poorely".

PO had the engine rebuilt, new carb (Brosol), "high performance" (sure...) 
air filter, points, condenser, many valves adjustments, many timing 
adjustments done.  However no attention was ever paid to that this BIG 
vacuum leak due to rotten 30 year old brake vacuum line. This is amazing, 
repair shops seem to not care after all. Since it that vacuum leak has been 
fixed, the bus runs so much better - even with this evil 009. Sweet deal. 
That makes me, newbie van owner happy.

What does "FLAPS" mean ???
