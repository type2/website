Subject: headlights + fresh air fans

Good day folks,


Any one would like to exchange an ODOMETER, perfect condition set to
0km, This is a KM/H odometer, sorry downstairs neighbors... see image -
www.nimblecreativity.ca/1/odometer.jpg (large picture)


For a

Fresh air lever (full set - blue and red.. You know)

Or


if this is very good deal for a certain someone, and that someone end up
having a complete taillight assembly.

 That would do ;-) (dreaming here)



Cheers
