I have had a noise like this once and in investigating and pulling my hair
out I finally found that the hand brake cable had somehow come loose from
the brake inside the drum on the rear and was "banging" against something
on the inside of the drum.  finally found it, put it right and sound went
away

just a thought, easy to check and fix
