I thought VWTrends had already gone under.

I see no point in publishing a slick magazine these days where the bulk 
of the art is in black and white, when something like the Samba is all 
in color. That goes for Hot VWs, as well.

I was just looking at Rob Henley's web pages yesterday. More 
interesting, entertaining, and detailed than anything I've ever seen in 
a motor mag.

And you can learn more by spending an hour with Ratwell's website than 
you can in a whole year of VWTrends or Hot VWs.

The only loss, it seems to me, is that there's no longer a place to 
have your restoration glorified in print.

But whatever will GEX do if Hot VWs follows VWTrends down the sewerpipe?
