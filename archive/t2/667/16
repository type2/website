Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

When I first got my 71, the vacuum line to the booster was like swiss cheese.
I plugged off the manifold port and drove it that way for some time. The pedal
was stiff, but the bus stopped fine. These things were supposed to be designed
to stop even in the event of loss of power assist as in if the engine dies and
you use up all the vacuum trapped, if I can say that, behind the check valve.
YMMV but I didn't have a problem driving power brakeless. I did take it to a
local mechanic to have the ball joints put in and some new tire installed.
That's when he discovered the rotted hose and replaced it with heavy duty fuel
line. Haven't had a problem with it since........except for the occasional
tendency for the pedal not wanting to come back up about 1 out of 10 times. I
hook my foot under it, lift it back up, and it works fine the next time. Now I
know why the PO had an added spring on the brake pedal return. I have a new
master cyclinder I'll install soon and see if I still have that problem. I've
heard of fuel hose collapsing under  vacuum, but mine's been in there since
1995ish and still no problems. My real fuel lines have been replaced MUCH more
recently! Tim don't like engine fires.
My 2 cents.
