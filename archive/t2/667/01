Subject: Brake Booster Hose

Hi,
I've had this problem before. The Pink heater hose from Flaps is No Good for
this. The original German hose is best, the braided woven hose with metal
inside it. This hose costs about $40 per yard from the dealer and is worth
the cost. 6 Feet will be plenty for one bus. Also purchase a new 'one-way
air check' from them while you're at it for $15 or so.

In a pinch, the High Pressure oil cooler hose from Bus Boys would be my
second choice, but they make you sign a waiver if you're going to use it for
that purpose as a sudden failure of the hose could make an unfamiliar driver
assume they'd lost all brakes, not just the assist. Also, if you're used to
having x number of feet to stop, you could be out of spec when the hose lets
go and wind up crashing. Costs a bit less $$ in the short run though. This
is also why the pink heater hose is not a good idea, it has very little
strength and no steel reinforcement.
