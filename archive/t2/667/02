I understood it.

Yes you can switch but where is the savings when you hit something that the
booster brakes would have prevented in the first place?

All the brake fittings are compatible. It's just a matter of mounting and
borrowing push rods and linkages, etc.

I hope to never see you in my rear view mirror with the braking system you are
proposing.
