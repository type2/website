Subject: 10-14 degrees this morning

I need to brag a little here since my 78 Champagne is making the 
transition from "show" bus to semi daily driver.

Moved it out of the garage last night and let it sit over night outside in 
10-14 degree temps.

Went out this morning and fired right up.  Let it idle for awhile and then 
off to the bumper car races on the interstate ...took a little longer to 
get comfy heat inside, but was nice after about 5 miles.

The only problem occured as I was pulling out of the driveway...radio 
turned itself off cause of low voltage to headlights...very dim...reved 
engine up down the driveway and the VR musta finally kicked back 
in...looks like I might need to replace the alternator sometime in the 
near future.

Cheers, dave
