Except a 3/16"-24  just slides on it and a 3/16"-16 won't fit down the
shaft at all (my original post was wron'g about the 3/16"-16). 1/8" is
2/16" so it doesn't seem that would work at all.

Putting this back on-list so the correction is there.

Is there any such thing as a 1/8" NPT *nut* to fit a tapered connector?
