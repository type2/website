Subject: Arrgh, I just want to get back on the road.

Ever since I put my engine in its been running funny. It runs sort of
rough at lower RPM's, then as I get near the high end of 2nd or 3rd, it
feels like its bucking and the power is way down. Its a 70 Westy w/
1776, hyd lifters, Kadrons and a 009 (oh my!)
 
I check timing and dwell and they're fine, carbs are synced as per AJ
sims page. I just recently installed a CDI and it ran great until I
pulled the engine (to install alternator). Tomorrow after work, I guess
I'll pull and regap the plugs and undo the CDI to rule it out.
 
Ummm...anyone else have ideas, I need to scour the archives to find out
about adjusting Hyd lifters, because I've never done that. 
 
Thanks
Zach
