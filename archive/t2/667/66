Well, got yer sawzall? ;-)

I understand that it *shouldn't* happen. But it does. I duplicated it
many times, not believing it myself. I wasn't getting the full 12v,
but it wavered between 10 and 11.3v. So there's some resistance there,
but surprisingly not much. There was enough voltage to light my test
light.

I also guess that means all my ground straps are working correctly... LoL!
