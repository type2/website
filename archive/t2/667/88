According to VWTrends groupies:

This isn't the first time VW Trends disappeared. They published 1 issue in 1976, followed by 3 issues in 1977. They then disappeared until October 1980 and lasted for 10 issues until the "Winter 1981" issue. They reappeared on the scene with the March 1984 issue and have been monthly since then.
