I just finally noticed this thread. 71s are so awesome and trust me YOU WANT 
THE VAC ASSITED DISC BRAKES!!

There where times with my first 71 that I wished I didn't have them as the 
booster went out. But now on my current 71 Westy (the booster was shot on 
it) I got the vac assisted disc brakes working 100% and it's so awesome. It 
stops way better than my watercooled right now.

Even if the booster is shot you can get it rebuit for about 70 bucks. It's 
worth every penny. Disc brake working properly blow away drums and I had my 
66 with drums at 100% and they just suck compared to the disc. It's up to 
you if you want to hack some master cyilnder in there from a 68-70 and do 
all that work for a much inferior system, go for it. :) But you will need to 
swtich to drums up there as well.

Sounds kinda like that guy doing the 12V - 6V conversion on the samba. :)
