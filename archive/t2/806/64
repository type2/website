fix it right and I think I spent a couple weeks under that car.. my god 
it was frustrating.  I was trying to root out the old tube with spring 
steel on the end of a drill and finally just gave up and cut the stupid 
thing off when I broke the steel inside the tube!!  Heck, I could have 
just zip-tied the new cable to the old tubes, but I wanted it to look 
slick... it's my weakness ;)
