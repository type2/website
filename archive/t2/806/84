Subject: Bus Carbs

OK..OK..  I won't get into the whole carb vs. fuel injection debate on
the later model 70 buses.  I know the consensus is that the fuel
injection was the best thing in the world.  However, that isn't an
option with me (mine is gone on my '76 and I can't afford to replace
it).

As I understand it, the other options for these buses is dual carbs or
the Weber progressive single in the middle (which is what someone had
put on mine).

Duals, as I understand it, can be difficult to tune? Expensive? And, I
don't really understand the carb options here?

The Weber progressive is also a mixed bag.  Some love it?  Some seem to
hate it?  My Weber is in terrible shape and a simple rebuild probably
won't fix it?  Replace Weber progressives (by themselves) don't seem to
be available (something about a one plus year strike in Spain?).

So, is it possible to put a common carb like the 34PICT-3 on the single
(formerly Weber progressive) setup?  What other options (especially
single carb) would exist for these later 70 model 2000cc engines?

Thanks,
