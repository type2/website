Subject: Heater... too much of a good thing!

Hi, All:

I recently purchased a 78 Westy --  runs great and I'm in love, except the
heater is baffling to me.  The mechanic says "you have no flaps and no
thermostat, so your heat is on all the time."  This is okay during those
dreadful winter months (Pacific Northwest), but what about the more mild
temperatures?  He said that he couldn't fix the problem without removing the
engine...  said that he manually directed the heat to the windshield...  Is
there a way that I could more evenly distribute the heat throughout the
passenger cabin (hate the hot air blast in the face)?  Apparently my cables
are missing, but the mechanic said that they wouldn't operate the "flaps"
anyway since they are missing.  I'm clueless here...  I would love any help
or insight.
