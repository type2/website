From Don Tuleja:

The heat control boxes are available new:

That ad is a little misleading. They are 72 to 77. They would replace 78/79 IF you don't care where the heat
dumps when they are off.

78/79 has a exhaust pipe on the outside of the frame rail to channel the heat away from the front of the
engine. Here is a great picture of it:
