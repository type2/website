Guys,

Oh....and this part for the folks who have "standard" style extinguishers 
where they are past the expiration date or show low pressure.

"FireAde 2000 has a unlimited-shelf life and is maintenance free in any 
container or extinguisher."

Oh, I like this part too....

"Safe to Use on Car and Driver:
FireAde 2000 has a PH of (7) Neutral. Unlike traditional fire 
extinguishing agents, FireAde 2000 is safe to be applied directly onto 
your engine and racecar without any worries of damage from the agent! Can 
even be applied directly to the driver."



Nuff said?

Cheers, dave
