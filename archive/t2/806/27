Richard,

and those are IDF's

these are what fit the manifolds I have

Then again, I can sell the ones off the Puma for about 1/2 enough to buy 
the *expensive* redline webber FI kit.

Or, on the other hand, enough to pay for about 1/2 of a complete
turbo kit that will make lots of power....LOL!


Cheers, dave
