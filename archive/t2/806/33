Just ordered mine. One of my issues with extinguishers is depending
on the type, how effective is it and how much damage will it do to
my engine. Yeah, the fire is out, but now you have an engine compartment
full of crap.  Looks like this one is effective and leaves no harmful
residue. Hopefully I won't have to find out.
