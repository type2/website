Lori,

Your mechanic's diagnosis is probably correct, but the prognosis is 
nonsense.

First, no matter what else you do, you should get a thermostat and 
install it. Without a thermostat, your engine doesn't warm up properly, 
and that's hard on the engine.

You can get flappers, used, and install them. Same for cables. Write to 
the list again and specify: whether you will have someone do the work, 
or do the work yourself; and whether there's a pick-your-part junkyard 
nearby
