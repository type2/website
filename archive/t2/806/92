Michael,

Ok, basically what you want is something that works...Fi not an option.

*If* you keep your bus in Alabama, you can probably put the weber 
progressive on it.

The problem is this....some of these carbs are for the "performance" crowd 
who are willing to put up with a little pain in order to get the 
power....and to pay the big bucks forthe "performance part".

The general probem with a single centermount on your bus is carb 
heat...you will never be able to live with it in a cold climate as it will 
start freezing up on you....and when you get down in the 30's in alabama, 
you will probably be walking.

So, what I hear that you want is something that just works well for 
everyday driving.

The only other thing I can think of would require dual carbs....would work 
much better in the winter, but then you have to buy linkage and *TWO* 
carbs instead of just one.

You can get those here:
http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=C13%2D43%2D5207
+ carbs.

Or the dual Kadron set up which would be about the same.

I've seen somewhere that someone made a kit for the T4 engines for them.

+ carbs

Tell John at aircooled what you want and it will arrive set up and ready 
to go for *your* engine.

Price varies, your mileage *will* vary.

Forget the 34pict-3 on a T4 engine.


Good luck ,dave

 OK..OK..  I won't get into the whole carb vs. fuel injection debate on
 the later model 70 buses.  I know the consensus is that the fuel
 injection was the best thing in the world.  However, that isn't an
option with me (mine is gone on my '76 and I can't afford to replace
 it).
