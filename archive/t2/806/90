 << How would powdercoating affectthe
efficiency of the heat transfer...?>>

Being that it's only and even mil's thickness, I don't think it'll slow
down the steam heat at all Tony.

I've seen old steam radiator's with 8 coats of paint on them that still
radiated plenty of heat.

Remember--this radiator is down to bare cast.
A mil or two of powder coating isn't going to stop the heat transfer.
