Hi Kevin,

The AFC system that JJ was referring to was the original Bosch L- 
jetronic FI as delivered on US and Canadian buses from 1975-1979. It  
isn't available as a kit, it can only be sourced piecemeal through  
dealers or swap meets.

There are some vendors putting together kits for aftermarket T4 FI,  
but they are either VERY pricey. (MillerFI (-at-) >$1000) or very DIY  
(Megasquirt).

I gathered together a system to replace my dual carbs with L-jetronic  
last spring. It took a couple weekends to get it running properly.  
Almost anyone with the proper manuals and a couple gauges you can get  
it done.... I would suggest that a fuel pressure gauge, vacuum gauge  
and ohm-meter are mandatory equipment for FI troubleshooting.

Happy trails,
