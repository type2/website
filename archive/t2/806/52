Subject: Vanagon starter question

My starter is starting to show it's age. It was noisy and now it's starting to
crank a little slow. I think it may be time for a rebuilt replacement.

Checked the BD website and saw 3 different starters listed.
sr19xor From 1/83, CH#24b093612
sr87xor 76-1/81
bos017 80-7/81

The door tag on my bus says "Incomplete vehicle manufactured 11/79". The
beginning of the VIN is 25A004.
From the notes on the BD site I am assuming the sr19xor is not right for my
bus. Of the remaining choices, which one is correct or is there any real
difference between them other than who rebuilt them?

I haven't pulled my starter yet. I was hoping to get the replacement before I
pulled the original.
Thanks,
Tom
