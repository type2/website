Interesting.  I usually time to total advance because I normally have 009
dizzys on board for a '71 Bus. I figure that if I go with what is maxed out
when the thing is screaming, I know it won't go over that figure (in this case
31 degrees at about 4000 rpm).  5 degrees ATDC would probably put it at about
26 degrees at full bore which is closer to the "22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm" figure for
centrifugal dizzys shown in your reference.  That seems low, compared to other
1600s I've driven.  But while I hate to lose any juice, I'll give it a try.

Thanks,

Nick

Nick,
The 1971 with push/pull vacuum dizzy is timed at 5ATDC. Not TDC. 5 degrees
advance could trigger some overheating.

Ask me how i know...
