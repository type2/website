Great post.  Fire extinguishers are a necessity in a
bus.  I've used mine before to prevent a fire when I
stupidly tried changing a fuel pump on the side of the
road with the engine hot.  Didn't have a clamp and
couldn't keep the fuel from running out on a hot
engine.  I barely missed serious injury.  I doused it
with powder and hooked the old one up until it cooled.

I mount mine behind the passenger seat.  It is easy
for me to reach over and get it if I have to and it
doesn't get in the way too much.  Cheers...KR
