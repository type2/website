Dan,

Radiator should be a piece of cake as it will never see temps over about 
212F.

When I was young and lived in your neck of the woods, I saw lots of 
radiators painted with regular old latex paint....depends on how hot the 
"super" kept the building tho.

Spray can BBQ paint should work well(you can even get it in white now if 
you want).

I would think that regular enamel for metal would be good as well.

And....if you really want, find someone to powder coat it with Hi-temp 
powder coat...good to about 1400 degrees.  hmmm, regular powder coat 
might be good as well since it is baked at about 375 to 400F to finish it.
It should easily be good to the 212F mark.

Cheers, dave
