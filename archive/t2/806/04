It's impossible to be scared enough about this topic. Of course, your 
post is going to lead to that old FART about an automated extinguisher 
system in the engine compartment. But that's okay.

Check hoses and carry a fire extinguisher, one you can reach from the 
driver's seat. Practice grabbing it, too.
