Walmart sells a nice Ozark that you can remove the
rear poles, buy a couple of pipe T's and clips, and it
will sit right in and clamp to your gutter.  I saw one
at a show and it worked great. Just the right height
and only 30 bucks!  That's what I'm going to do when I
get around to it.  Cheers...KR
