Nick,

When you put the boots on did you:

Check for proper thermostat/flap operation?
Check for the presence of debri around the heads/cylinders(blocking air 
flow)?

I can't imagine why just 3 valves might be doing that except for the debri 
part.(or spark plug seals not sealing well on just those 3?)

Other than that, it doesn't sound like it's too bad yet.

How many total miles on the heads?

Bottom air deflectors on and tight?(the ones between the cylinders)

Same plugs all around?...yes I know, some of these are silly, but 
IBTDT.

Cheers, dave
