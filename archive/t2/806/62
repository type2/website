Subject: Re: [T2] Heater... too much of a good thing!

I too encountered the rusty guide tube problem- one old cable would not 
pull out.  Daughter's bus gets 50% heat on one cable- to get 50% to 100% 
one would lie underneath and wire open the flapper box- a messy choice- 
many do this just for winter.  . I rigged a wire from the flapper box 
arm to a small eyebolt mounted onto the triangle welded by the rear 
wheel jack mount.  The wire has a pull knob on the end- now she need 
only pull on the wire and lock it by twisting it over itself.
