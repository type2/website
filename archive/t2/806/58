I also jack just under the shock mount- The smaller floor jacks from 
wallymart fit well there next to the wheel.  Do keep a concrete cap 
block (4" thick) handy to wedge under the wheel to keep it from turning 
when removing or tightening the bolts.  You need a torx or allen head 
socket on an extension on your ratchet.  If reluctant to loosen, I use a 
pipe extension on a flex head socket wrench. Rotate the wheel so the 
bolt you are working on faces you or is down.

  tire just barely off the ground.  You can safely work under the car then
  as long as you make sure that you have a few inches of clearance between
  you and the bus.  This is easy with a bus, but I'd never do it with a low
  modern car!  Leaving the tire on means that you can pull against it to
  hold the CV still while wrenching.
