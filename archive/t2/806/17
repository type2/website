Subject: RE: Fw: [T2] Heated front windshield??

I can't think of a better way of spending ?200.    I'm half surprised that
it's not a popular accesory in North America.      We have always had
Landrovers, Landrovers must be the only vehicle with a worse heater than the
Type two .. In fact my wife puts on a grass skirt in our type two and sings
"I love my Island in the sun" the moment it drops below zero.

In about 1980 my dad had a Heated windscreen fitted to his Series III.    It
was horrifically expensive and he only had the right hand windscreen
changed.    Until he retired he was a Doctor and he used to get lots of
night calls.   I rigged up a system so that the windscreen could run from a
6v power supply plugged into the house.    This mean't it wouldn't ever
freeze but it wouldn't reduce it's life as it only had 1/2 the proper
voltage.

I have one on our "luxury" Landrover and I wouldn't be without it .. In the
UK with all the wet, if you get into the Landrover Soaking wet it steams up
almost instantly .. but you don't want to use the heater.. Heated windscreen
is great .

Other people (Who own "Pimping" cars) can keep .. Electric windows, central
locking Electric seats, Heated seats, Air conditioning!! .. why you would
pay for any of those before a heated windscreen defeats me ..
