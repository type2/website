Here's what you need:

Plenum
2 pairs of runners, plus big hoses to plenum
Throttle and seal
S-hose from throtttle to AFM
AFM
Air cleaner
4 injectors
1 cold-start injector
aux air valve
Anti-backfire valve and hose
Fuel pressure regulator
Fuel ring (hoses and pipes)
High pressure fuel pump
Fuel filter (high pressure)
2 different temperature sensors
wiring harness
brain box
EGR set-up or blanking plate, if needed
O2 sensor (1979 system only)

As I said, get AFM and pressure regulator from a parts dealer, the rest 
used (and checked).
