Nick,
I believe that timing for total advance means nothing when it comes to
timing a vacuum dizzy. The vacuum may be very different when you are driving
at freeway speed than what it is when you time at 3000 rpm in the shop.
The book says it is timed at idle -and 009 is a different story of course.
