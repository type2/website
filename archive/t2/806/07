Subject: RE: [T2] FI or carb

Yea, I am in the same boat.  My 76' had its FI replaced with a Weber
progressive.  The main problem I am having is that it looks like who
ever installed it messed up the linkage on the carb or got a pretty bad
rebuild.  I thought about getting a new Weber but none seem to be
available.  Any suggestions for other carbs?
