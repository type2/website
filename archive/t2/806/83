Subject: Re: [T2] OT?: priming a radiator

<<The archives have a lot about primers and painting things that get
hot. Do you suppose that that information applies equally well to
priming a cast iron household hot water radiator that is freshly
sandblasted?>>

I don't know what the archives has for info, but allow me to make this
suggestion.

For a household radiator, do yourself a favor, and have it powdercoated.
As long as it's freshly sandblasted this would be the best in the long
run.

It'll last a lifetime without falling off.
