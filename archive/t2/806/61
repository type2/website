Is it time to re-condense the lists?
 
In the summer I was trying to clean out the back shed, and  I found the old rear hatch off my 65 westy.  This was the pre - shiny paint job hatch, and it has the V(-at-)L sticker on it from back when the internet bus community was new and shiny, even if my bus wasn't.

 All, 
  The vintage bus list is not very active just now and any ways I have no problems reading posts concerning a '74 camper. I've been on the "Bus list" pretty much from the beginning and I miss the on line community when all years of VW buses were included. Ron "Coyote's" old lenti... list, great travel posts, Bob Hoover's sermons and so on.
