have you looked to see what the cost of a rebuild kit is for that
weber? While I"m not a huge fan of these guys, unless you know it's
shot (worn throttle shafts etc) then a rebuild might be all it needs. 
if it works it sure would be the least expensive route. That way you
can save your money for either a fi or carb system later that will
work better on the engine.

I would think you would have a tough time finding an adapter to make
that work.
