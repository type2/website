I have 2. One strapped to the heat pipe riser doohickey under the dash (very
handy) and one in the spare tire well in the back. I doubt I'll be able to
use the one in the back in case of a fire (TOO HOT!!) but it's handy for
things that happen when working on the engine, like spilled gas.

However, both are past the inspection dates. Any recommendations for a CHEAP
replacement?
