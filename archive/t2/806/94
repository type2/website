I have and I have even gone ahead and purchase the rebuild kit.
However, from what I have seen on the Weber website and also what I have
noticed from visual inspection on the outside of the carb, the linkage
and such on the outside has be really bastardized.  Getting all of this
setup the way it should go makes me nervous.

However, having another VW beetle and a 34PICT-3 sitting on the shelf,
it would be nice (and neat too) to have similar parts.  I know we are
talking about a one barrel vs. two barrel and the jets would probably be
an issue.  But, it doesn't hurt to ask and see what other have tried and
are using out there.
