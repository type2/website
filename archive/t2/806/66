Well .. She's 7 1/2 months pregnant right now . The grass skirt has been let
out a few times!

If you think A/C is a worthwhile investment then a heated windscreen is
probably going to look expensive!    If you come from a coutry that invented
the hot water bottle before the wheel then a heated windscreen looks cheap
and A/C looks like something thought up by a fetish enthusiast.
