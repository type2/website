Subject: Re: [T2] heat and noise in a vw bus

I just finished before Labor Day a total resto on my '77, including a
complete repaint in another color. Since I wanted to change colors
completely, I thoroughly gutted it ( I should mention it is a Westy). After
a thorough cleaning of the shell and then the repaint, I sprayed the
interior side walls with 3M rubberized undercoating, then applied a self
adhesive foil faced insulation between the ribs on the side walls. Then the
original insulation went back in, then the interior. The result is a bus
that is almost too quiet! I can't hear the engine as well as I am used to. I
can carry on a conversation with a back seat passenger without yelling. My
heating system is intact and in fairly good shape, the only addition being a
blower added up front, and it works very well. My door seals are new, and
the front grill vents seal when closed. All this adds up to a bus that is
warmer and quieter than I ever dreamed possible.
