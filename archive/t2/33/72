Subject: Re: [T2] Help identifying P&C set

96mm is standard I think for a 914.

You can use them on a bus but I think they will raise your compression 
ration reducing any reistance your engine might have to overheating, 
pinging, and the such.

I'd read up some more before you install them. There is one list member 
that did have 914 engine in his bus, I do not know what other changes he 
might have made to his engine to make it live.

The heads were also different on the 914 which might cope better with a 
higher compression ratio.

I know this is an 'answer' but I hope it gives you enough info to find out 
what you need to know.

You could join the 914 list at www.pelicanparts.com  and sell them and 
spend the loot on bus parts.

Take a good look at your heads - are there three or four studs holding the 
intake manifolds to the heads? You might have a full 914 engine.
