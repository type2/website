Bryan:
Interestingly enough, Westfalia made poptop campers from sunroof Kombi bodies
thru 73. So, theoretically one could fit all the sunroof parts to convert one.
The hardest part, however is the drain tubes. (The sunroof is not totally
watertight and there is a tray under the sunroof that catches the rain water.)
There are four of these tubes that go down thru the rocker panels.  finding and
fitting all these parts would be a challenge, but the results might be worth it
to you. My 82 Vanagon is a sunroof and I have never had any trouble with it. It
is  a work vehicle and used 5 or 6 days a week and the sunroof is open all
summer long except when it rains. Sure makes the temperatures a lot nicer.
A good friend of mine had an 82 with a sunroof and his daughter (now 25 years
old) recently told me what fun it was to travel in that car as a youngster!
(nice of her to tell me about that- I was very instrumental helping her dad get
that car!)
In summation, a sunroof vw type 2 is a pretty nice thing!
