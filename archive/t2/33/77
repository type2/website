Hey -- have you been talking to my wife?!?

Good point, but at least the terms "single cab" and "double cab" don't refer to something different with other cars.

Been around VWs since my first one in '73, so I guess I'm a hopeless case as far as getting it.  I realize and cherish all the cool VW-only terms out there, like New 
Dash Split, One Eyed Duck, etc.  Just think "ragtop" is a poor term for a fabric sunroof since it means "convertible" everywhere else; both terms refer to the roof 
of the car but the reference is both similar enough and different enough to cause confusion.  For example, it's pretty clear that upon overhearing "doghouse" or 
"barndoor" in a conversation about VWs, a neophyte isn't gonna confuse them with terms relating to domestic animals.

And it further gripes me that the usage seems to be derived from or at least reinforced by the atrocious writing in the VW mags.  I mean, jeez, Car & Driver sounds 
like Shakespeare next to those, uh, rags.  Slang, in-terms, etc. are cool as hell.  Sloppy terminology sucks (he said, using a transitive verb without its object).

My quest is to sow enough linguistic doubt that next time you hear someone say "Dude! Did you see that slammed ragtop?" you'll go, "Uh, is that a...?"

Actually, ;-) "It's not a car ... it's a Volkswagen!"

BTW I did find an interesting ref on automotive terminology: http://www.buyclassiccars.com/glossary.asp.  Alas, it doesn't clear up the "ragtop" issue.
