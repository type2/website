Subject: horsepower question


Ok experts, here's your puzzle:
A 1973 day camper (no poptop) with recently (professionally) tuned dual 
carbs, vac advance dizz, 1800cc motor and timed to 7.5 ATDC (like the shop 
manual says). Runs great, idles fine, revs excellent in the driveway, no 
wierd sounds or anything. Clutch is good, adjusted well. Bus sat from 1992 
to 2000, but brakes are loose now and seems to roll without much resistance. 
It won't go normally. It limps along. Tops out at about 35mph and barely has 
the oomph to start out from a stop. on a SLIGHT hill, it will not go 
forward. Am i looking at a tranny issue? Is there any other possibility?
Help!!
