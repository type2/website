I run 30-32 degrees total advance -- no timing adjustment seemed to
improve things. Installing a pop rivet in the throttle plate however,
reduced the HUGE hesitation in my camper to a very slight, but
tolerable one. It might go away completely with a jet change and/or
accelerator pump adjustment. Take a look at Boston Bobs article on this
