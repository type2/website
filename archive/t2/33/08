Hey there Volks,

Push starting a FI'ed bus (foward or backwards) won't work unless the
battery has at least a 9.6 volts to power the fuel injection system
AMHIK.

This is why I always have a freshly charged battery installed when
troubleshooting a suspected fuel injection problem. I won't charge
the battery while it is installed in the bus, only when it's removed.
Reading Muir has got me paranoid, I guess, although I've jumpstarted
my FI'ed buses before (a no-no according to Muir).

Hope this helps,
