Subject: Re: [T2] cloth seat covers?


Karl,

To my knowledge, this bus has never been touched that way<grin>.
132,000 original miles and the engine appears to have never been out of it
yet.

The seat covers on *all* the seats are a "red" vinyl with what appears to
be off white looking cloth inserts.  The panel trim is the same
"red" vinyl with what appears to be "chrome" lines embeded in it.


The front window cranks and the dash are a very dark brown.

The outside colors are a dark red? over brown with graphic stripes(3) down
each side.

It is not a camper.  It has a walkthru between the front seats and a
middle and back seat.  No sun roof.  

It was manufactured in March of 1978, the vin number starts out as 2282.

What is it?

Cheers ,dave
