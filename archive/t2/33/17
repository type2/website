Jim,

I did get the quote from the site below. I even responded that you had got
yours for $80 and asked how I could get a similar price. I even offered to
pick it up at the local warehouse as you did. Their answer was. . .

"I'm sorry Robert, but that is the cheapest windshield available for your
windshield."

My buddy at the body shop can order me one for less than their quoted price.
I guess they won't be getting my business.
