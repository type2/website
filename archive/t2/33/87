Subject: RE: [T2] sliding door "link"

Hello folks,

VW shows that the U piece and the track mech that is attaches to are 68-75
and 76-79 specific. I cannot tell the difference. As long as you keep the
two pieces together then your all set. FYI we sell a complete rebuilt hinge
for $75.00. Just bolt it in on a slide away. Later

The palm-sized U-shaped steel doo-dad--bentley calls
it the "link"-- on my sliding door is cracked straight
thru making the door hang up. (I'm talking about that
metal U, the thickness of your index finger, that the
door hangs from on the center track.)

Before I go to the yard and buy an entire door (and
have to get a friend to help me tear it off), does
someone on the list have one hanging around? I'd pay
shipping and fair price.
