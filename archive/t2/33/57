Hi Bryan and Everyone else,
If you aren't in love with this vehicle, and it
doesn't sound like you are, why not sell it to someone
looking for a Westy.  Westfalias are worth more than a
passenger van or even a Kombi.  You could buy or trade
for a better VW for your needs.  There will be much
less hassle, and we keep another vintage VW original,
everyone wins!  

Just a thought,
Rick
