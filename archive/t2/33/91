Subject: Benz rims on my Westy

I have quite a few sets of Mercedes wheels that all have the proper bolt pattern to fit on my 76 Westy.  How are people making theses rims fit?  The studs in  are to short to secure the wheels. Also the front and back have to be elongated in different ways I think.  I have a shop here to do the work, I just need to tell them what it is I need.  I know this topic has been discussed before but this time I'm saving all responses.
