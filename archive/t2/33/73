Subject: Re: [T2] horsepower question

Is it running on all four cylinders?

Could it be that you recently adjusted or replaced your accelerator cable 
and now the carbs are not being opened completely when you have the gas 
pedal on the floor?

Slipped timing?

Doubt it is a tranny issue unless your engine is screaming in 4th. Doubt 
also it is geared too high, if you had a tranny with a higher ring and 
pinion gear ratio you just wouldn't have power on hills.

I as curious as you are, so keep up updated.
