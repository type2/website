Subject: Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Hi Bryan,
No one seems to be answering your questions so even
though I can't refer you to any particular companies I
can tell you that there are a couple of firms that
make ragtop style sunroofs for buses that formerly had
poptops.
The only one I have info on is in England but surely
there must be a firm in the US that does the same
thing or is willing to try it.
The firm in England custom fits the roof to the size
of the existing hole...result:no welding or other
hassles.
Surely someone here knows of a company that does this
in the US.
:-)
Cheers
