Thats going to be a LOT of work!  If the westy is a good deal and NOT what 
you want, get it running and cleaned up, then sell it/trade it for a hard top 
bus.  

Rust free, early bay passenger buses are routinely_parted_out_because just 
don't sell well compared to westfalias and later 2 liter models.  They 
frequently appear in the local u-pull-its with dead engines or transaxles. 
Wait until you find what you really want and put your time and money into the 
fun aspects of having a bus instead of a huge amount of unecesary body work!
