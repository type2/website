If this is an original white Westy it should have the blue & green plaid 
interior.  This would be the same as my '74 Westy, but the outside paint on 
mine is Yosemite Yellow.

In my opinion the blue & green plaid which was only offered in the Yellow or 
White Westy in '74 & '75 is the nicest interior and layout offered in any 
baywindow Westy.  Someone should jump on this if it is a candidate for 
restoration.
