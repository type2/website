Kevin, reguardless of what anyone may say or think, if you like and enjoy the 
paint job then more power to ya. Drive it with pride. With all that has 
happened as of late, I was looking for a good flag as my wallpaper to show 
how much I love my country, That's when I saw your Bus. I enjoyed it so much 
that I  downloaded it and have it as my wallpaper on my computer. My wife 
wants to know if you would mind if we used your paint scheme for her bus? 
Also we would like another picture of your bus, by it self with out the other 
car  parked behind it. The tree background increased the beauty of you bus so 
be proud. Awesome job. I am in the Navy (22 years) and proud to serve.
