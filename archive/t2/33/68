I think you should double your dosage!!         Why do they call a VW truck 
a single cab? A Crew Cab a Double cab? Because it is VW lingo not 
because....."the rest of the antique auto hobby and the general population 
will think you're talking about a convertible?".........we have our own 
language and if you don't get it now (especially with all the VWs you have) 
you'll never get it!!!!  Remember "it's a Volkswagen not a car".

That's my little rant
