Hi Jeremy,

Horsepower starts with compression. If you haven't got compression, you will
not make power. It will rev OK when stationery, but there's no load so that
doesn't prove much.

If the bus has been sitting that long, remove the tin and inspect the
cylinders from mouse or wasp nests. These can block airflow and the
resulting heat buildup could cause a valve seat problem, thus ending
compression & power.

It could also be a vacuum line, but I'd start with the compression test.
