Hi Kevin,
Close is a couple of feet.
I'm not surprised the roller work looks o.k..
The real cutting edge between good house painters &
bad ones is what they can do with a brush.
For some reason rollers sort themselves out although
the paint usually doesn't end up flat like a spray
job.
Stencils are like that though.....I did some fish
stencils for our kitchen once & they were REALLY
fiddly.
Still,most people don't care about little
flaws....this isn't the OCTO show afterall:-)
The bus looks cool.
:-)
Cheers
