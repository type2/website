Subject: Re. Heat and Noise in a VW Bus.


Hello,

   I have read the article on heat and noise and found it very informative 
as well as fun to read.  I am in the process of redoing my interior after 
replacing part of the floor and driver's side rocker.  I have decided to not 
use cool patch or anything designed to stick permanently to the floor, walls 
or interior of the bus.  This is mostly because I imagine that someday I may 
very well end up welding again in that area or somewhere else in the van.  I 
can just imagine trying to remove all that stuff to make a repair or having 
it catch fire while welding.  I think trying to make your bus sound like an 
Acura is bound to be disappointing, even if it works.  I think the spartan 
functional interior and handling are even part of the bus's appeal.  This is 
only my opinion and I don't want to try to discourage anyone from doing 
whatever makes them happy with their own bus.  For myself, I will probably 
use the NASA insulation, regular insulation, a vapor barrier and new birch 
paneling.  I might put down some carpet and padding.  That's about it.  It 
is all stuff I can easily undo if I have to make furture repairs.  -James.
