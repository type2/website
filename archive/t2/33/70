Subject: sliding door "link"

The palm-sized U-shaped steel doo-dad--bentley calls
it the "link"-- on my sliding door is cracked straight
thru making the door hang up. (I'm talking about that
metal U, the thickness of your index finger, that the
door hangs from on the center track.)

Before I go to the yard and buy an entire door (and
have to get a friend to help me tear it off), does
someone on the list have one hanging around? I'd pay
shipping and fair price.
