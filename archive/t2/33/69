Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Again...   I can appreciate what you are saying.  If there were people
fighting for this Westy, it would have been bought by now.  There doesn't
seem to be a shortage of them.  I don't see '70 models bringing in a lot of
money, so I don't see it getting me enough green to by say a 63-65.  I think
I'd rather build it up pretty nice (possibly with the pop-up gone) and then
sell it as a '70 model bus.  I don't think it will hurt it's perceived
value, because the guy is giving it up for $400 with a touch of rust now.  I
can see your point, but I don't see $5 difference in it's value in this part
of the world.

-I'm not killing the van, I'm just doing my part to make everyone else's
worth more money.  :-)
