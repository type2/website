Is the 74 the first year that sleeps four people (the pop top is in the back 
instead of the front)? If so 74 would be the camper for me, I am much more 
comfortable working with carbs. Anybody know how much rust the body has? I 
would guess if the axle is rusted out the body probably isn't that great.
