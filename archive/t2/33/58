Well, looking at the free van comments, and the fact that this guy could not
sell it before I came along, there may not be a big enough group to sell to.
I'd much rather have an older Bus...   however this is the one that I found
a good deal on.  A wise person might have once said:  "If you can't find
what you want, find something else, and force it to be something it is not".

Thanks,

Bryan.
