Subject: 1978 Westfalia

Hello,

  I just purchased my first bus last night.  Does anyone know where I
can find a wiring schematic for a 1978 Westfalia?  I also wouldn't mind
finding out more about how to operate the different appliances and the
electrical panel.  If someone could point me in the right direction for
locating this documentation it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg
