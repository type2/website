Gentlepersons-
                       I've got two (2) HPBooks "Bosch Fuel Injection 
Systems" -
covers D-Jetronic, L-Jetronic, LH-Jetronic, LH-Motronic, K-Jetronic,
and KE-Jetronic. ISBN # 1-55789-365-3. New!
$10 plus freight. N.B. HPBooks, not Bentley or Bosch...But good over-
view of FI from basic theory to particular systems.
