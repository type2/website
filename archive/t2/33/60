Subject: Help identifying P&C set

Hi ! Type-2ers,

I have a brand new set of P&C that are 96mm bore. They look just like the 
P&Cs on my type 4 engines, but no book I have shows a 96mm option.

The excuses that I can come up with for these are either a large bore kit for 
busses or a Porsche 911 set. The box says Porsche Cylinder Set, but no model 
number. The manufacuturer is NPR, in Japan.

All help is appreciated.

Cheers/Don Carron
