I have the same concerns, as well as wanting to do everything on the cheap.
I bought scraps of closed cell foam from the local foam shop and put them on
the cab roof with 3M spray adhesive.  They also sold me a 1" 4x8 sheet of
styrofoam for less than $20, and I am in the process of fitting that into
the side walls.  Probably put more closed cell foam scraps under the rear
seat.
