Dave, other than mine yours is the second one I've known about. I'm asking 
$1,500 OBO. Rebuilt 2L FI out of an 81 Westy including the wiring harness and 
computer. I only put the 81 engine in there until I could rebuild the 
original motor, which also goes with it (complete including extra FI, wiring 
harness and computer). It ran before removal but had (has) a couple bad 
lifters. extra transmission, new clutch, new tires X 4, new windshield and 
seal (not installed). Has all the componets for the A/C but is not hooked up. 
I was told by PO it worked. I bought bus with engine removed and had to put 
it back together and drove it home with original engine, it did not smoke and 
had lots of get and go. New rebuild put original to shame, but I like to 
stick to original as much as I can. It is the Champayne Edition. I have 
pictures, but I don't know how to post them, when I try to send as 
attachments it take about a half hour to upload and then says it can't sent 
it? Go figure.
I have way too many projects and it is getting hot around here with all my 
vehicles (Housing complex don't like it):( I'm working on a 71 Superbeetle, 
71 type 2, 7 pass mBz, and I have an 81 westy I'm parting out, plus my 
raggedy old ford van, and I just got rid of my 70 ghia. It's almost to the 
point of either you or else:( I am located in Mayport, Florida (Jacksonville)
