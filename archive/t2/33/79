Subject: Re: [T2] There were NEVER any factory ragtop buses

I think I'll agree that convertible is supposed to be the only "ragtop", but
when you have companies out there marketing their cloth-type sunroofs as a
"ragtop" what can you do?  I think that only started because people had a
similar gripe about what IS a sunroof and what IS NOT a sunroof.  I can see
the discussion on some other group:
"If it is not a retracting part of a complete roof by some weather
protective material such as glass or metal, then it is not a sunroof" or
whatever the heck that may say.  I say, you knew what I was talking about
when I said I might want to convert to it, right?   By a show of hands, who
thought I meant making my bus a full convertible ('vert)?
