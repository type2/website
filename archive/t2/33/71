Subject: Re: Park links

Can we settle on a date?
If we're going to go to a Texas park there will not be any problem with
space in OCTOBER/NOVEMBER its more of making sure the park isn't closed
for winter months.
Somebody throw a dart at map.
I'm sure that there are going to be some of us left out because of
date/distance constraints.
