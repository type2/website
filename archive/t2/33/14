Go to:

http://www.windshieldstogo.com/index.html

and fill out the quote form.  They'll get back to you in a couple of days with the price.  When I called their 800 number, I was quoted a higher price, so I tried the website just for reference, and when that quote was cheaper, I used it when I called to order my windshield.  As far as the $123 charge goes, it could include shipping, which I was quoted as being in the $45 range.  I actually drove to a near-by warehouse and picked up my windshield in person.
