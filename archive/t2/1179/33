He went to the Swepco when he put in the Bostig I believe Tim.  Last time I
talked to him personally he still was running MTL, but I'm pretty sure all the
syncro guys have gone Swepco, as does most of the Porsche crowd.  Daryl's recs
per his site:
 	* We suggest a name brand 75/90 Synthetic 
for stock Vanagons
with stock 2.1L motors such as Valvoline, Royal Purple, 
Amsoil or Penzoil.
* Use MTL for the Jetta style units for 
"normal" usage.  
	* For higher power
applications over 150 HP, 
a thicker weight racing type oil is highly
recommended.       Swepco 210 (80/140 
wt) is the recommended choice (the
Porsche boys love it.) 210 is better in 
colder applications than 201, but
both will shift a bit stiffer when 
cold.. 
 
It does go about 2x a cheap dino
oil though, about the same as Amsoil or any good synthetic.  For a regular
power VW tranny, probably no utility, as you (and he) mentions.  As Tim
mentions here, AA has probably done thousands of VW, Audi, Porsche transaxles
now, with a stellar reputation.  The thread I was reading at some point Daryl
had definitely (by personal inspection) decided wear in RWD 091-094 was worse
at least under high power with MTL or MT90.  Weddle also sells Swepco FWIW.
 
Though like I said for a stock box, still got MTL in my '77.  I think you can
still get a GL4 dino Sta-lube BTW, and I bet it just has a different label
from their GL5.

Find out what Daryl at AA
Trans has to say. He has seen the insides of
hundreds, or is it thousands by
now. He used to like Redine MT, but heard
a RUMOR that he changed to something
else.

Today's GL5 is best for your VW. I use just dyno 90wt GL5. NAPA, Valvo,
Sta-Lube. For our Buses I don't see reasonable value with synthetics,
unless
you think you can double your change interval.
