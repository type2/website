Subject: Re:78 FI into a 75 bus?

Anyone ever switch an early AFC for later one? With a bad 75 ECU diagnosed,
I have 3 1978 ECU's and 2 spare harnesses, and 2 late AFM's, but can't
find a spare 75 I thought I had-and with the 75 having the 6 pin AFM and
I think a throttle switch, the ECU contacts are different-Beforing
paying $400 for a rebuilt, can I put in the entire 78 AFC and there be
no issue with the 1800 cc capacity of the 75?
