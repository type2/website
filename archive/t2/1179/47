Looking at the wiring diagram in the Bentley, you'll see that one wire 
of the injector plug goes to the resistors and the other wire goes to 
the ECU.  So, what that means is that the double relay provides +12v to 
one lead inside the injector plug and then the ECU *grounds* the other 
lead to complete the circuit and fire the injector - this is why the ECU 
grounds are so important.  This is also similar to how the points work - 
the coil receives constant +12v and the points switch the negative side 
of the circuit - the only difference is that the coil fires when the 
points open, not when they close, but that's due to the physics of how 
the spark coil works.

That said, touching a voltmeter to the two injector leads *should* show 
an open circuit because otherwise it would be holding the injector open. 
  To really test if you have the constant +12v to *one* of the injector 
leads, you need to connect one voltmeter lead to ground and the other 
voltmeter lead to one of the injector contacts.  If you don't have +12v, 
try the other injector contact - you should see +12v on one of the 
injector contacts for all four injectors.

Also, one other thing that not many people know - our system is a batch 
fire injection.  This means that all injectors fire at the same time 
every time there is a spark event.  Yes, that means that gas is injected 
over a closed valve, but that's how it works, and it obviously does work.

If you want to test the injector, just get a 12v test lamp, touch it to 
both injector contacts and then crank the engine over and it should flash.
