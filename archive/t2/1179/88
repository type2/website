Subject: Pictures of remanufactured ATE calipers from Rockauto.com for

I ordered these calipers from Rockauto basically as a pig in a poke, because
up here in Canada the cheapest I could find were well over $100 dollars each.
These are A-Cardone remanufactured part no's A1C 19-448 and 9 respectively for
the left and right front calipers. I am quite impressed with them actually for
the price, as they've been cleaned up by blasting and then were coated with a
shipping coat of some kind to prevent rusting. I paid $38.67 for each caliper,
plus the core fee of $25.58 which I'll recieve back when I return the old
calipers in the return boxes. I have 6 months to return them too. :-) Anyway,
just thought I'd share with the group.
The link below is pics of them.
HTH,
Courtney
