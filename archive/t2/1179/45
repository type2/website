Yeah that is what I have, and it is in bad shape. It has two sort of slices
where the engine tin has worn through. I think that it might be for an
earlier style bus. 

Here is a samba thread on these items....

Yeah! Dat's da ticket!
Thanks Kevin. However the original unit in my bus, instead of the crimp in
the tube, had a squarish bit trimmed at an angle to seat flat against the
fan housing.
