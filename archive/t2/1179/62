Subject: Re: swapping in different ECU's-75 runs on 78!!

    Emboldened by list advice (of Karl v. Salzen) that the ECU's differ 
little, I just slipped in the 78 ECU into the 75 MPC laying down near 
bumper, and it started right up (bus has literally sat since before 
winter, starting  just a bit on ether).-It's now  pumping up the 
clattering valves (had hydraulics swapped in to the stock 
rebuild)...........Took 20 min to pump up, sounds great now!   3 people 
on the list have offered 75 ECU's; I thank them and will wait for 
daughter to return from a con to decide.
The Spirit of Karl lives on-he last helped me determine that the $169 
SVDA Mexican distributor  Bus Depot sold should work in the 78 if I 
advanced it a tad at beginning.
