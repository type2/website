Chris -

Words of advice.  WD40 is good for freeing up mechanisms like the the
mechanical advance and even offering a VERY thin coat of lubrication.
But don't depend on WD40 to be a permanent lube.  A few drops of motor
oil into the mechanical advance will offer better and long-term
lubrication of the advance way over and above WD40 which will quickly
evaporate with the friction and engine heat down the road.  I have
often used WD40 to free up and clean advances, but always finished
with a few drops of motor oil when doing the final assembly.
