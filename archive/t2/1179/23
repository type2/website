Subject: Re:Stress cracks.

Best fix for stress cracks is to get the piece off the van and repair from
behind.  Add a layer of two of fiber glass cloth 2 inches past on either side
of the furthest cracks.  There is no real strength in the putties when
compared with cloth and resin.  Either epoxy resin or polyester resin will
work. Epoxy does adhere better to old glass. Glass fibers are where the real
strength comes from, the resin makes the matrix adhere and holds the fibers
from moving.  A couple of layers of biax cloth ( goes around corners and
curves easier), rolled down ( with a finned laminating roller) with resin on
to a clean and abraded surface (to get some tooth on old glass) and you will
be done for the rest of your ownership.  I use a 36 grit flap wheel in an
angle grinder with a VERY LIGHT touch to clean and abrade.  Tyvek suit and PPE
of course. LOTS of nasty dust. Fill cracks from the front (open with a dremel
so you can get it in just like the dentist) with
 resin that has fumed silica added until it is like peanut butter.  Sand
smooth.  Paint.
