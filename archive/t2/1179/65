Subject: Steve Dolan passed away on June 7

I bear some really sad news, for me personally, and for the memory of these
lists as they once were.
 
I received an email today from Jim Dolan stating
that Steve had died unexpectedly last night.  Steve had some medical problems,
and hadn't followed these lists in a couple of years now, and in fact wasn't
able to work on his buses much recently.  Apparently I was one of only a few
VW people he was much keeping in touch with at all.
 
I will try at some point
to post some thoughts as a fitting tribute to Steve.  For now I will only say
that although certainly an odd character and a grumpy young/old shit, he was
under it all the most big hearted SOB I've ever met.  He was one of my closest
friends, and I already miss him incredibly.
 
I will post further details as
Jim sends them to me.  If people would like to post stories or thoughts, I
will endeavor to collect them and forward them to Jim to perhaps be mentioned
at the service, unfortunately I'll probably not be able to make it back east
myself.
 
If someone who still subscribes to Vanagon could forward this there,
I would appreciate it.  If anyone from Vanagon would like to share something,
please copy me so I can pass it on...
 
Sadly,
John Anderson
