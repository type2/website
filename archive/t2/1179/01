Chris, to go bare metal I still blast, with sand or slag (Black Beauty) no
less.  I had a drum of plastic media but wore it out on 3-4 buses, and it cost
100x more.  To me if you go slow, balance for pot pressure not acceleration
pressure, you can still do fine, not warp, not overetch, even on a bus with
sand/slag despite whatever comes as fads.  I will say though regarding soda,
sure would be nice to not have sand falling out of nooks and crannies forever,
just you have to pay someone to do it.  But smartly you seem to want to not
get to bare metal.
 
If you truely want to go to factory primer only (which
may or may not work out when you get there) sandpaper on a DA, strip the paint
down coarse but as you get into OEM topcoat paint and approach primer no more
than 150-180 grit or you'll just mostly be at bare metal, which you will still
be at somewhat anyway.  As usual pop for a good DA, or wear out 3 cheap ones,
PSA or hook and loop paper, whatever is cheapest at your local auto body
place, and change em off as often as you need to, don't be cheap it will take
3x as long.
 
After getting to where you want immediately DP-40 the whole
thing before bodywork.
 
And before you touch it in the first place, no matter
how long since waxed, wash it 2-3 times with TSP  in hot water, rinse
countless times, then wax and grease remove the whole thing.  BEFORE you even
touch it with sandpaper.

What is everyone using to strip (sand)
old paint off. I've been experimenting on my bus in prep for eventually
sanding it down to the factory primer b/c it's been painted x3+ times. I have
air sanders, electric wood working sanders (palm, orbital palm sanders), 2"
disc sander, etc.
