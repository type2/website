Yeah, I miss Karl.  He was the man.  What a wealth of VW knowledge was
lost with him.  And I miss his curt responses to some of the less
informed who wanted to do stupid things to their buses.  Like running
the wrong tires.  And I speak from experience.  He straightened me out
on a number of things.  RIP, Karl.
