You wash and degrease first because there WILL be residual, wax, grease,
road
tar, etc on it.  Even if it has sat 20 years without a wax.  You go sanding
on
the body and it drives said stuff deeper into the sanding scratches in the
remaining paint.  If you go completely to bare metal, doesn't matter so much
as long as you degrease the bare metal well, but 2 hours with a bucket and
hose is real easy insurance to avoid the issue so why not.  Three biggest
reasons for adhesion failure are probably residual contamination, flash rust
from not immediately metal converting and priming bare metal, and finally
using incompatible paint systems (changing types or even brands of paint.) 
The fine sanding residue that gets carried off with wet sanding can be a
real
PITA as well, loves to get back into nooks and crannies of door jambs and
the
like and can be hard to wash off completely and cause problems later.
