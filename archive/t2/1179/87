I first met Steve when I went to DC for work back around 1994-95.  He 
took me to lunch in his '79 (I think) passenger bus.  When we were done 
with lunch, we got back to the bus and Steve informed me that we would 
need to push-start it... in an underground parking garage!  I ribbed him 
about that many times afterwards.  That was also the first time I 
experienced the pull of a well-running 2-liter FI engine.  It motivated 
me to upgrade my own engine from a 1.8 to 2.0 shortly thereafter.

A few years later, Steve was driving cross-country and stopped at my 
house in Texas for a day.  His bus was loaded to the gills - I think he 
said he was delivering an engine to the West coast for a friend  
(doesn't that just sound like something Steve would do?).  At one point 
I mentioned what a VW-wasteland Dallas was and that I was having a hard 
time finding some rear axle assemblies for my bus.  He took my out to 
his bus and produced not one but TWO sets of axles and insisted that I 
take the best set!  That was just the kind of guy he was.  15+ years 
later those same axles are still on my bus.

Had him at my house again briefly a few years ago, did not know when we 
said goodbye that it would be forever.  I miss you Steve!!!
