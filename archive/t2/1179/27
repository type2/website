Subject: Heater Controls Question

I'm looking for a little info about the controls for the heating in a
1600-engined bus.


The defrost lever, when moved to the bottom position,
allows full heat to the windshield.
When moved to the top position, I get no
heat from either the defrost vents nor the footwell vents.

The flap on the
vertical tube under the dash has is not connected to anything and has been
zip-tied in place to direct all air to the defrost vents.

Reading the article
below, I should have a cable from the defrost lever to the flap on the tube to
control the flow to footwell and defrost vents.

Does the
defrost lever also move some flap behind the dash that will cut off the
defrost vents when moved to the footwell position?
I can't really see anything
like that.

Also, if anyone knows where I can get new seals to replace the
crumbled seals on the fresh air flaps (behind the grille), then that would be
ace.

It's barely feeling like summer over here so I hope you lot back in the
States has been out enjoying their rides!

Thanks,

Josh
