Mine was "rolled and tipped" and went on fine except the top was blasted 
almost to raw fiberglass so it DRANK the paint.  I'm interesting in 
learning if I can sand somehow and re-coat to make it even smoother.

Just looked at it again through the office window.  Pretty good job for 
a roller and brush!
