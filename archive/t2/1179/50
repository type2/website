How old is the gas... if it is more than 30 days, has ethanol in it,, then 
there is a cloud of water goop in the bottom of the tank.. 

I am not sure if the fuel rail will mix that with the rest of the gas ... 
but I do know it creates hell... 

pull the plugs.. if they are wet.. see if they spark,,, I put the plug near 
the hole, crank it and wait for the POP.. no pop.. then that wet stuff isn't 
gas...
