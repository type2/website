A sad day- I camped next to Steve at Everybus (2001?) when he brought 
his stripped down splitty to take to MetWiz. He sat on the springs all 
the way down.  Did he ever finish it?
Also saw him at Tom Forhan's (Christmastime?) annual dinners  and at 
various campous like Assategue-wasn't it he who held those talks on 
checking dwell with a dizzy on a drill? Or was that Mark Dearing?
His last post to the list:
"Time passes, entropy increases....

Does anyone have a handle on the VW situation on the Delmarva peninsula?
There used to be half a dozen people in Sussex and Wicomico counties, as
well as the rest of the peninsula that worked on aircooled engines and
bodies (bugs and buses) but many of my old familiars are gone or dead.
About the only one I know is still in existence is Dick's Autohaus in Queen
Annes.  Does anyone know any VW shops over closer to the shore?  There used
to be someone in Delmar... is he still around?

Steve Dolan (who is not dead, really!)"
