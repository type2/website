Subject: Re: Steve Dolan

I am so sad to hear the news of Steve's passing.

Steve Dolan was the reason the AIRS List was started.  Years ago he  
was traveling the country in his bus and ran into problems.  Others  
and myself were on the chat list at the time and got to talking about  
how the VW Bus traveler could get help while doing what we did best,  
travel in our busses.  Several of us got to chatting about the  
formation of AIRS and eventually the group was formed.

He was such a good man with such a great heart.  If it were not for  
him I probably would not have made it in the "Search for the Bginning  
of Wind" tour back in the late 90's.  I have tried in recent years and  
even months to find him but to no avail.  I worried and wondered about  
him and wanted so badly just to touch base with him.  He gave me a  
place to stay while I was in DC and did so much more than that for me  
back then.

I remember his smile, his laughter, his wisdom and his amazing  
brilliance when it came to everything from VW bus to life itself.  I  
don't think I have ever known anyone that loved to talk critically  
about anything and everything.  He was very well read and learned in  
so many areas.  A very intelligent guy with a heart that would and  
should be the aspiration of all of us wondering through this life.  I  
have missed him for years, but miss him even more now.

I wish I had been able to somehow repay all that he gave and did for  
me an d so many others.  What a marvelous person with a great spirit.

Rest in Peace my friend.  I love you brother and have since I have  
known you.  I will continue to think of you and when I do I will smile  
and know that God probably is enjoying your presence, as you are his.   
Today I will indeed shed a tear and many thoughts and memories of you.
