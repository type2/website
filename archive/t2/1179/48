Digital
VOMs do
not
work well
for checking
injectors
they will
often read right
past the pulses.

I think the fuel injection trouble shooting manual is in the archives
if not I will send you a "copy" to use (and for legal reasons then destroy 
;0 ...)
it is priceless and works.

will it start and run with a squirt of starter fluid??
does the fuel presure stay up when cranking sometimes a clogged fuel 
filter will allow presure but won't hold it.  check the easy stuff first.

good luck
