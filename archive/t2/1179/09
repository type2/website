Hi John,
            Since the main market is for boats, which are mostly too big for
your garage too ;), it is made for outside application.  The recommendation I
have seen for one person roll and tip is to work in 1 (one) foot square
steps.  It skins over pretty fast and it needs to work wet to wet.  Once it
starts to flash over, you must leave that area alone until it dries
completely.  Adding 10% of the thinner helps with that. Temp dependent of
course. Interlux seems to recommend doing that ( thin 10%) as a starting point
for rolling.  Different for spraying of course.  Very good customer support if
you give them a call; the web site has videos too.   You can wet sand and
polish after the fact or do a second coat over the problem area after the
first has
 dried.  Two-three thin coats overall is the recommended practice.

If you can work in a dust free space so much the better.  Hard to find a calm
day in the valley.  Tarp structures are wonderful as aids for that.  I use

Jon, can you wet sand and polish it after the fact for problem areas if any do
persist after the "tip" procedure?

inside, which I can't do with the top on the bus with my garage height.
