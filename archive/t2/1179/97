I first met Steve in the flesh en route to Everybus in 2001. He was 
driving a VERY ratty looking splitty, which was destined to wind up at 
MetWiz shop for some much needed resto work. It was so bad that when I 
looked inside, I could see the road underneath. Steve's seat was sitting 
on a chunk of 3/4" plywood, which had very little metal underneath it.

That was the first of a bunch of NE campouts where I would get a chance 
to chat with Steve about buses, beer and all nature of other things. I 
saw his splitty again a few years later, when he loaned the engine to AJ 
in order to get home from Everybus when his own engine suffered a main 
bearing failure.

Back around 2005 or so he asked me to see if we could revamp the airs 
list, but that has yet to come to pass. It's better than it used to be, 
but he and I both agreed it needed a better interface and a way to keep 
its data fresh and useful. If we can do just one thing to honor his 
memory, I think that one would make him proud of his legacy.

Steve was always helping people, and always happy doing it; that's how I 
will remember him.

Happy Trails,
