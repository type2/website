Jon, can you wet sand and polish it after the fact for problem areas if any do
persist after the "tip" procedure?  The '77 top needs done, and that shit
looks a lot easier than what I've always done with the Z-chrome and acryllic
enamel.  How long does it take to dry, if it can flow out so well and self
level, I'm sure we are talking tacky for quite a while (hours?) which means
inside, which I can't do with the top on the bus with my garage height.

For those
using Interlux Brightside on the pop-top.  The recommended home
method is
"roll and tip". Very simple and time proven method. Look it up
and/or watch
the *tube vids.  Use good quality short nap rollers and multiple,
inexpensive
foam brushes.  Throw the brush away when it accumulates enough
paint to drag. 
You will know when.  Works best with two people, doable with
one.  Gives an
outstanding finish without any additional work.  Reasonable
price for durable,
high quality, high gloss, finish that will make you proud.
