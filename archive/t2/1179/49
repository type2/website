Subject: re:Heater Controls Question

Hey Josh,

 

I think the red lever on the dash just controls the flaps back at the heater
boxes. But on my '69 I have two red levers one for each side. I am thinking
you have one lever, so maybe your setup is different. .

 

AFAIK that lever only controls the flaps at the heater boxes and nothing
else-ie it does not control any flap on the vertical tube under the dash. It
is merely an on/off switch. The lever under the dash (on the vertical tube)
controls the direction that the air flows. 

 

I think the issue is the zip tying of the flap directing all air to the
windshield. Lose the zip tie, and turn the flap, then you'll get air to the
footwell. Maybe the zip tie is there because whatever puts tension on that
lever(ie whatever holds it up or down) is missing.  On mine (again yours may
be different) that flap on the vertical tube seems to only be up or down,
nothing in-between. So you either get full flow up or down. 

 

The red lever controls volume of hot air coming forward. The lever on the
vertical tube controls direction(defrost or footwell). 

 

Hope that helps.
