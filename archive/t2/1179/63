Sure Courtney if it is a mild steel or cunifer set and you got an ISO bubble
flare tool.  If it is a stainless set, you won't do it without a hydraulic
tool.  I find it real handy to cross clamp the tool right beside the site of
the tube with a good C clamp (well I actually use a Starret pin vice but same
difference) when using a hand tool, improves your chances greatly.
 
Generally
speaking you may be smarter (although it looks like crap) to waste some tubing
with extra bends, going long on turns, even up to an S bend than to reflare. 
I do generally reflare, and with a good (old MAC) hand tool I'm still only
about 85% useable and know 1 in 8-9 I'm going to end up scrapping.  If you
make it too short, you are obviouslly starting again from scratch.

Unfor.
cip1 is only 30 miles away in Vancouver, and Busdepot is in Penn, so sometimes
you gotta go with what's local. 
Anyway, can I just shorten these metal lines
with a tubing cutter and then a flaring tool? It would seem doable?
&*^&%!!!!!
