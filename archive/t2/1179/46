Subject: Qu re injector testing

Daughter's 75 bus does not start, (always started hard due to CSV 
malfunction, but always did with 3 tries, waiting for it to vaporize 
between each)....Ign is OK, runs a few seconds with ether. Ran through 
protocol, and fuel pump builds over 28 lbs pressure, power to double 
relay is there, series resistors are getting 12 volt, and inserting 
probes of VOM into inj plug shows 12v- now I read that both sides of 
injector get 12v- and they are grounded (or one side must be grounded?) 
to fire solenoid coil of injector.  I must ask- why would both sides of 
connector be hot before cranking?  I tried the VOM in the plug while 
cranking, which was inconclusive (few millivolts) as it was a digital 
VOM.  Guess I have to make a test light or find and dust off the analog 
VOM-will it work with that? - any one do this with a diode, which should 
show flashes??  Gotta solder to a bulb I guess.
