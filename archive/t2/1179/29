Subject: RE:Valve Cover Clips

Thanks again for all the input.

 

I took the heater box off the engine, while the engine was in the bus. I
soaked the thing with PB blaster. I tried tapping it out with a nail set and
hammer. It wouldn't move. I then tried drilling it out, the only drill I
could get in there was a dremel.

 

 

Eventually I pulled the engine-as I noticed a couple other things.the engine
tin was in rough shape, and it looked like the front engine seal was
leaking. I also had another engine (the 6V engine that was in the bus before
this engine) ready to go. I had been prepping this engine to go into a
beetle. I had converted it to 12V thanks to help from the list. I had also
done some minor work on it.

 

 

At this point I've got my bus running again, with the engine that was in it
before( as in a few years ago). I've got the engine with the broken clip out
and on my work bench. Now I've got a bit more leverage, better access, and
ability to work on it. I think I'll keep soaking with PB blaster, and
tapping it for a couple days. Mig welding is not really an option, as I
don't have a mig welder. ;)

 

 

If that doesn't work I'll try cleaning it up, and either heat, and or drill.

I'll keep you posted.
