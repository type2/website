Just what kind of finish is the original top? GLOSSY, glossy, or flat.

There was some gel coat failure (whiskers.) (Painting conditions: 80 F deg 
summer days) I rubbed the whole top down on Friday with Scotchbrite and 
running water to clean it. I primed it with Rustoleum's recommended primer 
on Saturday afternoon and top coated it 24 hours later per the can 
directions. (Oh yeah... I added a bit of Penetrol to the top coat per 
Penetrol recommendations.) Takes 2 qts of each of primer and top coat. 
You'll have half a can of each left over.

Semi-gloss? Looks more 'factory' to me. It's still 'glossy,' just not 
'GLOSSY.' if you know what I mean. Lemme find a picture....
