Subject: Please - Help me diagnose my transmission problem !

Hi guy.

My Vanagon 1983 is grounded because of a transmission problem
I would really appreciate if anyone could help me diagnose the problem.
First, it is  a rebuild transmission which is only 30000 miles , I am 
the most gentle driver shifting gears in the world and probably in the 
cosmos !
I have problem with my reverse gear , first and third gear (all the ones 
you select toward the front)
When I select the reverse gear , it is very hard to select. When it is 
selected, it almost immediately slip away to neutral after a small move 
from the van.
When I select the first gear. its hard to select and tend to slip away . 
However once engaged,  the first gear works fine ! same thing for the 
third gear.

I have no special noise , grinding , the transition is smooth when 
working , I can easily switch gears from first to second and third to 
fourth , but I have problem swithing back to third and first !

Any idea where should I look  first !
I plan to change the oil just in case , BTW GL-4 GL-5 other ??? debate 
is raging over Internet !

Thanks for any help.

Chris
