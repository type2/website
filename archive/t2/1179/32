Find out what Daryl at AA Trans has to say. He has seen the insides of
hundreds, or is it thousands by now. He used to like Redine MT, but heard
a RUMOR that he changed to something else.

Today's GL5 is best for your VW. I use just dyno 90wt GL5. NAPA, Valvo,
Sta-Lube. For our Buses I don't see reasonable value with synthetics,
unless you think you can double your change interval.

My tranny has about 220k miles and has yet to be opened up, factory
assembly. Natural fine hairs only on the drain. Most of those miles was
GL4 during the early GL5 problems and before GL5 was made.

If you use that, you are not wrong. It's an alternative that works well.
NAPA Tractor Lube (made by Valvo) is one of the few GL4 lubes readily
available but only in 5gal buckets. Everything on the shelf in quarts is
GL4/5. Several others still make GL4, but few stock it in quarts anymore.

We are the vintage market, not even 5% of the current demand for lubes
both for our trannies and engines. Specs have upgraded for 30 years
several times for new spec vehicles, and new spec lubes in old spec
designs is risky to budget.

The vintage Aircooled Porsche crowd are all over this. Google up what they
are saying about vintage lubes for some good current ideas. They are
addressing the very same issues, vintage specs that are no longer met by
new specs.
