Subject: Can I just shorten the metal brake lines on this crap I got

After reading this topic on the Samba (AFTER I ordered this kit btw) I was horrified to see how poor this kit is for my 77 Westy.

Unfor. cip1 is only 30 miles away in Vancouver, and Busdepot is in Penn, so sometimes you gotta go with what's local. 
Anyway, can I just shorten these metal lines with a tubing cutter and then a flaring tool? It would seem doable? &*^&%!!!!!
Thanks,
Courtney
