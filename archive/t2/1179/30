Subject: re:Heater Controls Question

I'm not sure which year bus you have.this is how my '65 and '69 work.

 

There is a lever on the vertical post under the dash. When this lever is
flipped up it directs the air out the footwells. When flipped down it
directs air out the windshield area. 

 

On my '69 (probably closer to what you have) there are levers on the dash.
Two for heat (left and right) and two for fresh air (left and right). These
both open and close flaps somewhere on your bus. The heater flaps are way
back at the engine, and the fresh air flaps are right behind the front
grill. The down position for both of these could also be called the open
position. 

 

I'm not sure if that answers your question or not.

 

As for seals for the front flaps behind the grill, as far as I know these
are NLA. What  I did for mine is to by some thin foam weather strip stuff at
my local hardware store, the peal and stick stuff. It works wonders, and is
easily reversible.
