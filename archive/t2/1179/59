Subject: Next question - Removing 35 yr old brake lines from MC. :-/

Well, since the brake hoses actually have a plastic ring around them that says
77, I'm betting the metal lines are original too on my Westy. So I know the
nuts are frozen onto the brake hose ends of the metal lines, and I had to
actually spin the whole caliper/ hose assembly to get it off the metal lines.
I am just imagining what the other end is going to be like at the MC. My
thought is to use PB Blaster and soak the hell out of it for a few days, then
apply some heat from my propane torch. Can I do this without destroying the
MC? It appears to be working fine; I'd hate to ruin it just to get the metal
brake lines off. Of course some will say, just replace it anyway :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
