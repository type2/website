Subject: Re: [T2] Please - Help me diagnose my transmission problem !

Don't even have to get THAT old, correct fill for 80s-early 90s Honda boxes
was regular 30wt engine oil.  Could still be for all I know, I was amazed when
I changed a buddies 89 Civic in the mid 90s that is what the factory manual
called for.  Does make one wonder now days with lower ZDDP if that is still OK
in something like that.

And we won't even get into integral tranny/engine
sumped vehicles, mini's etc...

EP/hypoid gear oil is generally only
really applicable for gearboxes with R&P - for some older gearboxes with
detached R&P the transmission itself is usually filled with straight mineral
oil (often subsituted today w/ motor oil).  FWIW.  There really are cases
where engine oil in the gearbox is the right thing.
