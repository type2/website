First, look for a new transmission builder (assuming the last one isn't 
willing to take it back and fix it properly).   I'm not a VW transaxle 
expert, but these are pretty typical problems (and, indeed, pretty typical 
problems in rebuilds).

If you want to learn more, Long's rebuild series might be a good place to 
start, even if you don't plan on fixing it yourself:

For an aircooled VW transaxle there is no debate.  GL4.  Maybe some GL5s 
are safe, but why bother when GL4 is readily available (once you know 
about it)?

Redline MTL is GL4 (ok, "gl1 - gl4").  Readily available (even on amazon). 
(it's a 70w80.  that's fine.  part number 50204)
Sta-Lube has a GL4 that is generally available at NAPA (that's what I use 
in my VWs.  they leak.)

FWIW, GL4 is still called for in some modern transaxles - 2002-2006 MINI's 
require it. GL-5 is not considered an acceptable substitute.
