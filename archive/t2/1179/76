I finished the splittie for him.  it was steve with the drill and  dizzy 
set up doing the tech classes at high country, that year I talked about  
carbs, steve and myself did those tech classes for a couple of years till I  
started doing them by myself.  it got harder and harder as it went well  past 
aircooled. Steve was quite the charcter and really a great guy   later  md

A sad  day- I camped next to Steve at Everybus (2001?) when he brought 
his  stripped down splitty to take to MetWiz. He sat on the springs all 
the way  down.  Did he ever finish it?
Also saw him at Tom Forhan's  (Christmastime?) annual dinners  and at 
various campous like  Assategue-wasn't it he who held those talks on 
checking dwell with a dizzy  on a drill? Or was that Mark Dearing?
His last post to the list:
