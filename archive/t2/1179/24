Hi Christophe,
                 I second John's advice on greasing the linkage before you do
anything else.  I did mine last winter.  Afterwards I was embarrassed that I
had let it get so bad.  Shifts like a dream now.  I'm not so sure that my
251-71181  Guide Pin with
Guide Ring ( from bus-boys site) isn't slightly
bent, but I was able to fine tune my shift pattern side to side by rotating
that part a few degrees either way. Undo the lock nut with a wrench on the
guide pin flats, rotate slightly, lock it up.  Write down which way, and how
much, you moved it immediately so you can go back if necessary.  Test drive.
Repeat until it is satis.  As I said it might not be "normal" but it worked
for me. Greasing the center guide bushing got rid of an annoying squeak.  I
did it by using a stick with a paper towel pad taped on the end to get some
grease on the shaft while in the 2/4 position (shaft forward-shift lever
back).  It's a long reach back above the fuel tank on a vanagon.   The
mechanism above the spare tire is easy to get to and grease.  Mine would spit
out of third if it wasn't "happy".  No more issues and much nicer shifting. 
Grease all the linkage before you do any adjusting at all.
