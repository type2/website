Subject: Re: [T2] grinding and thrashing sound perhaps from my

To wrap up this saga I ended up replacing the starter. The old starter, a
rebuilt unit from Mexico, was not returning from its engagement point with
enough force. The Bendix, if that is the spring inside the starter must be one
it's say out as I was able to move the assembly back and forth with nearly no
effort.

It took me forever to remove the old starter bushing. I used the tap method I
found on Vince Waldon's website.

It took a 12mm, then 13mm tap to get it out and it came out in pieces. A 14mm
would have been nice to have but I wasn't going back to the parts store.

Problem solved, thanks to all who helped.

mechanism, but the easiest to test.  (the others are probably worth just
swapping in another starter - but you can look in the bellhousing hole and
look for odd wear and metal bits on the flywheel teeth..)
