ECU Swaps
by Karl von Salzen 

A while back someone asked what the difference was between all the ECU's on 
bay window buses. VW/Bosch made 4 per year model. Cal auto and Cal manual, 
Fed auto and Fed manual. I said I have never felt a diference in any of them 
when I test them in my 77 Westy. With that in mind, I just went to my EKTA 
disc to see what VW says the part number of the ECU should be. 

That 039-906-021B that Bus Boys says fits fits 79 Cal manual trans.... well 
EKTA says it is the ONLY ECU available for ALL transmissions in these 
applications: 

1) Calif, from the start of the 77 year model to the end of the 78 year 
model
2) ALL Fed bay buses from 77 to the end of 79. EKTA does not show it for 79 
Cal!
3) ALL aircooled Fed Vanagons, 80 to 83.5. 

The Calif Vanagon is 071-906-021B 

No wonder I never felt a difference! There isn't one.
