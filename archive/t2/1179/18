Subject: Pop Top luggage area stress-cracks 

My 76 Westy developed luggage area cracks also. First I tried to get the 
luggage section off and failed.  I widened the cracks with a Dremel and 
provided adequate space for waterproof marine epoxy from Ace (that you snip 
off from a cylinder and work with your fingers until it is all one 
color.)  I worked it into the cracks and let it set up, then shaped it 
smooth and flat. Prime and apply same marine paint used on the pop-top. 
Repeat as necessary every 3-5 years.

Does anyone have stress-cracks in their luggage area? I tried years ago
to fill them with high build primer but they just showed through later.
I'd be interested in a good solution.  Chris in TN    '78 VW Westy
