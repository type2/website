Before panicking on the big stuff, check the shift coupling. If it's
okay, an adjustment at the gear shift might help too.

GL4 was considered a must for VW trans because GL5 eats the yellow
metals in the tranny (synchronizers). Someone not too long ago posted
advice from a tranny tech he knows who said that all modern GL5s are
now safe for yellow metals. So who knows what to believe! A guy on the
Samba also made the point that tranny parts are getting to be NLA, so
it would be better to sacrifice yellow metals to preserve NLA steel
parts. That's great if you rebuild your own, but a dead transmission
can be a deal breaker for many people, plus if steel parts are NLA,
why not the yellow metal too?. So I guess it's just a matter of
choosing your poison!
