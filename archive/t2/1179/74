I think
Dicks is still there or was the last time I went by but his junk yard pays 
the bills.  as far as I know he is last on the penisula

the guy in downtown Baltimore is gone

and the VW speedshop in Lanham has recently closed.

the old guy (can never remember his name) on old harford road in Baltimore 
must be at least 80 and just as much a crumudgon as ever is still there 
but??? he refuses to work on more than he will, won't touch mine because 
it is automatic. even if I wanted front end work done??? go figure.

not sure if Ray's in Dundalk is still there no listing anymore in the 
phone book.

were falling below the threshold level of business to keep these guys 
afloat.  that and the internet both lists like type2 and nationwide 
dealers like bus depot have taken too much work away from them to survive.
