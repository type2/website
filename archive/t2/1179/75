I bear  some really sad news, for me personally, and for the memory of these
lists  as they once were.

I received an email today from Jim Dolan  stating
that Steve had died unexpectedly last night.  Steve had some  medical 
problems,
and hadn't followed these lists in a couple of years now,  and in fact 
wasn't
able to work on his buses much recently.   Apparently I was one of only a 
few
VW people he was much keeping in touch  with at all.

I will try at some point
to post some thoughts as a  fitting tribute to Steve.  For now I will only 
say
that although  certainly an odd character and a grumpy young/old shit, he 
was
under it all  the most big hearted SOB I've ever met.  He was one of my  
closest
friends, and I already miss him incredibly.

I will post  further details as
Jim sends them to me.  If people would like to post  stories or thoughts, I
will endeavor to collect them and forward them to  Jim to perhaps be 
mentioned
at the service, unfortunately I'll probably not  be able to make it back 
east
myself.

If someone who still subscribes  to Vanagon could forward this there,
I would appreciate it.  If anyone  from Vanagon would like to share som
ething,
please copy me so I can pass it  on...

Sadly,
John  Anderson
