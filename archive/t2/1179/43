Kevin,


What you described is how I understood the levers to work.

What I
was wondering was:  does the red lever which controls the flow to the
defrost/footwell vents, in addition to moving the lever on the vertical tube,
also control some flap behind the dash somewhere which restricts airflow to
the defrost vents?


That's how mine seems to operate, but I can't see
anything like that when looking back there.

...
I'm not sure
if that answers your question or not...

As for seals for the front flaps
behind the grill, as far as I know these
are NLA. What  I did for mine is to
by some thin foam weather strip stuff at
my local hardware store, the peal and
stick stuff. It works wonders, and is
easily reversible.
