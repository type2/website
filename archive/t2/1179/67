Subject: re Steve Dolan

One night in January, when the temp was in the low 20s, Steve drove 
to meet me in my unheated garage where he bent himself into a pretzel 
to show me how to release the ignition switch from the steering 
column of my '68. In a month of Sundays, I would never have stumbled 
on that procedure on my own.
What a guy.
