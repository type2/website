Subject: Re: [T2] Please - Help me diagnose my transmission problem !

I"ll just echo linkage, particularly on a vanagon, back on the tranny, and the
whole thing.
 
For oil I think most of the crazy hardcore syncro/094 guys, who
are the benchmark for wanting a high $$ Vanagon trannies to survive have all
gone to Swepco 201 or 203, though I'm not sure which one, except for very
continuous cold climates.  I was a longtime Redline MTL and MT90 fan but
apparently their base oil isn't what it used to be and when Daryl at AA
transaxle finally went away from it, I believe it.  I do think that both the
Swepco products are GL-5, but it is pretty well accepted that modern high
dollar GL-5's with nonreactive esterfied sulfur additive packages aren't going
to attack yellow metal.  The Swepco's are not synthetic, and are rumored balky
when cold though.  And the Redline is still considered good oil but not for
high power conversions on the relatively delicate 094 R&P, just fine for your
van if cold shifting is a concern, vastly better than cheap fill.  I have MTL
in my '77 and like it just fine, if I still had a subie
 powered syncro perhaps it would have another choice.

I have no
special noise , grinding , the transition is smooth when working , I can
easily switch gears from first to second and third to fourth , but I have
problem swithing back to third and first !

Any idea where should I look

I plan to change the oil just in case , BTW GL-4 GL-5 other ??? debate
is raging over Internet !
