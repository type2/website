Mike,

Dick's is still open.  I think the "air cooled guy" only works 3 days/week.
 I had my 1968 in there last fall for brake and suspension work, and my
friend just took his 1978 Westy there last week for some electrical issues.

I'm just over the bridge east of Annapolis and Dick's is just about the
only place I know I can get my bus worked on by someone who is honest and
has a clue.

There are several busses in my area, but there doesn't appear to be an
organized "scene".  I know of at least 3 other bays and 3 Vanagon
Westfalias in Cape St. Claire (where I live) but none are active (yet) in
any organized bus communities that I am aware of.

p.s.  I only met Steve one, but he was incredibly generous.
