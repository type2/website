	I repeat my earlier warning that this class of compound, 
isocyanates, can set you up for a life-threatening bout of asthma the 
next  time you breathe them.  The first inhaling causes a 
hypersensitisation which has no apparent effect at the time or later 
-  until you next breathe the undetectable vapour again, upon which 
you may find yourself writing on the floor exerting all your effort 
to get rid of the present breath in some hope of being able to drag 
in the next one thru severely restricted pipework.
	Colleagues warned me of this soon after it became known 3 
decades ago.  Shame it still isn't widely known.   Even if the new 
acrylic paints (I suggest we not allow 'enamel' for them) hadn't 
become available, I would sternly advise anyone to refrain from 
slapping isocyanates into their air.  There is no need, and details 
(e.g what fraction of people do develop the hypersensitivity) are 
unimportant.  Shun this class of volatile poison!
	I'm chuffed at this new thread keeping me up to date: today I 
slap the final RIPO into the body of my camper, and then prepare to 
paint.  I dislike bare steel and will elicit none; the factory paint 
where still sticking sturdily to the steel will be most welcome, and 
protected with new paint.

	At the moment I'm thinking acrylic, roller if not yard-broom 8-)
