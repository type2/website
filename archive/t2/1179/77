He was a a very interesting soul. I attended one of his classes at Everybus
2003. I think it was. He was a very good teacher and story teller. There was
something about him that would draw you in and make you want to hear more. I
bought a fuel injection off of him there. When I saw his bus, I couldn't help
but chuckle when I saw how big his emergency parts stash was. After going
through many breakdowns since then in my bus, I realize how wise he was. He
definitely embodied the true spirit that is VW bus owners should have. He
didn't know a stranger, he was always willing to help and share knowledge, he
did not mind getting dirty, and he loved the adventure of the road and camping
in a VW Bus.  That is how I remember him. Heres to you Steve. You won't be
forgotten.
