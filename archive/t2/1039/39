All better now.  Per Bob's suggestion I used JP Weld and steel wool fibers to reset the drive shaft in the gear.  

Since the molded shaft well in gear was cracked radially, I also dremeled out the inner diameter of a larger metal washer to fit snugly around the outside of the well to prevent it from expanding under stress. I put a fiber washer under that to keep the metal washer from shorting the contact plate on the other side.

I re-indexed the motor, bench tested, then re-installed and tested it AGAIN only this time I used pieces of tape instaed of actual windshield wipers.  Sure enough, it ran backwards.  Turns out it needed to be indexed 180 degrees out from what the manual describes >:0(

Not sure why...the motor and wiring all looked OEM, I don't think it had been hacked by a PO.  Maybe the motor was a rebuild and the internal windings or contact wiring had been done wrong.  Oh well...

Lesson Learned:  Test the motor in the installed position before you bolt on the wipers.
