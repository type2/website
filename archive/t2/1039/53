Subject: Re: [T2] More strange to me engine problem; update

If I understand what you're saying,, without the head gaskets,, the heads
don't seal against the barrels......

ok... that is bad... and I had 2 sets of heads where I sent to the machinist
to correct so they didn't need gaskets..... footnote 1

BUT ,, I knew right away [second set anyway]  as the leak down test
indicates POOR ,, and there is air leaking,, you can hear it... and it isn't
in the crankcase, exh.. or intake... so... you can sort of feel around the
barrel to head area.. and soap and water finds it...

It has been stated that compression on this engine, and leak down is in
spec....

Bob? .. Hal.. did your heads leak at the barrel ? was the compression low..
or the leak down low...

footnote
the heads I had were cast and you could imagine the fins opposite the rocker
box sort of shaped like a loaf of bread.... that curve caused the barrel to
NOT seat against the inside surface,, but on the shoulder of the barrel....
it could be measured at slightly more than 2mm... but you had to measure the
depth of the head in many spots around the circumference..  and note that
there was a 2mm high spot in the middle of the head.   I had a machinist
plane the head so it met VW specs. for depth  5.4 - 6.5mm
otherwise I would have been forced to stack 2 gaskets to make up that 2mm,,
and still would have been out by a tiny amount....
That would have altered the compression due to the extra volume in the
head....
not acceptable to me.
