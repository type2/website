My 74 bus has a non-operational Blaupunkt that I didn't want to remove because
of it's vintage look.  So, I installed a Kenwood stereo with CD player and
satellite radio inside the glove box.  No cutting of the dash involved, just a
very small cut-out in the very back of the glove box.  The glove box closes
great, there is still some storage room on the side and if someone is looking
inside the bus, there is no visible stereo to steal.
