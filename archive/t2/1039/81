This sounds very similar to what my 78 is still doing.

Confirm your fuel pump is or isn't working with a pressure gauge. Buy or
rent one, have it hanging out the top engine hatch and a friend in the back
seat watching to see if it changes when the symptoms appear. I thought it
was the pump too until I got a gauge on there.

Here's a video of a walk through of my bus with vacuum, fuel pressure, and
timing: http://youtube.com/watch?v=N8-ykG_ZWBg
