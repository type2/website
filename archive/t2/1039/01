The only thing I would tell you to do is check the obvious. Make sure the manifold nuts are torqued down. Also, I have had vacuum leaks around the orange bushings that connect the outer manifolds with the center manifolds. If you have clamps on them, make sure they are tight. Also, make sure to torque down the nuts that hold the carb on the manifold. Make sure that you have good manifold gaskets and a good carb to manifold gasket. Other than that, make sure that your spark plugs are tightened like they should be. Any way, I know that I am stating the obvious, but I have experienced vacuum leaks in all of these locations. Good Luck!

 Being a sp intake manifold, I had to drill and tap a hole
 (about 3/8") for the
 vacuum for my power brake booster.   I have checked for
 vacuum leaks.  Found
 none.  But the brakes don't seem to be as responsive as
 I would have
 anticipated with using a brake booster.
