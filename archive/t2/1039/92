Subject: Need help removing sliding door runner cover

I am perplexed, and could use a little help.  In trying to remove the 
sliding door outside runner cover, I am stuck.  In section 5.10, Bentley 
describes three Phillips head screws that hold the cover on the body. 
Two on the underside (I got these off), and one at the front of the 
cover.  I don't have this screw that they picture.  Bentley also 
pictures a retaining strip with a Phillips head screw.  I don't have 
this either.  Lastly, Bentley also mentions a nut and bolt that need to 
be removed from inside the passenger compartment, but I'll be darned if 
I can find it...

Searching the archives indicates that maybe I just need to be persuading 
the cover with a putty knife (along the beading)?

What's the trick to getting the cover off?  I'm sure it's simple, but I 
don't want to muck things up.  Advice is appreciated!
