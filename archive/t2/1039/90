Subject: fuel pump discrepancy

The 1600 DP that I just rebuilt won't start because no fuel is 
flowing from the fuel pump.  The pressure measurements that I made 
aren't conclusive so I reached in my stash for a spare pump to swap.

This OEM spare differs from the after market pump that's on the 
engine now in that the lever inside that is pushed by the rod sticks 
out of the newer pump by about two mm, whereas that same lever in the 
older pump is recessed into the pump by a few mm.
Is one of these pumps defective?
Where should the bottom of the lever be located?
