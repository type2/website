The antenna on the Guac's been broken for over a year. I looked at electrics
and posed this question to the list at one point too.

The result was that unless you mount it in the roof somehow, it ain't gonna
fit. It would stick forward like a javelin if put in the stock locations.

So you have to decide where to cut the hole for the new antenna and how
you're going to fill the hole(s) for the old one.

Luckily I still get great radio reception even with the broken antenna so I
just stopped worrying about it. I'll find a good original one someday...
