Subject: bolt size question

I am restoring a low light bay, 1969. Last night I went to put the sides
of the front bumper on. They are the pieces that have the step pads at
the bottom of the doors. All of my bolts and holes were too rusty to
save the bolts, so I have no real idea of the size and thread pitch. I
am scared to run a tap through the threads in case I have the wrong
thread pitch. I have experimented with various sizes and none of them
really give me a good feeling. Anybody have an idea what size bolt and
thread pitch these are? They are not the same size as the main bumper
bracket bolts.
