i'm running a 75 FI automatic 1.8 liter bus.  on a straight away at
60-65mph what rpm's i would be seeing?  trying to get a feel for my
newly rebuilt engine and i want to know if my oil pressure is where it
should be.  also, to see if the oil temp gauge is reading too high.
with a loaded bus, some camping gear, me and three kids, i was seeing
oil temps maxing out at 260* F.  oil pressure hung out around 40psi
sometimes 35psi when i was cruising at 60-65 mph. the oil is 15-40
dino.  head temps where around 400*-450* the whole time according to
the VDO gauge.  from what i've read these are fairly inaccurate and if
i read ratwell correctly too high.

i checked the archives.  most applicable info was for 2.0 liter manual
buses.  mine is a 1.8 FI auto.

thanks,

jeremiah
