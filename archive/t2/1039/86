Subject: Help with vac fitting ID and a nice surprise

Hey everybody;
 
I plan on trying to test start the 75 today, I'm trying to button everything
up that was undone by the previous owners and by sitting three or five
years.  I still have this mystery fitting I found laying in the back pass
side bottom corner of the engine bay down by the injector lines.  I've been
all over that area with a flashlight and mirror but I can't find anyplace it
appears to belong.  Can anyone help me out?  I know Bosch CIS systems are
really touchy on vacuum leaks so I don't want to chase tail on startup
issues if I have a hole in the plumbing.  Photo is below.

As mentioned, I'm sorting everything out and part of that process involves
some disconnected wiring back by the battery.  I saw a huge knot of
electrical tape on a bundle of electrical wires by the rear door guide, I
was half afraid to mess with it because it looked like it had been there a
long time.  I noticed that it didn't appear to connected to the wiring so I
pulled it loose.  Inside was an original key that had been wrapped in paper
and wrapped again in electrical tape.  Long forgotten, I'm sure, I was
really glad to see it because all I had was a single cheap aftermarket key
and I was goling to buy an OEM blank and have one cut.  I take this as a
sign today is the day it will start and run.     
 
thanks in advance
 
Joe
