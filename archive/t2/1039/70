My suggestion would be to bite the bullet and make it right.  If your
distributor is not aligned correctly it's often the case that your
valves are not done right either.  Here's what you need to do:

Find REAL #1TDC.  At #1 TDC you should see your flywheel mark and/or
your fan mark lined up with the case seem.  At that point you could be
at #1 or #3 TDC.  To find the difference check the rocker arms on #1.
If you're at #1 TDC there should be slack in both intake and exhaust.
If you're at #3 TDC at least one of them (don't remember which) will be
opened so will have no clearance.  Like I said, find the REAL #1 TDC.

Now that you've got the motor at REAL #1 TDC if your distributor is
really off you can now correct it.  Pull the distributor.  CAREFULLY
remove the spring that sits in the middle of the dizzy drive.  Either
use a coat hanger to stick through the middle of the spring and a small
screw driver to put pressure against it so you can lift it out OR get
one of those handy little "claw" grabbers (the one on a flexible stalk
with 3 prongs that you open by pushing the button at the other end).

To remove the distributor drive itself you can use a small wooden dowel
about the diameter of the spring you removed and stick it into the hole
where the spring came out.  If it's too big just whittle it down until
it's a tight press-fit.  Then just lift it out while allowing it to
pivot a bit.  Re-install with the correct alignment (check Muirs,
Bently, or even Haynes for the correct alignment).  Once in place
re-check the alignment because it pivots as it seats into the gears.

Re-install the distributor with the plug wires correctly installed
(1-4-3-2) then check the valve clearance on all 4 and adjust if
necessary.  Set your timing according to which distributor you've got
and fire it up.  Assuming your dwell is good then all should be well.
