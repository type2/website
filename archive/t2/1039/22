Subject: Natural Bus Diecast update

I'm going to do the decals this weekend.  I've already spook with some folks
who want them and their avatar on the roof. If you want a Bus for sure (I'm
keeping the price down at $8) and want a avatar on it send it my way.
The decals are printed on clear decals paper with an Inkjet so if there
somewhat transparent to a point.

If it's square avatar or pic I'll use up some white decal paper I have and do
it, but I have to charge an extra $1 for it.  Paid more for the paper and have
to spend more time cutting around it.

Thanks
