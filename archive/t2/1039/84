Subject: 2 liter rebuild

I am taking apart a 2 liter that had bad compression, due to some really
sunk valves that Adrian fixed up nicely, and figured I'd split the case to
make sure it is good down there. The cam showed plenty of wear, and the
bearings seemed corroded or something and was missing what appeared to be a
layer in spots, so I am glad I did this.

I have built many type 1 engine, and was very suprised to find the crank
condition.  I have measured, calibrated the micrometer, measured again, used
the caliper, and borrowed my neighbors, and the crank is coming out as
standard size.

Does the oil filter really help that much, and keep them that clean, that
standard cranks are still around after all these years?  IS this common
place on type 4's?

Also if anyone has an oring for the original oil pump, that they did't use
on their build, let me know if you would not mind putting it in the mail for
me.


Thanks in advance

Have a good summer

Eric
