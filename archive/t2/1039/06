Actually, I have a Sapphire VIII AM Radio/8 Track Player for my 67 Beetle - anyone know?who I can trust to get that fixed?

But the bus is more of a driver, and I only have one 8 track tape in my collection.? I'm kinda tired of hearing that tape at this point.........

So maybe a CD player makes more sense in the bus.? I have a cassette player in there now, and I can use one of those cassette-on-a-wire things to hook up a portable CD player, but it's kind of annoying.

Jamie, when installing a DIN unit, did you find that there was any interference from the faceplate overlaying any part of the dash?? Or, is there no faceplate overlay with the DIN configuration?
