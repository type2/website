Subject: Replacement Poptop Needed

The poptop on my '77 Westy was cracked at the rear corners when I 
bought it.  I'm looking to replace it rather than try to fix it.  
Although I've done some fiberglass work in the past, the substrate on 
this roof looks like a poor candidate for restoration.  Anybody got 
a '77 or '78 salvage bus with a decent roof?  Anybody know of a 
salvage yard with a decent pop top?  Close to Wyoming?

Thanks all,

Ben
