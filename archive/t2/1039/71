It is the charcoal cannister, not the intake air distrubutor.

Here's the way my hoses route:

Large Right: Goes to the top of the round attachment on the air filter housing. This one circulates the fuel fumes into the intake for to dispose of them.

Large Left: Goes to a fitting on the left side of the fan housing, near the rear.  I assume this provides a slight positive pressure to the cannnister.

Small Right:  Goes to a Tee fitting at the top of the enegine compartment.  This Tee connects to the fuel tank vent system tubing.

Small Left:  Mine has nothing connected to the nipple, probably just to equalize pressure?

My engine is a stock CA 2.0 which runs great and passes smog regularly, so odds are good that it's configured correctly (but you never know I guess).

The Bentley calls it the intake air distributor, I believe. I thought it was
a charcoal filter for gas fumes.  Each side has a larger diameter line on
the bottom and a smaller diameter line on the top, four total lines. The
drivers side top line is missing (open nipple), the pass line is there but
disconnected at the end away from the canister. Hard clear plastic line, not
broken off, I just can't figure out where it goes. I was thinking airbox for
the pass side but I can't find an open port in range of the line. The EGR
valve on the driver's side has an open nipple on top of the housing but I'm
thinking a test cap goes there.
