Subject: Retractable Electric Antenna

Hi everyone,

My antenna is on the way out and I would like to replace it with an
electric one. I have looked at the Bus Depot, GoWesty, etc... but did
not find any being carried. Who here has replaced their antenna with
an electric one, and what did you use? I will be installing the
antenna on a 1971 Bus.

Thank you,

Max
