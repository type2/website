"is the auxiliary air vavle on the 75 FI bus engine interchangeable
with any other FI aircooled vw engine?  found some rebuilt python
units on jc whitney reasonably priced, but none are listed for the 75
FI bus engine."

I just went through the same thing.  I purchased a Python rebuilt from JC
Whitney and it works fine.  According to Ratwell.com the Aux Air Valve is a
Universal fit for the FI busses and FI Beetles.  JC Whitney has the AA valve
listed as a 75-79 Beetle part.  Here's the link to ratwell:

When I got my part from JCW I noticed the VW part number on the rebuilt
ended in 0 as opposed to my original that ended in 1.  But like I said, I
plugged it in and it works great.  At about $50 its much better than paying
the $250-$300 for a new one, and is better than paying $10 for one at the
parts yard that may or may not work for who knows how long.  The Python part
even has a 1 year warranty.

Wow I should become a Python sales rep!

Has anyone had any experience with their rebuilt AFM units?
