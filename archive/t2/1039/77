Subject: Intermittent Engine failure...

Strange problem on a 77 automatic westy, after driving for a while, doesn't
seem to matter distance or heat, the engine stops, cranks won't start. 
After 10-15 minutes fires right up and drives fine.
It has done this 3 times
in the last few weeks.
I'm leaning towards a fuel pump issue, as when I crank
it over in this state, I can't hear the fuel pump running.  I replaced the
fuel filter just to ensure things would flow good, but it has since done the
same thing again.
Which components should I verify for the fuel pump, as
it would seem just replacing the fuel pump, which is quite expensive, and may
not be the issue is not the right solution.  Though with it being the original
fuel pump, it has to be on a short life span...
Where do I start ?
thanks
bob
