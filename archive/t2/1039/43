Subject: Fwd: [T2] More strange to me engine problem; update

Greg: Believe me, I know the feeling. With many rebuilds under my 
belt, I spent the morning trying to troubleshot a 1600DP from my 
son's Ghia that will run but won't idle at all.

My experience this morning might be relevant to your problem. Like 
you, I have always checked for leaks by flowing propane over the 
various joints while I listen and watch a tach that I hook up to the 
engine. This morning, the carb that would not idle showed no change 
in rpm with propane. I was so sure that the symptoms suggested a 
vacuum leak, that I got a squirt bottle of alcohol and dribbled this 
liquid where the throttle shaft emerges from the casting. Sure 
enough, an unmistakable and reproducible  increase in rpm at both 
ends of the shaft.

Because this was so unexpected, I repeated several times with propane 
and then alcohol. Same result.

OK, so I pull four 34 PICT-3 carbs from my stash. I now have parts 
from all four on my bench trying to find a combination of top and 
bottom that has (1) a choke plate moving correctly,  and (2) no 
vacuum leak at the throttle shaft.

Jack
