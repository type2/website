Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper Motor Spins

Well, I removed/disassembled/cleaned/lubed the motor, gear, and  rack assembly. I used JB weld to fix the drive gear, and indexed the shaft per the manual.  Bench tested OK. So good so far...I reinstalled it all, including the wipers, but when I switched it on, the wipers tried to go BACKWARDS which of course stripped the drive gear again :0(

I'm hoping the gear can handle another JB weld.  Is there a trick to indexing the drive shaft, other than what the book says? Next time I think I'll run it first WITHOUT the wipers installed.

Looking online, I'm not seeing any rebuilt wiper motor assemblies for late bays...anyone know if these are available anywhere?
