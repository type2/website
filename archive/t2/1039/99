Bentley does not get year specific. The nut and bolt was on the early bay.
Late bay just has 2 fasteners.

#11 and 12 here:  http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t207600.gif
was used up to vin 2x6 2035 000.  Your 78 only uses #2 and #14.

Karl is correct, my 77 just had these two.  The panel may require some persuasion with a soft mallet.  Also it has a rubber/plastic seal at the top which will likely be destroyed.  You can buy these cheap online.

The front screw threads into a matching machined hole in the panel, the rear screw has a little clip attached to the panel...don't lose the clip.
