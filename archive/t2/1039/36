Greg: Re your firing problem: Here is a message that I copied from a 
list years ago and stored in my troubleshooting file. FWIW.

NOT FIRING ON 1 AND 2 You have an intake leak for sure. My bug did 
the same thing. It is sucking major air and likely not even firing on 
that side.(explains the cool head.) Retorque those nuts and if that 
doesn't do it you will have to take off the intake and put in a new 
gasket..
