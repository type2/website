Subject: Rear torsion tube turned in frame: fatal problem or worth

Hi Type 2 gang.  A fellow has purchased a 1976 Westy.  Unfortunately the tube
in which the torsion bars are inserted broke off the frame on the sides (has
twisted in the frame).

Frame under the cargo area looks good, axle beam seems perfect, body is 4/10,
rear frame need fixing but I saw worse.

Anybody has already fixed such a thing ?

Would you say it is a very sensitive area and repair is beyond reasonable ?

Any reference about correction, welding, reinforcing ?

I believe the guy has pay too much for a van in such a condition but now any
help will be appreciated to help revive this camper van.
