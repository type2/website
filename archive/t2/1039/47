Subject: Can you replace Shift Coupler w/o pulling Tranny or shift rods?

Hi All,

In the spirit of reviving the list, here's a question that might be a  
duh, but hopefully I am missing something simple here.
  65 bus-engine out-3 new tranny mounts in place-discovered og shift  
coupler sheared in half  (-at-) the rubber joint.  Removed old & want to  
install new WW version, but not enuf room w/o something moving more-I  
have shifted to 2nd to give moi room, but still not enuf.  Is there  
any easy way that I am not seeing to install-Bentley &  Muir don't  
help much.

YMMV,

Tom Buese
