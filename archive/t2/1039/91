Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump discrepancy

Is it possible you are comparing a Alternator FP (uses
shorter FP Push Rod)and a a generator FP?....The Alt
style is offset for extra clearance...the Push rods
are different about  6mm (I think) in length...if you
are using a Gen Style push rod (longer) on a Alt fuel
Pump it will damage the alt pump....but the other way
around....No gas.....Tony
