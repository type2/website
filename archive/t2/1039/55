Subject: auxiliary air valve

is the auxiliary air vavle on the 75 FI bus engine interchangeable
with any other FI aircooled vw engine?  found some rebuilt python
units on jc whitney reasonably priced, but none are listed for the 75
FI bus engine.

 would the 1974 411 FI model work?  i thought these were the same
basic engines.

thanks,

jeremiah
