Subject: Re: [T2] T4 Case Can it be used?

As mentioned, the crank is offset ground (meaning the journals are smaller on the 2.0 allowing them to be ground on the same sort of crank billet but out for a further stroke) so any T4 case of any year can within reason be swapped to any other using stock strokes (this is all well documented on the Type2.com site BTW.)  You can actually stroke to about 78mm with offset grinding 2.0 journal size and still run stock rods by clearancing the rods only (though a lot of the rod bolt head does go away.)  There are case differences from obvious (914 and 411/412 oil filler locations vs bus, vanagon case breather cast in, dipstick locations) to moderately obvious (single vs dual relief, boss for mechanical fuel pumps drilled/used in early bus, windage trays in 914s) to more subtle (1.7 or 1.8? to 2.0 extra resevoir pocket in case causing difference in lengths of oil pickup tubes, 8mm vs 10mm mounting bar holes for bus to vanagon case.)  BUT given a matched set of case specific stuff
 (the oil pickup, relief valves, breather) any set of internals can be built in any case and about any case can be used in any vehicle using a T4 with mostly minimal if though sometimes irritating minor solutions .  You may have to fill the oil from an odd location or have a dipstick where you aren't expecting it, or have to block a fuel pump hole, or drill out some holes on your mounting brackets, but you CAN use the case.  My $0.02 anyway.
       Now could the original guys specific case be used in a general sense, assuming it cleaned up well enough, sure.
