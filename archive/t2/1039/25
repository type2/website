Subject: Seeking Westy Storage in Vancouver

I working on a cross country trip plan (Toronto - Vancouver), I'd like to
leave my 75 Westfalia in Vancouver from Aug 22 until late October (while I
go to NZ). Prefer indoor storage.  Can anyone help me out or point in
toward a storage company?  I understand this might not be cheap. A parking
garage would be ideal.

Thanks,
James
