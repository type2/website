I have a 78 automatic.  2 liter but the auto is the difference here
the 1.8 and the 2.0 really are not that much different in driving
specs

new rebuilds (first 3k miles or so) are tighter until broken in so run
a little warmer. (I also have VDO guages)

I try to never ever let mine get over 250F, at about 240 I slow down,
I have found that my engine cools best at around 58mph (this is a
trial and error sort of thing until you figure out your bus)

sounds good to me

I prefer synthetic once I am broken in. run dino only the first 3k
miles or so

I don't have a head temp guage.

they may or may not read high, they are often inaccurate but they are
consistent.  I have an infrared temp sensor and will sometimes compare
my guages with actual readings to get a feel for them.  with VDO
guages you know your engine and you mainly watch for trends or "out of
normal" readings.

except for oil temps I would be happy with your readings, I would
double check the oil temp with a known guage or other means to figure
out how your  guage is reading.  personally I start getting nervous
when my guage gets over 235 or so.
