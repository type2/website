Subject: Re: [T2] 2 liter rebuild

They're pretty much bullet-proof as far as the bottom
ends. That is, however what the final demise of my T-4
was. I over-revved it. I felt a kind of a shudder when
it happened and then again quite a few times over the
next ten years or so. That bottom end got fitted with
stock top end, wild 96's with 11:1 CR, something
in-between, and finally died with a stock top end on
it. Apparently when it was over-revved the crank
actually started whipping. The center main was all
hammered out of position. Amazing how many years it
ran that way - all of them very hard mileage!

Be sure to use the correct O-ring there (oil pickup
tube-to-case) cuz if it's wrong, the pump will lose
prime and you'll have to carry a turkey baster with
you and remove the oil pressure light sender and
squirt oil in the hole until the pump is full! You
might suspect I have a pretty good story to go with
that! -BaH

 I have built many type 1 engine, and was very
 suprised to find the crank
 condition.  I have measured, calibrated the
 micrometer, measured again, used
 the caliper, and borrowed my neighbors, and the
 crank is coming out as
 standard size.
 
 Does the oil filter really help that much, and keep
 them that clean, that
 standard cranks are still around after all these
 years?  IS this common
 place on type 4's?
 
 Also if anyone has an oring for the original oil
 pump, that they did't use
 on their build, let me know if you would not mind
 putting it in the mail for
 me.
