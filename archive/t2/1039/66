Subject: timing help

I have a 72 1700. The distributor is 180 off, had to move all the plugs around to get it to run. Do I have to time it different also? Set at 5ATDC it doesnt run worth a crap. barely Idles sputters and pops when I accelerate, if I advance it way up it seems to run fine.
  Any suggestions?
  Thanks,
  Ed
