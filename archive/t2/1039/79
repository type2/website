You could try out BustedBus.com in Golden Colorado. He might have something
or may have a line on something. It may be cheaper to take your top to a
boat repair facility and have the glass fixed than to spend your time
swapping tops and driving around the West to find one! Most of the ones I
have seen are only in fair condition unless they have been out of the sun
for 30 some years...

Good Luck,

Subject: [T2] Replacement Poptop Needed

The poptop on my '77 Westy was cracked at the rear corners when I 
bought it.  I'm looking to replace it rather than try to fix it.  
Although I've done some fiberglass work in the past, the substrate on 
this roof looks like a poor candidate for restoration.  Anybody got 
a '77 or '78 salvage bus with a decent roof?  Anybody know of a 
salvage yard with a decent pop top?  Close to Wyoming?

Thanks all,

Ben
