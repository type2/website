Exactly the problem I ran into.  The heads had been fly-cut so deeply  
that the
ridge above the upper cylinder fin was bottoming against the head  
casting ..
before the top edge of the cylinder met the sealing surface inside  
the head.
Which caused "air leakage" (compression loss) in the barrel-to-head  
area.

Pulled the heads & cylinders and tried to lap the cylinders into the  
heads
(this was a freshening of the engine, not a rebuild), and that's how  
I found
the clearance .. issue.  Which lead to a call to AVP the next day to  
complain
about heads that were fly-cut too deeply during their rebuilding  
process,
and then was told the little detail about needing to use gaskets.

I'd imagine that you could probably trim that ridge off on a lathe to  
get
enough depth  into the head, but at that point is it really worth the  
bother?
