Mike, the outside armrest (door side) will not fit, as the armrest on the 
door is in the way. I simply removed that one, and kept the inboard ones in 
my 77 Westy. Check it out for yourself. I guess you could remove the door 
armrests, but how would you close the door then? Other than that, my vanagon 
seats just slid right into the tracks on my 77.
Take care,
Courtney
