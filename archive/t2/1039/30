Subject: 1972 Dual carb brake booster hose

Hi Volks,

I have an engine here I'm reassembling and I am having some trouble 
figuring out where stuff goes. It's originally from a 1974 westy, but it 
came with a lot of spare parts and I am not 100% sure which parts are 
original to it and which aren't.

But...

The front tin (firewall) on the engine that came with this engine has no 
hole on the 3/4 side for the brake booster hose. It does have the large 
square hole on the 1/2 side for the preheater tube, and there are some 
extra holes on that side that I could use; but the booster balance pipe 
that I have doesn't exit there, it exits on the 3/4 side.

Do I need a different brake booster balance pipe? Although I did own a 
72 westy a little over 20 years ago I have no memory of how the brake 
booster hose was routed.

I checked ETKA 7, but there are no diagrams of the PDSIT carbs there, 
and the pics at ratwell.com don't show the brake booster hose.

Also... does anyone out there have a spare set of oil-bath air cleaner 
supports available?

Happy Trails,
