Subject: Re: Need help removing sliding door runner cover

Bret said: I am perplexed, and could use a little help. In trying to remove
the sliding door outside runner cover, I am stuck. In section 5.10, Bentley
describes three Phillips head screws that hold the cover on the body. Two on
the underside (I got these off), and one at the front of the cover. I don't
have this screw that they picture. Bentley also pictures a retaining strip
with a Phillips head screw. I don't have this either. Lastly, Bentley also
mentions a nut and bolt that need to be removed from inside the passenger
compartment, but I'll be darned if I can find it...

------------------------------------------------------

Bentley does not get year specific. The nut and bolt was on the early bay.
Late bay just has 2 fasteners.

#11 and 12 here:  http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t207600.gif
was used up to vin 2x6 2035 000.  Your 78 only uses #2 and #14.
