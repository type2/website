does the vacuum can on the distributor have one nipple or two?  only
set it 5ATDC if the vacuum can has two vacuum nipples.  if the can has
only one, the advance, set the timing to 7.5BTDC.  or better yet check
out this site,http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm.  take the
numbers off your distributor and vacuum can and match them up to the
chart.  set the timing to your distributor not your engine.  to get
the numbers you may have to pull the dizzy from the engine.

if the dizzy vacuum can has both an advance and retard nipple but the
retard is not working you may still have to set the timing to 7.5BTDC.
 hopefully the list will correct me were i am wrong and clarify where
i am fuzzy.
