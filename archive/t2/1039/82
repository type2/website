Subject: 22nd Annual Twin Cities VW Show, Free this year!

OK everyone.  It's time again the Twin Cities (MN) Volkswagen Club  Annual Show!  This is the 22nd one and this year the is no charge for specttators nor for show cars.  There is a charge for swap spaces and cars that are for sale.

This is the break down of the Type II classes:
 
1951 to 1967 
1968 to 1979
1980 to  1991
 
I got them to do it this way so Vanagons weren't competing with Splits.
 
So, with all these Type II classes, bring yours in!  There are 1st  through 3rd place trophies for all classes.
 
The date is Sunday 1 June from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm and it is a Westside Volkswagen's new New Car dealership on the west side of County Road 100, south of I-394, in Saint Louis  Park on Westside Drive.
 
Hope to see you there!

P.S.
Could someone forward this to the Vintage Bus list,  please?  Thanks!
