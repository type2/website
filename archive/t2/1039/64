Subject: rough idle while cold.

Hello list,

My 74 2.0 fuel injected bus is running rough while cold. After about
10 minutes or running it smooths out nicely and idles near perfect...
but until then its pretty rough, exactly like a vacuum leak, which I
assume it is.

Where should I look next time I get in there? My gut tells me the aux
air valve. anything else that could cause this?


thanks list!
