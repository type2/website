Subject: FOUND! -  Looking for a front-end clip for a 78 bus 

After a bit of searching, I found a clip over at Small Parts Connection 
up in Hesparia, CA.  It's in perfect condition and still had the 
original paint.  My metal shop guy was pretty impressed by the quality.

I got a buncha other things, too.  I bought some vanagon seats with 
armrests to put in my 78 (my friend said it would work).  I also got 
some vanagon self-adjusting drum brakes for my 78 per Karl's 
recommendation in his article on type2, too.  Cant wait to try out my 
new toys!

Thanks,
Mike
