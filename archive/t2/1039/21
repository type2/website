Subject: Re: what size screw?

  I'm attempting to remove the engine compartment door on my '78 Westy. The
famous screw on the left is frozen solid and it looks like I'm going to have
to drill it. What size is it so that I can have the proper tap and replacement
on hand. Thanks guys. ------------------------------
