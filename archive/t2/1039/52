Mike, you got lucky.

I went through the same wringer that Bob did with AVP heads and gaskets
last March.  They were real polite on the phone and sent the gaskets
free-of-charge via Priority Mail, but it would have been much better  
if the
gaskets had been included with the heads, or at minimum a note in the
box about them being required.  Much aggravation from many people
could be saved with a little slip of paper...

Being a mechanical masochist, I pulled the heads with the engine  
installed
in the Bus.  In the driveway, in the rain.  It was teh sux0rz..
