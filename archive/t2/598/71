Bad = stuck in the compressed position?

I would NOT recommend this. With some weird luck, the lifter starts to work
again...

If you've got a working lifter, this should be no problem on a type4 engine
(I guess we're talking about a type4 because of the hydraulic lifters):
Jack up the bus, remove tire. Remove valve cover, remove rocker assembly.
Remove tin mounted to heat-exchanger and engine. Take out the pushrod, then
remove the tube (gentle turning and pulling). Using a small magnet you
should be able to pull out the lifter (you can also try to remove it with
your finger or something else that you can put in the small hole on top of
the lifter to get it out).

Installation is reverse of removal.
