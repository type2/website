Subject: Window installation issue resolved

A couple weeks ago, I posted about some "abnormally stubborn gaskets" which would not get flush with the lip all the way around, even with copious amounts of silicone lubricant. I would like to tell you how we overcame this stubborness. Under the advice of a guy named Joe Little, we soaked each gasket it hot water for about 10 minutes before installation. As far as temperature of the water was concerned, he said, "As long as you can put your hand in it, it's safe for the gasket." After soaking in the water, I dried the gasket all around and then applied the lubricant. As a result, the gasket popped in all the way around with little resistance. I hope this information is helpful to someone and thanks to all of you who offered your advice.                   -Paul Deatherage
