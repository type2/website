Subject: front door rubber

Evening; 

Just installed a new, expensive OEM German front door seal from OEVeedub.
Fit and contour appear identical to the original that I removed, including
the rubber triangles in the corners, etc.

My problem is this - it's _really_ hard to close the door completely. I
know these seals will settle over time, but I have to SLAM the door to
make it close flush. I wouldn't normally be overly concerned, except that
this is really supposed to be the correct seal and I want to make sure
things are right. 

Normal? Or is this a problem? 

Thanks, 
Dan
