Subject: Re: [T2] LPG heater options - 84 Westy

I second the Olympian.  I also bought one on Ebay, and have it setup in
between the driver and passenger seat, behind the center chest/garbage can
thingy.  I plumbed it into the existing heater gasline that my bus had for
it's old forced air furnace (Anyone have one of those that still work by the
way, made by coleman?  Let me know if you want to sell one!).  It heats the
bus VERY well, and is relatively child safe with it's safety shutoffs and
what not.
