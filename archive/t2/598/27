After you have done what Harry said to do, put the bus
in netural, set the parking brake and chock the
wheels. Disconnect the battery. Crawl under the bus on
the passenger side by the rear wheel and check the
wires on the starter. The small one(female
connection)from the Ign switch, make sure it has a
good contact. The big wires coming from the
battery,alternator and other things that are connected
to the big bolt(8mm with a 13mm nut on it) on top of
the solenoid make sure the connections are clean.
Connect the battery and try to start it.. Phil
