You can afford new dual carbs! See below.

What you are looking at Chris is the infamous Weber Progressive carb. I have
one, he has one, she has one, we all have one. It's the most popular
replacement carb for a pancake engine. It has it's slight downfalls, but I
have been using one for 4 years and like it ok. It's not that bad. This carb
is one of the subjects that come up on the list pretty frequently, and
everyone has a pretty stong opinion, for or against. Check the archives for
more info.

However, you can afford new dual carbs. The carbs you have been looking at
(new) for 600-1000 are probably the Weber's and they are expensive and
pretty large. But Solex makes a complete, BRAND NEW 34mm dual carb setup for
our buses for $319, the same price as the Weber Progressive, plus you get an
electric choke, unlike a lot of those big dual carbs you have seen! These
are at CBPerformance, but CP1 may carry them too. Here is a link for the
CBPerformance page:
