I lost the same bolt on mine, I have guages and it was the dead of winter
and about 5F degrees when it happened, the engine shot up from 190 to 250
in less than a mile, which is about what it took to get to a safe spot to
stop.  I heard the bolt come off so I know exactly where it happened,

fixed the bolt, waited about a half hour for the engine to cool a bit
(maybe the most nerve wracking half hour in recent memory) but engine
started right up and has run fine since...

mine is also a 78FI with auto tranny
