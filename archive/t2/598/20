Subject: Re: [T2] Geostar Tires ?

> I was getting rather high prices on tires for my 1969 Bay but happened to look 
 at the SAM's Club website... there I ordered some Goodrich LT tires in an 
 appropriate size for pickup in Dover, Delaware.  The store called promptly; 
 price was about $65 each, roughly half what I was being quoted elsewhere.  I 
 can get you the specifics if you are interested.  Load range is C according to 
 the Goodrich website; presumably this is OK since vehicle is not a camper.
  ------------------------------------------------------

Here we go again......  Load range C ONLY means it is 6 ply rated. Probably is a 4 ply tire.

You NEED to know the max load weight rating on the sidewall.

LT tires are usually too low! and they do not have reinforced sidewalls.
