Yes!

It's been twice that I noticed something was wrong with my valves just by 
the sound of them.
The first time I found the adjusting screw of the intake valve on #4 
completely out and resting on the cover.
I had to bike 40 miles to find a replacement at a shop that works on 
aircooled engines south of Boston :-P since
none of the FLAPS or VW dealers around had them.

The second time, one of the washers holding the rocker arm shaft for #1 and 
2 broke and the nut unscrew itself off the stud. Again, I found the nut and 
the broken washer resting on the valve cover
It scares me how much damage could've been caused by a 5 cents part failing...
