Subject: A new battery is not necessarily a charged battery

When you buy a new battery, most of the time it is charged. Sometimes 
it isn't. New is one thing, charged is another. For all you know, the 
store owner used the battery you're buying to run his boat all weekend.

(True story: I worked in a bookstore in the 70s that had a code: when a 
customer asked for a book instead of finding it himself, you were 
supposed to call back to another clerk to "bring the preferred copy" of 
whatever. "Preferred copy" meant which ever one was most banged up, or 
the copy that a clerk -- not me! -- took home to read on the hopper 
overnight.)

Never leave a FLAPS or other place without having a clerk check the 
electrolyte level and the charge of a new battery. And watch them while 
they check.
