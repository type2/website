Subject: Safe, not Sound

Hello All,
Back safe from a very nice vacation, but regrettably had to be towed home.
I may use some incorrect terms, so please bare with me.
The bolt that holds the pulley attached to the crankshaft came out.  I
traveled maybe 3 miles before I had the idiot likes go on, and saw smoke in
the mirrors.
After attaching the bolt and pulley, I attempted to make it home.  It ran
horrible.  This is a 78 2.0L, FI.
Questions.. would I have done any serious damage without the fan belt and
pulley turning for 4 miles?
Where do I look first for issues?
I believe it is hydraulic valves in a GE case.

Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III
