Subject: Safe but not sound

Hello all knowing,
I am here to tell you that a white collar worker has NO business dressing up
as a mechanic and attempting to work on his VW.
I wanted to check the compression and adjust these hydraulic valves.
Some wise man once said, "put a pencil in the cylinder to find TDC"... well
I snapped the damn thing, had it caught, not once but twice.  Decided I had
TDC and commenced to adjusting a hydraulic valve.  Never done this before!
I messed with number one, and got nervous, and quit.
I think I have it too tight, there is more thread showing than before I
started.  I unscrewed it all the way, and turned it towards the valve until
it touched, and then two full turns after.
The compression came out better tonight than when we did it 3,000 miles ago.
In May, 1=112 2=110 3=104 4=112 tonight 1=120 2=110 3=110 4=110.  Go
figure??
I tightened everything up and wanted to start it.  No business!  It would
maybe start, but not run.
Ideas??
Incidentally, the timing scale got demolished when the fan came off (you
know that little cheap ass plastic scale attached to the fan cover)  How do
you time this thing?
It is a 78 2.0L FI, automatic if that matters.
Thanx in advance folks!!!

Beep Beep,
