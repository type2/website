Dan,

Didn't use the oevduub seals but had the same problem...do you have the 
same problem with the window open?

If so, it's just the seals and if you close the door firmly it will close.

I put mine over a year ago and they are just now loosening up...this is 
good!  Do check your clearance though just in case.

Cheers, dave
