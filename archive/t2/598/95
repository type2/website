Subject: oh no, not another TDC thread....

I've spent the day searching the archives, the web and Hoover trying to
get all of my answers. Unfortunately, where one bit of advise stops,
another starts, and rarely is it clear if the authors are talking about
pancake motors or upright motors. I have the classic type4 (pancake)
motor with many PO marks on the fan pulley. I've read about the classic
pencil / dowel / screwdriver in the #1 hole trick, but the description
of that test always stops just short of saying where on the pulley to
make the mark (or, it isn't clear what motor is being discussed). So,
on the type4 motor, if I find TDC through observing the #3 valves, the
#1 valves, by the "drawing a line from the tick in the hub" trick or by
the "object in the #1 hole" trick, do I mark the pulley at the point
where the case halves meet, at "12 o'clock" or at the "0" on the timing
scale? Once that mark has been made, do I measure 3/8" (wonder why this
isn't in mm) clockwise around the pulley to make the timing mark? If
this is clearly described somewhere (like Muir's book) I apologize for
the FART. Once this is really clear, the answer would be a handy
addition to the "drawing a line to find the magical-mysterious FIF
timing mark" library entry.
My motor runs, but not that well. By moving the dizzy from the timed
location, I can improve its performance, so I figure I must be relying
on a bad mark for my timing. Oh, and I want to get the valves adjusted
right. Driving a few miles at a time as a daily driver is one thing.
Going on a camping trip into the mountains leaves far less tolerance
for SWAG's.
