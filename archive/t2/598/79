it's the smoke in the mirrors that worries me about this scenario.

which idiot light came on, by the way? the "GEN" light should have come on
as soon as the pulley/fan stopped turning.

if you had the OIL light come on after 3 miles of no fan, i am afraid that
chances are good the engine has been severely overheated. this would also
imply the GEN light was not working properly.
