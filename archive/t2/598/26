Subject: rear speaker installation in a 70 westy

My stepdaughter wants to add rear speakers to the 70 Westy to  be able to 
blast music.
I remember seeing someone's web page with a great stereo  installation, but 
cannot find it in the type2 archives.
Does anyone have pictures of rear speaker  installation?
