Subject: Missing water filler key, 84 Westie

Took our newly-acquired 84 Westie on a weekend camping trip. Jeepers, 
these vehicles are bit underpowered, but the plucky camper made it all 
the way up the Tejon Grade out of the San Fernando Valley, to the upper 
Kern River and back with no problems. Had to draft behind semis up the 
grades at 40mph in 100 degree weather, but no overheating.

One issue surfaced: when it came time to put water into the water tank, 
I discovered that none of the three keys that came with the Westie fit 
the filler cover. We filled the tank via its cleanout hole on the 
camper's interior.

I'd like to fix this minor issue -- ideas?
