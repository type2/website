Subject: front bumper license plate holder...'71 bus

    About 15 years ago my license plate bracket on the front bumper broke. I 
took
the plate off and set it on top of my dash. I'm getting sick of looking at it 
when I
drive.  Does anyone know of a source for the bracket that will fit in the 
factory
holes on the bumper.  I checked Busdepot online catalog with no luck.  Any 
help
appreciated.........
