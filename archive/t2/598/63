Subject: Ebrake help needed

Folks, I have been trying to get this straight for a few weeks now.  I just
got some replacement parts from Busted Bus.

Prior to these parts, If i pulled the ebrake it would hold and then start
"popping" off the ratcheting mechanism thus giving me no real ebrake.

From prior help postings, i figured the notched shaft was worn, and thus
ordered it, and a new collar for it too.

I installed all, and now the ratched does not even want to hold it at
all..ant my old notched shaft was sort of bent up, too, so thought for sure
it would have been the problem.

I looked at the finger that is supposed to engage the notched shaft, and it
seems to be pliable and its spring is still intact..............Any ideas
out there on how to make this thing function?
