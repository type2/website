Hi Bernd,

Wow! Did he buy it in Germany and brought it to Peru?
It doesn't look like a typical South American
Made-in-Brazil bus (splitwindow bus with new
"non-split" front)

If your bus was assembled in Germany I can decipher a
lot of facts on your car by looking at the so called
M-plate. This plate is fixed behind the drivers seat
and has production information on it.

It sure looks like a 1969 model because:

- it has a dashboard painted in the body colour (this
was only done in modelyears 1968 and 1969, since 1970
they are black).
- there is a metal wall in between the gas tank and
the engine. This was done since the spring/summer of
1968.
- the 3rd digit of the chassisnr is a '9' meaning it
is from modelyear 1969.
- The inner rear-view mirror has a long standard and
has a vinyl cover instead of being chromed. (chromed
is 1968 only and a few cars in 1969, in 1970 they came
with mirrors that had a short standard)
- the sun vizors cover the entire lenght from the
window side to the standard of the inner rear view
mirror. in 1968 this wasn;t the case and in 1970 the
shorter standard of the mirror required different
shaped sun vizors.

...and there is more. But I will not exhaust you with
all those details ;-)

22 = VW microbus standard version
1 = left hand drive, sliding door right

It sure is a 1969 baywindow. Look very much German.
The plate says 'Made in Germany', but if you want to
know if it is assembled in Germany as well you have to
look if the M-plate is there, it should be fixed on
the metal wall behind the drivers seat. If there are
just two holes and no plate....than is was assembled
somewhere else. I am very curious to that. Especially
becuase I am researching the meaning of the codes on
this plate.

By the way. The plastic cap you see here originally
was positioned in the trunk :-D
