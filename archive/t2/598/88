Subject: Re: [T2] LPG heater options - 84 Westy

I installed an Olympian propane heater in my bus and it works great. It is
teed off from the Westy propane tank (going to the stove). This brand is
commonly used in RV's. Don't foget you must vent the bus (fresh air) with a
propane type heater. Here are some pics:
