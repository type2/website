Subject: RE: [T2] Missing water filler key, 84 Westie

Any ideas??

Yes.

Remove the lock and take it to a competent lock smith to re-key.

To remove the lock, you unscrew the plastic fitting from the side of the 
Vanagon.

Then pull out the umbiliical cord(s) and remove them from the plastic 
fitting.

Now you will have access to the back of the lock.  There is a simple NUT 
that has to be unwrenched.  But there is a locking tab on the simple nut 
that has to be unbent to allow the nut to be unwrenched.

There are three pins to this lock.  Each pin has five possible settings.  
5x5x5=125 settings possible.

The key blank is quite rare and pricey.

If you need  additional info or help that is not found in the archives, 
pmail me.
