Subject: T2 valuation

Hi
I am currently in dispute with my insurer about the
value of my 1970 Westie. It is free of all structural
rust with a recon engine and is 3/4 way through a resto.
They say its worth 700 pounds and therefor not worth
repairing. Can you provide any Ad's or documentation
supporting the uniqueness of the 1970 T2. I have asked
them to find 1970's for the price and they cannot but
will not accept that this is due to the rarity of this
years model etc.

Any help would be of assistance
Regards
Niall O'Brien
