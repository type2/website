Subject: Friend with bad lifter

A friend from NH USA is stuck in cape breton with a bad #3 lifter. Says it is the one on the right.

Says the engine is a rebuilt '77 with hydraulic lifters put in.

It was suggested that he tighten down the screw on the lifter. He has not.

Can we do the repair at the campground?
