Depending upon your sound level needs, you may find the die-cast
aluminum-cased speakers to be better than big speaker boxes.  No, you
don't get the thump-thump bass, but you save a lot of space and even have
the option to move the speakers outside while camped to annoy your
neighbors!  My own setup simply had two of these speakers sitting at the
ends of my home-made parcel shelf.
