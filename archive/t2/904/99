wow, that's a ton of carb for a 1600!!  I have dual 36's on my 1776 with 
big valve+ported 041 heads. . . my starting procedure:

-I have a separate switch for my coil--I leave it OFF and crank for 
about 6-8 seconds to build up oil pressure through my full flow remote 
filter

-when I see oil pressure start to rise on my gauge I pump the pedal 
~twice to get some gas in there and turn the coil ON to fire.

-after the 2 pumps I usually hold down the pedal 1/5 to 1/4 (think maybe 
~4mm at the throttle plate) till it fires, this will give the engine a 
more balanced mixture plus some air to lean out the ton of gas I just 
pumped in there with the two strokes.   Once  engine roars I have to 
goose it a little for about 20-30 seconds till it will hold idle.

. . . because I have found that DRLAs on my engine tend to run VERY rich 
at low idle (throttles closed with miniscule gap, synched with 
synchrometer, CB sez starting point is 0.004") even once the mix is 
tuned down for a snappy off-idle transition, maybe I don't have the 
right jets but let's face it, these are huge carbs compared to a stock 
single 34. I use 60 idle jets.  if you don't hold the pedal down a 
little bit it will be getting a very rich mixture.

as a corollary--for hot start, it is easy to flood with too much gas, so 
what I do is push the pedal down halfway (only once and hold) and start 
cranking, when it sees a lean enough mixture it will roar to life.  
pumping more than once will cause the cranking time to increase before 
all the excess raw gas is blown out. . . YMMV

that reminds me I still need to lean my mixture for my new 6300' 
altitude. . .
