Actually, I've done quite a bit of aluminum welding with a mig - I
used to build livestock trailers for a living.  You use argon as a
shielding gas.  Apparently helium can be used as well but, I don't
have any experience with it.  Aluminum welds very cleanly with no
splatter if your machine is set up properly.
