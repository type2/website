Subject: timing question

Hello List,
I am having a hell of a time trying to time my recently purchased 78 bus with
79 rebuilt GE motor and 1975/1976 SVDA distributor 0231 181 012..Hope this
doesn't sound too redundant to you all, but here it is:

Start up bus
Vacuum at 17Hg  when warm
Once warm, put on tach/dwell meter and attach strobe
Check: Advance is teed with fuel pressure reg. and throttle vac, Retard is
teed with plenum, decel and AFM housing - all new vacuum lines.
tach is a little low, bring it up to 850 to 950 using the idle mixture screw
and set the notch to 5 ATDC using the strobe, and alrightythen.

Throttle and observe the advance mechanisms. Okay, advance works, about 20
degrees over to 15 BTDC at 2000 RPMs and let go of throttle, now she's
backfiring a lot more than before. NOW WAIT why won't it return to 5 ATDC? It
takes forever (at least one minute) to get kinda close, maybe 4 ATDC or 3 ATDC
and the RPMs have increased a little, but dont remain steady.. On the next
open throttle, she returns to near 0 TDC and the RPMs are pushing 1000 now.
Try it again or do a road test - the power is low, and will stall, and even
give a little protest or two to start back up. Dang! Lift hood, attach strobe
and tach/dwell - Where is 5 ATDC and 850/950 RPM? Not even close to accurate
unless I've stalledl the bus and had to restart it.

Is it the idle speed? Is it the new Pertronix ignition install affecting RPMs?
Try to remove the mechanical advance, and turn the RPM down to 600, now it
will behave more accurately going up and down. But then the idle is so damn
low, it will often peter out on decel or at a stop, or is hard starting, etc..
Is this a sticking distributor plate or centrifical weights? Or the
wrong/broken distributor for my bus? Why won't this thing return accurately
and relatively quickly when I set it during recommended RPMs? How should the
notch move at idle speed with a SVDA?
The Muir oral method for testing the vacuum canister mechanisms proves they
work OK, but are kinda sticky, definitely not smooth, the rotor snaps back OK
from a twist, a little oil under the old points plate, which is bouncy not
solid, and there has been no dust cover or felt in the dizzy for who knows how
long.

Background:
1979 GE California motor, 1978 everything else (it smogs as a 1978 with the
EGR on) and was set a 7.5 BTDC with retard plugged by PO - til now.
1975/1976 dizzy 012  put in by PO (with rebuild, i guess)
Pertronix just installed
Coil, cap, rotor, spark plugs, wires, fuel lines, Temp Sensor II all replaced.
Compression good all four < 125.

 I'm at a loss, and basically new to VW land. Any suggestions? Thanks, list. I
apprecite you.
