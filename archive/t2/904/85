Subject: westfalia tent for sale

Hi Volks

   We have a westfalia Add-a-room tent for sale.(sadly we sold the bus and
hence have little use for the tent)
It is a yellow and blue 70s vintage tent in excellent condition. All bug
screens and zippers intact. All poles present. Fully waterproof (we know from
experience).

$950 canadian.
We are on Vancouver island.
