Subject: No idle/hard restart at operating temp - the saga continues...

I made an initial post a few weeks ago, but am just now getting time
to delve into this further. To recap, the bus fires up easily and runs
great when cold, but as soon as the motor warms up a bit it refuses to
idle and is difficult to restart. The bus in question is a stock '79
Westy with 2.0 FI and about 83k original miles.

Several replies were quick to warn of a cracked head or similar
problem, but the bus is *not* losing power, even after the symptoms
begin. As long as the RPMs are up, it runs great. But as soon as I
need to slow down for a stop sign etc., it dies and doesn't want to
restart.

Anyway, I elected to start with the fuel filter and a new temp sensor.
I got the parts today and prepared to dive in... and lo and behold the
existing sensor is unplugged! Question is, I don't know if it vibrated
loose or was intentionally disconnected at some point. Forgive my
ignorance, but this is the first time I've had to actually work on the
motor in nearly two years, so I never thought to check. Could the
thing run like it has (very well) without the sensor connected? I just
moved and can't find my Bentley manuals... does anyone have a pic or
diagram of where the sensor should plug into the harness? I can't find
any loose matching wires anywhere.

Also, the existing sensor nut appears to be something huge, like 25mm,
and the replacement Bosh part is 13mm. Do I have the wrong
replacement, or could this still be the right part? The bus has been
off the road for almost a month now, and I want to start driving it
again! Any insight or advice is much appreciated. TIA-
