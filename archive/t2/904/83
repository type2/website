I ahve some quick reference info (from memory) at this moment.  More
detailed info will have to follow tomorrow once I have the Bosch Fiche at my
fingertips:

VJR4BR18 = Bosch 0231 129 022, replaced by Bosch 0231 129 031.  Originally
fits Early 60s Porsche 356 and 67-69 Porsche 912.  Very similar to the 0231
129 010/019 distributor utilized on the 50s era Type 2, but has a much
sharper curve and comes on quicker than it's 010/019 cousin.  Some quick
timing specs below:

VJR4BR18 - Timed at 7.5 BTDC (-at-) 900rpm
1200rpm = 5 degrees advance
2200rpm = 20 degrees advance
2800rpm = 30 degrees advance

VJR4BR8/1 or 25/1 (019 or 010 respectively) - Timed at 7.5 BTDC (-at-) 900rpm on
original 36hp engine.  I recommend when using on a 1600 it be timed at
around 0 to 5 degrees BTDC.
1200rpm = 5 degrees advance
2200rpm = 15 degrees advance
2800rpm = 30 degrees advance

As noted above, the BR18 comes on a bit quicker and has been known to cause
detonation on VW 1600s, whereas on Porsche 1600s it works just fine because
this engine is more correctly setup at Porsche and for which the distributor
is designed for.  Thus, I don't recommend it for the street on VW engined
based vehicles, however, it's a screamer for the dragstrip.  Long haul high
RPM useage will tend to make the VW 1600 run hot most of the time.  I speak
from personal experience when I tried to use this distributor in a number of
VW 1600 street applications.  I went back to the stock distributor, which
is:
