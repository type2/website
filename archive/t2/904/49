    Actually the Tig is the way to go for body work. Not fast but much more
control, and far less distortion. But the fact is you need all three plus a
stick welder and Plasma Cutter to do complete auto work. Save up the bucks
and get the best machines you can afford the first time. Remember....buy
bigger size matters! You can always turn a machine down that's to big, but
if it wont penetrate, you can't turn up a machine that's to small for the
job.
    Funny thing is, once you buy a welder you will start to find all sorts
of welding jobs to do. Plus you'll have a whole new respect in the
neighborhood! "You know like that Bob guy on TV"!

Welders have hotter rods
