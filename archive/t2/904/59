Subject: Re: [T2] petrol tank sealing ?

hello Robt  What I do is take the tank to a radiator shop and have  them boil 
it out. I then use POR 15 gas tank sealer and tape the openings off  with 
duct tape and shake it all around. I then hang the tank so that all the  sealer 
will drain out the pour in spout. Unless you supply an air flow thur the  tank 
you will have to let it dry for about 3 days. You can speed this up using a  
vacuum cleaner on blow and sticking into the sender unit hole to get a good air 
 flow thur the tank. I also paint the outside of the tank with grey POR 15  . 
 I use old rubber inner tubes as the outside padding for the straps when  
reinstalling the tank.  later  Mark dearing
