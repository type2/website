 Hello List,
 I am having a hell of a time trying to time my
 recently purchased 78 bus with
 79 rebuilt GE motor and 1975/1976 SVDA distributor
 0231 181 012..Hope this
 doesn't sound too redundant to you all, but here it
 is:
 
 Start up bus
 Vacuum at 17Hg  when warm
 Once warm, put on tach/dwell meter and attach strobe
 Check: Advance is teed with fuel pressure reg. and
 throttle vac, Retard is
 teed with plenum, decel and AFM housing - all new
 vacuum lines.
 tach is a little low, bring it up to 850 to 950
 using the idle mixture screw
 and set the notch to 5 ATDC using the strobe, and
 alrightythen.

 Background:
 1979 GE California motor, 1978 everything else (it
 smogs as a 1978 with the
 EGR on) and was set a 7.5 BTDC with retard plugged
 by PO - til now.
 1975/1976 dizzy 012  put in by PO (with rebuild, i
 guess)
 Pertronix just installed
 Coil, cap, rotor, spark plugs, wires, fuel lines,
 Temp Sensor II all replaced.
 Compression good all four < 125.

Stop.
Correct the vacuum lines 1st.

Manifold vacuum: comes from the plenum between 1 and 2
runners. Vacuum at idle. Feeds the fuel pressure
regulator and the decel valve.

Ported vacuum: comes from the front of the throttle
housing [front is front]. No vacuum at idle, appears
when you open the throttle. Feeds the vacuum advance
and the EEC valve on the air cleaner.

Are you using the 78 or the 79 throttle housing? If
the 79, it has a dedicated vauum nipple JUST for the
vacuum retard on the distributor. That is the one that
goes to the 75/76 dual dist you are using. Mid 76-78
throttle housings do not have it. 

You have me confused when you say you are using the
75/76 SVDA..... the 75/early 76 dist is a DVDA dist.
It has a dual vacuum unit. 

If you are using the 78 throttle housing, I would not
connect the retard side to anything. Leave it open and
ime it to 7.5 BTDC.
