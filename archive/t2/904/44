Subject: Water tank removal ('79 Westy)

Group,

My water tank is leaking in my '79 Westy... not sure if it is pump, drain
valve or the tank.  So, I thought I'd remove the water tank to make it
easier to isolate and repair the problem... so, what's the easiest way to
take the tank out?

Thanks,

Wayne
