Folks,

Did you catch the reference from Robt to the stuff called
" Lumiweld".

Actually, in this country it is called "Alumiweld " and is available from 
the eastwoodco.com.  I read up on the tips and techniques section on their 
site and caught this reference.

"Think "steel" when you machine this material. It is HARD. Your drill will 
want to slide off the hard fillet into the soft aluminum. Your new thread 
is several times stronger than the original old threads."

Hmmmmm....sounds a lot easier than having to take a head to a machinist
when you strip a stud out of one.....and if a person was *really* serious 
about reworking their heads just once....well....do all of the stud holes 
with this stuff and you should never have to worry about them again.

Wonder how it would work to refill worn throttle bushing holes in carbs 
and then redrill them....if this stuff is lots harder than the carb "pot 
metal", then it would last a lot longer to keep the throttle bores from 
leaking as well.


Cheers, dave
