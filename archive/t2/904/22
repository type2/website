Subject: Re: [T2] Aux air regulator elbow

It's available all over. I just bought one at vwparts.net (their Huntington
Beach, CA store) for $8 yesterday (not kididng!)

The correct part number is 022 129 637, but 022 129 639 is identical as far
as I can tell (and that's the one I bought).

You may want to consider just installing a hose from the aux air regulator
to the S boot. That'll get you going anyway.


Can someone tell me whether the rubber elbow for the auxiliary air
> regulator on the fuel injected bus is available anywhere?  Part number?
