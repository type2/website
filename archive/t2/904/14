Hey guys,

    I have a few things I'm giving away. I've cleaned out my garage and I
can't bring myself to toss this stuff. I cannot ship any of it, but if you're
nearby and you want it, please let me know and I'll set it aside for you.

I have two middle windows (sliding door / side middle window). These are the
2/3rds windows that are used in conjunction with the smaller vent windows. I
have TWO of these. They ALSO come with a set of matching window rubber gaskets
from West Coast Metric. These are the Cal-Style window rubbers. They have
never been used other than the fact that I've wrapped the glass in them. They
were brand new, and then I decided to go with sliding windows in the middle
instead.


I also have a fully functional Pace Setter dual exhaust system for a 73-78
engine (I believe that's correct). It has surface rust, but it's otherwise
sound. It has dual chrome tips.

Please let me know if anyone wants these. I also have various other trim
pieces and whatnot.


I would really like to get rid of them by bulk pick-up day on August 28.


Thanks!

Todd
