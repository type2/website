Subject: Re: [T2] petrol tank sealing ?

I used an Eastwood kit, as we recommended to me by one of my powder
coaters.

There is a nice kit from POR 15:

I cannot say which is best.  Both are a bit of trouble to do.  I
bought the zinc paint for the outside as well from Eastwood, but it
seemed that it was about to rust (there was a small bit visible,
after a pretty short period of time), so I sprayed the outside with
Dupont Nason epoxy primer, then with a gloss black, which I did not
like, so I then sprayed it with Dupont ChromaOne single stage L90D,
finally, I am happy.

This is far more attention than a gas tank should get.  The outside,
anyway.  Hopefully, the inside coating will hold up.  I am thinking
that maybe the POR-15 is better, but I do not know why I think that.
