Anyone else confirm this?

I googled it and every ref is that you'll damage your charger if you do
so, and most chargers have reverse polarity safeguards.  No word on what
it might do bad to the battery... But I only looked at 5 pgs or so of
results...

I would imagine it would make a diff whether or not the battery had a
charge on it to begin with, but then that would imply that must drain
it, charge it reversed, drain it and then charge properly.

I dunno.  Sounds like a recipe for letting the smoke out...
