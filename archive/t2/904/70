Tracy -

See this link:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/wiring/69busfuses.jpg

All fuses are 8 amp (White)

1970 models have the 12 fuse style box and is an animal unto itself.

As far as a CORRECT wiring diagram for the 69 (actually Late 68-69), there
ain't one to be found as far as I have searched for the past several years
(I know I could be wrong..Mr. Atwell chime in please?).  The only diagram
listed most everywhere as 68-69 is actually early 1968 due to the
differences in the turn signal & hazard flasher circuits.  Early 68 used the
infamous 9 terminal flasher relay, but around the middle of 68 at VIN 2x8
220 000 they went to the 4 terminal flasher and the multi-terminal hazard
switch.
