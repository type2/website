All years of bay bus had from the factory crimped fuel line clips in some or
all locations. For the single carb buses, all the clips were crimp style
11.3mm. For dual carbs, all were crimped, some 11.3 some 14.5. With
injection, 75 had all crimped everywhere, even on the filter, sizes were
14.5 and 18.5. In 76 (I think) some of the clips on the rear side of the
firewall were screw clips. 77 on had all screw clips on the engine side of
the fuel ring, all others were still crimp clips.

I much prefer the crimped clips over the screw type. They are more secure
and never ever move or leak if installed correctly. For ease of servicing,
there are a few location that can use screw clips, namely the two front of
firewall ends of the fuel ring, this is good when pulling the engine. The
two on either side of the cold start valve can also be screw type, this is
good for bleeding the fuel pressure when needed.

We have a new supplier for all of our fuel clips and we should have an even
better selection than ever of exact OE fuel clips. I am going to update the
website with new items and new photos next week. We now have in stock the
exact screw type fuel clip (with the wide flare on the edge) used after 76.

Strange to note that on the injectors themselves, no clips are used, the
hose is simply press-fit on the barb of the injector with a metal collar.
When I replace fuel lines on a bus I always save the metal collars and
re-use them in this way.

I have all the photos needed for a new tech article on fuel line replacement
for injected bus, it will be published whenever I have time to complete
writing the article.
