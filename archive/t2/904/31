Folks,

OK, if no one has info on the diameters or thread sizes - can someone let me
know what types of heads the screws should have (i.e. hex, pan with
philipps, etc.) and if there are washers (I'm assuming flat washers).

Thanks again.

Can someone let me know what the correct screws for this task for both the
sides (2 on each side) and the ones near the windshield.  Along with the
screw thread, I would appreciate knowing length, the head type (hex or
Phillips or .) and what washers, if any, are to be used.
