Bob,

Wasn't there someone who finally figured out that one of their hoses from 
the tank to the fuel pump was collapsing on them?

1.  How about not just "checked" but "replaced".
2.  Something floating around in the tank that covers up the intake.
3.  Tank vent hole plugged or covered?
3.  Grounds all inspected/replaced?  Look at the wires where they are 
	crimped on.  
4.  Possibly the pertronix, although most folks insist that they
	don't go bad, just die.
5.  Wires to the fuel pump checked for tightness?
6.  Pertonix wires where they come out of the distributor not rubbing raw?
7.  Bad ignition switch intermittent connection?

Q.  Better or worse in the heat/cold?
Q.  Better or worse over smooth or bumpy roads?
Q.  When this happens, and you take it out of gear, does it die or idle?
	(yes I read that it never stalled).


Cheers ,dave
