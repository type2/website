Subject: Original fuel Line Clamps

I have a '79 Bus and would like to know what type of clamps were originally
used on our bus's FI fuel lines. were they screw clamps or, as I expect,
crimp clamps?

I ask because my fuel lines have screw clamps - so I think a PO has had the
lines replaced at least once.  Yes, I know I should probably replace them
again so I know that they good/new.  Until then - it would be nice to know
that my current fuel lines are not original 27 year old hoses.

Oh, BTW, I was looking at the Microfiche on Richard Atwell's site and was
wondering where the parts lists are for the fiche pictures.

TIA,

Wayne
'79 Westy
