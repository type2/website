  My bus will not run unless the key is held forward and kinda jiggled to keep
it forward. It is getting rapidly worse. Not fun to drive holding the key on.

  What is more likely, the electrical part with wires (easy), or the ignition
switch barrel (hard)? I'm thinking barrel. Anyone done it in the bus (steering
not removed)?

  TIA,

  Ric
