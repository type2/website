Subject: RE: Original fuel Line Clamps

There's also an article in the type2 library by yours truly.

It has lots of parts numbers (chart by Matt R.) and details.

I used MB fuel line and $1/ea screw clamps I got at a Euro-car repair shop.

That procedure was done 5+ years ago with no problems since.

I have a '79 Bus and would like to know what type of clamps were originally
used on our bus's FI fuel lines. were they screw clamps or, as I expect,
crimp clamps?
