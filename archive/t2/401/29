I'm not worried about crashes into flat solid walls. It's the offset 
crashes I would worry about. That big flat wall really spreads the energy 
of the crash.

Side crashes I'm not too worried about due to the axle and thus frame under 
me, rear enders are not a big worry with the rear end so far back and 
containing all the drivetrain.

Big spikes (hay carriers) and rollbacks I worry about! <grin>
