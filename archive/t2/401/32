"And that folks is what worries me the most about running 55 mph on
interstates where much of the traffic is running closer to 80 mph.
Folks driving too fast and not paying attention (the other guys -
not the VW drivers)."

I wonder if something may have happened to the tow vehicle's lighting?  If 
the lights were out back there, that might explain the collision.  Then 
again, so would lack of sleep.  Regardless, please triple check trailer and 
tow-vehicle lighting before embarking onto the highways and byways.
