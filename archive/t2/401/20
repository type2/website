What is "safe enough?"  That is something only you can determine.  I feel
fine with my daughters in my '71, but then I'm a very conservative driver.
I don't venture onto the highways at night and I tend to think that
everyone is out to hit me.  If there is a 2-lane alternative to the
interstate, I'll take it, not so much for safety as for driving enjoyment.

I think that the driver is a lot more important than the vehicle when
safety is concerned.  People get killed every day in brand new vehicles
because they don't pay attention to possible hazards.

As my father says, "the most important safety feature in any car is the
nut that holds the steering wheel."
