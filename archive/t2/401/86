Come on people.... as was with many of the episodes, it was all a ploy
so that Daphne and Fred could get some make-out time in the Mystery
Machine. I think it was Fred's little joke to see how silly of an errand
he could get Shag and Scoob to go on. "Oh no.... the Mystery Machine is
needs some radiator water (for my air cooled bus). Shag, Scoob, here's a
bucket (with a hole in it) and a box of Scooby Snacks. That old
abandoned Mansion on the hill probably has water. Hey Velma, I bet
there's a library room up there with some really groovy books. Daphne
and I will stay here with the Mystery Machine so nothing else happens to
it."

My 5 year old recently discovered Scooby Doo on video. We saw one in
which the
MM brokedown. Shaggy and Scoob were dispatched to fetch water for the
radiator,
which was  at the back of the van. Hmmm, maybe the MM was an early
prototype
for watercooled conversions. ;-)
