Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead AC

The AC units installed back then were all aftermarket units--it just
depended on who got the job of installing them. ( and by afterarket I
mean they wern't istalled at the factory--they were installed either by
the dealer or an outside source, as per the customer's order )

i kinda like the look of the underdash unit too--looks real nice,
matches the dash---
BUT--forget ever adding a parcel tray--the AC unit kinda absorbs this
area pretty good--:>(

It's interesting that you mention that. I've been considering installing
A/C in my transporter since I got it. It's more or less for HER, than it
would be for me. One of the ones I've seen was pretty large actually. It
attached to both overhead bars in the roof and had something like 8 or 9
air vents comming out the sides. It was an off-white, and I found it in
an old 1971 Transporter. 
The other one I've seen was MUCH smaller, and I DID see it in a
Westfalia. It looked like maybe a 1973+ Westfalia.. Orange, with the
matching plaid orange interior. This one, while it was smaller, looked
EXACTLY like the one in the 1971 Transporter, but it was shorter by
about half the length. 
Other than that, the only other A/C system I've seen was one that I
snagged. It was an extension of the dash-board... it ACTUALLY attaches
to the underside of the factory dash. It contains the A/C radiator
thingys (?? what are they called?) and about 6 A/C vents. I also grabbed
the matching BOSCH A/C compressor too. Luckily enough, the clutch on the
compressor seems to be fine. I didn't get the lines though.. :( 
Luckily enough, the A/C control unit that I got matches the dash of my
car TO THE T! It's made out of the same material... I'd guess it was
factory except that there's a little emblem on it that says PBI or
something... Even the buttons match the dash!

Subject: Overhead AC 
All this talk of consoles and the pic that was posted got me thinking
about the 
stock overhead AC system for the bus. Does anybody know if it will fit
in a Westy? I've found one in my local boneyard in good condition and
was thinking 
about the feasability of installing it.
