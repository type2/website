Subject: ACs in early bay westies

Someone mentioned AC units being placed in the sink cabinet in early bay westies.  I haven't seen that, but the AC unit in my 71 was in the jumpseat, 
with an interesting console unit.  I've seen that in another early bay westy.  Made by "Volkswagen Products Corp."  Intake through a large grille in the 
rear side of the jumpseat box, and IIRC the unit took up most of the jumpseat box.  Condenser (or whatever you call that) was a giant unit under the 
body, with two fans on it.

One pic on this page shows the interior unit: http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/vw/71westy/index.html.  Bus has since been sold but I may be able to 
get my hands on the AC parts if anyone is desperate for them.  (And please state that you are desperate when you p-mail me so I'll know to jack up 
the price. :-)
