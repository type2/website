If you have a son, you'd better get used to accidents and running to the
doctor's office, they seem to come with sons.

No car is totally safe, there is no promises when you are on the road in
ANYTHING.  If you are going to worry too much, you'll go crazy.  The best
thing you can do is be the best driver out there and give yourself plenty of
room, don't tailgate and make sure the crazy drivers behind you have a way
to pass.  Look twice at intersections, don't think a red light or stop sign
will stop all the cars.

People will say our busses are dangerous, but will jump on a bike, powered
or not, go figure.

Even the big SUV's have safety problems, they like to roll.  Keep you
vehicle in good shape, make sure the kids are buckled in and enjoy your
trip.  

Life is a journey, but excessive worring will ruin it for sure.
