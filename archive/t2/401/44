No theoretical numbers in my case - I put my bus on a chassis dyno.  My Sanden rotary compressor took a steady 1.5hp at 3600rpm (~2000 compressor rpm).  And that was with R134a, might even be a little less with the Freeze-12 I am running now.

Did I mention that I like Freeze-12?  I saw vent temperatures of 31 degrees a few days ago (on an admittedly mild 70 degree muggy morning here in Dallas).  Best I ever saw with 134a was 39 degrees under similar conditions.
