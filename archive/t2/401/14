So, somebody climbed up my back last week about my comments relating to watching out for truckers on the freeways.

Well, here's a horrific story about a trucker climbing up two split windows this monday.

Not happy about the "I told you so" at all.

Yes the moral of the story is.......... 18 wheelers and small vw buses do not mix.

At approximately 5am this morning we found that fact out for ourselves.  So here is how it starts, the whole weekend went well, good, and even great, the
usuall suspects and great vw's.  The only problem all weekend was Richards Clutch on the container van that we thought was fixed after the christmas tree island repair session, but it as not.   We planned to hit the beach on monday so on sunday night we spent the night at our friend gregs house.  Then on monday we hung out with another friend and checked out some very awsome vw buses again.  But getting later into the afternoon we knew we had get going to
get home in time to get Richard on his plane to germany.  

So off we went.  All was fine untill later that evening when Richards clutch went out.  No problem
I made sure I had a tow and my tow hitch, and extra wire for lights,  we hooked up in Indio and we were ready to go after a little adjustment to the
front end alignment.  I started the night with our friend as a co piolet and talia robert and richard all camping in the back.  After I got tired we
switched drives to richard and then to our friend and back a forth a bit thru the evenening with plenty of time to get home.  Then all I know is that I am
woken up in the back bed of the high roof while sliding on its side hoping that we would just not flip over?  We didnt and I was very glad for that.  I
was on top of talia attempting to wake here up and find robert. I heard out friend say he had robert and he was ok and safe so I had to figure out how to
get out.  Soon I heard our friend and richard outside and heard richard say the bus was on fire and we had to go out thru the front.  If any of you know
how full the bus was it was a little harder than that.  All I could see was a small gap where the light and smoke and soon fire was and feel talia under me.

I attempted to wake her up and get off of her in the confined space I was in and I had no idea where in the bus I was.  Finally talia came too and sat up,
I told here we needed to get out of the bus thru the front somehow but I could not move anything around me and about this time I was getting scared and all
because the fire was right there and the flames were filling up the small gap I had to see out of, which ended up being the back window.  Talia all of a
suden sat up and like wonder woman pushed all the boxed off of us and scooted out thru a hole.  I followed and soon found myself crawling out of the front window that was broken.  I was able to make it 50 feet from the bus and layed down.  Then I looked behind me and saw the large semi with another car stuck to its nose?  I decieded to go down tward the back of my bus were I saw other people and at this time knew we were all out and safe.  I found Robert and just held on untill the ambulance got there.  He was perfect, no scratches or brueses or anything.  I had a huge bump on my head and Talia had a small cut
on here eyebrow that they hospital super glued back together.  Richard and out friend made it out to with no need to go to the hospital.

So what happened you ask again.  Well at around 5 am this morning a very fast semi came up behind us and ran into the back of the container van, or should I
say ran over it?  It was as I mentioned before attatched to us because we were towing it.  The semi pushed the container van into the back of the high roof sending its rear into the air and dislodging the two buses apart.  The container van stayed attatched to the front of the semi as it ran into the
gaurd rails and burst into flames.  The high roof was sent onto its side when the container van was ripped right off of the rear.  We slid for a bit and the
engine caught on fire.  Richard and friend were secured in the front seat and our friend got out and was able to kick out the original brake away glass from europe in the highroof making an escape route for Richard and all of us.  They were also able to put out the fire so Talia and I were able to get away.
Talia and I went to the emergency room and were distcharged in a timly manner after waiting a bit for her exray and my catscan.  We all got back together at
the hospital to go out and rent a rental car and pull the important stuff out of the high roof and make it back to Phoenix just in time to catch the plane
to germany.  I do mean just in time, our friends were calling us as the plane was boarding trying to hold his seat and had he been one minute later he would
have been sitting here right next to me.  We are all a bit shooken up and some of us have markes to show for it but we all got out in plenty of time  and
that is all that really maters.  The truck driver has insurance and all should work out fine I hope.  The container van is in about 4 pieces in a tow yard
out near the CA AZ boarder and is nothing more that some of the top frame and a totally smasched in front nose, that if you can imagine is what did the rear
damage to the high roof.  The highroof is also out that way and later on this week I will attempt to retrieve both of them back here to Phoenix.

All of richards tools, swap meet finds, nos parts, my new racks, most of my PLF t-shirts and our friends most personal belonging went up into flames in
the container van.  Were were able to find and salvage most everything in the high roof, only missing a few pieces so far like Talias glasses.  I found my camera, rayban sunglasses, my litterature I had taken to show a few people and most of my more valued things I went looking for.  Several things are still unacounted for and we have not really had a chance to view the totall loss, we just wanted to make it home.  I will go look along the highway on my way back to see what else I can find, Richard found some of his nos parts just laying about, some good, most not.  But none the less, the most important things were alllllll safe and sound.
