Subject: bus safety vs vanagon

well, they are certain to be safer but you can die in any vehicle.  my
father was killed by the b pillar in an astro van.  all that said, their is
a guy who was at the classic selling "komfort bars" for split and bay
busses and i was quite impressed by his work.  they come powder coated
black unless you request them not to be and they provide a good measure of
safety for you along with making the cab more rigid.  his phone number is
562.254.4942 which is a long beach, ca number for those who are interested.
his name is russ and he was quite a guy.  the prices listed on the sheet
here in front of me from the show were 250 for splits and 275 for bays.
they leave you just as much room for your feet up front as you ever had and
only marginally  slow you down while getting in the vehicle.
