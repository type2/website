Subject: Cab seats for sale - UK

Hoping to improve my comfort in Ashley, I bought a pair of r T25 cab seats.
They would bolt right in and are in really nice condition with no splits,
tears, stains or sagging. BUT as I had suspected but wasn't able to prove
until I tried them, the seat base is much to tall for a T2. OK if I was 4ft
high I would be fine, which is a shame as the seat is so comfortable but
I'm 6ft 3 and don't like rubbing my head on the roof !

Anyway, I want to try and sell these on for what I paid for them - 50 UKP.
Buyer collects from central England or pays shipping (I will ship to the US
if you REALLY want to but you must be able to get a better deal !)

p-mail me at phil(-at-)pagenumberone.co.uk if you want more info and photos.

Please buy these seats as they are living in the back of Ashley in the spot
I want to put my new cooker unit in :-)
