Guys,

Autozone sells a "generic" led light bar for about $20.00
Comes with brackets(plastic).  It is about 14" long and has
about 20 led's in it.

I hollowed out some of the plastic on the glueable base to match
where my heater wire on the rear window goes and then glued it with my
favorite glue...3m weatherstrip adhesive(black, not yellow).  Ran the wire
inside the window hatch frame and out where the defrogger wire comes out.

Hooked it up to the brake lights and bingo!  Great late model looking
really bright hi mount extra brake lights.  No big drain on the wiring
since they are led's and it looks almost stock.

I did try glass/super glue and it was a failure...use the adhesive.

A nice saturday morning safety job...

Looks similar to the one on this page 
http://www.watsons-streetworks.com/leds_plus.html

labeled #L50-44

Some of the others on this page might actually be able to screw into the 
upper hatch frame and swivel down...might be easier that way.


Cheers, dave
