How about dual a/c - one coil over the back and under the dash too. There 
is a guy on the Corvair list with a Corvair van and he has done exactly 
that - dual air with dual blowers. Seen the pics and he did a nice job. 
Basically used a solenoid to open and close flow to the rear coils. Was 
either triggered by a pressure switch or thermostat. I have the details 
someplace.
