I won't argue with that, but having another 60-100lbs perched on the roof would make an already tippy vehicle even tippier, not to mention the clearance issues.  Add to that the fact that many of the places I like to camp do not have electrical hookups, and there is no way I would ever consider one.  A 5000btu window unit is a much more practical solution IMO.  Which reminds me, now that the season is here I have seen those small window units advertised for as cheap as $87.  It's always amazing to me what mass production can do to prices.
