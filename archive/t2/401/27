The only way to efficiently turn an AC compressor with a belt around the
crank. The alternator does not provide enough juice to turn an electric
compressor. You could load a 50hp generator in the bus and use it to power an
airconditioner - but that sort of defeats the idea of driving a bus...

It's a simple issue of the effort/power needed to run a compressor.
Theoretically, the newer rotary compressors only use a few hp to turn but even
a few hp require a good bit of wattage...
