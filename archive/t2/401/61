Hi Volks,

It's an exhaust valve for a 1.8L carbed head. The catch is that I 
require delivery by Friday.

The reason I need it can be seen here:
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/westfakia/E-Valve2.jpg ...I removed this from 
the bus on Monday night.

This Saturday I need/want  to get an engine into Bob the Tomato. This 
is critical if I am going to be able to attend the June Jitterbug in a 
suitable vehicle.

Plan A. is to put up a recently acquired 2L engine. It needs a pair of 
2L heads I sent out to a local machine shop to have the valves done and 
some studs pulled. Problem there is that I'm not 100% sure they will be 
ready in time.  After the 2L is installed in "Bob The Tomato" his 1.8L 
will be converted to FI and installed in Dad's 75 Westy "Franklin".

Plan B. is that I repair the busted valve on the 1.8L engine, and put 
it back up "temporarily" until the 2L is ready. Which is why I need the 
valve. The seat is OK, so with a little lapping compound I'm sure I can 
get back on the road in good time.

Thanks for your assistance!


Happy trails,
