Subject: Re: [T2] can anyone in CT helicoil ? 

I recently had the exact same problem...off of a newly remanufactured head.  
The exhaust studs are 8 mm, so we had to go up to a 7/16 drill, redrill the 
phalange on the exhaust hole, as well as the stripped stud hole.  We went 
through a few drills in this stage, finally had success with a carbide tip masonry 
drill.  Kept it as cool as possible with a steady stream of WD-40 as we 
drilled, and the going was slow.  Tapped the hole, inserted heli-coil, and then put 
the old stud in (with a larger washer to cover the phalange hole) and torqued 
her down.

The important thing to remember if you plan on doing this job is to not drill 
too far, or even close to as far as the old stud hole.  Drilling through the 
cylinder wall will make your day a lot worse, and won't solve the problem.  
Since the studs only need 16 ft-lbs of torque, you really only need 3 or 4 
threads on the heli-coil to obtain enough strength.  We did this repair with the 
engine out, on its side with the exhaust attached, if you are planning on doing 
this repair with the engine and exhaust installed, you are gonna need to jack 
it up a ways and be ready for some uncomfortable drilling.  If you haven't 
already, pick up a helicoil kit.
