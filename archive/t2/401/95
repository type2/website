I haven't been in that part of the country but I had done alot of 
travelling on I-81, I-75, and closer to home I-75. Speed limit is 70. 
Traffic runs 5-10 mph faster. If speed wasn't the factor on I-5 I'm happy. 
Yes our rear lighting is stinko. Bought new tailights a couple years back 
from Bus Depot. Reflectors housings are black versus the OEM light grey. 
Some silver paint is in line here!!!

Take care.

Chris
