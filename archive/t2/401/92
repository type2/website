Subject: Alternator, still

Hi again..

Alternator light has been on in the 78 constant.  Flickers at idle slightly.
Around 12v while running.  When the green feild wire is given 12v, output
jumps to 14.3V.  Replaced the regulator, no result.  I know this should have
been a 1st stop, but I am assuming the alternator output is connected to the
starter.  Also, does the regulator reat the voltage at the starter as well?
Those connections have not been checked.  Possible loose
connection/corrosion?  Should have time on Saturday to tinker.


Thanks in Advance
