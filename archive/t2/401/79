Subject: 78 westy camper wiring ?>

Hi!  On a 1978 westy there is a light above the sink/ref area.  Where should
this light be wired up to?  engine battery via the light switch?   or the Aux
battery?  Little bit of strange things happening in the wiring on my bus, I am
trying to sort it out.   Right now everything is working great.  but I am not
sure if it is wired up correctly.....  thanks in advance!
