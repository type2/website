Subject: Telescoping side?

How about modifying the bus to have a telescoping wall on the drivers side like 
a big RV? When you pulled up to your campsite unlock the side and crank it out 
to add some square footage to your floor space. Just put some tracks on the 
floor, cut out the side and make some kind of box with the side of the bus. The 
cabinet could sit in this little telescoping knook and look somewhat stock 
while retracted. It could be weatherproofed with some rubber seals for a 
sliding door. Removeable legs for stability. The roof would be tricky but I'm 
sure there's a good design in one of the brains out there (with minimal weight).
