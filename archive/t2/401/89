Subject: Tail lights

On my 70 Westy, the P.O. installed a set of generic trailer tail lights,
 bolted to the inside of the rear hatch so they show through the rear window.
 The wires run inside the rear hatch, out along the hinge into the ceiling,
then
down the cabinet, through a grommet to the engine compartment and are wired
right to the stock lights. Works great and they are high enough for the SUV,s
to see.
