It is like I tell my daughter about flying on a plane.... when it is your time to go and God calls you, your gone and nothing you do can stop that. So
go on that plane, drive your bus because fearing them, you are going to miss out on the fun and adventure. And it won't shorten your life 1 second less than the time you have been alloted to be here on earth.
