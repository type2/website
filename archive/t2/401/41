"I mounted an Audiovox flip-down LCD-TV between the front seats on
Itch ('69 Westy). A Lasonics 8090 CD/DVD player fits nicely between
the "roof" and the pop-top. The wiring between the DVD player and
the LCD-TV "sneaks" along the driver's side tent base, down the
front-left corner of the sunroof opening, and into the "ceiling",
coming down thru the ceiling panel where appropriate for the LCD-TV.
All very stealth."

Got pics?
