Actually, not to be a wise a#$ but the sailboat does not have the right of
way. I do a lot of sailing and teach boating safety courses and the large
commercial vessels always have the right of way due to their limited
manuverability. And for the bus towing another I always thought there were
laws about towing other vehicles, and the lighting that is required. Not to
excuse bad driving on the trucker's part if there was any but an ounce of
prevention....
