I'd be "real" careful about adding or subtracting anything to the structure
of an existing vehicle that wasn't tested and spec'ed by an outside source.
Since I haven't seen or know anything about "komfort bars", this may not
apply to them...Lotsa 'stuff' seems to logically offer more safety, but may
not when actually tested. Ridgidity might be one of them...Too much stiff-
ness 'might' induce forces that the seatbelts or even the seat mounts 
weren't designed to withstand...It's not the primary impact that gets you;
it's the secondary... ;-(
