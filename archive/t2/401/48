For my two cents... I was in an accident a couple years ago in a 1980 VW
rabbit convertable. Drove headon into a guy in a rainstorm. He hydroplaned
through a red light into my path. I was doing like 45. I walked away with
only a bit tongue (note to all future crash victims, keep your mouth shut
before an accident). The car completely crumpled up front but from the doors
back it was like brand new.

Anyway, my thought is these VWs of that era (late 70s, early 80s) must be ok
in a crash cuz I survived.
