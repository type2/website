I wouldn't suggest mounting it permanently.  Just load it up for camping trips and prop in in the front passenger window when you stop.  It's simple to make a small wooden frame to accomodate this.  It's a little bit WT, but has many advantages, including:

Only WT when you are using it
Doesn't take up space/load capacity when you're not using it
Cheap
