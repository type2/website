Subject: Re: [T2] bus safety vs vanagon

I do agree that how you drive affects your chances of getting hit, but it's 
not my driving that worries me (I drive my bus like a Grandma)....it's those 
other drivers that drive like morons that concern me. You can be the best 
driver in the world but still get into a vicious accident.

I assume that a Vanagon is safer becuase it's more modern and safety was 
more of a role in the design.  I was hoping to hear from some folks that 
know Vanagons and can confirm that they are sturcturally more sound than a 
Bay. But are all Vanagons the same structurely??

I know with my 71 Westy that the sides of the bus are not well protected at 
all and that they "fold" in an acident.
