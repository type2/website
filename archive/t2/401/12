I'd be damn wary of doing that.  First, check with a Lawyer in your
state on what the law says.  Next, call the Sheriff's office and ask
them. They will probably tell you that you could be arrested for
possesion of anything on your bus.  If you have a friend who's a cop,
he might be able to arrange something to help you out.
