Subject: RE: [T2] Are Vanagons safer than Bays??

Of course it's all a relative thing. For every vehicle that is safer
than a bus, I'll show you one that's less safe. I often drive to work in
one of my mini cars (a 2-cylinder aircooled Fiat 500, and a '74 Mini
Cooper). Believe me, both my crew cab and my Westy are veritable tanks
compared to those.  That said, I bought my wife a New Beetle largely
because of its exceptional crash test results. I may play a bit loose
with my own safety in my tin-can cars, but when it comes to my wife and
5 year old I'm not willing to take the same chances.

To (partially) answer the question more directly, one of VW's claims for
the Vanagon when it replaced the Bus were improved safety features like
a larger crumple area, more frame reinforement (less bulky but
structurally stronger due to modern design technology), and a
collapsable steering column. I have to admit that just from a standpoint
of overall "feel,"  I do feel that my Vanagon is more solid than my Bus,
although this doesn't prove anything (and I hope never to be in a
position to prove it!).

An anecdotal comment: I once bought a parts Vanagon from someone who had
crashed it through a building. The front of the van was completely
demolished in the head-on collision, yet the areas immediately around
the driver and passenger seats were relatively intact.  He walked away
with only severe bruises.  The building didn't fare as well; it was
closed for a week.  (Ironically, the building happened to be his place
of employment, which coinidentally he just happened to be driving past
when he lost control of the van in the rain, or so he said ;-)
