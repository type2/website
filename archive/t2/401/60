I agree.

Someone else once wrote:  "If your car is properly maintained, with good
brakes and steering, clean windshield, lights and wipers that work and all
that,
then your safety is a direct function of what you are - what you are being
as you whistle down the road. If we all constantly drive as if we were
strapped
to the front of the car like Aztec sacrifices so we'd be the first thing
hit, there would be a helluva lot less accidents."  John Muir, VW Book, p.37
