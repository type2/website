Subject: are type2 getting more popular

I don't know if it's just me ,but lately I have seen more type 2 stuff 
for sale in magazines. In particular more baywindow stuff becoming 
available. Is this because the shops are needing more business
and reaching out to other types of VW's or because the demand for the 
stuff has increased. I am just
wondering what your opinion is? If  this should have been a Friday 
topic, sorry and hold off any response to then.
Last question is what kind of grease are you using to lube your tranny 
and throttle cables? On the package it says silicone grease and the only 
thing I could find was a spray. I thought that white
grease would be okay.
