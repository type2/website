Subject: Fuel Tank/seat removal

 
--Who's got the line on getting the rubber connection between the fuel tank and the metal elbow in my '79 off? Do you have to cut it? What about getting a new one back on?

--Trying to remove my rear passenger seat (79') and can't figure out the carpet connection from the back of the seat to the sloped wall of the bus. The carpet has a paper insert folded up in the carpet and wedged in a metal rail run across the firewall. How to?

thanks y'all

Billy
