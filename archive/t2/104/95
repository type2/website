Subject: east to west transport

   My transport guy is leaving the Chicago area tomorrow and I doesn't have
anything for him to haul. So if anybody needs a bus or anything really,
moved from the mid west to the west coast contact me asap, he is very
reasonable and honest.

ronnie 

ps. he will go about anywhere to pick something up
