 Yup. Michelin say the Agilis 41/51 is their replacement for the
MX, MXL & MXT. Check out:

 Though what you probably want is:

 Which explains the higher load rating vs. the MX.

 I have Agilis 81s (in 195/70R15C FWIW) with about 20K miles on them. They
work well, though personally I'd prefer a bit more grip as
I drive my bus "enthusiastically". I wouldn't fault the tyres, though,
and will probably replace them with another Agilis (the 51 in 205/65R15C)
when they wear out. The 81s (and 61s, which are probably what you are 
looking at (I don't think they ship 81s to the US) have a Mud+Snow rating
and hence arn't the best dry tarmac boots about. They are wearing well-
let me know if you want me to put a tread gauge on them, but a quick check
suggests about 7mm of tread remain (from 10mm, I think) on the fronts,
so they ought to be good for another 30K, at least. This is with quite
frequent cornering that's hard enough to provoke understeer.

 I've used them in snow, without problems, and they've seen a lot of rain,
as we've had a very wet winter this year, again I've no complaints and 
they  are a good, stable ride. I was surprised when I first fitted them
that my steering got lighter, too, dunno why that should be.

 I like 'em, they are made in Germany and designed for vans like ours by
one of the top manufacturers in the world. Not the cheapest tyre on the
market but a quality product.

Cheers,
        W.
