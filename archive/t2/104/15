Subject: VW's and Clearwater, Fla

Hi Folks,

I'm heading to Clearwater, Florida  at the end of the month for a
business/pleasure trip for a couple of weeks and was wondering if anyone
knew of some good scrap yards or part stores in that area.  For that
matter anything VW in interest will do.  I have a 72 Westy and I am
looking for an engine lid and a few interior parts.

Thanks

Craig
