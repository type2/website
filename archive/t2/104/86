Subject: Firewall seal - right / wrong

The rubber firerwall seal that is used on a type 1 engine in a bus...

Does that rubber seal lay as a flap "over" the engine tin,
or
does it get mashed downward "in between" the tin and the firewall?

Looks to me like it does a pretty good job of sealing in either configuration.
Must be a right/wrong, however ......... Which way ??
