On that note, as an aside to Virginia residents,  I recently read in an
industry trade paper that in Virginia, vehicles over 25 years old will soon
be exempted from emissions inspection.  This means that most (and in a few
years, all) busses will be exempt.  Previously the cutoff was 1968.

Yes, the 25 year exemption is in effect in Virginia.  Now.

But, if the VW required a cat converter because it was a California bus, it 
will need one in Virginia to pass the Safety Inspection.

Also, the EGR FILTER is a requirement for the FI buses, California or not!!  
Safewty Inspection again.

The Emmissions Inspection looks for the EGR VALVE!!
