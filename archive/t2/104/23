Collie,

Yes, most commonly these are found on the driver's side middle 
window. I have seen some military examples that had it on the 
passenger side as well but no regular production vehicles. Most of 
buses I have seen with the solid window were 68 to 70. The dealer 
window sticker for my old 69 listed the middle opening quarterlight 
as a $17.00 option.

See at EveryBus!
