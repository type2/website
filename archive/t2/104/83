Subject: Gas tanks

Does anyone know if tanks from a 71 and a 73 are the same or not?  I am
pretty sure the capacity is the same.  Just wondering if all the inlets and
stuff would be the same also.

I have a spare from a 73 and want to clean it up and when I pull the tank on
the 71 to be able to drop the other right on in.

How would you check to see if the sender for the gas level works correctly
or not.  I would rather know before I get it all back together, so I can fix
it while it is convenient.

Hope to see some of you this weekend at Edisto Freeze Yer Toe at Edisto
Beach State Park in SC.  http://quicksitemaker.com/members/snoop/Edisto.html
