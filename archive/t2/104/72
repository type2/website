Subject: Looking for Transmission Mechanic

List,

After recently pulling the transmission (engine & gas tank) out of my 71'
Bay I've decided to get it rebuilt.  I'm looking for a good tranny shop in
the Bay Area (San Jose, CA).  I'm looking for someone who can re-gear 1st &
4th (freeway flyer) and beef up the differential.  Any suggestions of good
Bay Area tranny shops would be greatly appreciated.
