Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tanks

While the sender is disassembled from the tank
dip the float in water to see if it a) floats and b) moves freely.

Then reconect it to the electrical harness and while the ignition is on move the float up and down and the gauge should move at the same time. (I cannot remember if the sender earths through the tank - if so you will need to supply an earth connection)

An assistant to read the gauge while you are 'playing' at the back will also help.

To make assesments of the accuracy of the system you would need to do some measuring to work out the deflection of the float which represents the tank full, half full or empty.

good luck
