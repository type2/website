I've been there.
I bought a good half inch socket driver(flex end, not a ratchet) 3 feet
long.
On this I put a 19mm impact socket.
When they are so tight jumping on the thing wont crack them loose I hit =
the
socket really hard with a 2 pound hammer. This works almost all the time =
but
when it doesn't I get a propane torch and get them glowing if I can. If =
that
doesnt work I use a bigger hammer:-)
I've broken the cross shaped tire irons so I would say a good long =
socket
bar is the best bet.
Good luck.
Wear thick gloves:-)
