I wouldn't tackle the body without a lot of practice first.
Get some scrap sheet metal and try some butt welds, lap welds and spot welds
with you mig. I took welding in highschool but needed a lot of practice just
to get up to speed. Sheet metal is tricky and usually involves a lot of
individual tack welds rather than a bead. Another technique involves
drilling holes in an over lapping piece and filling the holes as spot welds.
I have two concurrent, ongoing projects right now that both require regular
welding so I easily justified the purchase of an inexpensive mig welder. I
already had a stick welder and learned less #1 while trying to use it for
sheet metal.
 
I recommend having. . .
 
-          Wire Welder - gasless is okay
-          Dremel Rotary Tool - These things are indispensable for real fine
finish grinding and cutting in tight places.
-          Angle Grinder  - You can get a cheapy  one at harbor tools for
less than $20. You will also need grinding wheels, cup brush, cutoff wheels
and flap disks.
 
I'm no expert but an amateur who has gone through what you are going
through. Contact me directly and I'll be happy to help anyway I can. Go
