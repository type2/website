Subject: 78 front trans mount??

Folks,

I have looked high and low for this item this morning.

Mine seems to be too loose and I would like to replace it.
I have "scrreches" when accelerating in my bus...probably the rear engine
mounts(will get to them soon) but would like to replace this one soon.

The noise sounds like tortured rubber mounts somewhere when the torque
gets heavy.


Anybody know where to get one?

Is it NLA??


Cheers, dave
