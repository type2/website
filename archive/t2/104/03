No pics showed up.....so I am a little confused. Sounds like you are trying to

75-78 exhaust is supposed to look like this:

Or do you have something that looks like this? :

and you need something that resembles A1 or A2?

I still haven't figured out what you mean by single port or dual port
flange.......
