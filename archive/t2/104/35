also fit on later vanagons? I have an 81 & wonder if
it will work on my rear hatch.
Also do you have any pics of the rack with bicks

Mike,
Yes, we offer similar racks that fit the Vanagon.  The Vanagon rack will hold

Yes, I have a pic somewhere with bikes on my '74 Westy.  If I can't find it 
quickly, I'll take a pic tomorrow.
