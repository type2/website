My best guess is that this is a port for transferring
data (measurements) to a computer via manufacturer
supplied software and cable for 'Statistical Process
Control" or "SPC". SPC is a method of monitoring a
process during its operation in order to control the
quality of the products while they are being produced.
Pretty nifty but of little use outside a manufacturing
environment that requires process control.
