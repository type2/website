BTDT 2:
             Same weather plus NYC...Limped into a gas station to let them
play with the lug nuts. A while later the guy comes into the office to 
tell me the lug nuts are, "Screwed up," and won't come off...Ace tried
to use the wrong socket and rounded off the nuts with the airgun. I
offered to trade him his life for plugging the tire on the rim on the bus
so I could at least get home and get the wheel off with my "salvage"
socket and a 1/2 in. breaker bar...
