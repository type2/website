Subject: one-piece windows

Did VW ever produce bays with one-piece middle windows like the passenger
rear? I know of a bus with them, but I have never seen another...

Anyone?

I am looking to replace the middle windows in my '77 - 7 passenger
(currently with stock vent windows) to one-piece to clean up the appearance
(mild custom)...any leads would be appreciated.
