John,

After you have the felt out. you must remove the vent wing. Next remove the
four upper and rear felt clips. These are the clips that held in the felt
that you have already removed. Sometimes they come out with the felt. They
just slide out and pull down. This chrome trim is the outside scrapper. At
the bottom where the scraper is are some push clips, similar to the door
panel clips. these just need to be pried out. I would start with the upper
most forward part and work back and down around. Do not worry about bending
it a little. Just do not kink it. I hope this helps.

Hi all,

I'm right in the middle of my Westy project getting everything stripped for
welding, sanding and painting and have run into a stumbling block.

How the heck do you remove the chrome (and rubber along the bottom) that
goes around the outside of the windows?

I've gotten to the point where the quarter windows are out and I've pulled
the felt out as well so I can see how the top and sides will come out. The
problem is the rubber/chrome part that runs along the (bottom) outer sill of
the door and is attached below the window sill. Bentley conveniently skips
removal info for that part. Any help is appreciated...

For those who may be curious:

My Westy restoration project is moving along well. I'm basically replacing
all window, door, and pop top rubber (not a cheap prospect) and most likely
will go for a new pop top tent as well. I pulled out all the windows and was
pleasantly surprised at the lack of rust except for 2 places. First the left
rear window quarter panel is rusted beyond economical repair. (Anyone out
there got a replacement they'd like to get rid of?- If not I'll probably go
for single piece glass instead.)

The other location is the infamous lower windshield sill. I started prying
there and the metal started crumbling. :-(  I don't think it is as bad as it
could be but the westy will definitely need some reconstructive surgery in
that area....

After that it is just to remove the poptop and luggage rack and she is all
set for metal work and painting.

Latest new parts scored: a Weber progressive (Please hold your derisive
remarks until I get a chance to see for myself... ;-) and some cool smoked
tail lights from "that auction site", and a bunch of new rubber (on order in
the U.K.).

TIA,

John B.
