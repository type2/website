I've been having a bear of a time trying to get my steering and front =
end of my '70 Westy proper.  Presently I am getting another rebuilt =
steering box hoping that it will solve the problem but I'm not that =
hopeful.  Other than not having secure tracking in my steering (it tends =
to wander/float more than it should) I have about a 3 inch play then a =
"click" when I turn the steering wheel.  The first rebuilt steering box =
didn't change a thing after numerous adjustments according to the books. =
 I sent it back and another is on its way.  In the meantime I was loaned =
a used box which got rid of the "click" but not the play or the floating =
of the front end. =20
So I think the "click" is from the flange for the steering column if it =
is slipping.  It is missing the fluting on the inside that contacts the =
fluted shaft of the steering box and so it doesn't  grab properly.   It =
was reamed out for some reason.  The big question today is - Does any =
one know where I can get one of these steering column flanges? =20
I have only heard from one source and they want $25.  That sounds a =
little steep!  Also any suggestions for the play in the steering wheel =
or for the floating would be appreciated.  Since I bought the Westy I =
put in new ball joints, shocks, tires (Kumho D rated 185R14 - max load =
1874), and everything is tight when I try to wiggle the front end - =
please no jokes I'm reeeeeaaaaalllly frustrated.  No one in the last =
year and a half has been able to figure this out.  Yes, I have been =
working on it that long when time and parts availability permit.  I =
bought this to fix up and take my 8 year old grandson camping but at =
this rate it may only be ready for a great grandson/daughter.
