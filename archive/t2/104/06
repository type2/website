Subject: help with FI idle mixture

Volks,
I had a stumble at all RPMs in my 78 FI 2.0L all stock. Put it on  a
smog sniffer and found the CO at 3.5 (at idle). Adjusted to 1.7. Per
Bentley I am near spot on at 1.7. Runs better now.

Anyone have experience with this adjustment? Any thoughts, other than
Bentley,  on where this adjustment should be?

Thanks!
Regards,
Chris
