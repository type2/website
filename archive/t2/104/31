Subject: Stupid Mistake? Follow up found rods upside down!!!!

I'm the guy with no compression in a newly rebuilt (by me) 1600 engine.

I discovered that my valve openings/closings were initiating either before 
or after TDC or TBC (depending on stroke).

After doing the above diagnostics I cracked the case.

I found that the rods were upside down, the raised marks were facing down 
not up.  The marks on the crank and cam gears were mated OK.

Could the rods being upside down explain the problem of no compression?

Thanks.

Bill
