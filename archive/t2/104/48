Hey Volks
We are moving to Nanaimo BC from Bragg Creek AB on feb 26.
Going through the stuff I don't want to take with me I found.....
68-73 Steering wheel (good shape)
Tail light assembleys (2) from a 67 type3
Long axel fom an auto tranny 73 bus (no cv joints)  don't all jump at =
once...lol
Headlight basket from 68-79 bus=20
2 good hubcaps ( I think they are from a type3 but they fit my 72 bus, =
they have a different shaped lip on the outside)

Here is what I need
Spare tire (preferably 195/75/14 on vw rim)
driver side headlight ring=20
Anyone in Calgary area interested?

Thanks
Brian
