Hi Theodore,
While you're right in terms of ease of repair there
are a couple of factors that make that impossible for
me.
1.While I can do little stuff, like starter motors &
the like, I don't trust myself or have the tools to do
an engine pull.
2.I live in the country & don't have a paved or
concrete area I could carry out such a manouvre so I'm
forced to pay a mechanic to do it(which frankly is
safer although costlier).
Thanks for advice anyway.
Cheers
Andrew Wood
