<snore> Huh?! <snort> Yah, I'm awake!

I'm sorry, I'm soooo out of the loop. I started a new job (which I love) at
the first of the year (new job = more time, less money, no vacation time
accrued). IF it doesn't work out, I'm definitely there (oh, mixed
emotions!). IF it does work out, I'm thinking of somehow finagling a week
or a week and a half off, driving out to Everybus (via Texas to see Art &
Kathy, and Atlanta to see Chris), dropping Wendelin off with Kelly for the
nose replacement, and flying back. (My poor bus has spent more time in the
shop than on the road since I got her.)

Hopefully, by then I'll have my two foster cats adopted, and my promising
little bus cat can come with me, and I'll only have to leave my poor
housemate with six cats to sit in my absence.

That's a lot of juggling, but Everybus *is* my favorite campout. :-)

There, I said it. I guess I'm committed now. Or I should be committed. But
we all knew that. Especially when I got that second bus. :-)
