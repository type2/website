iginal , never been hit, everything is there and working including the un=
der dash A/.C. But the tranny makes a whining noise in first, second and =
third but not in fourth. I am buying it from a mechanic who has owned it =
for 1-1/2 years and says it has made that noise the whole time. He said h=
e drained the tranny fluid and found it to be clean , no metal filings an=
d told me if he thought it was bad he would of replaced it. . Other then =
it being a little noisey, he said it shouldn't be a problem. He said it c=
ould of been a rebuilt at one point , and when they installed the gears t=
hey installed them a  little tight .   I know  a used vehicle is a crap s=
hoot , but I want to know does this make since what he says. He owns a re=
putable commercial truck repair business in town. Other then that it's ni=
ce..
