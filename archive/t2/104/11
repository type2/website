Subject: brake help needed!

Hello,

Ok, I am finally getting around to doing my brakes and wouldnt you know it,
I cannot for the life of me
get any of the dang lugnuts to start loosening up. When I had this random
shop give me an estimate a month back, they must have just gone nuts with
the airpowered gun and they are essentially welded in place it seems.

Should I run buy one of those cross shaped lugwrenches, so I get more
leverage and hopefully then will be able to bust them loose, or do I need to
wait till tuesday to find a shop someplace with an airgun where they can
break them free for me?

Jeez, if I had a flat tire I would be screwed. Or maybe the shop was made
that I said I think I would rather just not have them do the work afterall.

any thoughts on this are appreciatted.

Christopher
