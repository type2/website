Hello Everyone---

Thanks to everyone who helped me through the Generator saga as well as the 
intake manifold saga in my 71 Campmobile. I have one last question for 
everyone.....I unfortunately didn't write down all the wires leading to the 
Coil....but I just need some info on a few...whether these wires go to the 
positive or the negative on the coil--

The wire that connects from the Solenoid on the side of the Carb to the right 
side of the carb to where? I'm not sure where that last lead goes?

The wire leading from the Points and Condensor---Which side of the Coil?

Thanks for the help--have a great day!!

Adam
