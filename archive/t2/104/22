Subject: Two year old fuel line Leaks!

I replaced all of my lines in my 75 fuel injected bus two years ago but now 
I am finding I have developed two leaks!  I used what I thought to be good 
quality hose so I am wondering what went wrong.  I hose I used was for I was 
told for fuel injection and had the Audi logo on it.

So it looks like I will be doing the entire job again so hat advice can 
anyone give me this time around, hose size I.D., spec, all metal lines?

Thank you
Don Miller
