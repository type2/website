Subject: My bus is cutting out??????

I have a 75 westy, and lov'n it.  lately, and slowly getting worse, it cuts 
out when speeding up, and cruising at an idle speed.  I'm kinda think'n that 
its my fuel injectors, cause i also have a fuel smell in my oil, of all 
places?!?!  Anyway, if anyone can give me any info.  i'd really appreciate 
it!
