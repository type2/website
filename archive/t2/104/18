List,
As my bus is now completely(almost) empty and going to the body/paint 
shop soon. I will be removing my windows. I have 3 busses full of 
different types of windows. Vents, sliders, louvers. I was hoping to get 
some opinions on which windows to put where. Also will all the rear 
windows be interchangeable?  Thanks in advance
