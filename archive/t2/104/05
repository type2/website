Slim pickenings in todays newspaper:

1958 single cab, $4500 or trade for Miata, Porsche 914, or 4x4.
559-292-0452

1970 bus, looks and runs good, $3000 OBO 559-875-4203
[way overpriced for the buses around here]

1973 bus, looks great, very clean, needs some work..... $2000 OBO
559-323-3800

I know nothing about any of these.
