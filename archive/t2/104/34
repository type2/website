Subject: Speaking of basic items...  Electronic vernier caliper

Speaking of basic items....

Back in December, I discovered, ordered and received a digital electronic
vernier caliper from Maryland Metrics for $31.85.  I thought the sale
ended on 01/01/02, but it has been extended to 03/31/02, so I want to
recommend this to all.

The link for Maryland Metrics is:
http://mdmetric.com/

The specific link for the mic is:
http://mdmetric.com/mosale0700.htm

The good:

rated accuracy of .03mm (.001")

mine works like a champ!

The not-so-good:

Chinese manufacture (I have no problem with that, but thought to
mention it)

One "mystery feature" is that it includes what is called an "SPC port"
which looks a lot like a USB port.  Has anyone got any idea what this is?
