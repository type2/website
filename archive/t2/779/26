Subject: [T2]Triple AAA tows vehicles not Families

in your spare time just something that happened to us and maybe for those with triple aaa......or considering it always two passengers riding back under policy never more than that.
so prepare to leave someone behind..... or alot of your family behind.... hope you werent traveling to far from home....
"Most folks dont get towed but short distances anyways" right? that is only one thing said by dispatch at triple AAA
