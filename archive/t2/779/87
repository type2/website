Folks,

Methinks it's about time for my yearly electrical rant....

However, the archives already have it!

deedeebus,

BTDT and I might be afraid to start the bus as well.

Take some time, look at/stare at/absorb the diagrams and then match
diagram to reality.  Yes, it seems to be hard, but you *can* do it
as lots of people on the list have managed to eventualy work it out.

Do the wires match the diagram...got too many?...to few?  Do they go to 
the same places as the diagram says?  

Yes, fuses numbered left to right(drivers side to passenger side).

Good luck!, dave
