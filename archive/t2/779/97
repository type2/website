OK, did it again with a better voltmeter, and it ain't zero.

Wiring short btw battery & fusebox, eh?

How the hell can I find out where it is?  I can't even see the "fusebox" on
the wiring diagram.  On the wiring diagram the 12 fuses are all over the
place.

I'm extremely confused and disconsolate.

Even Josh is ready to throw in the towel.
