Subject: Back in "the day"...  (exhaust systems)

Volks,

Okay..  I'm toast :-(  Last night I accelerated away from a light and all
of a sudden the bus got quite a bit louder.  No power loss, so I pulled in
at the next driveway and had a listen at the back fo the bus. Sure enough,
the EGR pipe had rusted away from my one-piece replacement muffler (I did
suspect this by the sound). Now back in "the day" there was a company in
Italy that produced a truly superior one-piece replacement unit and at the
time I ordered a couple, figuring I would need them eventually.  Alas,
between the rust and some inherent genrousity, this is the last of that
batch and I KNOW that the italian company is long gone (they were going
when I did my bulk purchase, which is WHY I did the bulk purchase.

So I head over to Ron's (Bus Depot) to see what he is offering.  He's got
the '72-75 style but nothing for '76-78 (which is what I need).  Bus Boys
has EMPI and Bugpack for 76-78, both of which (EMPI and Bugpack) are bad
words to me.  I suppose I will be forced into choosing between them but
want to ask....

Anyone got a better offer or a better idea?  I know I can change to the
'72-75 heater boxes and buy Ron's muffler, but I actually like the
incredibly complex 76-78 settup...  it's so "byzantine" :-)  I'd prefer to
stick with it.  I actually have an original X-over pipe and Y-elbow, but
no cat replacement tube nor muffler and tailpipe.  I could buy them and
return to factory stock (probably a good idea) but I'd rather find a
high-quality one-piece replacement muffler for '76-78.
