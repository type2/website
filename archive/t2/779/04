Saab seats in a Westy?

Interesting. I have owned MANY Saabies (900s) and the seats were pretty 
darned comfy on long hauls.

Still, I have also heard that properly restored horsehair (coconut 
mat?) seats in the old VWs are equally kind on the derriere.

I'd be interested in learning more about this, or more about the merits 
(and links!) on VW seat restos.

Danke,
Anton
