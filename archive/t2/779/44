Yes, the 1600 was always available on the Bay, but with the usual upright
cooling system.  The Vanagon also used an aircooled 1600 but with a unique
cooling system that looked similar to the Type 3.  The basic engine unit was
a sustantially modified version of the Type 1, with hydraulic lifters, oil
filter, relocated oil cooler etc.  The engine was fitted until Decemeber 82
or January 83.
