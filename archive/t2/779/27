Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Carb Flooding

I'm not really a carb guru, but I do know a little bit about them.  If I 
remember correctly, the float controls how much fuel is allowed into the 
carb.  It also is responsible to turn off the fuel when the float bowl 
is full.  If the float is not working properly, it will keep allowing 
fuel to flow into the carb and then out through the jets and into the 
engine.

I have never seen a vw carb but I'd venture to guess that it has a 
float.  If so, I would check to see that it's operating correctly and is 
shutting off the fuel properly.
