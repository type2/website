Subject: Need '79 muffler

OK another exhaust question.

I have a '79 bus with the stock California emissions setup with the cat 
parallel to the side of the bus near the driver's side head.  I want to 
purchase a top quality replacement muffler and tailpipe, and I want to 
keep the stock emissions set-up.  I've babied this exhaust system for 
15 years and everything but the muffler is in excellent shape so I will 
keep it.  The muffler itself has been patched and patched and patched 
again by welding, but I'm now starting to get pinholes again, so its 
gotta go.

Can someone (Ron?) recommend the correct muffler??
