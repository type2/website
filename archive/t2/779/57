Subject: Last Chance to save a Bay...

This weekend the 79 transporter I bought for mechanical parts must leave
this earth for the great scrap pile in the sky. The code enforcement has
given me their last "warning". It has a really good body and would love a
home. So the first person to haul it away gets a six-pack of Sam Adams. If
not, I'll be drinking it all alone.

Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling...

P.S. I MIGHT pull parts off of it if someone is super nice and gives me a
few nickels for my nicked knuckles.
