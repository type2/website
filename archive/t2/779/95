I'd just replace all the fuses while you're at it if they don't look new. I 
cured one electrical problem (fuse wire was cracked allowing enough 
electricity through to give a reading but not enough to light a tail light) 
and headed off another (fuse disintegrated when removed) by replacing all 
the fuses.

Cheers,

Martin.
