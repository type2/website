Absolutely! Even places that say they're "VW Specialists" can't. I had
an 84 Rabbit GTI that had a single dead diode. Nobody said it was bad.
Looked good to them. Finally, after months of dead batteries, I took
it to a real rebuilder. They replaced a few bits for a total cost of
$25 and it worked perfectly after.
