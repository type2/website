Subject: Re: [T2]Triple AAA tows vehicles not Families

     I wonder what would happen if several of the folks that have had this 
same thing happen to them wrote a letter with all the facts of their 
incident and sent it to all of their local papers and news agencies.  Many 
news folk seem to like tragic stories and use fear to sell their product.  
"What you don't know about your auto club, could your family be at risk?  
Find out on Action news at eleven!"  The visual of the loving wife or 
husband left on the side of the road in the rain while spouse and child 
drive off into the night with the creepy tow-truck guy might be enough to 
get them interested in printing or airing the story?  It would only cost a 
few stamps and a little time.  I dunno, just a thought.  If even one local 
rag printed it you could send it in to AAA just as a little screw you right 
back statement :-)
