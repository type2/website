It's great that she has alot of people backing her up. The point that seems  
to be lost is the guy has put money on the table and it's gone and he has no  
product. Period. so being she is so loved why doesn't someone who swears by 
her  coming through give this guy his money back and when she gives him his 
product  then he can give the money back to whoever paid him. Then he can rest 
assure  that he will get it. 
I went through a similar deal with someone who had a product for  sale and he 
was in Oregon and I am in Virginia. I was told that it was shipped 2  days 
after the money was recieved. I had to go back and find where I got his  info 
and hassle a friend of his who let him use his phone number to sell the  
product. The friend swore he would pay and after 3 months I got the  product.
 When it's your money and you can't get in contact it's harder to  
understand. It's easy to say "yes she will deliver" when it's no sweat off your  back. 
She can be the best person in the world but, when you run a business and  you 
disappear it's hard to explain. She may have missed a phone bill  but, she has 
friends that can get in contact to this guy and atleast say 3  months 6 months 
something. To take the money and leave him hanging, no  matter how sweet she 
is and a great person, it's still wrong.
