I definitely do not recommend a normal FLAPS for checks or replacement parts. The "real" rebuilders do the fix for the same or less than the rebuilt-in-a-box and it'll last longer. This has worked well for me several times and they stand behind their work too. Even our little town of 25K we have 3 of these places.
