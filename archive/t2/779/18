so it has a 1600 engine and not the 2000 liter engine???  I  know the 1600
was stock in Europe but I thought the 2000 was an option,  I would check
the 2000 does have a oil filter.

fix it,  it is summer in the South of France and the engine could overheat

I use synthetic in mine and have for many years, in a 1600 with no filter
I would continue to change at 3000 miles, in my 78 with a oil filter I
change before 5000 but usually after 4000

I would still change fuel lines even if they "say" they are new, also buy
a fire extingueser anyway.
