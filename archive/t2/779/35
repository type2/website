Subject: Re: [T2]Triple AAA tows vehicles not Families

Hello Cha  Next time dont mention the number of people  the dispatchers call 
independent tow guys and they will normally give everybody a ride.  The tow 
guys really dont make very much doing AAA tow jobs till they go over the mileage 
number.  AAA is normally a real good deal, has better discounts than AARP 
does for car rentals and motels. But you would have to be an old fart to know 
that LOL   later Mark Dearing
