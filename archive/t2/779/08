Let's see if I can make this short. The "product" I was buying was a Westy  
tent in ok shape with the poles. I have a nice Westy tent without poles. So  I 
was mainly buying the poles. What I ended up with was a Rivera tent with the  
wrong poles for the Rivera and the Westy. So now I have 2 tents without the  
right poles. I was so glad that I didn't get screwed over completely that I  
never complained. It was a Samba deal about 5 or 6 years ago. Lesson learned. So 
 I got the next tent local and from a good friend. No screwing and happy as I 
can  be. The right poles and the right tent. Thanks Mark.
