Rae, that pipe is held on by a small sheet metal bolt or screw like
those used on the rest of the tin. The pipe has a little tab on it
that attaches to the heat exchanger. If you remove the bolt and the
hose in the engine compartment, you should be able to push the pipe up
into the engine compartment quite a bit to get it out of the way.
