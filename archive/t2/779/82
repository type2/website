Very very well said.  Why not support the members of this list that are
here supporting us?  I'll buy as many of my parts from Mitchell
Motorworks (www.bustedbus.com) as I can.  They're local, they post to
the type2 list, Joe entertains my kids and has a really cool dog, and
he's willing to crawl under my bus and fix little things for free.  Let's
hope the next owner is as nice and helpful as Joe.  Support those that
support you!
