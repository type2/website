Subject: Really dumb newbie question .. Just checking ..

Hello Everyone,

			I've been lurking here for a while and have been doing a load of research
on the web.     Our friend has just bought herself a 1977 type two camper
with a poptop.     I went to see it and it seems solid and mechanically
sound .. but brush painted so cheap ...

			She collects it tonight and wants to drive it to the South of France next
Monday.    I thought that an oil, plugs, dissy parts and grease nipples
would be a good starting point ..

			The previous owner is giving her all the manuals (including workshop) so
I don't have them as a reference at the moment ...  However I want to order
the parts for the job today ..

			Can I check .. There is no oil filter?   It's just the strainer that I
have to clean (with petrol?) and then replace the gaskets ?

			There is a foam seal around the "Engine pan" between it and the body
about 50% of this is missing ... Is this an instant replace or can we leave
it a month ?

			With 2CV flat twin engines the lifespan was massively improved with a
very expensive synthectic oil changed regularly.. is this 1600cc going to be
the same or can I use regular oil and 3000 mile intervals ?

Thanks in a advance ..

filter ..
