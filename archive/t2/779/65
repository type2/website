the 2000 does have a oil filter.<

It's definatly a standard 1600 aircooled unit (we did look at some buses
with other engines but passed them by for ubiquity and cheapness of parts ..

I would continue to change at 3000 miles, in my 78 with a oil filter I
change before 5000 but usually after 4000<

I've ordered the oil ..

Oddly the only thing I knew about type twos utill I started my research for
this one is that "They catch fire".   About 20 years ago I used to work for
the traffic department of Kent police and if the officers ever say a type
two parked at a services or broken down at the side of the road they would
chat to the owner about fuel lines.  If the owener didn't seem "With the
program" they would ask the owner if they could check them.     While I was
with them we had someone die in a type two fire.

I inspected the fuel lines and they look new and are E marked for unleaded
fuel and braided.   The fuel pump is also new ..
