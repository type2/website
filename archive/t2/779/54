Subject: No clearance intake #1

'79 CA Westy

What could cause a no clearance situation with the #1 intake valve?

Chasing worsening lifter racket, I dissasembled the rocker assembly for
#1 and pulled the lifters.  Yep, exhaust harder than a rock, so I'll
replace it, doesn't seem to want to pump up at all and I'm not gonna
mess with the bentley procedure for bleedin' the bloody things, not when
a new lifter is $10....  Intake lifter fine, able to depress it with my
finger or a chopstick.

But noticed that even with the adjustment screw completely OUT of the
rocker arm on the intake, there's negative clearance between the valve
stem and the rocker arm.  TDC, of course.

Dissasembled, it all looks good.  Valve stems the same height and
straight, push rods straight, no sign of any hammering on push rods,
rockers or adjustment screw.  Adjustment screw heads look as new -
nicely convex.

What I can see of the cam lobes looks good, all smooth 'n shiny.

Does it matter?  Currently probably all adjusted to 2 turns per the
local mechanic who replaced my 1-2 head almost a year ago today, I'll go
thru and adjust all to 3/4 turn after it's back together.

Thanks, list!

Teri
