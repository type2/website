Subject: Woe is me - electrical mystery

Woe, woe, woe!

My husband is definitely ready to divorce me.

Or at least sell the bus.

I don't know which is worse.

OK, here's the deal, and thank you to all of you who have responded to my
questions (all right, pleas!).

Eight days ago (seems like aeons) my alternator-starter wire fried.  In a
serious way. 

With the help of Josh Sapp, an amazing CO Springs VWphile I just happened to
meet on the side of the road one chilly mountain night, tonight I

1) Rewired and replaced the alternator and voltage regulator.

2) Got the tap out and replaced and rewired the starter (left the old
bushing in - Josh said it was OK).

3) Replaced the shifter front bushing and rear coupler.

Good to go, right?  Wrong!  A test with the voltmeter between the positive
battery terminal and the positive battery wire was 12 volts.  According to
Josh, it should be zero.  A ground somewhere.  Where? Maybe we rewired the
alternator poorly?  We checked everything else so out it comes.  It's fine.
We double check everything and put it back in.  I take the wires off the
starter - seems OK.

What could be wrong??  "A hundred things."  But where do I start?

The voltage regulator & starter-solenoid are brand new.  The alternator I
replaced less than 2000 miles ago and when I took it out I had it tested at
the local Advance AP and it was all good.  Should I get a new one and try
it?  That's at a cost of $160 or so... Not to mention the $160 I shelled out
for the last one.  Sigh.

Anyway, I am going to sleep on it and hope for a miracle.  Josh is going to
sleep on it and come back again tomorrow.  Meanwhile, we're stuck in
Colorado Springs.  I go to bed dreaming of wiring diagrams.

Any ideas??
