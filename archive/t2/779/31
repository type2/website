at one point a couple years ago when I had my van towed via triple A they
showed up with a rollback that had a crewcab, good for 5 people and if I
recall it actually had 4 seatbelts in the back so I guess 6 people could
have squeezed in....   I was alone so it wasn't a big deal but I suspect
if you need it you could at least ask.

I guess somewhere in the dark reaches of that thing I call a memory I was
aware of this, but seems that with families traveling this would come up
more than occasionally.
