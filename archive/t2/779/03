I have a 78 bus, (have gas heater, too but)  I have put Vanagon seats into
my bus it is a slide in swap.   I then have a "bunk" heater from a truck
stop and sit on it.  this works exactly like many seat heaters and while
not that pretty is very effective in keeping that part of the anatomy
comfortable even if I don't fire the gas heater, and it uses almost no
power.
