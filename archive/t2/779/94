Subject: Re: Electrical mystery

Trouble is, I only have a bike at the moment, so can only test the
alternator at the local FLAPS that's in biking distance.  Thanks for the
info re these testers...

The fuse test didn't reveal any power change.  Everything was unhooked at
the time so I had to hook up the starter, regulator again - hope I did it
right.  By the way, does the order of the wires on the solenoid matter?
Battery cable first - then a red one going up toward the front and another
red one -- then the alternator connector is how I have it.

I managed to borrow a new alternator from the Euro parts store here so will
swap it out and see if it makes any difference.  Hope I can get the pulley
off.  Josh is coming back over in an hour & bringing the full wiring diagram
with him - the vintagebus one is great but hard to look at part by part
onscreen...

I never got electrical systems.  Always my most hated part of physics class.
Now it's coming back to bite me!

I really appreciate everybody's help.  I sure am learning a lot.  Last week
I didn't even know where most of these parts were, much less what they did
or how to switch them out...
