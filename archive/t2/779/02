Subject: SAAB Seats?

I have seen a few people mention that SAAB 900 bucket seats are a pretty
easy install into a bay window on some of the bus site I have looked at.
Anybody here actually done this? I guess you can wire up the seat heaters
and everything. I'm curious about how much fabrication is actually required,
and how much work is actually involved? I need to do something about the
seats in the mighty Westy. I would like to make it more "bottom friendly"
for long haul trips.
