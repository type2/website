You will want to degrease and clean the boot completely, smear it with
black RTV, and then wrap with electrical tape.

 Thanks for your help with the alternator questions, Richard  - I appreciate
 it.  One more: how torn does that boot need to be to cause a problem?  Mine
 is only slightly torn.  Could I just repair it with electrical tape and hope
 for the best?
