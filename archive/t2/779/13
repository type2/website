Subject: [T2] Good to see mid-70s T2 being saved...I hope...

Although this post is directed at the PDX-locale
purchaser, the general T2 list would benefit from a
small piece of good news.  At least I hope it is good
news.
    
This Sunday afternoon, I passed a T2 that was being
trailered.  The T2 was a mid-70's ASI/Riviera Plan
one.  From it's look, it has languished in a field or
forest for some years.  It had WA plates, and was
being hauled southbound on Highway 30.  Windows were
dirty, so I couldn`t scope-out the T2 interior.
    
Hope it isn't being scrapped.  My wish is the new
owner loves T2's and will give it a new lease on life.
 Since the T2 rear-end was at "normal height," I
presume it's engine was still resident, but no doubt
deceased and in need of serious repair.  (But having
been a T2 list member for sometime, I now have learned
of the need to partially dismantle and remove mouse
nests from engines which have been in storage for
extended periods of time.  See?  The T2 list has
helped me become a more responsible T2 owner!)
   
Had the towing vehicle stopped at a light, or pulled
into a McDeath, or some other convenient location, I
would have taken the time to chat.
   
I was in the econo-box Volvo.  My son and his wife
borrowed my T2 last week to go to a String Cheese
Concert.  The T2 hauler was probably puzzled at my
extensive rubber-necking.
    
Did a T2 list member haul a T2 down Hwy 30 this Sunday
afternoon?
