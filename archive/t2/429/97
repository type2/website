If you have access to an air compressor, you can use glass media NOT sand
blasting, and it will remove the paint very quickly. Just remember that the
little glass media balls fly everywhere. I made a temporary blasting booth
by buying cheap tarps and knocked together a "room" with the tarps including
one on the floor to let the glass media land on. That way I could re-use it.
If you want quick paint removal to bare metal, and no metal damage, use
plastic or glass media available at most specialty stores for paint, bondo,
bodywork supplies etc.

Never having attempted this before, I am trying to
remove the exterior (multi-colored) paint off a '79
bus with limited success. I have used the Aircraft
stripper and now using a vibrating sander with 80 grit
paper, again a slow procedure. Now is there an eaiser
DIY way or must I accept the spray/scrape/sand/curse 
time intensive method currently employed?

Tks in advance
