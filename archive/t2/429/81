Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [VB] (friday) Toyota reinvents the Freidolin!

Eh! A GOOD stable mate for my VW Bus is a 1981 Smokey & The Bandit II -
Pontiac TransAm w/ T-Tops.
95% NOT plastic.
 
I think I remember hearing about the Scion.. they introduced that car about
3 years ago, but I guess are just now trying to pass it. Is it being sold in
the US yet? I haven't seen them here. The Japanese seem to be more
interested in large bulky vehicles like what a VW Bus would provide. They
have big car shows where they basically mack out their minivans with
ENORMOUS spoilers, and front chin spoilers.. they paint them some wild pink
colors... very.. well.. imaginative I guess would be the correct word to
use.

to the huge amount of plastic in it, though!"
