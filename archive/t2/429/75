I know this won't change anybodys minds on this, but have you ever done the
figures on what a semi tractor weighs in comparison to what it tows?  Here
in Kansas, it is legal on the interstates for a single axle semi tractor to
pull 3 full sized LOADED semi trailers!!!!

fashion.

Safety does not just mean equipment but has to be coupled with attitude and
common sense.
