Subject: '70 bus drum brakes, pulls to right, plainly just dont work

ok guys, 
my brakes suck, i have done nothing to them but bleed
them, that got them to work. before i start driving
this around alot i want my brakes to be all they can
be, the only prob. is i've done anything with vw brake
shoes in the past. 

I know its simple to adjust, but are there things that
should be replaced like spring etc at this age?
Im concerned that it pulls to right, but more
concerned about stopping.

thanx,
rob
