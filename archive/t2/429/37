Subject: Weight of a camper...RE: type2 Digest 30 Jul 2003 12:00:00

Give me a break...if all the GVW's you've found are within 20 pounds of
correct, then what the hell difference does it make....if what you're towing
with is within give or take even 100 pounds of blowing because you are
towing something then you don't need to be towing
it....duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


If you live in  a state with inspection and any kind of updated equipment,
they have put a bar code sticker on the inside of the driver's
door...probably on the frame...that has info on your bus printed on it
including the weight...it is probably listed as gross vechicle
weight(GVW)...that's everything, including tires and the air in them. Net
vechicle weight ,if you can't figure it out from there is pretty light..

or GVW may already be there from the factory, on my 84 it was. If you can
find it, add a couple of pounds for NVW if you're the one figured this
out...and you're standing inside the bus...

if you've added camper stuff to your bus after buying a noncamper bus, then
look at the cabinets,if they're not oak then they are pressed wood or fiber
board with a laminate(30 lbs?) add 5 gal of water at about 8 pounds per
gallon if your tanks full, throw in 20 pounds for butane tank and compressed
butane, etc., and you can figure all of the camper gear together is 80 to
120 pounds...given that the sink is alumniun and you do not have a slate
tiled bath



in addition, .some insurance policies have it printed next to the
description of your auto...they have looked it up via your VIN number and
it's for your bus...
