Subject: transporter mpg

hello again!
i was wondering... what is the average mpg in a 1969 transporter with a stock 1600? how many gallons does the tank hold? i seem to be getting about 250 miles per tank "city" (actually mostly driving on country roads)...
also........
have a pop in the idle...only at low idle...not an exhaust thing, as i just redid exhaust/intake gaskets when i replaced the exhaust...so, no vacuum leaks or exhaust leaks, ??? carburetor? and it does not seem to effect the performance of the engine.
thanks much for everyones help!
