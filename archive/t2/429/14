Subject: Where is a good place to get a remanufactured/used engine?

I'm tired of chasing demons in my engine. I want to get a new remanufactured
engine and be able to hit the road. I'm tired of wondering if I'm going to
make it, or how much it's going to cost me next time.
I have a 76 Westy. I'm located in NW PA- near Erie. I don't want anything
extravagant. I pretty much want a dependable engine. I'm running a single
Weber Progressive right now- not the best.
I want something that will run down the road at 65-70, push me up the hills of
NW PA, and that I don't have to worry about braking down. I know there is
general maint. to be done, but I don't want to do anything more.

I'm looking at the engines Bus Depot offers right now. Anyone have any
comments/experience on/with them?
Ron- Anything you can say about your engines if you read this?

Can anyone suggest another place for a good engine?

I'd entertain offers on a used one from anyone close to me, but I REALLY don't
want to inherit someone else's problems. I just want to drive!!!

Thanks for any help,

Nik
