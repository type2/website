Subject: Paint Removal

Never having attempted this before, I am trying to
remove the exterior (multi-colored) paint off a '79
bus with limited success.  I have used the Aircraft
stripper and now using a vibrating sander with 80 grit
paper, again a slow procedure.  Now is there an eaiser
DIY way or must I accept the spray/scrape/sand/curse  
time intensive method currently employed?

Tks in advance

Stan
