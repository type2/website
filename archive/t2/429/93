I bought this kit from GoWesty (made by WW):

If you look at the image of the kit, I'm talking about all of the seals
except for the outer one. The kit doesn't show the two vertical seals at the
left and right edges of the frame but there seems to be enough of one seal
in the kit to cut and do all the places it fits.
