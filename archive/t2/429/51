Well, you said it.  They're selling it to kids and they don't really care
about the specs.  The good thing is that it is a DOT-ized version of a
Japanese Domestic Market car and Toyota engineers them well.  What they
don't want to admit to the teenyboppers is that the xB is a very
utilitarian mommymobile, so they concentrate on the pretty geegaws (I'm no
kidding, one of the accessories is multicolored illuminated cupholders!)
that the kids can buy.

There is a
Scion web group (www.scionlife.com) but any reasonable technical
discussion is rare.  Most of them are wondering how to fit 19 inch rims
and cold air intakes.

Most of the drivetrain specs are identical to the Echo.  The only
difference is a shorter final drive ratio to help move the extra 400
pounds around.

It does make a good stablemate for my bus.  I have a hard time getting
used to the huge amount of plastic in it, though!
