Hi,

I was under my bus yesterday trying to rebuild the seat anchor when I found 
out why I wasn't getting any warm air at the front of the bus this winter. 
I put some pictures on the web.

The question is, how would I go about fixing it? I thought about using 
muffler tape or pipe insert of some kind,
Anybody has done a similar repair before?

Thanks in advance for your kind help,
