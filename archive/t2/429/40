Subject: 2L Dual Solex Fuel pump specs req'd

Hi Volks,

I'm in the process of getting a 2L dual-solex engine installed into my 
westfakia. So far it is going well, and I fully expect to have it completed in 
time to go camping this weekend and get home in time for Buses Of The Corn.


This engine originally came out of our 77 Sunroof bus, wearing a Weber single. 
I had expected to use its electric fuel pump to supply the trusty dual solexes 
that I am pulling from the 1.8. 

But... Sometime since I removed this pump in May it has been damaged, and the 
supply inlet nipple has broken off clean.

Can someone please help me out with the fuel flow specs required to feed these 
carbs? A NAPA or Canadian Tire part number would be most excellent, if one is 
available.

Thanks in advance,
