Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?

I'll have to chime in here, I towed my 73 hi roof adventurewagen from
glendale to lakewood with a 2 wheel dolly and my wifes 3.4 v6 4 runner
automatic.  now, it towed very well but mind you their was no cross winds.
if i were driving from say lakewood (south of los angeles for those of you
not familier) to phoenix i would assuredly meet some cross winds and i'm
not so sure it would have been such a nice trip but i probebly still would
have done it albeit a bit slower than the 65-70 we were driving.  i just
don't see where a vanagon has the suspension to do such a move.

I would have to agree with this as well. I have often pondered over what
possess people to tow heavy objects with a 50hp motor on a 3000 pound
vehicle...Personally, I would never consider that as option and I would
barely consider it using my 2003 Mazda B3000...which has a V6 in it and
weighs around 3500 pounds.
