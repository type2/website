The other issue to contend with is road noise especially if you break down 
on the interstate.
I think the biggest challenge faced by someone needing to use the AIRS list 
is what to do while waiting for the local AIRS member to call them back.  I 
know the 3 guys that called me on July 2, were pretty lucky that I was sick 
the day they called.  I missed the phone but called them back within a 
couple minutes.  They were 100 miles away (according to the wrecker 
odometer) on the interstate with a very sick engine and AAA was on the way.
