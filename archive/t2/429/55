Subject: more on exhaust leaks/popping

Well it seems there are a run on exhaust leak problems lately on the list. I
to have been dealing with leaks in my '78. I have replaced all of the exhaust
system from the manifolds to the muffler with all new parts except for the
manifolds which I bought used. They were in much better shape than the ones I
already had. I sanded/lapped all the flanges with 220 wet/dry untill the
surfaces were smooth and even. I am *almost* positive that everything is
sealed tight. I am still getting popping on decel with my foot off the gas and
in between shifting in lower gears. It is better than before replacing all the
above parts but still there. This leads me to my question. I have read on
another list that another cause for the popping could be bad injector grounds.
Anyone ever heard of this? If so what grounds should I be checking,the ones
under the intake manifold on the case or somewhere else? I also am running an
Empi extractor and muffler and thought that it might be from a lack of back
preassure from this muffler.

Any suggestions?Thanks.
