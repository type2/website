Subject: dipstick for oil leaking

just curious is there a rubber groment that fits on the end of the dipstick ....
i think i may have some oil comeing out there.,...?
it keeps laying some oil a small puddle under my fan houseing...
i thought it was the oil filler tube gasket so i replaced that...
i also replace the dipstick boot...through the alternator...

i keep wipeing the oil around the dipstick and it keeps showing back up...

i have tried to come up with something....?
i thnk maybe i can use a small piece of gas hose or a little bigger and fit it to the top of the dipstick to keep what little oil comeing out from comeing out..

any ideas.. i am sure someone else has had this happen..

its comeing out i am figureing right where to dipstick stops....
there is nothing there bu the metal.. looks like somethng mwent there at one time or another,,,?

peace and thanks in advance...
