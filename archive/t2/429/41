Greg,

Just look at the specs for adjusting the psi on the original
stock pump...seems 3 psi was about right.

Then go to the flaps and tell them you need an electric fuel pump for
a carbed engine that delivers about 3psi....not too much more.

Dual carbs(in your engine) are not going to make much difference over 
single carbs in terms of fuel delivery.

Cheers, dave
