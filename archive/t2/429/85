i know this post is bout cross-drilling DRUMS, but i have a rant on
cross-drilling rotors:

don't do it.

cross-drilling your own rotors, or even having it done at a machine shop can
have dire results, the worst being the rotors tend to crack in use. i know
people who had this happen on race cars and it is a scary thing.

proper cross-drilled rotors have the holes CAST into the rotor before they
are drilled. drilling the rotor can also greatly upset the rotational
balance of it.

the brakes on a late bay are very good. use pagid pads if you want better
braking, they are better that the cheapie ones most people use.
