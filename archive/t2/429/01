I might suggest a pair of the new LED lights for the tow vehicle, the
magnetic ones just don't show up well in the sunlight, or very far at night.

Richard and Dawn who were the ones towing have done so many times and use

help.  They have towed MANY busses with their bus, at least two from my bus
farm in Kansas back to Arizona.
