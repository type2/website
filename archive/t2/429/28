I would have to agree with this as well. I have often pondered over what
possess people to tow heavy objects with a 50hp motor on a 3000 pound
vehicle...Personally, I would never consider that as option and I would
barely consider it using my 2003 Mazda B3000...which has a V6 in it and
weighs around 3500 pounds.
