Subject: Re: [T2] more on exhaust leaks/popping

could a dirty fuel filter cause popping?

I give my bus full throttle to hear the engine in
neutral, and it doesnt seen to rev correctly, it
feels/sounds as if though it not topping out on revs
and feels to be restricted in power or something, even
sounds dead, and not mean and lean..

my bus pops and i cant stand it no more, are my heads
bad? I have no idea what the PO did to it, but its
obvious he did something.

under my right cyl. i feel air coming from somewhere,
exaust leak? or a cracked head or warped? It seems the
passenger side has always been the prob side with the
bus..

peace and chicken grease,
rob
