Sorry Rick I can't agree with you.  "All of the safety measures" would include having a capable tow vehicle.  I think you would agree that a drum-braked 3000lb splittie with a 50hp engine does not qualify.

Just because they have done it a few times successfully does not make it safe.  They were simply lucky, up until recently.  I am happy that they escaped from that horrible accident with no injuries, and hopeful that they learned something from the experience.
