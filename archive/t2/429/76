Nice going Dave,

Any comments on the air quality?
Moisture content?
Oil content?

The tank that is shown on their page looks a little small, I'm assuming the 
compressor runs continuously, what does it use for a bypass when the tank 
is full and air is not being used?

This is sure a far cry from the one way valve that we used to screw into 
the spark plug hole on the old V8 to pump up the camp air mattresses.
