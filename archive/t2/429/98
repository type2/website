You're sure there's no wax or other coatings on the paint
that are preventing the stripper from working? I've come
across this on some furniture I've attempted to strip...
You might try sanding the paint first to break the sur-
face to let the stripper "in" to do its work. Try sanding
and then wiping to get rid of the dust before applying the
stripper. OTOH, if the Bus is stripped inside, a variable 
heat gun might be the answer...Start at a low setting and 
bring the temp up until the paint softens enough to scrape 
off. But be really careful and have someone inside to make
sure you're not igniiting something on the other side of the 
sheet metal. We stripped a TR 4, mostly with a heat gun but
it was already gutted and we kept very damp towels on the
other side of the metal we couldn't get off the car...
