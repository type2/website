Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [VB] (friday) Toyota reinvents the Freidolin!

Read an article in Car and Driver on this and evidentally it is
built on the Echo chassis.  Some of the less than stellar things
about the Echo were intentionally modified or left out of this
particular Fridolinesque variation.

LA auto show folks didn't even carry the motor specs or handling
specs on it.  This is what prompted the Car and Driver article, they
ran their own tests.  What I don't understand is why anyone would
set up a booth at a car show and not have something resembling a
spec on hand.  Although it did have a bumping sound system and purty
lights on site.... heh.  Give em a light show and they'll buy it I
guess.  I do appreciate the non conformist body styling....  Its a
heck of a lot prettier than an Aztec (puke)
