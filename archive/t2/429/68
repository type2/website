Subject: AIRS, cell phones and help on the road

Hello all,
In the last few days, I have found a couple of
messages on my voice mail that seem to be from someone
(or maybe 2 different someones) who might be looking
for help with their VW.  I can make out just enough to
tell that they sound somewhat pressured to find a
place to work on their bus (?) but the message is so
full of pops and noises and blank spaces that I cannot
catch their phone number or other info.
I've had occassion a couple of times in the past to
help VW owners passing through western Wisconsin, and
it has always been an interesting experience.  Haven't
made any new lifelong friends, but did end up with a
good feeling and no bad experiences.

I am mentioning this because I suspect there is
someone out on the road in northwestern Wisconsin who
may have gotten my phone number from the AIRS listing
who is wondering why I haven't called him back.  It's
that blankety-blank cell phone, friend--if I can't
hear what you are saying when you leave a message
during the day, I can't call you back. A phone card is
a cheap way to use a pay pone, and contrary to popular
opinion, there are still a lot of pay phones out
there.
Another suggestion--many of us have day jobs, and
evening is often a much better time to contact people
at home, if you have no luck during the day.

Jim, in Menomonie, WI, 
feeling a little bad about not being able to help
