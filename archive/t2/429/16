Subject: Impossible but made it anyway bus stories....

Quoth Casting Fool:
Any other interesting "ought-to-have-been-impossible-but-it-made-it-anyway"
bus stories out there?

Well, the 243,000 never rebuilt Westy made it from NJ to Transporters by the
Tunnel and back- with an oil pressure of 12 when it got to 250
degr....normally I get 18 at 220, but it was a hot day......the 40 wt oil
went in.
