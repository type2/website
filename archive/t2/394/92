...but those guys are professionals....

WAH?

Let's remember slip-streamers, they're also 
48hr-no-sleeping-ball-the-jack-cross-country-speedfreaks.

Before I get flamed, I've got friend whose family business is produce brokering/shipping 
(think short time-frames) companies in Calfornia, so I know of where I speak.
