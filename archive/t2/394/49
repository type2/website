Subject: [T2] changeing oil in crankcase

thanks all for the response....
I will continue with my castrol after all this........
i am still undecided if to continue with the 20w50 or to change to SAE 30 weight or if to use 10w40 or what.
i realize there has and is alot of talk on oil.
Just figured that SAE 30 weight was about what most use?
Exspecially after reading that in muirs book .
Yes i take into consideration that this book is a little old.
Oil has changed since this book was written.
I just want to make sure that i am giving my bus what she needs.
I have heard talk on even tirs haveing to be right just for a bus.
From what i have found a bus is diffrent than anything else i own.
I have only been a bus owner for a few short months now.
peace and thanks to you all!~!~!~!~
