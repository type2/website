 What are the possible symptoms?


Out of about a hundred of them, I have only seen one bad one. And it went south because it somehow got filled
with water.....

For some strange reason VW made 4 different ones for each year: Fed manual trans, Fed auto trans, Calif manual
trans, and Calif auto trans. I have tried almost all of them on my 77 Cal Westy and they all worked the
same... only difference I noticed was the part number. I have half a dozen working ones sitting gathering
dust. If you and Jack have reached the end of all the tests and come up really believing the ECU is dead,
pmail me with your bus year, trans type, and version. [and ECU # if you have it out] I will mail you a good
used one you can try.
