Subject: Re:Transmission removal

Jamie,
    I'd drop the engine first and then the transmission.  That
opiniion comes from the fact that I use a smallish floor jack for such
tasks and I don't think the combined unit would be very stable on my
jack.  Maybe if you have something like an ATV, motorcycle, or
transmission jack it would be easier and safer to do it with them
together.  Remember, safety first.
