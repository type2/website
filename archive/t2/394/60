Subject: Re: [T2] Tie rods and steering dampener

Hello Chris,

can't help you on a local source for the steering damper, but you 
will probably need the bushing as well when you install the new
one.

as far as the tie rod ends go, if the hammer trick doesn't work
(which i think it will with some penetrating oil), then 
rent one of the 'pickle fork' tools from FLAPS. yes, it will
destroy the old tie rod ends, but since you are replacing,
that doesn't matter.

also, get an alignment _immediately_ after replacement. on the
first bus i had, i replaced the tie rods & the drive home(& then
back to the shop) was _very_ scary.

good luck & hope to catch up with you at Natural Bus.

Hi,

I have a pair of tie rods to install on the
bus and noticed that the steering dampener
looks like it is the original. I need to get one
quickly so the question is has anyone been able
to source one from a retail parts store such as NAPA, Autozone, Advance,
etc. No time for mail order

As for replacing tie rods, which I have not done,
is there anything special needed to do the job?
I was told by an old school VW fellow in town
that if you undo the bolts and hit the rod with a
hammer near the ball ends it will flex enough to just pop out.

Nothing ever works out that easy for me so any other
experiences would be good to hear.


Thanks
Chris
