Subject: RE: ECU faulty?

Progress is being made!
I have been going through this link that Ratwell sent  
(http://www.type2.com/dakhlia/AFC/afc.html)and I am making progress but have 
some questions.
To explain where I am at:
From the being of the link I went to--
  engine start trouble
  engine won't start
  pressure (fuel pressure good)
  test light does not flicker (when hooked up to unattached injector wire)
  test light lights up (when connected to center slot in connector going to 
the series resistors)
  test light flickers (when connected to multi-pin connector terminal 1 and 
ground and engine is cranked)
and then I get to this page:

Switch ignition on.
Test voltage between the following terminals on multi-pin connector of 
control unit.
between 10 and 5
between 10 and 16
between 10 and 17
If test light lights up, then the control unti is defective and must be 
replaced.
If test light does not light up:
Check wiring to control ground connection (type 1 on top of alternator, type 
2 on top of crankcase).
Break in wire between multi-pin connector terminal 10 and double relay 
terminal 88b.


I am not sure I am connecting to the correct terminals(I couldn't find it in 
the manual either), but I counted from the bottom as 1 and went up.  When I 
hit 2-4 the light comes on and the fuel pump runs at one of them.  At 5 NO 
LIGHT.  Up around 16 and 17 I get a little confussed at which to count since 
they are side by side, but 16,17,18? all light up(the last few in the row).
Anyway, I assume 5 is suppose to light up and since it doesn't I'm to 
conclude the ECU is bad???
Does it sound like I have tested this correctly?

Thanks a million, it's nice to feel I am making some progress even if the 
problem isn't solved yet!

p.s. How is my friend doing that seems to have the same problem?
