Valve adjustment is in order after bad compression readings, before leak
down test.  Lots of people totally guess on the valve adjustment procedure
and screw it up a lot........

I am working on a vanagon now where the owner replaced his push rod tube
seals..........and then it ran like shit........also now has oil leak.

So, I go into it.  First off, big oil leak was due to him using a
distributor o-ring instead of the correct o ring on one of the push rod
tubes................next, the push rod retaining wire was installed UNDER
the rocker arms........one cylinder had so much preload the valves never
closed...............now the engine has 135 in each...........before hand,
high was 110 and low was 80..........

Same vehicle had burnt points, spark plugs in the heads finger
tight......................on and on.
