Subject: Fw: need a scan of a Bentley page

 Hi Gang.
 
 I can't for the life of me find my Bentley manual. I need to see the page that describes the shifter
 linkage adjustment on the early automatic tranny. If someone could scan that page and p-mail it to me
 it would be most appreciated. I think it is chapter 6 section 3.4 page 9 .
 
 Thanks.
 Beep Beep
Dave
