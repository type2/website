Subject: Re: [T2] hot wire under dash...

get this checked out by a local vw tech asap i would figure...
hot wires???
the plastic being hot isnt good.. even the wire it self in the 
exspression was hot (meaningthat it was a + wire with power to it)thats 
diffrent just wrap the end with electrical tape and a wire end cap..
but for the wire its self to be hot the thought even worries me...

is it hot when the ignitionis on or all the time?
what does this go to or come from .. battery? fuse box?
