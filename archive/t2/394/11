       BusFusionites, time has run out for pre-registration and T-shirt
orders.  The T-shirt order goes in Monday morning.  If we have some dollars to
spare we may order a few extra for those of you who want one and did not order
one and for those who have not pre-registered.
       With less that two weeks to BusFusion you need to make your plans now
to head on up to Mississippi Mills, Ontario for the premiere VW camping event
in Canada !  Held in conjunction with RiverEdge, Festival of the Arts in
Mississippi Mills this will be an event not to miss.
       The BusFusion Activities Schedule and the RiverEdge Events Schedule are
close to their final format.  Check the respective Websites for complete
details.  BusFusion  - RiverEdge - Celebrating the Arts in Mississippi Mills
       This coming weekend of June 6 ~ 8 is the IWCCC's first event in
Drummondville, QC.  I will be going up there Thursday and will not be around
until Monday afternoon.  Any inquires about BusFusion will be responded to
Monday evening.
       Don't forget to reserve your tickets for Sarah Slean and the Civitan
Lobster Fest.
       Don't forget your VW Art for the BusFusion Art Show & Sale
       Don't forget to bring your VW items for the BusFusion Flea Market.
       Don't forget to make plans for the BusFusion Van Painting - theme is
Water this year.
