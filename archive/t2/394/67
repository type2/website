the filler tube gasket is actually quite thick, as gaskets go, maybe about
0.030". it is made from the green waxy type of gasket material, impregnated
paper of some sort. regular paper gasket is not the right thing for this
location at all.

again, not the right idea, IMO.

RTV should not be used in the crankcase anywhere, there is a high likelihood
of globs of it getting into the oil passages and this can destroy the motor.
a little silicone grease helps the gasket stay put in assembly and will
never do damage. if you must use sealant, use permatex or hylomar in very
very small amounts. but you shouldn't need it.
