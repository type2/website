Subject: [T2] Oil Filler tube gasket

>i hope it doesn't seem like i am picking on you theodore, but i have to
take
issue with a few of your points:

No problem here. I just remebered the gasket being thinner. You are most
likely correct. Most paper gasket material I see in the FLAPS these days is
impregnated, which is what makes it gasket paper.  As for the RTV IMHO it
is fine for this use provided it is the correct type for this application
and it is used properly. A very thin film to aid in sealing and keeping the
gasket in place is not likely to end up in the crankcase. Now trying to use
the RTV in place of a gasket, or laying down a big bead that squeezes out
around the sides is certainly not what I had in mind. Either way I don't
think its a big deal.

As always just my $.02...
