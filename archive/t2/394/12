Subject: More Tie Rodisms

Well, I managed to crack a pickle fork :( I have thrown in the towel 
for the day. Tomorrow I will get John's tie rod separator and have a 
go at that. FYI, I was doing the work without jacking up the bus 
because I could see no advantage in unspringing the suspension and I 
did not feel like dragging the floor jack up from the basement. Would 
having the bus on the ground keep the tie rod end from parting with 
the steering knuckle?

Thanks
Chris
