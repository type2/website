Subject: Any thoughts? my engine is running rough

Hello list,

I have been having trouble getting the vacuum up in my
bus. My bus has a 2L f.i. engine. I only have 7in of
vacuum at idle. The engine runs but it runs roughly. I
pulled the spark plug wires one by one from the
distributor cap to see if any cylinders were not
firing. I found that each spark plug is getting spark
but I was able to pull 2 of the spark plug wires off
and the engine did not run any different. BTW, the
dwell is 54 using Pertronix. I assume that i am
running off of 2 cylinders. Am I right to assume that
because the vacuum is only 7 and that 2 cylinders are
not firing this means that the valves are out of
adjustment on 2 cylinders? This motor has 0 miles on
it since it was rebuilt so I do not think the valve
seats have fallen in. I do not think there is any
other vacuum leaks. Does any one else have any ideas
about what could be causing this? I did gap the plugs
before I installed them. I plan to change them ASAP to
the stock type of plugs instead of the Bosch platinums
just because I know the stock ones will work properly.
I just want to make sure I am looking in the right
place before I go on a wild goose chase. Thanks in
advance for any tips. 

BTW, the fuel pump works fine and I am using brand new
injectors.

Thanks and have a great day!

Regards,
David Kelly
