Subject: Sway Bars?

Hi folks,

I am thinking of installing a bigger sway bar on the front end of my bus,
probably the sway away kit from Bus Boys. Maybe a rear one down the road
but maybe not. I just got new tires (Yokoham 356 load range D) and am
really happy with the improvements. What I am wondering is what types of
improvements can I look for with a sway bar that is bigger than stock? I
don't want the suspension to be so tight that I feel every little crack in
the road, but will this help some of the body roll from driving in high
winds or when  big truck goes by. I know that nothing will eliminate these
effects entirely and thats part of the excitement from driving a bus, but
what I am really asking is based on your experience with one of these bars
"is it worth it?" Also how much of a PITA is the install? Will I need an
alignment afterwards. Do I need any special tools?

Thanks,
