Hiya Steve,

Indeed, Bob Hoover seems to have the last best word on that firewall 
pass-through.  His remedy is much better than the rubber grommet installed by the 
factory.  What were the boys at Wolfsburg thinking anyway?  Exposed to that much 
heat a rubber grommet would have a short lifespan indeed.

In any event, Mr. Hoover's solution is cheap, practical, easy to do, and 
efficient.  I would suggest that anybody interested in taking a major step to 
reduce the liklihood of fire in their bus consult with that particular sermon.  
And if I'm too far off the beam, I believe that sermon is in the Type 2 Archives.
