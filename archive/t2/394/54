Subject: Pison/Liner Question

OK, I've successfully dropped the engine and tranny on my 79 Westy and have
done the disassembly. Brought the heads out to a machine shop for a check up
and now I'm trying to figure out my options for replacing the
pistons/liners. I'm seeing prices and types all over the board. Most of the
bus parts places have 2.0 sets for ~$375.00. Bus Depot has a Brazilian setup
for $290.00. There is a guy on Ebay selling a setup that will boost to 2.2
without requiring any additional machining for $350.00.

Anyone have any advice on what they've had success/failures on? I'm not
afraid of Brazilian stuff as I had a Fox for a long time that was Brazilian
built and ran like a tank. But if someone has had issues in the past I'd
like to hear.

Any advice will be helpful!
