Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

I was thinking about having a custom tonneau cover made a year or so ago to
eliminate my high top. The local marine shop, who also makes pickup
tonneaus,  was going to make me a cover, but not with snaps at the front. He
was going to use a moulding that they use for boats, which would not allow
water underneath it at highway speeds. I think it was a track or something
that a rope will slide through. Snaps have their weaknesses at 60 mph,.
