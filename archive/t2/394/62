Subject: weekend bus update

well, i finally fixed my accelerator pedal problem by upgrading to a late
bay linkage under the bus.  i also got a new carb linkage setup at the
junkyard and had to modify the carbs a bit to make it work but it is now
working much better than before.  the old linkage bar had a bend in it and
was hitting the airbox but looked like it was a stock bend as it worked
great except the clearance issue.  the new one is straight.  i also put in
a late bay under dash heater controls that move both fresh air flaps at the
same time but for some reason i can't figure out how it was supposed to be
hooked up between the switch and the tab on the bar going to the flaps.

my final problem to be addressed before paint is that darn shifter.  i have
replaced the bushing that is at the end of the shifter that looks like a
little tube and the shifter ball still comes out of the socket it is
supposed to ride in if i use any more than super delicate pressure on it.
it wasn't like this when i bought it last year but after removing it once i
have never been able to get it back in correctly.  anyone have any
experience with this who can point me to my fault here, i know it has got
to be something obvious that i'm missing.
