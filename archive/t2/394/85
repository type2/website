I too have a 71 poptop westy and am thinking about doing the exact same 
thing. Are there not aftermarket sunroof assemblies available? I think i'd 
rather buy something that I know would fit then to try making something 
myself.  If you do try what you are thiinking with snaps I'll be very 
interested in how it works out, may go that route myself.
