Subject: Re: [T2] Questions.. Comments... Timing Scale Note

Hi-
Quick note about timing scales: I was unable to find one from any of my
local or mail-order vintage VW parts houses here in Canada. (I know that I
can get them from some of our fine US mail-order venders. Crossborder
shopping is a PITA that I like to avoid if I can.) Out of desperation I
called my local VW dealer. At
least here in Canada, The timing scale for our type 4 engines is a regularly
stocked (& cheap) item at VW dealers.
Cheers,
Matthew
