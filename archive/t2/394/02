Subject: Change to synth for trip?

I've been running 20w-50 dino for two years
but have been reading that the synth will lower
the temps a bit.  I am about to embark on a 4000
mile journey in june in a 78 2.0L rebuilt FI westy.
Should I switch or stay with what Im' using now?
by the way the oil is "For higher mileage vehicles"
thanks in advance.
