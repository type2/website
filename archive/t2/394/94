OK, thanks, I got it...

Since my VW is about 15 ft (177 inches) long, I should have 1.5 - 2 Westy 
car length spaces from the front of my Westy to the rear of the trailer.


BTW, I noticed the sign on some of the trailers that say "If you can't see 
my mirrors, I can't see you!!", so do you think I should honk my horn every 
few minutes so the driver knows I am back there??

And the trailer MAY be able to stop in a shorter space than my Westy, but 
then again, I did just put new shoes on the rear wheels..


Barry thanks all.

PS.  Since 90% of the accidents occur within 3 miles of your home, I will 
patiently wait until I get outside that radius.  No use tempting . . .
