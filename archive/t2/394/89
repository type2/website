Subject: Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

Hello.

I was just wondering (just a thought; not a sermon) : : :

I was being squeezed out of my lane by an 18 wheeler this AM, on I-95/495, 
on the way to work.

Naturally, in keeping with the only road rage response available to me [1- 
passive or 2- proactive road rage], I slipped behind the 18 wheeler and 
enjoyed the ride, if not the scenery.

However, I did not notice any improvement in drafting the 18 wheeler (if 
that was a 'semi', I would hate to see a full grown one...).

How far back, or close up to the 18 wheeler should I have been,  both going 
at 60 MPH, to notice the draft??

I notice significant buffering usually at 3 truck lengths behind most any 
large trailer, so I gather it must be somewhere between 0.10 and 3.0 times 
length of the vehicle.


Thanks.

I let you know how it turns out on the ride home.
