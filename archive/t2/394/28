Subject: re: [T2] Any thoughts? my engine is running rough

hello Jamie,

Thanks for the reply and the info. The needle is
steady. it does fluctate with the changes in engine
idle but it does not jump back and forth. It is
possible that my piston rings have not set yet. I have
not been able to break them in because I have been too
busy trying to get the engine to run right. I did set
the timing to 5 btdc with a timing light. The only
other place that might be causing a vacuum leak would
be around the throttle body gasket. Those gaskets are
NLA and I had to make one using gasket material. I
noticed somthing else strange. I had the port on the
air plenum that is supposed to be hooked up to the
brake servo plugged. When I unpluged it, I expected
the engine to die but instead, the engine idle
increased dramatically causing the vacuum to drop
some. When I pluged it back up, the vacuum spiked back
to around 30-40 and then quickly droped back to 7 in
as the idle droped back to "normal". Thanks again!

Regards,

David Kelly
