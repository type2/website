Subject: Oil Filler tube gasket

You can get one of these if you buy a complete engine gasket set. Pretty
expensive for on egasket. If I were you I would go to your FLAPS, get some
gasket paper and make one that way, use the thin stuff as that is what the
original looks like, dont use cork or anything thicker than regular paper.
Make sure both surfaces are clean and dry, use some brake parts cleaner or
carb cleaner to get rid of the oil, be careful not to spray a bunch of that
stuff into your crankcase.  Then when you put the new gasket on use a
little high temp RTV sealant.
