Seriously, folk . .


It was said >>Snaps have their weaknesses at 60 mph,.


If you took the tent off the Westy, you noticed that there are four aluminum 
rails that held the tent canvas to the body with little screws.

Well, run down to your fabric store, grab 2 yards of suitable heavy clear 
vinyl, and screw the four aluminum pieces back on top, capturing the vinyl 
underneath.

This is something ridiculously cheap and can be accomplished over lunch (if 
you take the lunch hour(s) I take!!)

No need to thank me.  All in a day's work (so to speak)
