Subject: flywheel xref?

Guys,

Double checking that a flywheel off of an 81 vanagon engine
will go on my 78 t4 rebuild.  

As a side issue, would a 72-74 flywheel fit the 81 vanagon
engine crank...yes, I know they are different clutch disk and
pp sizes.  210mm vs. 220mm...but will they interchange on the crank.

Also, where to get various thickness t4 crank/flywheel shims.

Also, Bentley shows some sort of metal gasket between the fan and the 
fan hub, but I didn't get one in my gasket set.  Do I need one on a 78?

Cheers, dave
