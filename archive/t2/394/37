Am I reading something into this, or is my '77 Bay unusual?

We've got one sliding door on the passenger side (USA), windows front to
back with a vent window in the sliding door toward the front of the window,
a vent window to the front of both driver-side rear windows, and (had) a
short and a long bench seat in the back.

No partition behind either front seat, and seat rails on both the driver's
and the front passenger's seat pedestals.

The bench seats are out (and gone) and we're configuring the back for
transporting stock to shows, etc..

Normal setup?
