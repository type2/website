Subject: glimpse within 'Convoy'

Ah, breaker one-nahn  ...  whut's yr 20?   ...   Omaha  ...
... a thousand screamin' trucks  ...
... and 11 long-haired friends of Jesus, in a chartreuse mahkrobus

	This stupid rekrd 'Convoy' has just been played in a late evg 
'nostalgia' session by top Radio NZ  pop musicologist Wayne Mouat. 
It took me back 3 decades to when we actually had something 
resembling an effective, somewhat coherent movement against nuclear 
power (allied with, but much larger than, the movement against 
nuclear weapons), which furthermore affirmed non-nuclear futures. 
'Convoy' was being plugged on pop radio during the period in 1976 
when the then biggest petition to the NZ Parliament  -  0.3 M 
signatures  -  was being organised as part of the Campaign for 
Non-nuclear Futures, in which my then wife & I and a loose circle of 
contacts around the country were playing Jack the Giant-Killer  - 
successfully, as it turned out; nuclear reactors are excluded from 
NZ, as well as nuclear weapons.

	Pop music, some of it moronic, can evoke good memories.
