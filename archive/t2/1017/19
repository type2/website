Subject: Distributor problem

Hello all,



I tried searching the archive and library, but couldn't fine anything
the seemed to fit my problem.  I probably just didn't know the correct
term to search for.



My 81 Vanagon Wesfalia cranks fine, but will not accelerate.  As soon as
I press the accelerator pedal it dies.  I was trying to figure out the
problem this weekend and discovered that if I disconnect the vacuum line
running to the distributor the engine seem to run much better and does
not die when I rev up.  I did not drive the Vanagon with the vacuum line
disconnected, I just revved it up with the accelerator.  I am stumped as
to what to do next.  It seems to me like it must have something to do
with the vacuum advance on the distributor, but I'm surprised that it
would accelerate at all without the vacuum line connected.  Can someone
please point me in the right direction before I waste money replacing
the wrong part?



Thanks in advance for the help.
