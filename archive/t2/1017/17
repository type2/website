Subject: RE: Who does work on Eberspachers?

The chambers are not to be used for 30 years. They are considered junk
requiring mandatory replacement every 10 years. That is why these things
typically have a little tag with the date of initial use. The German TUeV
inspections, for example, will not pass a car that has a Eberspaecher with a
heat exchanger older than 10 years in it.

If yours is rusty, toss it. It is a fire hazard. I doubt that you will find
an authorized service place that will rebuild these without replacing the
heat exchanger. At that point a new AirTronic may be more cost effective.

OK, I've got two B2 Eber. gas heaters here, and the thermoswitch/quarz
sensor rods are NOT coming out without shearing the top off the inner
chamber threaded connection, (in fact I've already done this with one, so I
suspect the heater is instant junk). They are SO delicate here, yet it
requires their removal to service the switch. VERY poor design. After 30
yrs, the nuts are so siezed on I would say your are NOT going to get them
seperated from the inner chamber threaded male fitting.
