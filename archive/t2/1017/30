Keep in mind that the listings Just Kampers has is for UK and European
Market Type 2s, especially for the 72-79 models as most were equipped with
the upright 1600 and the fact that UK Type 2s are Right-Hand Drive with
completely different cable lengths.  This is why their cable measurements
may be different than what was used for North American models.

Had I clicked to look at the header in Phil's original message in the first
posting, I would have known that he's corresponding from the UK (Gmail
mercifully hides all that crap). Had Phil let us know he's in merry old
England, some of us wouldn't have given potentially misleading information.
