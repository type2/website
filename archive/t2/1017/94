Subject: mackerle air cooled motors book

i purchased one of these recently, and if you don't know, this is an 
AWESOME trove of info on how a/c motors work. mackerle focuses on 
tatra (where he worked), but he includes others in detail.

this is the 72 version:
1972 Air-Cooled Automotive Engines

(Automotive) AIR-COOLED AUTOMOTIVE ENGINES. By Julius Mackerle, M.E. 
Second, Revised and Enlarged Edition; John Wiley & Sons, NY, 1972.

here's the deal: the store has another copy for $50. the first person 
who gets back to me and agrees to donate $20 to the list maintenance 
fund will get the addy and phone # of the seller (after the 
fundmaster gives me notice you have donated).  your $70 total will 
still be less than i paid for my copy!!

older, UK copies of the book go for $300...
