Sounds like water is collecting in your flasher relay - mine does that too
...

Here is a quick fix: cut a hole into the plastic housing of the relay. This
will allow water to drain out of the relay and also reduce condensation
inside the relay since the housing is vented now. Having a spare dry relay
in the glovebox is a good idea, too.

In an ideal world you would fix the leak that allows water to enter. But if
your windshield frame is severely rusted (like mine) seal replacement may
not be a good idea since it would also include considerable metal
replacement around the windshield. In the long-run that is the only real fix
...
