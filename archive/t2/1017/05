Well, I spent all day yesterday working on the Bopmobile in anticipation of getting it to pass TN emissions testing.  I was going to change all the plugs but the only thing I could find close by on Saturday were AC Delcos and you couldn't remove the connector on the top.  So I checked and cleaned all of the plugs that were in it.  They were all Bosch except one was Bosch Platinum.  That was the only plug that looked the least bit burnt.  I cleaned and replaced them but I intend to replace them all, not with Platinums.  I guess what I've read here was right about them burning hotter.  Don't know why the odd plug.  I did them myself a couple of years ago and don't remember doing that.  

At a VW fest a while back I had bought an electronic ignition module.  Couldn't get that to work.  Changed back to points (new) and it ran fine.  Then I got into the carb.  It was indeed running too rich which probably explains the high CO content.  I leaned it out and upped the idle to keep it running until I found a good balance of power/performance vs. burning too much fuel.  She runs like a top now but the emissions place was closed by the time I got there.  Have to wait until Tuesday morning.   I did find that the breather screws had all come out, except for one that was still loose.  I changed the air filter and fixed that, so she should be breathing ok. Also, I found a source of my oil leaks...no seal at all on the distributor!  I'm anxious to see how much difference putting one on makes.  I found the right one.   I'll let you know how it turns out with the state.  Cheers....KR
