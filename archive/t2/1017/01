Subject: Fuel Injection..???

Hey guys... I was talking to a friend of mine at Der Otto Werks here in
Ogden, He stated that I could rip the injection off an early Vanagon and put
it on my Engine?? Have any of you done this?? What parts do i need to watch
for and grab off the Vanagon providing i find one? This would for sure solve
all my carb issues, it sure did when i converted my Fastback to FI.. So much
nicer.. Please let me know your thoughts.. Thanks for the wisdom in advance,
may the vw gods be with you.


Jason
