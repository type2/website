And that case difference is not "strictly" significant, can easily be overcome to work, sporting the "dual dipstick" look.  Otherwise case differences are bearer bolt diameters, breather, both easy to overcome.  Internals as Scott mentions are the same, heads likely are not if the GE engine is truely as it came, it is likely oval port.  But crank, rods, cam, hydraulic lifters, valve train, pistons, cylinders, oil pump, etc, etc all the same.

All the internals are interchangeable. The only significant difference is
the crankcase itself.
