Subject: Who does work on Eberspachers?

OK, I've got two B2 Eber. gas heaters here, and the thermoswitch/quarz sensor
rods are NOT coming out without shearing the top off the inner chamber
threaded connection, (in fact I've already done this with one, so I suspect
the heater is instant junk). They are SO delicate here, yet it requires their
removal to service the switch. VERY poor design. After 30 yrs, the nuts are so
siezed on I would say your are NOT going to get them seperated from the inner
chamber threaded male fitting. If anyone knows who can service and hopefully
repair my little learning experience I would appreciate it.
Thanks,
Courtney
