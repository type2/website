  In my case, having just changed the cable - not long enough :-(

I used a cable listed as 8/69 - 7/71 in my '71 van (1600 engine) and it's
about 8 inches too short. I can just see the end of the cable I used to pull
the new one through.

Is a '72 cable a bit longer ? I suppose I could bodge things with a cable
joiner at the front and make something that works but it seems a shame to do
this if the correct cable is available. 71 was a changeover year but I can't
see why this particualr part would change.

On the positive side, I used some heat shrink tubing to join the two ends of
the cables together to pull the new one through. I thouhg this was quite
clever and once I found the right size it worked well.

Thanks
