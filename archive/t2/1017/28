By Golly, you're right.  It did run fine until I bought new gas, then started running sluggish.  May have gotten some bad gas but I richened it back up a bit and it's much better.  And I threw a bottle of 91% Isopropyl in it.  She's going to have to sit for a while now.  

I'm off again, guys.  This time I have to sign off the list, but I'll be back early next year.  Thanks for the advice.  Everyone have a great holiday season! Cheers....KR

Adjust this before you overheat or your engine starts pinging.

New CO: 0.41%, Big difference!  Now I'm thinking I'm running too lean.
