Hey Ron,

Sorry for your loss. Glad nobody was in your Westy when it got smashed like
that.

The insurance process will suck but it's always fun to start the search for
another VW - I'm sure you'll score a great find. Winter is always a good time
to buy and most folks don't get the camper itch during the cold months so
fewer buyers around.
