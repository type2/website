Firstly I should state that what I don't know about carbs could fill a
book! However, I believe that increasing the venturi size could result
in loss of power at lower revs because it reduces the acceleration of
the air through the carb which is the purpose of the venturi.

Removing the choke would of course make it more difficult to start and
run when cold. It would be easy to test by setting the choke to remain
fully open before removing it entirely and seeing how you go in cold
weather.

Polishing the throttle plate I think would be in the category of
infinitesimally small gain for a lot of work (aka complete BS)!

Have you considered a Weber progressive? Although vilified on the Type 4
engine, I believe they are better suited to the Type 1 engine which
comes stock with manifold heating. The advantage of the progressive is
that the two barrels gives you the smaller venturi for low speed running
then both barrels when more power is required. As for looking stock I
guess it depends on how knowledgeable the person checking it is!
