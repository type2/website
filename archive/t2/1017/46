A few months ago I asked Dawn why her website no longer listed 74-79  
poptops for sale and I never got a reply...

Michael,

I have some poptop fabric samples from Frank Grote in UK:

The orange is the original color you are looking for but recently he  
has stopped listing poptops on his website...

http://www.vwbusparts.freeserve.co.uk/vwbus/weleroof.html

When I last talked to him he said he was trying to source a new  
supplier. Send him an email and see if he has anything in orange to  
sell you.

FYI. I always wanted one of his canvases but he had trouble sourcing  
yellow and the exchange rate for prohibitive.
