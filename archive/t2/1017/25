Subject: Re: Distributor problem

>I was trying to figure out the problem this weekend and discovered that
if I disconnect the vacuum line running to the distributor the engine
seem to run much better and does not die when I rev up. I did not drive
the Vanagon with the vacuum line disconnected, I just revved it up with
the accelerator. I am stumped as to what to do next.

It's possible that the diaphragm in the vacuum advance unit on the
distributor is ruptured creating a vacuum leak when you rev the motor.
Did you block the vacuum advance line when you removed it?

You can check the vacuum advance unit by moving the base plate inside
the distributor to simulate the action of vacuum then blocking off where
the vacuum line connects. If the diaphragm is ok the base plate will not
return to its rest position. I have only been able to do this test by
removing the distributor and using my tongue to block the vacuum inlet!
It is supposed to be possible with the distributor in situ using your
thumb to block the vacuum line but I can never get a good enough seal.

>It seems to me like it must have something to do with the vacuum
advance on the distributor, but I'm surprised that it would accelerate
at all without the vacuum line connected.

There are a number of distributors that rely on centrifugal advance only
such as the notorious 009.
