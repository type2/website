The tree looked healthy before it fell. But we'd had a lot of rain recently,
so the ground was soft, plus it looks like there was some erosion near the
base of the tree due to its location along the bank of a small creek.  On
Sunday night we got a major ice storm with high winds, and the tree
uprooted.  As a few people noticed, it missed my house by only a few feet,
and no one was hurt.  So all in all, I feel pretty lucky.
