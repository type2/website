Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint removal

If your going to use a torch... instead of heating up the arm,, and causing
change in it's strength etc... and working like a ....  just blow the ball
joint out ... then you don't even need a press. You have to be a bit tricky
with the outside wall of the ball joint,, once you get it red hot,, ready to
pull the extra oxygen trigger.... turn off the accetalene, and let the ox
that is present blow a slot on the ball joint... you might have to do that
twice,, 180 deg apart,, then the 2 halves will just fall out.

you might think it is crude if you have a press,,,, but if your somewhat
proficient with a torch.. it is very easy with no damage to the arm at all..
