Subject: Re: [T2] How long is an accelerator cable ?

An equiry to Just Kampers brings this reply:

3462mm J10223 68 - 69
3410mm J10224 69 - 72
3620mm J10226 72 - 76
3780mm J10221 76 - 79


I'm going to order the 72-76 one as I think that will give me the extra 
length I need. I'm still mystefied why this changed over the years but for 
the moment I just want my van on the road.

Thanks for your help.

Phil

72 is a bit unique and requires a special one.
