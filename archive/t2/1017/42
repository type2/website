Give a call to Carol (-at-) Sewfine (800) 739-3463 and she should be able to help
you determine your seat and make a quality seat cover right there in-house -
they've really jumped into the Type 2 & Vanagon interior products with both
feet in the past year.  They're actually called 3/4 Middle Seats to
differentiate from the actual 1/3 - 2/3 Front Bench Seat on non-walk-thru
models - terminology is where it's at, so be specific when identifying it or
you may end up with the wrong (and sometimes unreturnable) seat cover.

Even though manufacturers like TMI say 68-73 and 74-79, I agree with Karl
that the main difference is the holes in the later ones for Headrests, but
most late Bays I run across these days have them yanked out and gone to that
great "seat heaven".  So I'm sure id there's specific differences in
dimensions of the bottom or seat back.

You didn't say what year YOUR Bus actually is, but that may or may not have
made a difference if your middle seat was obtained elsewhere from whatever
it originally came from.
