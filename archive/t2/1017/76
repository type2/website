 Hi,
 we are able to obtain Westfalia canvas tops in "Corn Yellow", an original 
 colour for the van....when new, canvas tops were fitted according to 
 availability and customer preference and so orange and yellow were produced 
 and fitted side by side..we are only able to obtain the yellow now, with 
 either one or 3 opening net windows..price in the Uk is #250, about $500 
 USD, plus postage.
 If ordered, the canvas can be available in a matter of approx. 4 weeks.
 regards, frank

Um, at $500 for yellow canvas, I'll get one from Ron at the Bus Depot :) I
really wish there was someone making, or willing to make, an orange canvas.

 Michael,
 
 I have some poptop fabric samples from Frank Grote in UK:

 The orange is the original color you are looking for but recently he  
 has stopped listing poptops on his website...

 When I last talked to him he said he was trying to source a new  
 supplier. Send him an email and see if he has anything in orange to  
 sell you.
 
 FYI. I always wanted one of his canvases but he had trouble sourcing  
 yellow and the exchange rate for prohibitive.
