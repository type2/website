Subject: Cylinder Lapping

I was just talking to Jason and he had to pull his head to get the
studs removed.

The question is, will he need to lap the cylinders again? There were
no gaskets. I say yes.

And if so, can someone give a better description of the process than I
can? "SPinning the cylinder in the head with some lapping goop" just
doesn't cut it. ;)
