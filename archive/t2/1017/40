73 and up seats have headrest holes.

Robert asked:


 I am trying to get a seat cover for a bay window 2/3
middle bus seat.  Mail order companies specify 
different seat covers depending on if the seat was
make before or after 73.  I am unsure of the year of
the seat I have.  What are the differences?
