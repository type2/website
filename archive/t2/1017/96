Subject: Ball joint removal followup

A few weeks ago I posted a question about the special fixture and/or ways to remove the ball joints.? 
Here's how?I ended up doing it:
I cut the centers out of the ball joints with a torch, leaving them about an eighth inch or so thick where they meet the arms.? (pretty smoky...do it outside!)
They were pretty hot, obviously, and I was able to drive the remaining ring out with a chisel or a punch pretty easily.

I sandblasted the arms and pressed in the new ball joints with a 20 ton press and a 4" long 2" diameter pipe nipple? (sch 40).? I had to remove the ball joint boots so that the pipe nipple would fitover the joint without pinching the boot.? (if you had a pipe of about 2 1/4" inside diameter you wouldn't have to remove the boots)
The 20 ton press shoved them right in, no problem.
I tack welded the ball joint to the arm (on the side that should have a grease fitting- the side opposite the boot) Two small, 3/16" or so long tacks, so as not to burn the joint.? Tacking the ball joint in was probably not necessary, but it is my daughter's bus, and I'd rather be safe than sorry.? The tacks will be easy to grind off if and when the joints ever need replaced again.? A coat of POR15 finishes her off.
Really went smooth, and I would have been done a lot sooner if I hadn't had to wait for the joints to come UPS.? Bus Depot and CIP1 had way better pricing than my local FLAPS, and I wasn't in a hurry.
Anyway, thanks to everyone who provided info about the press fixture and ball joint removal.? I appreciate it. This site is a great resource.
Thanks again, everyone,
