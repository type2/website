Hey guys,

    How bad-ass would this be in the third gauge pod of our gauge cluster?

http://store.wagaero.com/product_info.php?products_id=247

It's got Oil Temp, Oil Pressure, Cyl Head Temp, and Voltage all in one 3.25"
gauge.

There's even enough room in the center to attach one of those chrome beauty
caps that's in the center of the other two gauges.

It's absolutely perfect, it EVEN comes with all the gauges.

Only problem is, it's $449. That's 2/5ths of the total price I paid for my VW
Bus to begin with!!!
