Subject: Orange Westy canvas top

Does anyone know who is making an ORANGE westy top? I have a '74 that has an
original 3 window canvas top, and being a "Stock-Nazi", I would like to replace
it with another orange one. My original is TOAST, ripped, torn, only 1 zippered
window was salvegable. I contacted EZ-softtops in California about orange
material, and I received this reply:

Hi Michael, 
Just contacted the manufacturer to have them send that sample from their
location and they have informed me that they no longer will order that fabric
because when it is folded it leaves a white line crease in the fabric and is
really too stiff to work with.....Sorry, just the gold, yellow and grey will be
available to order. 
Best regards, 
Denise

So, does anyone know where I can have a top made, that will satisfy my desire
for ORANGE? Or am I S.O.L.? Thanx listers, 'yall are great!
