Subject: My Westy is totaled!

A 60 foot tree squashed my Vanagon camper like a bug early yesterday
morning.  I've never seen a Vanagon so totally demolished.  Not a single
body panel is intact, and it literally split at the seams. The curious can
see some pics at:

While I've had a number of VW campers over the years of various vintages,
this one had a special place in my heart, as my little girl (now 9) pretty
much grew up in it over the summers. 

Anyway, now comes the arduous process of convincing the insurance company
that a VW camper is worth more than the NADA book says it is. And finding a
replacement.  I'm leaning toward another later model Vanagon Westy, but
wouldn't rule out a really clean '76-79 or even (maybe???) a Eurovan. If
anyone stumbles on one that isn't overpriced, please let me know. Driving
distance from Philly is preferred but not absolutely necessary.
