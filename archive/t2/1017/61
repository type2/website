Not sure which solex's. Most likely the dual set up from SCAT. (not my bus, 
not my engine) No leaks in the intakes. Not sure about a balancing tube. I 
know that my intakes have a notch down at the entry to the head. Is that 
what you mean? Or is it a tube going across the engine between the two 
intakes?
