Subject: importing a 64 bus into Canada from the USA

Ok,, I know about riv.ca ... I am reading it again ,,  but I have a question
... I will attempt to call the border crossing and get their take on it,,
but somethings are easier with the authorities,,, if you have done your
research first,, and say all the right things...

This vehicle I am looking at does NOT have a title... seller say bill of
sale is all that is required in his state prior to the '70's

Can i bring a 43 year old volkswagen across the border without a title..
something tells me I'll be in trouble..

anyone have the secret?

this is the quote from riv.ca   that tells me I *should* be able to bring it
back with these other documents.
THE OWNER MUST ESTABLISH THAT THE JURISDICTION FROM WHERE THE VEHICLE COMES
DOES NOT HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS REGARDING SUCH
VEHICLES and provide to Customs the original document that shows the basis
for ownership or right of possession, such as a bill of sale, and two
complete copies of that original document. Further, the owner must certify
in writing to Customs that the procurement of the vehicle was a bona fide
transaction, and that the vehicle presented for export is not stolen.

maybe I answered my own question,, I thought I'd ask to see if there was any
first hand recent knowledge
