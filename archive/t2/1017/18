Subject: Re: [T2] How long is an accelerator cable ?

The 72 Only cable is essentially the same length (see the list Kris hansen
posted).  The main difference is that the cables up thru 71 were solid, the
72 cable is braided.  They both have the same ends as well.  The loop end
that goes to the pedal attachment was used thru 74 on the Dual Carb Models,
"S" end style was 74 FI/75-79.
