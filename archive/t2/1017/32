Subject: Bus tow bar in western WA

Does any freindly listee have a bus tow bar they would be willing to entrust
me with for a week or two in western WA? I live in Puyallup, but travel
everywhere from Tacoma to Bellingham for work so could pickup and dropoff just
about anywhere. I have access to a machine shop and want(need) to make a tow
bar for my busses, but dont have the correct measurements. Since the busses
reside some distance away from the shop I want to have a pattern with me while
welding/fabricating my own so would like to have one in hand when I go to
"shop night" (our version of a weekly cocktail party where my freinds and I
have a few cocktails, tell some outrageous lies, and fabricate things for
fun.

For anyone that does have one, and will let me borrow it for a short time, I
would also make a spare for them for their time that they could sell or
whatever."What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The treeof
liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood ofpatriots and
tyrants. It is its natural manure."-- Thomas Jefferson (letter to William
Stephens Smith, 1787)
