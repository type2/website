Subject: Re: [T2] Orange Westy canvas top

Hi Michael.

I too have an orange '74 Westy. Let me tell you, its hard finding an
orange pop top canvas. Everyone will tell you they are made to order,
and when you order orange, they'll send a gold one...which is not even
close to the original color.

I recently bought a large amount of orange "duck cloth" which is
pretty darn close to the original material and color. I cut out my
original windows and plan to incorporate them into a new canvas. THe
windows were still in really good shape.

I think I paid $60 for enough to do the project... but have been
putting it off until the weather gets warm again.

There are different qualities of this material out there and I got a
pretty good quality. I want to say its 12oz duck cloth but that might
be incorrect.
