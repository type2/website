Subject: Re: [T2] Bay window bus middle seat differences

Even though manufacturers like TMI say 68-73 and 74-79, I agree with Karl
that the main difference is the holes in the later ones for Headrests, but
most late Bays I run across these days have them yanked out and gone to that
great "seat heaven". So I'm sure id there's specific differences in
dimensions of the bottom or seat back.

  The upholstery changes from basket to square weave in there as well, I assume in '74.  That aside for the option of having headrests is the major difference year to year.  I know my '76 had the square flat appearance and my 73's had the deeper smaller basket weave, and despite 20+ buses over the years I've oddly never owned a '74 or '75 bus.  I don't think bay 3/4 middle seat frames change, front seat frames changed with the upholstery or perhaps at some other time from flatter squatter seats with the knob tilt mechanism (that look in shape like the rear seats) to the slightly more contoured ones with "bolsters" though I do use that term very loosely in a bus.  (Pictures of a rusty orange westy cornering on a skidpad (or the DC beltway) at 0.52g with Steve Dolan strapped into a set of Recaro's jump to mind for some reason.)

  On a similar veign but aside, is anyone making the green vinyl found in late bay westy's?  I still have yards of the OEM '76 cloth from the group purchase we did 12? years ago (which I feel like an idiot for selling at $4/yd back then with repro crap going for $30/yd now) but I've never seen the green vinyl to trim it with.  Anyone got a source?
