Subject: Re: [T2] How long is an accelerator cable ?

I think the next question is,,, do all the cables have the same shape end at
the pedal,, and at the other end?

I was thinking I should pull my cable out,, and measure it,, because, I have
a 74 bus with 2 liter injected engine,, so.. I think I used a 211-721-555AA
1975 to 1979  Manual Transmission, 3548mm

Your list shows 211-721-555N  1974 Fuel Injection, 1435mm
I assume that must be a automatic .... I think they were the only efi in
74..
but that length is half the length of the rest...
