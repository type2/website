Subject: Re [T2]any takers?

Sounds like a person who loves their bus, but in dire straits.  Sounds like
me!!  Unfortunatly I would have no chance of "buying my bus back"  I would
lose it to the pawn store.  Hope your problems work out.  I am still holding
out on keeping her.  I know it has been posted before, but  who knows a
trustworthy transport company.  Say from Fort Collins Co  to Atlanta Ga.
recent lose of license  makes move and drive much harder for me and my 78.
