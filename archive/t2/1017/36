Subject: RE: [T2] Orange Westy canvas top

Bus depot has one that says you can specify the color. Seems they are built to
order? Maybe they can provide samples to you. Sunbrella is a great material.

This shows colors that go westy has. I'm wondering if what they call yellow is
close to the stock color. Yellow Orange maybe?

The other thing - if you have a canvas that will be good for a pattern you can
find someone that sews and can make your own. Then you could pick out the best
matching canvas you can find.
