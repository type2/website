Subject: Two cheap busses in western WA

while searching for bus parts last night, I ran across this ad. these bodies
look real nice and I cannot bear the thought of these going to a junkyard so
thought I would link it here for anyone in western WA that could make use of
them. I still feel regret for a '78 I had about 4 years ago I was working on
restoring and cherried out the body but never could get the engine running and
had to haul to a wrecking yard. the stuff of Nightmares. "Someday" I will have
my own property where I can devote all my spare time to bug/bus restoration.
It is truely depressing how many buses I hear of getting cut up that are in
such good shape.
