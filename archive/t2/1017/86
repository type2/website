Subject: Re: [T2] My Westy is totaled! 

Ron,

Did that tree hang up in another one or end
up supported by its crown structure?  Seems
to have stopped pretty high off the ground
unless you want to tell me that the residual
strength of the Westy body is what was holding
it up.

Under the circumstances, I might suggest enough
welding and the like to mate the rear hatch
to an external wood furnace and then feed 
that tree into it...
