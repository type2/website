Pontus asked:


 Hi volks!
I am about to renovate a type 4 engine, GE00484, and have a  vanagnon
engine, CV033091, lying around.
Does someone know what parts are interchangeable?
Clutch, pistons, cylinder heads etc..?

GE00484 sounds like you are missing a number or 2.....

If that is all of them, then you should have a 78 engine. This means you
will have oval exhaust ports.

The Vanagon engine will have square ports, so the heads will not work.
