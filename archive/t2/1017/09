Subject: Great Bus Toy

Hey all,

I found a great Splittie toy in the gift shop at the hotel I stayed at when I
was in L.A. for work last week.

They make a double cab too. Cost about $20.

Too bad the don't make a Bay, it would have looked like our first Bus, the
scruffy but well loved Das Bus. She went to a good home after I bought
Peadpod.
