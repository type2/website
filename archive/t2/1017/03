Engine and Bus Specs..

I have a 72 Westy, It although has the nicer Safari Top with a 6 foot bed up
there too ;)

Engine, 022 stamp on heads and i just had to replace one cause the po had
dropped a valve seat, replaced with 2.0 head. so i belive its a 2.0.

I am hoping to put Vanagon injection on it as i was told its not too
difficult, just need to find a donor vanagon thats all there or a few to
piece together.

I do however have type 3 carbs on the engine which i found out run a bit
lean.. I have a set of Stock carbs i bought from mark dearing in virgina,
however, Even with a rebuild.. I am having issues... Runs fine at idle, but
does not want to go up hills like the t3 carbs do.. t-3 carbs take hills ok,
but the stock ones however... seem to go to an extent and feel like they
should "open up" more.. but dont.. kinda like running into a wall.. just
goes so far then... no power.. does that make sense? he may be sending me
another pair to get right.. i do have the idle bypass circuit working. idle
cutoffs working.. balanced at idle... i do need an adjustable linkage rod to
make sure the right carb is getting enough throw.. Hope this helps..
