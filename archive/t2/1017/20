"Gauge gives oil pressure (PSI), oil temperature (degrees F), cylinder head 
temperature (degrees F x 100), and exhaust gas temperature (degrees F x 
100) all in one gauge.

It_ is _an attractive design, but I don't see the need for an exhaust gas 
temperature gauge. EGT is very useful on a turbo engine, but I don't see 
the value on a naturally aspirated one, when cost is a consideration.

I have always appreciated the "Teutonic simplicity of only what is 
necessary" that was the basis of my Westy design.

The EGT feature seems to be a departure from that design 
philosophy.....(and Todd's observation that he finds the price a disturbing 
feature in relation to what he paid for the whole vehicle.) So, I agree 
with him but for a different reason.
