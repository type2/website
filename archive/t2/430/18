Don't know if you got his last time. Having puter problems. 



>>I looked at the pics and wanted to ask some questions...
>>
>>1) What was your source for the swaybars?
>

www.aircooled.net

>>2) Cost?
>  
>
Around $250.00 for the set.

>>3) Do you think the rear bar could have  shorter link? Could I shorten the 
>>links and still have the same function?
>

I have been thinking about shorting the rear links. I can't see any draw back to it. I wrote the manufacture about the rear links and never got a reply. I have since put poly bushings on the front. I am going to play with the links in the rear sometime this fall..

>>Thanks for the great pics.
