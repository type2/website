Subject: turn signal switch

in my 72 bus my turn signal switch was not releasing  and the horn 
started honking when i would turn left. i  took the switch off and 
noticed the white plastic piece  was cracked. for a short term fix i 
pulled the wires off  the horn and put turn signal switch back 
together.   

the part # lists a different switch for different years.  is it possible to 
easily make any bay bus/bug/vw switch from the late 60's-70's 
work or do i need to look for one from a 72 bus? Does anyone have 
a spare they don't need?

thanks 

scott
