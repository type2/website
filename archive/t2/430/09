Getting the old ones out will generally require a press. But the kicker is that it
requires a special jig to hold the arm in the press. When I did mine I assumed
that they would be similar to my Type 3 but came to find out that there isn't a
good flat spot to set it on. The place that did my Type 3 ball joints was unable
to do my Bus ones. Of course they sat there for 2 days with no phone call but I
was lucky to find a local VW shop with the necessary jig so I didn't lose too much
in extra down time.
