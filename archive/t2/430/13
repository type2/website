The difference here is that a semitractor is part of the tractor/trailer
combination and carries a large percentage of the weight of the first
semitrailer.  When you tip the trailer over, the tractor goes with it!

They pull triples here in Nevada as well, and it's scary.  Loaded trailers
don't bother me, but the prospect of pulling two empties followed by a
loaded trailer scares me!

In closing, you can pull just about anything with anything, but you have
to use proper caution.  The scariest thing to me is the braking.
Semitrailers have brakes on all wheels, but a towed bus does not.  Once I
was towing a 10000 pound Airstream with a 6000 pound suburban and the
trailer brakes failed.  I was driving on a wide graded dirt road and hit
the brakes for a corner.  The tow vehicle wheels locked up and I had to
release them to get steering control.  All I could do was steer straight
ahead into the sagebrush while braking as much as I could and it took
_forever_ to stop!  Did I mention that this was at night?  Did I mention
that the suburban and trailer belonged to my employer?  I'm a lot
more careful now, as losing the trailer brakes took away about 2/3 of my
braking ability!
