Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS, cell phones and help on the road

It's a stretch to call this bus content, but I'm on the AIRS list, and if
anyone leaves me a phone message I'll try hard to help, but they'd to well
to pay attention to the last half of my message:  "You'll improve your
chances of being called back if you slow down when you get to your phone
number."

It helps.
