Subject: Re: [T2] burned exhaust valves

For all you inquiring minds out there, yes this company is AVP.  I don't 
want to bash them because I don't know what really happened and the 
company has always been very friendly and helpful.  Still, it really 
gets my goat that they claim I should have adjusted my valves according 
to this undocumented procedure, and that was the reason they burned.  I 
will admit there was a period of time I was running with the timing 
advanced, since the bus wouldn't idle otherwise... of course temps would 
be higher.  But, I never drove the thing very far, the oil temp/pressure 
gauge readings would always scare me into stopping.  I suppose I am at 
least partially to blame.

In the end, it has just been a very costly and time consuming process.  
This had been my first shot at any kind of engine work, before I sought 
help from mechanics.  And I spent a LOT of time doing my homework, 
studying Bently, Tom Wilson, online info, talking with other bus owners, 
etc.  Kinda turns me off to the whole DIY Volkswagen thing :^(  I just 
wanna take my family camping in the bus...
