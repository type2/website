Subject: Still looking for a GAs Heater

Thought I'd post gain now that everyone is back from the Bus Campouts and
meets;

Looking for a complete working Gas heater from A Baywindow or Vanagon. Will
even consider one from a T4.
I need the complete set, wires, timers switches etc.....
Would also like a copy of the install instructions.
