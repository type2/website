Dang! I keep forgetting that people NOT in California don't
ahve such access to the goods!  I have the origional seats
from the '80 westy in my friends attic...was going to
install in the '78 westy, but if I can get teh BMW 325is
leather ones to fit, they may come available...not
realisticly able to ship over there though...in the
pick-n-pull yards here they are often abundant.
