Gil,
I just have to ask this question---
What is your definintion of "looking really good"

I don't want to be opening ths can of worms again--BUT
Spray cans, rolling and brushing with farm tractor enamel isn't really
even worth the time or effort.
The paint will be short lived, and the quality of the job will fall
short of your expectations.
Yea--I have seen the "I have rolled and brushed my Bus 10 years ago with
Benjamin Moore enamel, and it still looks good" tales--I'd like to check
out these deluxe paint jobs--

Now if you would like to do something neat--and will be really cheap, if
you don't care what the end result will
be---
Go to WalMart---and pick up some flat latex olive drab green, brown and
tan.

Roll and brush a camo job on it---

You could duplicate a WW II Afrika Corp paint job--with the black palm
tree's on the doors, etc.
No masking, very little prep, no depleting the ozone, no respirator
needed, and it'll dry pretty fast.

As long as you want a low dollar paint job--might as well look cool---

" The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of the
good deal is gone"

You can't get anything good looking on the low, or no budget program.

Later,

TK---

  
E-mail message   
 
With all this paint discussion, I picked up on a string where someone
said "(paraphrased) you can go to an auto/paint supply store and get
them to mix your color and put it in shaker cans." 
Is that just for the camper top, or are you saying that one of those
places will put them in handheld spray cans and you can then paint an
entire bus and make it look really good? 
That sounds like a great idea if it works because I have a 74 orange
westy and I'd like to make it better looking, but I can't afford the
auto body shop price??? and frankly I don't want to rent a spray painter
and go the big route.. 
thanks...
