Moral dilemma...
Stopped at an auto parts store for some oil, and when I returned to
my Bus, a couple young (17/18) guys were lookin' at it. After a little
chit chat, one of 'em asked me if I could get him some 'weed', since,
"you still smoke, right?" Well, actually I don't, and I was wondering...
Would it be a bad thing (shades of Martha Stewrat), if I told 'em to wait 
there and I'd be right back with some 'weed'. Now I figure I could get to 
the Shop-Rite and buy two bucks worth of oregano and bag it up in about
a half hour. If I sold it to them for twenty-five bucks, I'd make a profit
of twenty-three bucks...My dilemma: Does the list think this is a 'fair' 
profit margin or not... ?-)
