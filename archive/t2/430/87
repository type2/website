Subject: alternator plastic shield???

ummm...

ok, I forgot...it's been awhile since I took it apart and
I can't decide how the alternator plastic shield goes back on.

I don't dare force it as it is NLA and mine is a little brittle.

Bentley is no help and the ramva ekta parts listing doesn't help either.


The tab that a bolt goes thru goes where?  Under the lock down bolt(at the 
top) or on the bolt that makes the "hinge" part?

Thanks ,dave
