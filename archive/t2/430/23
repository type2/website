Subject: more on exhaust leaks/popping

--Hey Rob,

be sure to always mention the year of your bus and your engine type/setup for best results, I recall you have a '70? right?

Popping (backfiring?) can be caused by exhaust leaks which let outside air into super hot pipes and combustion actually takes place again in your exhaust system. Obviously not good.

I'm sure something could be happening with the carb as well, but I would doubt fuel filter. Your carb only needs about 3psi to operate.

Also, you should always feel air coming out of the bottom of your engine because that's where the used cooling air is going to come out of. Make sure you have all your tin on the underside of the engine present and accounted for.

An easy way to test for leaks without burning the bejeezus out of yourself is to shove a shopvac in the tailpipe and set it on blow. Spritz your exhaust system with soapy water and watch for bubbles in bad places.

Good luck,

Billy
