There was a Morris Minor in a backyard near me that was painted in latex
forest green to match the foundation of the house...Every year would be
my guess and every thing except the glass...Last I saw it, it was a green
house (lotsa flora growing inside it), and nothing but a thick latex shell
holding together whatever metal was left... ;-)
