Its Friday !!

The Bus is packed and I'm just heading out to Vernon, BC from Calgary, 
AB to cook in the sun (-at-) Peach Fest.
With any luck I will see some of you out there ! Keep your eyes open 
for the orange Safare.
This will be her longest journey to date !

Anyone else voyaging this weekend ?!
Have a great weekend all !

Steve
