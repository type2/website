Subject: Help Idle Problems in TX...

Listees,

My dad just informed me that my new 82 Westy, (that i have yet to see) is 
having major problems keeping an idle when stopped. I am completely clueless 
and a virgin to the type4 engine, what could be causing this and what is the 
fix??

Is there a list memeber in Austin/Dallas area that could help me out with 
this, I would really appreciated it.

If you can help give me a call tonight on my friends cell, 512.565.2145, or 
if you get this message tomorrow (Sat) try my dads cell, 830.263.0897.

Thanks,

Daniel
