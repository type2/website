i took my reservoir out from behind my seat to clean up and add a new tube to 
it, after i added the new tube i wanted to see if it was air tight so i blew 
into the tube, and it wasnt air tight, air came out of the little hole in the 
top of the reservoir cap.. is this right? or is there a diaphram or something 
in there supposed to stop that from happening? thanks for the help!  scott
