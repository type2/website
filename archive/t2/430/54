Subject: painting...

With all this paint discussion, I picked up on a string where someone said
"(paraphrased) you can go to an auto/paint supply store and get them to mix
your color and put it in shaker cans."

Is that just for the camper top, or are you saying that one of those places
will put them in handheld spray cans and you can then paint an entire bus
and make it look really good?
That sounds like a great idea if it works because I have a 74 orange westy
and I'd like to make it better looking, but I can't afford the auto body
shop price??? and frankly I don't want to rent a spray painter and go the
big route..

thanks...
