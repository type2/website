no dont do that that would suck on your part..
if they want to get high enough then they will find a bag somewheres else..
dont be a ass and sale them some bull s**t!

just because you drive a bus they think you are a smoker there bad for being stereo typical..
not all bus owners are hippies and not all bus drivers are smokers or do acid or shroomz or what not whatever hippy folk do ... which is still being stereo typical..
i have know many true hippy folk throughout my life and have know some of them to just be a hippy without the smoke or other things..

dont sale them no oregano... 
pass out bad karma expect to get it back three fold..,

as a kid this would be a good idea but i am takeing it that you are older than just some kid lol and not saying you are a old folgie either ... lol
peace and have a good day..
