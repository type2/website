Doyt--

Anything is possible---

I personally haven't applied any Petit, Awlgrip, ( another popular
marine urethane finish) or Imron with a brush and roller---
A friend of mine has a 75' Chris Director Motoryacht , and he tried to
roll and brush the flybridge one spring---it was a disaster on the
vertical surfaces because in order to get any decent coverage, the paint
has to be applied pretty heavy--and this is the first problem--the
runs--
If it's pretty warm out the paint will also start setting up before you
can "tip" the rolled finish with a brush---and as with his large area of
the flybrige---as well as the sides of your Westy--this can be a problem
in having dry area's---where the brush will drag on the semi starting to
harden paint--very difficut to spread out over a large slab sided panel.

I have sprayed all of the bullet proof urethanes--Imron, Petit, and
Awlgrip to boat hulls and top sides----with great long term results---
But this rolling and brushing thing takes a bunch more time than I care
to get involved with--it can be done---but what a pain--

Oh--my buddy with the yacht?
He called me after he made a mess---what a nightmare sanding down the
Imron--all the paint had a tendancy to "ball" up on the DA paper---it
didn't go too far--before having to change the paper.
And I went through a lot of it--
This is your call--but in my professional opinion--spray it---
Less work and a much nicer overall finish--

Later,

Terry

Refinished...body paint question
Bottom line: Looking for judgement call on painting the _body_ of my
Westy with a roller/brush. It is all prepared and in primer (2 years
getting it back from patchy rust, etc.)Gonna do it myself, on a nice day
in the back yard.
THE PROBLEM: Modern paints are incredibly complicated systems and I
think they require big volume high pressure sprayers, and they are all
very expensive, and require complete body suites and helmets to avoid
death from inhaling the spray. I know I can't rent the equipment and get
up to speed on the skill and judgement that it will take to put on that
incredibly expensive/dangerous paint. And professional painters
want/deserve $800-$1,000 and up to even talk to me about putting a top
coat on my ready-to-paint Westy.
A POSSIBLE SOLUTION: I'm considering applying a marine paint myself,
with a roller and a brush, and living with the results. That way, I can
get a painted surface that has ultraviolet filters and silicone shine
enhancers and built-in flow helpers already in the paint, right out of
the can. I had really good results using marine paint on the poptop last
week. But that is such a different surface than the Westy body that I
need some advice to decide if it is doable.
THE PAINT: I refinished my Westy poptop with Pettit EasyPoxy single
component polyurethane topside paint, #3108 Off-White. $30/quart at
WaMart, Marine Department. It went on the poptop so smoothly and looked
so good that I am entertaining thoughts of using that same paint to
cover the entire bus. I figure 3-4 quarts will do it + $90-120. So, here
are the questions:
Using the roller/brush method, will that same marine paint dry equally
smooth on the vertical metal surfaces of the body, which are in primer
and ready for a color coat? On the poptop, I used a roller to apply the
paint, and then I brushed out the result. The brush marks just erased
themselves beautifully, and the paint dried as if it had been sprayed
on. But, the fiberglass top is a vastly different surface than the
painted metal sides of the vehicle.
Next question: Is there some OTHER paint system that is a candidate for
application with a roller and brush? When I talked to a boat painter,
along with the Pettit line he also recommended DuPont Imron. OK, on the
web I looked into Imron products and found at least 5 different
varieties (numbered down from 6000) and I obviously can't use any
judgement in picking the one that will go on easily with a roller and
brush, and look good on my Westy, which sits out in the sun all the
time. And the Imron stuff looks like it isn't pre-mixed with all the
proper additives. But....I CAN get it tinted to match my existing paint
color. That is a big advantage.
I'd appreciate a judgement call from someone with painting experience,
addressing the question of a good topcoat that can be applied with a
roller/brush, and which can be mixed to match my stock VW color Sage
Green....76 Westy standard green (Taigagrun, L 63 H).
And any other ideas will be appreciated.
