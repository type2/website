Subject: RE: [T2] Battery

Michael,
There is a metal plate that bolts into the pan of the battery tray
that secures the battery to the battery tray.  Most of the buses
that I have seen with the bungee method of battery security have
boards under their battery's because their battery trays are rusted
out.  Is your battery tray intact?
