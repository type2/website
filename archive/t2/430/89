Subject: Dallas Help ?

Listees, 
My dad just informed me that my new 82 Westy, (that i have yet to see) is
having major problems keeping an idle when stopped. I am completely
clueless
and a virgin to the type4 engine, what could be causing this and what is
the
fix??
 
Is there a list memeber in Austin/Dallas area that could help me out with
this, I would really appreciated it.
