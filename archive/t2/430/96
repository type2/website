I also have a `77 Bay, and I would be a happy camper to find a set of usable
(not mint) Vanagon seats for my bus somewhere near to the Augusta, Georgia
area.  Heck, I'd probably consider throwing some repro's into the deal.

My bus has the tracks on both sides, driver and passenger, so installation
will be a breeze.  The current driver seat needs restuffing and upholstery
work, and there is no passenger seat.  I'd much rather install the Vanagon
seats than redo the driver's seat and try to find it a mate.

Fabric color does not matter, but good padding and a minimum of cuts, burns,
and tears is a must.

Anyone got the goods out there? :O)
