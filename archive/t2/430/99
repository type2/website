Subject: '80 Vanagon Backing plates on a '78 bay

If I pull the backing plate (et al) off a '80 Vanagon, is it a simple 
replacement onto a '78 bay??

I will pull everything from the Vanagon backing plate to the drum

Reason: want to upgrade the '78 to self adjusting brakes.

Thanks

Barry

'78 Westy
