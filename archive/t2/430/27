Subject: PopTop Westy Dimensions?

Please reply to Michael - thanks!

----- Forwarded message from Michael Hathaway -----

Can you refer me to, or do you know the rough dimensions of the pop top VW
camper van (Westfalia camper ).  It's a 1978 which I am having transported
to me from quite far away and do not want to get stuck with the extra charge
for full size vans with camper top/conversion vans.  
 
Thanks for any help you can provide.
 
Thom
