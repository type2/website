Subject: HCBF aeiral photo's update: not quite yet :-)

hey volks
I am getting tons of emails asking when ALL of the aerial photos from HCBF 
will be available for order.

I am still waiting on the masters from the pilot.  They are in the mail, I 
expect them next week.

I have found a web service called SHUTTERFLY that will allow you to order 
your own prints of these aerial pics - any size upto 20x30.  The photos will 
be of high enough resolution to get good prints at this large zize.  You 
will be able to order online securly with credit card or paypal.

I figured this would make it easier and quicker for your guys to get copies 
of the prints instead of sending me a check, me getting them printed in town 
and shipped.

AS soon as I get the prints I will get the account set-up on SHUTTERFLY.

thanks again to everyone for this year's HCBF,
buddah
