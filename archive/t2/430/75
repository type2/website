Hi Tony,

If I had a dollar for every kid who has asked me for drugs while I was
getting into my bus, I could probably buy another bus.  I guess that is one
of the risks of being approachable and patient with strangers...
It seems to me that if you are going to go to all that trouble, you should
be sure to pick up a blank index card to cut up into little squares.  That
way the hippie dude in the VW Bus can sell them some acid too...  Heck while
you are out on your shopping spree, you could stop by the local costume shop
and pick up a fake badge so you can "arrest" them after you sell them the
goods.  Maybe that would teach them about asking random strangers for drugs.
How have these kids escaped natural selection this long...

							Have a great weekend,
							Jay

Give me ambiguity, or give me something else.

Moral dilemma...
Stopped at an auto parts store for some oil, and when I returned to
my Bus, a couple young (17/18) guys were lookin' at it. After a little
chit chat, one of 'em asked me if I could get him some 'weed', since,
"you still smoke, right?" Well, actually I don't, and I was wondering...
Would it be a bad thing (shades of Martha Stewrat), if I told 'em to wait
there and I'd be right back with some 'weed'. Now I figure I could get to
the Shop-Rite and buy two bucks worth of oregano and bag it up in about
a half hour. If I sold it to them for twenty-five bucks, I'd make a profit
of twenty-three bucks...My dilemma: Does the list think this is a 'fair'
profit margin or not... ?-)
