well I wrote it up some months ago in a little more detail...personally it
didn't seem like much at the time, just a solution to a problem...I had
just bought the bus and I liked most everything about it EXCEPT the gowd
awfull babyshit green paint job it came from the factory with.  Barry
keeps trying to convince me it is a pretty color but.....I'm not buying

so I bought something called "Custom Color" from a local FLAPS (Salvo I'm
pretty sure) but it is a regular brand... will have to get a can from the
garage as I have a few left over and use em for touch ups when I do body
work and things...my bus is a bright white to below the windows and a dark
metalic blue below the windows, with a deep red one inch stripe seperating
the colors (which I am now replacing with Scotchlite reflective material)
