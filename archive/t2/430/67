I guess what it all comes down to, Tony, is,
are we talking FRESH oregano or DRIED?

Knew a guy who sold grass clippings to 8th graders while he was living with a teacher. Needless to say he ran into continuing lifestyle problems for several years.

Got his first DUI in his squareback on Acid driving around with a loaded bong between the seats. Not a pipe in the glovecompartment mind you, a whole bong with water and packables.

When the cop came up to his window, the girl he was with started screaming, "We're on acid, We're on Acid!" 

The squareback made it to the yard shortly thereafter.
