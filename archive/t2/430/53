It was camper & commercial. I can't remember the type of paint but I have
seem the finished product - looked pretty good. Certainly couldn't tell it
from an average spray painted job. Not up to the best show winners but good
enough for a working camper.

I read in a magazine recently about paint that was designed to be rolled on
(or brushed) and was for a vehicle. I am not sure what magazine it was, but
I will look around tonight. I think it was one of the last few Camper and
Commercial magazines. It was probably last quarters issue. The paint
supposedly was very thick but self leveling, even on vertical surfaces. It
sounded like decent stuff. I will see if I can find the article this
weekend.
