here we go, even though I have a sprayer and have done even Imron spraying
when I had to do my bus I had to do it with spray cans for reasons that
had nothing to do with paint.

first I divided the bus into 9 regions, (3 side panels on each side,
front, rear, roof) and did each one seperately, I started with the roof
and ended with the bus front.

second I did as much body work as I could, not perfect but as good as I
could at the time.

third I masked one region and primed and painted in one day.

I used a very high quality auto enamel and put on several coats of the
paint....this was not cheap in fact I figured I spent more than if I would
have been able to pull out the spray gun.   several cases of spray paint
at about $5 a can (got a discount for buying by the case)

while I don't think the job was my best work, it was the best I was able
to do under the circumstances...the whole job took a couple months.

if you were at Everybus you could have seen my 11 year old paint job,
which I rarely wash and have never buffed or waxed.....hey it is my daily
driver and I use it for work....but you could have eaten off the engine it
was that clean!!!

cheap wasn't one of my criteria and I figure with the body work etc I
spent about $350-$450 in materials on the paint job and several months of
my time
