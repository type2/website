Imron contains isocyanates. Those are some nasty chemicals, as they're odorless
and will cause permanent brain and nervous system damage. If you don't
have the proper safety equipment I strongly suggest you avoid using Imron,
even if you intend to brush it instead of spray. 

Not to mention that I can't imagine Imron looking anything but awful if not
sprayed and sprayed rather expertly. You can go to an automative paint store
and have them make up the colour of your choice in an enamel that they will
put in rattle cans for you. I'd do that before rolling/brushing.
