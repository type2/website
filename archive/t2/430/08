Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal, emergency flashers revisited.

just curious but have you tried sanding the inside of the connections out where the bulbns go..
 mine quit working once and i found out that the seals wernt holding on the front turn lights and that they had rusted inside.. this was right after purchase..
just a thought this may or may not be a problem for you but thought i would mention it..

i used a small dremel roll with sand paper on it.. that way i could get up in the hole where the bulb goes..
peace
