 Any idea what the projection does?

Sounds like you have the 68-73 double-ended handle. It is made that way so you can work the door from the
inside.....68-73 Westies have the sink unit standing behind the pass seat, with very little clearance between
the door and the sink unit with the spice rack/shelf.
