California only.  Sun belt in February, rest of the US in June, 2004.  I
think that this is a marketing gimmick to increase desire and generate
publicity.  folks are going to Californai to buy them from quite a way
away.

Now if they would just come out with a Scion that is about 4 feet longer,
two feet higher, and, oh, yeah, have an aircooled engine in the back...
