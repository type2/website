Little late on that one, from what I've done so far I
let it dry on the floor and sweep it up in a pile to
throw away.  I figure once the bus is done the garage
will be ready for a good cleaning.  On the flip side
the cats figured out real quick that stuff wasn't a
good substitute for kitty litter!
