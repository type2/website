Subject: RE: [T2] Paint Removal

Due to a real big e-mail I received yesterday my
account became saturated and I didn't receive any
e-mail for the past 18 hours.  Real bummer coming into
work this morning and seeing no bus stuff, had to
start work instead.  I had too many honey-do's so
didn't get a chance last night to try out the
suggestions on paint removal but will work on it the
weekend.

Tks again for the help 

Stan
