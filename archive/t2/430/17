Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint advice.

Anyone contemplating replacing their ball joints (and anyone with a 30+ year
old bus that hasn't looked at them lately) should spend a few minutes in the
Type2 Technical Articles Libary (www.type2.com and click on "Library").
Then scroll down and click on "Ball Joints" (or any of the hundreds of other
useful topics for that matter).  LOTS AND LOTS of good write-ups and
step-by-step instructions on how to fix almost anything on your bus here.

Thanks to the site admins (and the much-missed Josh Rodgers) for setting
setting up and maintaining the Technical Library!!!
