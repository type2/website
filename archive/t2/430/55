_>>>Is that just for the camper top, or are you saying that one of those
places
will put them in handheld spray cans and you can then paint an entire bus
and make it look really good?
That sounds like a great idea if it works because I have a 74 orange westy
and I'd like to make it better looking, but I can't afford the auto body
shop price??? and frankly I don't want to rent a spray painter and go the
big route..

I wouldn't go that route Gil. It costs somewhere around $35 a can to have a
shop mix a color for you. Great if you just have to touch up a panel or an
area that had rot. Bad idea for painting a whole bus. For that price it
makes more sense to go to Maaco and get a cheap respray for like $500.
