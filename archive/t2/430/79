> Inciditentally, I dropped the bulb and began searching for it. I
picked up under the seat what I THOUGHT was the lightbulb but instead ended
up being a 1/4 full vial of crack cocaine. Called the police, they told me
to just throw it out because if I brought it in, they'd arrest me. Called
CarMax, they told me to bring it in and they would have a police officer
there. Needless to say, I took a picture of it, threw it out, and brought
the car to CarMax.

Then there was my buddy working as a military cop out in Omaha doing civil
patrol and he found a ton of weed stashed in a car door during a stop.
Something like $10K worth! Ya never know what you may find in a used car
haha
