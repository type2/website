Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Removal

well i myself was haveing the same problems trying to get through several layers of spray paint..

my wife bought me some furniture stripper from wal mart ..
its in a white can with gold on it.. 

works extremely well..

first turn on the water hose..

then put on some rubber gloves...
then spry it on and get out your putty knife.. after spraying it on wait about 1 minute and start scrapeing with putty knife i promise it will come off like gooooo like water..

dont get it on your skin though burns like hell...
once you have gotten mosty of it scraped off then take the watrer hose and careful not to splash your self and spray it off the bus..

it will come right off,,..

what is left is fairly easy to sand down to a smooth surface,..
i am now finally to that point..

this stuff cost like 3 -5 bucks a can but i wouldnt do it without it..
i have sanded and sanded and then i bought this stuff and in minutes the pain job was washed out of the drive way into my grass...
not the best thing to do but it is my driveway and my gras whihc is still beautifully green..
just one edge has small amounts of paint chips in it now...
lol.,..
i scraped most of the stuff into the garbage can or a cardboard box and took it to the trash dump..

peace hope this helps sure did me..
saves alot of sand paper and strios with ease..
peace
