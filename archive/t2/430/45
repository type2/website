This is complete and utter BS and if the quote is correct then my opinion of
the "certain rebuilder in Sacramento" has gone way, way down.  I, too had my
heads rebuilt by that "certain rebuilder in Sacramento" and spent quite a
lot of time in the shop when I dropped off the heads, just talking to the
owner of the company.  Neither during the conversation at the drop off nor
at the time that I picked up the heads was the orthodoxy of "only one turn"
past contact ever brought up.

You may, in fact, be the problem here, with a too-lean mixture or
way-advanced timing, but if the shop is going to hide behind an unpublished
"standard" then I'd fight them all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Please let us know how this all plays out since, up to now, the opinion has
been that the "certain rebuilder in Sacramento" has been more than fair in
their treatment of their customers.
