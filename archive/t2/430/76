Heh, Marlboro box, eh?  About 2-3 days after I purchased my 1997 Pontiac
GrandAm SE from CarMax, I was replacing the underdash floor lights with new
brighter bulbs. Specifically I was replacing the one under the passenger
side dash. Inciditentally, I dropped the bulb and began searching for it. I
picked up under the seat what I THOUGHT was the lightbulb but instead ended
up being a 1/4 full vial of crack cocaine. Called the police, they told me
to just throw it out because if I brought it in, they'd arrest me. Called
CarMax, they told me to bring it in and they would have a police officer
there. Needless to say, I took a picture of it, threw it out, and brought
the car to CarMax.
 
The manager gave me a hard time saying that it wasn't crack.. and that it
was actually gun powder. I then said to him.. 
"Who goes musket rifle hunting in a Pontiac GrandAm in South Florida??"
 
The guy didn't have an answer for that. So.. I had him strip search my car,
and clean it.
 
Other than that the car has been great.. 74k miles later (112K total) the
car is still kicking! :)
 
 
As far as Bus content goes... the Bus will fortunately / unfortunately
(whichever way you prefer) ALWAYS have some relation to Woodstock. Hippie or
not, there was a LOT of pot smoking going on there... I've seen the video..
hehe.
