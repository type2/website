Thanks for the write-up.

I've been thinking about doing the bilge fan mod on my Bus as well.  A 
few comments on yours:

1. I think probably the best material for the new heater tube section 
is probably aluminum HVAC duct.  It's easy to work with, comes in the 
right size(s), is fairly inexpensive, readily available at any home 
improvement store, and is actually designed to carry hot air :-)

2. For the fan mount, the rubber couplers designed for connecting two 
pieces of iron drain pipe found in the plumbing section of your local 
hardware / home improvement store.  If you make the tolerances tight 
enough, you shouldn't have to expose very much (or any) of the rubber 
to the hot air.  The rubber couplers are nice because they're easy to 
work with, and can serve to dampen vibration.

3. I don't think all campers have belly pans (do you mean "the length 
of the Bus"?).  My '76 Westy certainly doesn't (just the pan underneath 
the pedal cluster / shifter ... don't all Busses have those?), and I 
don't see any evidence that an original pan is simply missing.
