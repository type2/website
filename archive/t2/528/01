the problem is that a 63 bus wiring system probably has very little
resemblence to the one it left the factory with, years and years of
"repairs" have probably left it a tangled mess.  

I new wiring harness is likely to drive you to drink getting it installed
right, or at all...that being said it might be the best solution, but I
wouldn't count on getting it done in any particular time
frame...intelligence is probably not really a factor, but being meticulous
is, step by step, take the Dr Tim DM to the limit and go a little beyond
and you get the idea.  

I've been upgrading mine, one wire at a time, slower but at least I know
where to look when I have a problem, put one wire in, get it working
right, then put in the next wire etc etc  very slow process but seems the
only alternative to the total transplant and ensuing complications
