 I've been told that this style wheel, with
perhaps a LT215 tire, will fit on my 70 bus.  Has
anyone tried this sort of wheel?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would not use that wheel on a bus. It is a bug wheel at 5" wide. A 215 tire is 215mm across the tread. 215mm
is over 8" wide.... not a good idea on a 5" wide wheel!
