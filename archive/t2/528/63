Subject: Lock Ring Pliers????

What are people using to remove the large snap/lock ring on VW cranks? I
have looked all over the place for lock ring pliers, split ring pliers, you
name it, can't find em. Does anyone have a source of a decent pair of proper
pliers to remove and replace the &*(^&!!!!!!!  lock ring that keeps the
timing gear and dizzy gear on? All anyone around here has are those whimpy
little snap ring pliers with pins on them.

Many thanks,

Courtney
