Subject: RE: [T2] My Brakes is broke - Cracked linings on shoes

>>Inside the drum things looked OK but the linings on both shoes are
deeply cracked. Is this normal?<<

no. replace them asap.

>>I
also need to replace one adjuster star, as I broke a couple teeth off
getting it apart. Note to self: Must get more anti-seize.<<

you can also use 'white lithium grease' which is made specifically for this
application. i'm sure anit-seize would work tho.

>>Just a few more details to attend to and everything will be peachy for
the trip to EveryBus.<<

see you there!
