185R14C, load range D. No matter what the tire salesman says, buy no tires 
that are not marked thus. Westies are inherently heavier loads and must 
have these rugged specs. I expect not more than 10% of the tire stores in 
America will have them in stock. Expect special order to get them. They are 
not going to be 4 for $99 in the weekend-four-color-loss-leader-FLAPS-ads. 
Try for Continentals as they were stock on many T-II's.
