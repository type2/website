Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt Dizzy Observation

Hello Guys    I use Advance stores for certain things but not Dizzyz or carbs 
, both of these items are rebuilt junk and a waste of time.  They do have 
good axles and can get Delco parts but you have to ask for them. I deal with 
their shop guys who are pretty good, the front counter guys are all stupid . I 
will only use their alt. and starters if they are easy to change , they come with 
a lifetime warrenty but you will spend a lifetime changing them   later and 
have fun  mark Dearing  salem Import service  salem va
