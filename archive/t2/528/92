Subject: RE: [T2] Bus tires ?

I want to buy some tires for my Westy. Any suggestions will be appreciated.
<<

heed the already posted advice of Dr. Tim & Ron.  definitely go with the D
load range for a Westy.

also, consider what type of driving you do as a factor in your choice of
tire.  if you stay on the road mainly, there is no need to spend the extra
dough on the all-terrain type of tires.  also consider, however, that the
highway type tires are usually not mud + snow rated.

the type2 library also has some good info.

good hunting,
