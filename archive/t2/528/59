Subject: Throttle Plate Opening on PDSIT 32-34 carbs

Situation:  OK, I have this '72 1.7 that I recently rebuilt the PDSIT 32-34 
carbs.  The book advice is to set the throttle plates to an opening of 0.004 
inches.

Listen, I do NOT have a micrometer, or life would be too simple to live 
with.  So I try to figure this out:  if 0.004 = 1 of something, then 0.04 = 
10 of something, and 0.4 = 100, and 4.0" = 1000, and then 1.0 " is 250 of 
something.  Thinkb&.  2.0" is 500 of something.

Bingo!!  Since I work in a paperless government contracting office, that 
means we have reams and reams of paper !!

A ream of paper has 500 sheets, and approximately measures 2" thick!!!

So, one sheet of paper is approximately 0.004" thick (well, at that measure, 
I guess I should say 'thin')

Thinking and looking, can I say the throttle plate opening is just about the 
thinness of a sheet of office paper?!?!?  No way!!!  My throttle plate 
opening is WAY biggerb&

This must be the reason that my '72 dual carb PDSIT 32 engine can idle at 
2000 RPM with the idle adjustment turned fully in.  I am running off the 
draw through from my overly open throttle plates!!

Dumb, dumb, dumb slap to the forehead.
