Subject: Rattly front end

I've been frustrated with an annoying front end rattle under my right front
wheel arch.  I was figuring that a ball joint was gone however heard that
the shock towers can go leading to a rattle as well.  While my fitted front
shocks looked like new, I picked up a set of Cofap shocks a changed them out
anyhow.  I found that the shocks themselves were in fair condition however
the lower elastometric bushing on both sets were completely shot.  There
were was a rusty old spacer on the rattling side which had the aftermarket
shock in misalignment and the elastometric bushing was pounded to death and
the steel bushing was also worn away.  The drivers side lower shock bushing
was almost as bad.  I looks like a case of mis-installation.  All I care is
that I eliminated the annoying rattle for under $70 and it drives
great...woohoo!  This is worth checking out prior to more expensive ball
joint work.  Next job, that worn and cracked steering coupling...
