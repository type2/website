Hi all,
  I am in need of one for a 1971 Type 2.  They are
listed as obsolete at the dealer and if they had one
it is $206.96 for it.
  Anybody have one they don't need or can point me in
the direction of getting one.  I checked my local
aircooled shop and dealer, and have just started the
online vendors.
Thanks for any help you can provide.
