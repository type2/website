Subject: Roof Rack assembly

Yet another project.

I would like to make a roof rack (not a plywood one)
and am looking for the pieces to attach to the rain gutters
on my 78' coolio bus.

Where might one look for such a beast?
Need to make one to hold stuff such as water jug, extra
jerry can, odds and ends.

Completed making the curtains for the van last nite.
Tiger stripe looks cool. Just need to hang them.

Links, ideas, help
all appreciated!

Thanks

James
