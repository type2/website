Well, I got my Bus back today with a freshly cleaned and relined fuel 
tank.  Runs like a dream, taking it on a trip down to San Simeon this 
weekend, yay!

In case anyone is curious, here is a picture of what was fished out of 
my tank before it was sent to the radiator shop for boiling out:

Pretty much the entire bird-beak had broken off and was floating around 
in the tank.  What are those spacers and the spring from, do you think?
