Subject: Re: [T2] door wiring

We make something for this... 

Drill ahole in your door post. Drill same hole in your door frame. End of copper tubing should almost be flush with edge of hole in door for appearance.

Put a piece of copper tubing (plumbing) into hole (should be a slight press fit) to act as a bushing. Do same in door. Maybe .25" long. Section the piece in the door (cut one side lengthwise) about half it's length. 

Insert rubber fuel line hose or PCV or heater hose into these holes protected by the copper. 

In the door where the partially sectioned piece of tubing is, insert a hose clamp and tighten causing the copper tubing to squeeze and hold the rubber tubing. Maybe a bit of expoxy glue in between the rubber and copper too. 

Now when you open the door, you have a wire guide that will protect the wires, look good, and is CHEAP.

The diameter sizing is up to you. Test build it on the bench of course. Seems like we used 1/4" or 3/8" last time to handle power windows and speaker wires. Also paint the edge of the holes in the door and door pillar so it doesn't rust. 

Enjoy!

Chris
