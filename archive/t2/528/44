Subject: pre registered puyallup swap space FS

I'm in the middle of selling my house and trying to locate another within the
short amount of time my buyer has allowed me, so it looks like i may not have
time to make it to the puyallup springmeet this year. I'd like to sell my
preregistered space for the $20 i paid for it. thats $5 cheaper than you can
get it now, and has the added benifit of being able to set up the day before
the swap, which isn't an option this year for folks that didn't preregister.
p-mail me if you're interested.
