Volk-a-maniacs,

Well, I got Annie back again from the mechanic.  No charge.  :o)

The cause, he says, was a loose wire that dropped off as I drove and touched
another wire on the voltage regulator.  The wire?  The same one that leads
to the ignition and coil.  Apparently that wire is not fused, which helped
(hurt) to propogate the singe when it touched the other wire.  Warning to
all, add a fuse to that wire!

He ended up splicing in some new wiring on all the burned areas.  That part
of the fix freaks me out a bit, since wire splicing is really the last thing
an I want done on this old bus who has endured conversion to 12v, abuse from
prior owners and more splice fixes over the years to make up for the abuse.
O'well, it works for the moment.  Someday, I will do the whole wireing
harness thing.  I've got some bigger dents to pull in the mean time.

Dispite this snafu, I am still pretty satisfied with my mechanic.  I view
this as an unfortunate result to a small mistake (not checking to make sure
all wires are secure).  After all, he fixed it with several hours of work at
no charge.  He knows I will be back if he treats me right, and I will.  A
good mechanic is hard to find.

Thank you all for the input on wiring harnesses.  Have a spectacular day.
:o)
See you in Puyallup next weekend.
