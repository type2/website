Subject: Free (as in beer) Westy cabinet in NoVa

Volks,

Next weekend we will be having a "large item disposal day" in my
subdivision.  I will be putting out a bunch of stuff but the vw-related
thing is that I have a westfalia sink/stove cabinet from a 1976-79 set
that I am going to put out.

If you want it, and can pick it up in Alexandria, VA it's yours.  It isn't
mint, NOS, but it is all there.
