mins into it during a big chase, the car hauler runs into the left rear of a 
parked Sage green 76-78 Westy. Totally destroys the Westy. "


Really, isn't that a better fate than most Sage Green 76-78 Westies fare??  
15 seconds of fame before the crusher gets its due.

But wouldn't it be awesome to have a Sage Green 76-78 Westy stripped of all 
its vitals and just the shinny shell being towed through a chase sceen at 80 
MPH and then blowing some explosive charge that would cause the Sage Green 
76-78 Westy to flip and roll over and over and over and . . .   Man, I would 
pay to see that.

[[  wait a minute...    I  have a Sage Green 76-78 Westy ! ! !  maybe I had 
better shut up...  ]]
