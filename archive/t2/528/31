I really hate to be the one to post this but someone has to.  I hope someone else saw this or ya'll will think I'm nuts.
I saw a tampax, yes tampax, commercial yesterday with the girl at the end dancing on top of a pink Westy!  It was hilarious.  Someone else please tell me you've seen it!
If not, banish me from the list.   -Chris
