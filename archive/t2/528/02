Subject: help with part id and location

Hi everyone,
I'm looking for a couple of parts. I'm having a really hard time identifying 
and locating one of them. The other I just want to make sure I get quality. 
Both are for a 79 with fuel injection.

The first is a little rubber elbow. I tried to find it in the Bently. If you 
look at page 29 in the FI section I believe it is the elbow that plugs onto 
the Auxiliary air regulator. The other end of the elbow has a hose in it 
that attaches to the rubber boot that is attached to the air intake sensor.  
Also, is there some trick to taking it off and putting a new one on. Mine 
seems to be stuck on the aux air regulator.

The other part I am looking for is exhaust gaskets.  I need the ones from 
the heater boxes to the heads (kind of oval shaped with a hole at either 
end.) and the ones from the heat exchangers to the crossover pipe (in this 
case muffler since I switched to the earlier one piece muffler to avoid 
buying a cat.) These are trapezoid shaped.  I'm tired of loosing power to 
exhaust leaks (especially at the heads) So I really want something that will 
last. Also, anyone have any experience with the mr gasket stuff or a similar 
product?

Thanks so much,
Peace,
Kyle
