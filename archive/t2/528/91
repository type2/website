I fully agree with Doktor Tim that passenger car tires are inappropriate
for a Westy - and, for that matter, so did Volkswagen, if you read the
original manual. Not only because of sidewall flex, but also because
VW's recommended rear tire inflation spec for a bus exceeds the maximum
psi rating of most passenger car tires.

However, both load range C and D meet VW specs, not just D (although D
is more common). Also "sidewall reinforced" 185R14 Conti's or Michelins
are acceptable (if they're still made), even though they may not specify
load range C or D on the sidewall.  Finally, the European 185R14 profile
is virtually identical to the American size of, I believe, 195-75R-14 (a
tire specialist could confirm this), so that is also acceptable (if
sidewall reinforced or load range C/D of course).  Do not assume that
all light truck (LT) rated tires have load range C or D capacity, as
many are rated for standard loads. Look for the load rating or "sidewall
reinforced" notation on the sidewall of the tire. 

I am using Korean made Hancook 185R14 load range D tires on my Westy,
and have used them on past Westies of mine as well. I find them to
perform and wear well at a lower price than many name brand
alternatives.
