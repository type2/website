Let's take a break and talk units here.
25W/day is not meaningful terminology.  Watts is an instantaneous measure 
of power.  Watts per day does not mean anything.  To have meaningful data 
about power usage over time you need to multiply watts by a time factor - 
something like watt-hours (watts * hours).  I noticed that some of the web 
pages earlier in this thread had charts using watt-hours-per-hour.  Duh - 
that's just WATTS... back to the instantaneous measurement.  But 
watt-hours-per-hour (or simply watts) is useful - if something draws 25 
watts at 12 volts it is drawing about 2 amps (watts/volts = amps).  Maybe 
when you guys were talking about 25W/day you meant to say that the fridge 
is drawing 25W (2 amps) average in economy mode over the course of a 
day?  That seems reasonable.  It would also be reasonable to talk about 
watt-hours per day (Watts * hours / days) but the numbers would be an order 
of magnitude or so larger (see below).

I like that, and my next fridge will be of that variety.  For reference, my 
current Norcold compressor fridge, which is 25-year-old technology draws 
7.5 amps (or nearly 100 watts).  Try keeping up with THAT with solar panels.

Argh argh argh.  If I knew what W/day was, this might mean something to 
me.  Assuming a 25 watt average draw, that is 25 * 24 = 600 watt-hours/day.

If you assume 8 hours of sunlight per day (very optimistic) you're 
correct  80 watts * 8 hours = 640 watt-hours/day.  Note correlation of 
units with previous calculation.  On average, you will need much, much more 
than that though.  Same with the battery as you don't really want to 
deep-cycle it, ever.

You can also get compressor fridges in the same form-factor that are 
"portable".

One other thing to think about regarding solar refrigeration - I have run 
into this and it's a big problem.  If you're camping with panels on your 
roof, what are the chances that you will be parking in direct 
sunlight?  Pretty slim if you're like me, unless you don't have a 
choice.  When the sun is out, you want to be parking in the SHADE so the 
inside of your bus doesn't turn into an oven.  Which makes it hard to get 
anything from your solar panels.  One solution is to have removeable panels 
and a long wire so you can park in the shade and still put the panels in 
the sun.  This is trouble, however and goes against my philosophy of 
minimizing campsite setup/breakdown (which makes camping SO much more fun).

If you truly want to be self-sufficient on solar, get the most efficient 
chest-style fridge you can and completely cover your roof with the most 
efficient panels (highest output per square inch) available.  You should be 
able to generate about 5x the power that your fridge requires doing this 
(15 amps vs. 3 amps, respectively) and if you park in the sun and have 200 
amp-hours worth of batteries on board, you could probably make it 
work.  But it's a serious engineering exercise and will take careful 
planning and lots of money.  And I will be in awe of you if you do it.
