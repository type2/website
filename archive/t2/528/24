> is there a differance between a "1600cc Bug engine" and a "1600cc Bus engine"????
 If I have a "1600cc Bug engine" what would I have do to put it in 1970 bus??

If it is an original bug case, then you will not have the 3 holes in the case below the crank pully for the
rear support bar.  There was a mickey mouse bar on the market that allowed you to use a bug engine in a bus,
but the bar used the tiny oil pump studs. NOT a good idea. I would never use one.
