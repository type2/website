Good Day List Volk:

A certain bus-pilot who is no longer amongst us asked me to forward this
to the List for it's bus content.  Any of you-all down in South Florida,
may want to go check it out, and report back as to it's veracity.  Since
the author WAS involved in St. Patrick's Day festivities - who can say?

" ...went out last night for St. Patrick's day, and came across a night
club with my friends at Fort Lauderdale Beach. The place is called
"Beach Bums". It's located just south of "Beach Place" right on the main
strip of Fort Lauderdale Beach. Anyway, inside this club, there is half
a Volkswagen beetle glued to the wall. And RIGHT next to the dance
floor, there is a Volkswagen Transporter (it's definitely a 1973). It's
a red Westfalia, and the top is up. They are using it as apart of their
DJ booth. It isn't cut or damaged or anything, but they just have DJ
equipment on the inside and the DJ booth is under a small tent
protruding from the side of the Bus (by the sliding door)."
End of forwarded message - now you know as much as I do :-)
