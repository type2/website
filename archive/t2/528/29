Hi Folks,

I had my pipe come loose in a snowstorm outside of Vegas, and it was a cold 
trip home.  Crawling underneath, I saw the pipe had rusted away.  I took the 
whole thing out and replaced it with standard 3" insulated gas vent heater pipe. 
Then I wrapped that with fiberglas pipe insulation and then with hi-temp 
duct tape.  Made a big difference.

See you on the road,
