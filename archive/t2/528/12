Andy:

Just for gigs/sh*ts - here's more data from my informant - maybe a
detailed trip report should be required for your research?  Maybe you
could slap a "Save The Bays" sticker on the bus (bus content, bus
content) while no-one is looking ;-)  You DO have a few extras on you,
don't you?

"The club is called "Beach Bums - Bar Nightclub & Beachclub"

It's located inside the building.. there's a large ante-chamber where
they have a big bar set-up, but the Bus is in the rear larger room.. the
front of it actually protrudes into the middle of the dance floor. The
VW Beetle that's "glued" to the wall is directly to your left (you make
a 180 as soon as you enter the room to the left of the door).

There's actually a small Cesna plane that's attached to the wall far off
to the right as well.

It's pretty cool, they use the Bus as a part of the DJ booth.

The nightclub is located RIGHT ON THE BEACH of Fort Lauderdale. Lets
see.. it's between the "Elbo Room" and "Beach Place".  (about a 100
meter stretch).

These nightclubs change names, and owners very frequently. I expect
it'll stay like this through the remainder of the season, but I wouldn't
be bit surprised if they change the entire thing again by the end of the
summer.

Last year it was called the Bermuda Triangle, and the year before that,
it was called Blondies. They actually showed something on the Travel
channel last night a 2004 show release. They said that "Blondies" was
one of the hottest nightclubs on Fort Lauderdale beach during Spring
Break. And I thought to myself... that club hasn't been called Blondies
in 2 years!"

 Let us know what you find out, m'kay?  Inquiring minds wanna know!
