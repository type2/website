Subject: Erraticaly loss of power

Hello Volks

Today I need your help with a very strange behavior of my '77 westy 1600 DP
engine, I was driving home on a road that is a long uphill, the first part
of the road is almost flat, then star to be more step, at the beginning I
can drive at 63 mph in fourth gear,at the end the speed is reduce to about
45 mph still in fourth gear and reaching the summit I have to change to
third gear to get about 38 mpg. The whole trip is about 32 miles long and
the last 3 miles are the stepped ones, so this morning when I got the last 3
mile the engine started to loss power, kinda stall, I could hear a few
backfires, I pull out to the road and check at the engine bay, everything
was O.K. and the engine idle fine. I tried to resume my trip but the engine
still with problems I made my way to reach the top of the road (less than a
mile) and check the engine again and everything looks O.K. so I resume my
trip again but from here it was flat all the road another 8 miles whit out
any problems.
I was wondering that could be a fuel starving or maybe an electrical problem
(points, condenser, coil) I am guessing.
If any of you guys have any clue that can lead me to solve my problem please
let me know, perhaps the bus is running fine I would like to solve the
problem to have a more reliable bus

Thanks

Roberto
