Subject: PDSIT-2 Rebuild.

       Hello All.

I have a 73 Westy with stock dual carbs which I am rebuilding. Upon
installation of the kit I see the diagram sheet shows only one o-ring for
the Thermo cut-off valve.( The rectangle electric valve on the L/H carb
only) There appears to be an inlet which has an o-ring and another
port(although this hole has a flat surface with no space for an o-ring).
Could someone in the know explain to me a) what this valve does and b) if
there is supposed to be another o-ring or seal for this second port?


Thanks
Phil
