Looks like mine is going to be needing to be replaced.

Anyone in Alberta / Saskatchewan who would like a friend forever
who would be willing to teach a newbie to tear a 1700 fi down?

Is this something I could do with all the books I have?

Im almost considering selling it before it busts and cutting my losses.
