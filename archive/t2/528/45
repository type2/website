I have to disagree a little here Karl.
It does mount to the oil pump studs but also bolts through a lower case
bolt.
Given a choice of using a good bug motor with the bracket or spending over
1K for a new motor I would use the bracket.
Yes a bus motor is better. But the brackets work. Ive seen them in action
and have not actually seen one fail.
