Hi Leon,

Does it make more or less noise when the clutch is in? Does the 
vibration/noise stop when you put a hand on the shifter?

I had a front shifter linkage bushing drop out on my bus, and it 
sounded pretty  nasty. If your wheels aren't sloppy you might want to 
look at the shifter. Another possible culprit could be the brakes.. you 
might have a pad or shoe dragging.

Happy trails,
