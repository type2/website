James, where are you?  I am in Calgary and about to start the rebuild of 
my 2.0l FI.  I have rebuilt a couple of engines before but not a VW. 
It's just a step by step process following instructions in one of the 
good books.  If you are nearby we could swap some tips.  I have a line 
on a good machine shop here to check out my cam, crank, case, rods, 
clean everything up, and rebuild the heads.
