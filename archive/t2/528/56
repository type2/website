Ahhh, Andy,

Just one of those things...I was just talking to a guy last night
at the local VW club meeting that was talking about having one of 
those on his 71 bus...*now* a 71 bus with a bad engine as it "loosened"
up the oil pump and dumped all the oil on the ground before he could get 
it shut off....he now has a nice lump of metal instead of an engine.

As Karl says...probably *not* a good idea...but useable nonetheless, 
until the oil gets dumped..

As always YMMV!

Cheers, dave
