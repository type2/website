The original style nuts are self-locking copper-plated steel and are small
across the flats, 12mm instead of 13mm. They are available from CIP and lots
of other sources. They are commonly referred to as "copper exhaust nuts". I
use hardened un-plated steel washers under the nuts. Anti-sieze is a good
idea if you use high-temperature copper type. Make sure it is the copper
type and check the temperature rating. The anti-sieze from Wurth is rated to
1200 degrees, there is one made by permatex and probably others as well.
