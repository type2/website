Subject: Pilot bearing removal and install

Greetings,

'79 2.0L FI Westy

I am trying not to buy a pilot bearing puller. Any way to get the bearing 
out of there with out one?

Or would this (Autozone loan-a-tool) work?

I looked at the puller from Harbor Freight ($16) but it looked too big to 
fit. Has any one used this puller? Did it work?

To install the new bearing just lube with multi grease and tap in with a 
same size socket right?

Thanks,
Brandt
