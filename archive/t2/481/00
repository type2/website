Subject: transmission changing procedure

Hey Jeff,
You need to get a 17 mm allen wrench
also sold as a transmission wrench,=20
get under the left side of the bus by the trans
the plug on the left of the fill, there is another
on the tail end of the trans, that is the drain.
Mine has a 3 inch magnet on the inside to
collect metal shavings, it works pretty well.
Mine looked like a spiky pipe cleaner when I took
it out.  I suppose you could jack up the front
to get it all out.
There is probably 2 or 3 quarts of oil in it.
You have to get 90 weight transmission oil=20
get a couple of quarts and a funnel and a hose=20
Fill to the brim till it starts to leak out the top,=20
that is the fill line.  I don't think it needs a seal,
but you could use teflon tape maybe.
I have to top mine off cause it leaks.
