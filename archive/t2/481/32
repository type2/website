Subject: Rear-end Howling and Growling resolved....(whew!)

Well, I finally got the correct CV axles from the Flaps.  After I 
removed my one original axle, and the incorrect axle, I thought to give 
my wheels the "wiggle" test once again.  Right side was OK (wiggled just 
a tiny bit...seemed normal), left side was pretty wacked.  After reading 
one of Steve Dolan's postings in the archive, I thought I'd see if the 
axle nut was loose....I'll be damned if that nut wasn't so loose I could 
have unscrewed it with my hand (if the cotter pin weren't there).

How did I not notice this before?  They didn't wiggle in the least last 
time I tried the "wiggle" test.  :-\  I think I didn't test for the 
loose nut the first time around...who knows/cares...at least I found it.

Well, in any case, I tighted up that axle nut, installed my new CV 
axles, checked the transmission level (it was good), and took a little 
test drive.  All noises are now back to normal.  :)  No more fat-girl 
with corduroy trousers, no more groaning rear-end, and I'm extremely 
relieved that this didn't require something pricy like a new transmission.

Thanks to all for the excellent suggestions!  This is a great list!

Enjoy,
