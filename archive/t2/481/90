Subject: Re: [T2] winter warning

my 78 bus has always been a little hard to start on cold mornings
gave it a short shot of ether and cranked er and got a funny sounding
backfire....knowing that I blew a hose I just went back to put em back on.

opened the engine and noticed I had a small fire, in the air intake.  just
blew it out and inspected. seems the backfire caught the paper in the air
filter on fire?!?  in any case cleaned it out, fixed the hoses and she
started right up and ran fine.

but had I not gone right back to the engine who knows what might have
happened, also helped I guess that the engine was pretty clean.

just a warning.
