Yes, excellent choice.

Put a staight edge on it, shine a light behind the straight edge.  See a
lot of light? Machine the flywheel.  Run a fingernail across the contact
surface.  Does it catch severely? Machine the flywheel.  This is a
judgement call as the clutch disk will wear in to some imperfections but
that "wearing in" is robbing you of clutch life-span.

Yes, with the engine out you can just drive the old bushing out with a
punch.

Oil is good.  Also apply grease to the starter shaft when installing it..

                             OOK!
