Any FLAPS should sell a pump that fits on a bottle of gear oil that can 
be used to pump the oil into the transmissions.  They look vaguely like 
the pump on a bottle of hand lotion or Fast-orange hand cleaner, but 
with a long plastic tube on the output end.

Regarding a seal, I don't think they have one... just a drain-plug type 
of thing, I think (note, I say this without having yet taken mine out 
to check/replace the gear oil, and my Bentley is out in the Bus right 
now, so I can't double-check).

Make sure you open the fill plug before you open the drain plug!  
Otherwise, you'll be really sorry if you can't get the fill plug out 
after you've drained all the oil.

Regarding what kind of oil to replace it with, I've heard a lot of good 
things about Red Line MT-90 synthetic, and am planning on using it when 
I replace the oil in my transmission.
