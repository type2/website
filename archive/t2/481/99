Subject: Which years had O2 sensors?

Folks...

I'm trying to identify what year an instrument cluster I picked up at a 
junkyard is from (I picked it up because it has absolutely pristine 
gauges).  It has an O2 sensor warning light instead, and I can't 
remember which years had that.  Anybody know?

Thanks!
