Subject: proper 74 fuel lines?

I am endeavouring to replace all the fuel lines on my new-to-me 74 Westy
as one of thse winter projects. Can someone confirm what the fuel line
under the bus, in front of the firewall should be? (i.e. steel, or fuel
hose?) 

My previous 71 had mostly fuel hose, and steel line where it passed
through the firewall. This 74 seems to have mostly fuel hose, even when
passing through the firewall, which can't be right. A friend's 79 has
mostly steel tubing with short fuel hose connecting pieces underneath. 

Steel line or hose? Combo? Thoughts are much appreciated. 

Thanks
