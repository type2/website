Subject: re: Changing transmission oil.

Hi Jeff,

It's definitely easier to change the gear oil with the engine out so that
you have access from the engine bay but it is also possible to crawl under
and do it if the engine is in in. Various posts in the archives recommend
85W90
Sta-Lube GL4 from NAPA (Sta-Lube also has a pump, also available from NAPA). I
used this the last time and it is shifting noticably more smoothly.

Permatex thread sealant (not thread locker) is good here. It is made for
tapered threads.

| Hi All:
|
| My last question regarding the damm transmission (had a frustrating
| evening getting selector shaft out). Anyone know of a good
| article/procedure on changing the transmission oil while the
| transmission is still in the van? It would seem that I need some type of
| pump to fill the transmission up. What does the community use? And what
| type of seal is on the drain/fill plugs? Nothing is listed on my ETKA.
