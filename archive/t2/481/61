Subject: RE: [T2] transaxle removal/installation

Not sure what year you have, but you definately don't have to remove the
brake drums or the cv halfshafts to drop the tranny on a T4 engine. Just
unbolt the cv's on the tranny end and tie them up out of the way with
bailing wire or zip ties.

As for the clutch, replace the bearings while it's out (ESPECIALLY the pilot
bearing). The other parts are a judgement call.

i'm in the process of replacing my transaxle and  i read that i have to
remove the rear brake drums. This doesen't seem necessary if I'm only
disconnecting the axles at the transmission end . Any advice.?

Also I'm trying to decide whether to replace the clutch. It has low mileage
