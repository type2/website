"The Hall control unit, checking" section of Bentley is very long - 2
pages - and not entirely logical.  Bypass the idle control stabilizer just
to make sure it's not affecting things.

It's the Hall sender and Hall control unit that "trigger" the coil so if you
think you're getting spark from the distributor center wire - pull the
center wire from the distributor, put the end near the engine, have someone
crank the engine - but no spark to the plugs (same test, except you pull a
plug wire) then it would seem to be the rotor or ignition wires.
