When I recently replaced my exhaust earlier this year I used zinc
metric from Home Depot as I couldn't find anything else.

I ran the van until the coating burned off the pipes and repainted
with high heat paint to help keep the corrosion down.

I have no clue as to a temperature rating on the bolts I used but
haven't seen any problems so far.

Should I replace them????  ....before things get too far???
