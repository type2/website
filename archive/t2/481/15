Craig,

Andy had it right.  It's the peashooters.  They are lined with this 
sort of metal "waffle" material which apparently serves as a sound 
deadening measure, but which actually just alters the exhaust sound 
into a fweem.

I had some of these aftermarket straight pipes on there for "that 
deep,throaty sound" (I have a bug muffler), but they practically rusted 
overnight, so I put the peashooters back on.  I've been contemplating 
putting on two bus damper/tail pipes in order to divert the exhaust out 
into the slipstream.
