Subject: transaxle removal/installation

Hello,
 
i'm in the process of replacing my transaxle and  i read that i have to remove the rear brake drums. This doesen't seem necessary if I'm only disconnecting the axles at the transmission end . Any advice.?
 
Also I'm trying to decide whether to replace the clutch. It has low mileage and the pressure plate is only 1/16" out of square with the engine. Both hovering arond 1".
 
I don't mind the engine removal too much and could stand holding on to the $100 clitch kit cost for a while.
