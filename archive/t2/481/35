Subject: Re: [T2] ECU :What is the Difference?

I went throught this with a local rebuilder- - he claimed the earlier
AFM in a higher capacity engine will draw more air (flap open more) and
the ECU will give the right increased amount of gas for this.  I also
intuitively differered,  seeing the AFM as a mechanical vacuum drawn
variable potentiometer that must be different at full throttle for the
75 vs 78, as the 78 will be drawing more MAX air.....Then again, can't
one just move the spring control screw to adjust this inherent leaness? 
BTW, does it get leaner or richer if you tighten this screw?  I'd guess
that looser is richert, as our tired 244,000mi all original components
engine looks to be a tad rich based on exhaust pipe sooty coating.  In
our case, he rebuilt a stock 75 in daughter's bus to stock specs, but
wanted to put a 78 FI harness/AFM/ECU in as the 75 has inherent
weaknesses (the control on the throttle housing, lack of air temp
sensor).  -Now if you are right, would such a switch make the 75 run
RICH?

on a 2L but other than that any complete system will work.
