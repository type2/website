Subject: Re: [T2] Pilot bearing removal and install

I use a screw type dent puller slide hammer.  I drill some holes into the
flat surface of the seal (there is metal behind the rubber) then screw the
dent puller into the seal.  It usually takes a number of holes before I get
the seal out, the screw pulls through the metal.  Doing this doesn't damage
the housing or the shaft and you don't need to take the bell housing off.  I
like to replace that seal whenever I replace a throw out bearing.

I would think you could just put a sheet metal screw in the holes and pull
with vise grips, may not be as easy, but it should work.
