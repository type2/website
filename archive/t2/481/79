Hmm -- I think I screwed up that request with too much info. Ask any of the
Buskatiers, I don't write often, but when I do it's usually too much
<grin>.

I'm not really looking for an assembly manual. And I don't need the latest
supercession part numbers. Hopefully if I start loking for a part that has
been superceeded the vendors will have the latest part number.

I am NOT restoring this bus to factory original. Having been a marine
electrician for 10 years I don't much like the way the wiring harness is
set up so that's all going away and will be beefed up, fuses replaced with
breakers, etc. H4 headlights, replacing external marker/turn/brake lights
with sealed LED units. Paint nowhere near original. Custom, hopefully
removeable/changeable, passenger/work/camper interior.

I'm looking for just a list of part numbers/descriptions. Is the text
section of the EKTA REGULAR text, or "pictures" of text pages? If it's
plain text I should be able to rip out the parts I need to at least get a
good start on my own database.

When I'm done with the bus I intend to have a "parts manual" unique to my
bus so that when I need to replace something I can look up the part number
and email it to Ronnie or go punch it into the Bus-Boys web page.

For now I need a list of part numbers for doing things like R&R of the
front beam and other driveline items under the bus. Need part numbers for
ALL rubber items on the bus because EVERY seal is being replaced.

A list of secrew/bolt/nut sizes used would be nice, but that's pushing it.

Any items that were '74 unique I probably won't need. I don't need anything
directly engine related at this time -- There's a Raby engine sitting in a
crate waiting for me to finish the rest of the work. Engine before body is
a multi-page story that would get me moderated for "chatty".

Like I said, I'm trying to get a parts list together so I can  prioritize.
My work schedule is REALLY odd and I'm working with no garage to work in. I
tow the bus to work with me and do a little on it if work is slow. Then I
tow it back to a 10x20 storage unit when I'm off. No room to work in the
storage unit and really no place to work on it at home (yet).

I set a "list" of what to do next. I haven't done anything in months
because I decided that I need to get the engine/tranny out before I do any
more on the body. When I have had time to pull the engine I haven't had
anyone available to help me lift it into my truck for transfer to storage
-- when someone's available, I don't have time...

OK -- I'll stop, I'm doing it again.
