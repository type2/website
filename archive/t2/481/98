Subject: Cooling Tin Grommets & Alt. Elbow

Greetings,

Again '79 2.0L FI

Today I was taking my alternator off from the fan housing (not attached to 
engine) and failed to undo the clamp that holds the elbow boot to the alt. 
The dried, hard, crusty elbow is now almost in two peices (torn by the 
clamp). May have been like that before or could have been my forgetfulness, 
probably both.

Does anyone know where to get a new rubber alt. elbow? This is the elbow 
between the alt. and the fan housing. Bus-boys say NLA with part# 
021-903-655B.  However, I googled 022-903-655 and found one (Automobile 
Atlanta) for a 914 but $30! and a few pages in German. Or can I glue this 
one back together?

Now to get to the subject...

Does anyone know or have a list of all the rubber grommets in the cooling 
tin and engine area? A list with part #'s and descriptions would be great. I 
know this is a long shot.

I am missing my oil filler tube grommet I think part # 021-119-953  Bus-boys 
say NLA, BD no find. Anyone know whats up with this part or perhaps used an 
electrical wire grommet in its place? Or is there somthing I'm no so 
educated on here? (Likely)

I've also found these pages which are quite helpful.  VWhelp.com

Thanks,
Brandt
