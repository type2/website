Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel cleaning & starter bushing

If the flywheel has no "burn" spots (blue/purple heat discolorations) and
has no significant grooves in the working surface (i.e., if you run a
fingernail along the surface you don't "catch" the nail) then it's probably
OK.  I'd just clean it up with some paint thinner or kerosene and a rag,
allowing everything to dry thoroughly before reassembly.  If you've got the
engine out then replacing the starter bushing is easy enough, just along the
lines you've proposed.
