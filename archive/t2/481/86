Doyt W. Echelberger was heard babbling something about [T2] Starting problems-76 2 liter:

Check to make sure all ground straps are tight/clean (battery to frame and
tranny to frame).

Next, look for the problem *I* had that drove me nuts for a few days.

Make sure the positive connection from the battery to the STARTER is clean
and tight. 

Mine was loose at the starter. I'd be driving down the road and
little electrical things would start going wrong. Alternator light on.
Headlights dimming. Engine sputtering. Even sudden, complete, shutdown if I
hit a bump -- started right back up if I hit another while caosting to he
side of the road.
