Have you pulled a spark plug wire while cranking to see that you are, in
fact, getting a spark?  Also, it doesn't hurt to double check that the
distributor drive gear is, in fact, correctly installed.

Having just gone through a similar problem with my recently-installed engine
in the Westfalia I'd say it's not completely obvious by looking at the plugs
whether you're getting gas.  I pulled a plug after the "crank/no start"
event and it was *not* obviously wet with gas.  Just to make doubly sure gas
*wasn't* my problem I installed a fuel pressure gauge on the fuel ring to
ensure I was getting gas to the engine.

The red and blue/brown wire both run over the the fuel pump relay.
