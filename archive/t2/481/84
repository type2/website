Subject: How do you check a hall sender unit? - was Cant get a spark?

Still can't get a spark, but I have isolated the the
problem a little more.  Getting 12V to the coil, if i
hook up a dwell meter to the spark plug wire from the
coil (don't have a timing light right now) it jumps
around so i think the dist. cap is getting spark, but
there is NOT anything coming from the dist. to the
spark plug wires.  I have an 83 Cal model with an
electronic ignition.  Wondering if my hall sender is
bad and how i can check it, or what else i might check
as being the problem.  Thanks
