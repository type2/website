Hello,
 I just got my SVDA in from Aircooled.Net and need to know what do I set the
timing at? I forgot to order the dang O ring! So, when I get that I'll be
ready to put it in. Does anyone have any tips for me? Thanks. By the way,
The service was very quick and I got a discount for being a list member.
Thanks Aircooled!

Dan
