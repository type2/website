Subject: Shop tip: license plate mounts and scalp cuts

Does everyone know that working under the rear hatch of a volkswagen bus
can cause very painful lacerations to the scalp?  Does everyone know that
by placing a couple of vacuum caps over the bolts or screws that retain
the license plate holder you can reduce the bleeding to embarrasment and
bruising? It still hurts but you will not bleed quite as much for your
bus.

                             OOK!
