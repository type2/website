Subject: Vanagon seatbelts in a late bay window

Hey folks...

Today was a good day at the parts yards, and one of the treasures I 
managed to score a set of nice Vanagon seat belts for about 30 bucks 
(if anyone in the SFBA is looking for a set, contact me privately and 
I'll point out a yard that has at least 3 more Vanagons with the belts 
still installed).

These are the later Vanagon [square headlight] belts; they're a little 
nicer than early Vanagon belts, but both types appeared to be 100% 
compatible in terms of bolting up to the car.

They do, however, mount up differently than bay window seat belts.  I 
don't think retrofitting them is going to be too hard, but I'm 
interested to hear experiences, tips, and tricks from anyone else who 
has done this before.  I'm going to be installing them into a '76 
Westy.

Thanks!
