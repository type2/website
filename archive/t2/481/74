I thought it was peculiar that the nut had come loose as well (has me 
worried that I've got other nuts coming loose elsewhere).  That cotter 
pin probably had a lot to do with keeping the nut in place...never will 
I be running around without those things installed.

As for the bearing going bad...I'll keep an eye on it, and check these 
axle nuts from time to time.  Hopefully I won't have to tear into that 
PITA for a while.

Enjoy,

Jonathan
