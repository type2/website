Subject: Parts list for a '74??

Definition of "excersize in futility":

a) Searching list archives for anything containg the word "list"
b) Searching for messages about parts lists without using the word "list".

Does anyone know of a COMPLETE part number list for a '74 -- 7 passenger?
Something in electronic form would be nice so I could flatfile it in Excel
for sorting and searching.

I want EVERY part number (with as much description as possible) used on my
bus.

It's currently in this shape: http://www.phorce1.com/bustemp. I'm slowly
taking it apart all the way to the point that it's a box on hefty
sawhorses. I'll be de-rusting and welding (having welding done actually) as
I go. 

I'd like the parts list so I can build a database of what I need to put it
back together and prioritize the purchase order to match the reconstruction
and my wallet.

It will also be a good "bonehead" guide to go with my Bently -- you know
"Hey, the list says there should be a 211-826-xxxxA bushing in here
somewhere but I don't recall buying one".

Thanks
