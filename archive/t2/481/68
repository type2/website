Wil,
Any automotive fastener supply house can get you what ever you
want--such as Kar Products.
Ace is the place even has metric hardware available--Bins of the stuff
!!
Sears hardware does too--

Search around a bit--

Nothing you used is a "problem" as long as it's working --but just think
down the road a piece--if you can't get them off--then that's a
problem--

When I recently replaced my exhaust earlier this year I used zinc metric
from Home Depot as I couldn't find anything else. 
I ran the van until the coating burned off the pipes and repainted with
high heat paint to help keep the corrosion down. 
I have no clue as to a temperature rating on the bolts I used but
haven't seen any problems so far. 
Should I replace them???? ....before things get too far??? 
Sincerely,
