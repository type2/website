Hello Guys    This isn't always true   You can not see the run out of a 
flywheel by looking or feeling it. Take it to a machine shop and have it ground on 
a flywheel grinder.  I have a peterson flywheel grinder that will show you the 
run out very quickly. I am amazed at how out of  true  flywheels get. Same 
thing goes for drums and rotors.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
