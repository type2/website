Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Nuts

One additional thing to consider with regard to the nut material for 
exhaust:If you use the copper nuts, and they get rounded or just plain 
stuck, they are by far the easiest to get off using a chisel. Never 
underestimate the power of a chisel when removing frozen on nuts; Just 
split the nut on one side or both and your home free. With a little 
practice and a good chisel, you'll be getting even much larger, steel 
nuts off fast.
The copper nuts are like butter with a chisel. Just my $.02
