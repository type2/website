Subject: Broken Key in Sliding Door Lock

Hello All --
Thanks to the onset of colder weather, my now-sticky front door locks
finally took their eventual toll on my key and in its weakened state it
broke off in the lock of my sliding door.  I tried to get it out of there
with a small set of tweezers, but only managed to push it farther in there.
Can anyone give me some advice on how to get the broken key outta there?  Is
it possible to remove the movable face of the lock (where the key slot is)
so as to get into the lock from the front and/or is it feasible to go at it
from the back (via removing the whole assembly)?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks!
