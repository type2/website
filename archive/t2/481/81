Hello Guys    This is very true. The copper nuts will bring the stud with it 
when removing. Yes they are easier to cut off , but you shouldn't have too cut 
them off . The stainless nuts will come off better. On a type 1 motor it 
really isn't an issue , on a type 2/4 motor with the studs up in a hole it could 
be very bad.  On the issue of cutting the nuts off be careful if you cut 
parrell to the stud you will bend or worse break the stud. cutting perpendicular to 
the stud will be better.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
