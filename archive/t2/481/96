Mike-

A quick word of thanks for you superb tutorial on type2.com.  Without your 
excellent description and pictures, I am sure I would have eventually just 
junked my bus.  As it was, it took me a good 45 minutes to "find" the small 
spring release hole.  I really appreciate you taking the time to help the 
rest of us out!
