Still a bit of mysterious oil leak on the engine...

If the flaps and stat are missing, what about the pulley the thermostat
cable runs in....that 6mm collar bolt that holds it on is drilled
directly into the interior of the case...if it's not there, you'll have
a leak for sure...

Watching the -20 outdoor hockey game in Edmonton tonight, I'm hoping
these guys have a good heating system...-30 to -40 is not uncommon on
the Prairies in November/December...not uncommon in the Dakotas
either...so it could be chilly either way..

Den
In Toronto Canada..would enjoy meeting the guys from the Swiss part of
the world...I think the Bug pack in the Toronto area could show them
some hospitality when they get here too...
