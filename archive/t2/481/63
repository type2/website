Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Nuts

Copper nuts are the hot set up for this situation--no doubt--

However, given the placement of them--and if any exhaust work ever will
be done on the Bus--laying on your back groaping to get to them--and you
screw up and use a 12 point socket, or slip off them with a open end,
easily rounding off the corner's of the copper nuts----the removal
process becomes a project--

I use stainless on all of my VW's--and copius amounts of the high temp
Permatex--no sweat--
 

<Gene Berg sells self-locking copper nuts that are 13mm (vice 12mm)
outside; These are easier to remove in most cases since you can get a
larger wrench on them. Anti-seize like the other folks said>.
