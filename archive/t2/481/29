Subject: Poor Power When Cold

Wondering if anybody on the list has encountered this and perhaps has some
suggestions where to look - Since it has cooled off I have noticed a bit of
a strange power loss when the engine is cold- not a real hesitation but a
feeling that your not getting the response from the accelerator pedal you
expect- think someone is holding your bumper as you accelerate - lasts only
briefly , maybe a couple minutes and then feels fine again - good accel and
power no hesitation everything is fine - anybody with any ideas - perhaps it
is the result of not warming up the bus
