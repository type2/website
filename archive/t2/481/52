Stainless steel if you can get it is great.  Silicon bronze is also
excellent.  If you are in the United States and can obtain either of these
in metric thread (check boating stores) then use them.  NEVER use brass or
zink! Both would corrode in minutes.

I use anti-sieze on everything but I think it is symbolic in exhaust work.

                             OOK!
