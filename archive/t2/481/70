Hi Warren,

A 1600SP engine is pretty reliable and simple, but is not very powerful.  
You may be able to pull 65-70 downhill on a cool day, but if you try to run 
that fast in the summer your engine will eventually overheat.  The bus is 
unique in that it's a 3000-3500 lb vehicle being pushed by the same engine 
as your old 1966 Beetle.  In addition, the bus is much less aerodynamic.  
This adds up to a much larger load on the engine, which will generate more 
heat.  Consequently, if the engine is breathing 95-degree summer heat, it 
cannot cool itself as effectively and will shorten your engine's life.

If you're looking at a 1968 Camper, chances are the engine has been rebuilt 
once (depending, of course, on mileage).  If the engine is original, plan 
for a rebuild ($500-$3000) sometime within the next year.  If you're 
rebuilding, consider increasing the displacement of your engine to 1776cc or 
larger.  The bigger displacement will make more power which will allow you 
to run a higher top speed.  As always, your mileage may vary (YMMV).

If I remember correctly (IIRC), the straight-up poptop is from Riviera.  If 
it has a fiberglass luggage rack in front above the driver's cab area, it 
probably is.
