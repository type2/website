<Stainless steel?-

Absolutley--if you can locate them-

<Anti seize--?--another great idea, with any future removal plans in
mind--the copper stuff with a high temp rating--

Remember this though--all this will eventually wash out.
Nothing is perfect, especially where the nuts are located--and the heat
they are subject to.

The stainless nuts will give you the advantage next time you have to
remove them--

Later,
