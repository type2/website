Subject: RE: [T2] Removing/reinstalling pilot shaft trans seal

I just ordered the bell housing gasket (cheap) and removed the housing.
Really easy and not frustrating like buying/using a puller on that
particular seal. Also an opportunity to inspect and clean the insides.

Hi All:

Anyone have any tips for removing the input pilot shaft seal on the
transmission while the shaft and the bellhousing are installed?
