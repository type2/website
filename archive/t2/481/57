Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Nuts

Gene Berg sells self-locking copper nuts that are 13mm (vice 12mm) outside;
These are easier to remove in most cases since you can get a larger wrench
on them. Anti-seize like the other folks said...

Greetings again,

What is the latest thinking on the best exhaust nut composition? Brass?
Stainless Steel? Zink? Or anti-seize?
