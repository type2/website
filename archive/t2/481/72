The bigger displacement [can] will make more power, which generates more
heat.  Also, the additional power won't help the top speed, thought it
might help you reach the top speed faster.  (top speed in a 68 and 69 is
governed more by the gear ratios.  4000rpm in 4th is 68.57 mph with stock
size tires.)

I haven't read the original post, but only this reply.  If you're looking
to gain a higher top speed, you need to look at many factors including,
but not limited to:

Brakes
Engine/oil cooling
Engine power output
Gearing
