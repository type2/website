When I had my Mercedes diesel I used Rotella T and Wal-Mart was about the
only place I could find it!  Guess availability depends on location :-)

Comes in gallon jugs which is about half a quart more than you need for a
Bus (Type 4), but the Wal-Mart I bought it at also had it in quart bottles.
This was in northern Virginia.

For every oil change in my Mercedes I had to buy 2 gallon jugs because it
really did take 8 quarts.

I've started using Mobil 1 15W-40 synthetic in my Bus now, good stuff.  Will
switch the Passat over to that (different viscosity of course) as well on
the next oil change, now that it's broken in.

Trivia:  Did you know that the '79 Bus owner's manual calls for oil changes
every 7500 miles and only changing the filter every 15,000 miles?
