hey all,

first off let me just say thank you very much to all
who have helped me soo far. it is much appreciated!

now, what grade of oil should i be running in a 76 FI
2.0? i currently run HD SAE 30 non-synthetic (cash
issues). it seems to work ok. i also add STP oil
treatment every now and again, i figure it cant hurt,
please let me know if it can.

with the onset of cold weather, i have been letting
the engine warm up for about five to ten minutes
before i drive it. it seems to enjoy this, however i
have heard varied opinions on this. is it bad to let
your engine warm? 

last but not least, on a recent trip to vermont i was
forced to pull over and rip the wires out of the horn,
as it was going off on its own in very sporadic
intervals. at first it was somewhat humourus, then, it
got old. any ideas as to why this would happen. my
dome light up front also likes to flicker occasionally
as i drive, any ideas? thanks a lot. -matty
