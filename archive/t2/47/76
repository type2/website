Subject: Oil splatter on back windshield!

I have had a problem with oil splatter all over the backside of my 74 Westy
(type 4 engine, 1.8L) ever since I bought it.  A local mechanic told me that
I lost my seal on my dipstick and it was leaking out that hole and the fan
was spraying it everywhere.  Well, I found a tiny o-ring that fit the
diameter of the dipstick and that didn't solve the problem.  Another
mechanic's response was, "VeeDub's don't leak oil... they just leave their
mark." Cute response, but not very helpful.

I have noticed oil collecting at the motor mount screw heads, once I park
it... Should I buy a oil seal kit and get to work?  Or is there a simpler
solution?

Did I say backside?
