The German manufacturer has discontinued the cap in both the locking and
non-locking versions, leaving VW (at the incredible bargain price of about
$50) as the only supplier.

But there's good news.  I obtained the last of the locking ones from the
German manufacturer and stocked up, so I still have some at an affordable
price. They are $15.95, in chrome - part number 211 201 551R, on the website
or order toll-free . Once they're gone, I will not get more.  (Sorry, no
more non-locking ones.)

I also got a handful that were missing the keys. From a quick look I'd guess
that you could, without too much difficulty, disassemble/disable the lock
mechanism, thereby turning it into a "nonlocking" one.  I'd sell these for
half price. I'll even sell you three of them for the price of one ($15.95)
if you want to keep a spare or two for later. New, but not returnable at
this price. Email me if you want these, as I will not put them on the
website, and nobody at the shop will believe you that I quoted this price.
