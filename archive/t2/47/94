Sorry about the two comments about Rotella's availability. In Fayetteville,
which admittedly ain't the center of the universe, there is no Rotella at
Wal-Mart. There are no quarts of Rotella in town--Napa doesn't have quarts,
AutoZone doesn't have quarts, the truck stops don't have quarts, Advance
doesn't have Rotella. Sam's has Rotella, but only in cases (6 gallons) or
drums (55). And the stores where I'd seen Rotella before moving here catered
to people who drive Peterbilts, and to those guys a quart of oil is nothing.
(My brother drives a Freightliner with a Cummins 350-hp inline 6 in it, and
he says his dipstick says "Add one gallon.")

But it does make perfect sense to sell it in quarts. Lots of diesel Mercedes
and pickups out there.

Thing I can't figure out: Why don't they sell ATF in pints? You don't add it
by the quart, you add it by the pint but it comes by the quart.
