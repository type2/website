Had the same problem with my horn and the dome light.  The horn problem was 
fixed by taking off the steering wheel and cleaning out the wire and contacts 
within.  I also checked for shorts and broken insulation thoughout the 
circuit.  The dome light was fixed by tightening the connections on the back 
of my sliding door switch and on the driver's door switch.  Both problems 
took less than an hour to fix together.
