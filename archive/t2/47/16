Woke up this morning to find that someone "needed" my tail light lenses more 
than I did.  What can you do?  Looking around I haven't beed able to find 
anyone with them in stock.  I kind of need them badly and would be willing to 
pay for overnight shipping. As I am about to depart on a road trip.
