Powdercoat- comes in colors ( inc. Hi-Temp) , clears, glitters, etc.
How about Purple with Blue Glitter ? ( don't laugh, I just did one :).
OK, Krylon is $ 1, Rustoleum is $ 5, PPG is $ 90, and powder is more.
Hard to explain to the guy who wants an estimate for a paint job when
his basis for comparison is a case of Krylon at a buck per can and he
is just trying to decide if it should be brush or roller....

>(not case,heads,or cylinders).
Why not ? type 4 fan housing could use it, and case and heads can be coated.
A thin coating of black may have heat releasing characteristics above those of
bare metal. Then again, so might silver. either way, it sure looks good.
forget about the really hot parts ( exhaust manifold at the heads ).
Barbeque Black Rustoleum works for a while, and Eastwood has a few products...
and wood stove supply shops have a good product that works.
But those spray cans of muffler paint rated 1500 degrees don't hold up .
