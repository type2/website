Dave,

*everyone* has an opinion on oil! :-)

I run Castrol 20W-50 year 'round here in Virginia.  Max summer temps are
~100, min winter temps ~10.  On a frosty morning, I see initial oil
pressures near 70psi, which is a bit scary, but they fall to reasonable
within a minute or two as the engine warms, so I just let it sit and warm
'til the oil pressure drops.
