Subject: [T2] Battery recommendation & engine start  - help needed!

Hi guys!

I acquired a '73 bus recently and I'm in a bit of a trouble. I hope you 
guys can help me out: my Bus refuses to start or has a really 
rough time starting... - when I turn the keys I hear the starter turn 
for a few times but then the engine simply doesn't crank... The 
generator and oil lights come alive normally. Sometimes the starter 
doesn't even turn.  I had a mechanic friend here last week but he 
couldn't also figure where exacly lies the problem - though he 
checked the starter and it is ok. I checked the battery but it reads 
normal values. Any thoughts? Whatever the problem I decided to 
change the battery. What do you guys recommend? What Amp 
values? I'm in Portugal so you could point me out some Euro 
brands...

Tx!
