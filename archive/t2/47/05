No, I think this is *exactly* the problem. The backup light circuit is coil,
backup light switch (on the transmission), fuse, light bulbs, ground. Hook
the backup light switch to the negative side of the coil, and when you shift
into reverse it grounds the coil and your engine dies.

Switch the backup light wire from the two-prong connector on the coil (the
negative side; one prong's for the condenser, the other for the dwell/tach)
to the three-prong side and your Bus will work fine.
