Subject: seats question


I'm about to go hunting through the local boneyards for middle and rear
seats
for my '79 bus, and may even scout for front seats as well.  Can anyone
tell me what years of bus/vanagon seats will fit?  The rear seat is
mainly
what I'm looking for, as the PO removed the seat long ago and built
a shelf for tools, leaving the rear seat to rust to death in his yard.
The middle=20
seat is in OK condition, but if I find a better one or a matching set
I'll get them both.

Also, while I'm at it, I may look for better front seats.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rob
