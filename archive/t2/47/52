Subject: For Sale: 96mm P&C set

This is a NIB set from NPR of Japan. The pistons are flat-topped and the 
crown height (wrist pin bore to crown) is the same as on standard 1.8 L 
pistons. The box says "Porsche Cylinder Assembly, but I've compared it 
visually and dimensionally to a standard 1.8 P&C and they are identical 
except for the bore diameter.

$350.00 + shipping from 37853 USA.
