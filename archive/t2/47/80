STP can't help either. The oil available today has a very good additive
package already; why add anything else to it?

As far as grade, that 30-wt non-synthetic is fine. Following some
suggestions on this list, I have switched from Castrol to Shell Rotella T,
which is working great, thanks guys. Two caveats: it's not sold in every
store--Wal-Mart doesn't have it--and it's not sold in quarts. It's intended
for large diesels that hold 11 to 13 gallons of oil, so it comes in gallon
jugs. NAPA has a neat little oil can that works wonders for the Rotella user
who doesn't need the whole jug.
