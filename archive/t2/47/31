Subject: Re: [T2] painting an engine

PPG is great paint.  Your local dealer can advise on the various kinds
available and suitable in your area.  You might be able to have the pieces
powdercoated for what a quart of  DAR 9000 (nicest shiny black you could
ever want) costs. They also make a cheaper line called Omni, which is just
fine as far as I can tell.  PPG's DP 90 black  epoxy primer makes a good
base for black parts exposed to stuff coming up from the road.  Ordinarily
you'd use contrasting color primer, but here you want to not call attention
to any dings.

Use hi temp paint for the heater boxes and ex manifolds.
