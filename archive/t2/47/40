If it's not a valve issue, and it may not be, then it could be a rod
bearing, which if it is will get worse soon. You should first discuss this
with the rebuilder. If he's a good one, he'll have the experience to help
you sort it out. Any skilled mechanic with a stethoscope could offer an
opinion. At least he would have a much better chance at accurate diagnosis
than anyone listening via e-mail.

Even a good warrenty is a redo from time to time. That's why it's better to
pay two times the money for a righeously remanufactured assembly that will
last three times as long as a middlin' priced assembly line rebuilt
wanabee. You reduce the risk of a redo very near nothing at all. That's far
better than any warrenty could hope to be.
