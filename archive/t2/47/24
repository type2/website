       I happened to score a set while working at a wrecking yard in Va., 
thinking around 1985.  They were in an upside down bay window waiting to be 
crushed.  I thought maybe some PO took them out of a splittie and added them 
to the bay.  Then I noticed the side window ends.  They are slanted instead 
to the 90 degree tee.  They now live in my Riviera camper and I have yet to 
see another set in person.
                                                       Peace,

                                                             Too many VW's to 
list
