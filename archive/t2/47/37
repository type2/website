Subject: tapping noise in newly rebuilt engine

Hi,
  I just wanted to get some thoughts about a loud tapping noise in our newly
rebuilt engine.( This is not a Gex,but for now I will not mention the
builder)  It starts making this noise only after the engine is warmed up. It
is a 78 hydraulic valved bus,but I don't think it is the valves because it
does not make this noise at startup. For the same reason I don't suspect an
exhaust leak. Yes,I checked the archives but didn't see anything just like
this. I just hope it is not anything deep inside. Even if the warranty thing
works out,I would not want to redo the installation. Please help.
