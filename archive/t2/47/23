Subject: painting an engine

So, now that I've got my engine out (fixing a bad piston), I want to
repaint the tin, intake runners, cooling ducts, manifold and anything
else that needs painting (not case, heads, or cylinders).

I'd like to have a nice hard finish that is going to resist flaking and
also be able to handle the temps in the engine compartment.  What would
be my best bet (paint type, brands, etc) to finish these parts?  I'm
going to degrease them and sandblast them first to get them clean and
smooth..

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Mike
