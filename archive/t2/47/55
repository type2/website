Thank You Karl, yes it is a 205E Dizzy

As a few of the Full Moonies know I swore I would never touch the timing
again after my last fiasco, I think I need to remember what happened the
last time with the 009 and when I was so proud to tell everyone I had put in
new points and gapped them at .006, in unison 4 guys said ......006 like the
picante commercial and New Your City!!!!!

However if I follow your advice I think I can get it timed close enough to
get a "Real" Mechanic to look at it, then next time I see Derrick "from
Charleston" I'll see if he can work his magic again.

Have a good week and Thank you Again!

Meredith
