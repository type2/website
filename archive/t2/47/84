Subject: oil pump removal

i own a 71 bus with a 1600dp engine. the flickering red light at low rpm on 
a warm engine has taken a huge toll on my nervers and i am replacing the oil 
pump. i have removed the oil pump cover plate, removed the gears and believe 
it or not, i can't get the oil pump body out of the case! as i do not have 
an oil pump puller, i tried gently prying it out taking care not to place my 
screw drive between the p. body and the case. the corners of the square pump 
body (save the lower right?) stick out a tad just for such prying.. so i 
have been told. well in the course of trying to pry this abomination out of 
the case i broke off the upper right hand corner of the pump body. soo i 
thought i would take a breather.. replenish my tobacco supply and send this 
email... any helpful hints out there?
the plan is to replace this failing oil pump with a full flow oil filter 
pump. is this a good idea.. i know oil filters extend the life of an engine 
but i am always a bit frightened by after market stuff.
thank you very much
