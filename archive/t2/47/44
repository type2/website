One cheesy yet effective way to test for an exhaust leak is to take 
something flat and cover your tailpipe. If there is no exhaust leak 
present the the motor will quieten down and then shut down in fairly 
short order. If there is a leak you will hear where it is coming from 
and the motor will not shut down. Caution-tailpipes get hot so do not 
burn yourself in the process.
