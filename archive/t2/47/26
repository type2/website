Bill,

go to:

http://www.everybus.com/eb/

When I got my DSL, I needed a domain name right pronto and went looking
for a good "bus" name.  Found that Chris had not registered everybus.com,
so I did on a whim.  I will be turning it over to him as soon as I can
think of a good one that ain't taken for myself.  In the mean time, I am
mirroring his updated page for 2002.
