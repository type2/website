Subject: Re: [T2] Jail Bars in a Bay?

Hi,

In Europe, Deluxe model passenger buses were referred to as the 
Clipper for the 1968,1969 and 1970 model years. The name was dropped 
because of legal issues over the name. Deluxe models 24,25 and 28 had 
the jail bars and a bar across the top of the rear seat. These pieces 
closely resembled those of pre 1968 buses except the bars on the side 
windows ran at 45 degree angles. In non bench front seat versions 
that had the spare tire mounted in the luggage area there were no 
bars on the left side. I have seen examples through the 1972 model 
year with the jail bars. The drop seems to have coincided with the 
drop of beltline trim that made its final appearance in the 1972 
model year as well.

The only buses with Jail bars I have seen in the US were those that 
were either tourist delivery vehicles or brought back by servicemen.

There is 1971 bus in Greensboro, NC that has a set of the jail bars 
in. I is quite an interesting bus in that is is left hand drive but 
has the slider door on the left side as well. I will try and get out 
an get the m-code plate info and find out where it was originally 
delivered.
