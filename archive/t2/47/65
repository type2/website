Subject: RE: [T2] 77 Gas cap NLA

hey folks,

This gas cap is available new (German) the problem is that it is $44.35.
This comes with the gasket (also available new $2.95) and keys. If you want
one of these we can get it for you.  Otherwise I agree with checking out
your local FLAPS.

Volks, does anyone have a gas cap (non-locking) for a '77 bus that I can
purchase? I talked to
my local supplier and was told they are NLA, (even through Motorworks). This
sucks, and my bus is a molotov coctail waiting to happen.

Thanks,

Chris
