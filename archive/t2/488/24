You will need to install the mounts for the air cleaner and open a hole for 
the ECU mount. You will need all the wiring running from the double relay. 
That's all the FI wiring harness on the double relay plug terminal with the 
white wires, and all the fuel pump wiring on the double relay terminal with 
the colored wires. You need the FI gas tank and fuel pump and filter with 
mounts. You need the tin and fuel pressure regulator from the FI motor.
