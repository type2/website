Your saying the flex plate won't interchange from a T4 to a T1 engine,
that is true as you said the T1 uses the single large bolt, and the T4
uses the 5 smaller bolts to attach to the crank.

But, if the T1 engine has a Flex plate already bolted to the crank, will
the Torque converter from the T4 transmission bolt to that flex plate?
