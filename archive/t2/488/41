Subject: Bus CV Boots Busted again

Does anyone know where I can get some boots that will
last longer than 400 miles, my poor vanagon(80 Westy)
has had now three sets of boots put on it to no avail,
they keep busting. One good thing , I am getting real
good at changing and packing the boots. The last set
came from The Parts Bin., the first ones were from
locals they didn't even make it to the highway. Phil
