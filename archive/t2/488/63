I am sure you're right, but up till now the oil viscosity has caused no 
issues. Like I said 122,000 miles, it burns no oil, it leaks no oil, it 
runs cool. No problems. I guess maybe the factory specs either need a 
review, or the tolerances of my Vanagon's 1.9 are more forgiving.

Thanks for the advice. I am sure the orange stuff would be nice to 
have, but it is way over budget and is not environmentally friendly. 
Apparently the stuff I am using is working fine as the cooling system 
is not building up any sludge or crud. Again, your actual milage may 
differ.

Brakes that are in spec will not squeak? I know that. My mechanic said 
that when it is time to change them, we'll put on a good set, not the 
crap that the PO had, and we'll turn the rotors if needed. it depends 
on the glazing. I provided this list of things that would need to be 
done, not a list of things that I felt were great about the situation. 
That is why I put it under the heading of Maintenance.

See the comment above about orange stuff and environmental 
consciousness.

Well, while you did not mean to bash me, you sent it on-list, and so 
made it appear as if I were an incompetent VW owner and that my van 
were on the verge of total failure from bad maintenance. If you didn't 
mean to bash, then you could have sent it privately, off-list, etc. So, 
now I come back on here, "defending myself" and looking like a bigger 
idiot. So, no-win here. But, the points are moot. The van runs great. 
Anyone that wants to take it to a mechanic for a look-over is welcome 
to do so. Anyone that wants to drive it home to PA from Phoenix has my 
blessing. The van runs great. I stand behind it. (Yes, the reverse 
works great too!) And, I didn't mention that the door seals are so good 
I need to roll down a window a bit to shut the door!
