Not necessarily.  Given the horizontal layout of the engine having lifters
bleed down after they've set a spell is not unusual.  Typically, it'll just
happen to one or two, but it's dependent on how long the engine has set and
the internal state of the lifters themselves.  When the engine was running,
did you have constantly clacking lifters, or would some clack on startup and
quite down as you drove.

"Rock hard" is a relative term.  You shouldn't be able to compress a good
lifter by hand but it'll still do it's job properly when subjected to the
forces existing in a running engine.   If you look in your Bentley you'll
see that one way suggested to compress a lifter outside the engine is to put
it (horizontally) in a vice and use the vice as a press.
