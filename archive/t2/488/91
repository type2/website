Easy-out:  A device designed to leave hardened steel in the middle of a
broken-off bolt or stud.

I've never heard of anyone having particularly good luck with an EZ-out.
The stud was already stuck, so wedging something into the middle of the
stud isn't such a good idea!

IF you have a good eye, you can drill down the center of the stud, then
use larger and larger drills to drill out the stud, leaving just the
threads in the head that can be pulled out with needle-nose pliars.

It might be better to take the head off an take it to a machinist.
Broken-off studs are easy for them, but the price goes up if there is a
broken-off EZ-out in the stud!
