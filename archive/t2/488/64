Well, while you did not mean to bash me, you sent it on-list, and so 
made it appear as if I were an incompetent VW owner and that my van 
were on the verge of total failure from bad maintenance. If you didn't 
mean to bash, then you could have sent it privately, off-list, etc. So, 
now I come back on here, "defending myself" and looking like a bigger 
idiot. So, no-win here. But, the points are moot. The van runs great. 
Anyone that wants to take it to a mechanic for a look-over is welcome 
to do so. Anyone that wants to drive it home to PA from Phoenix has my 
blessing. The van runs great. I stand behind it. (Yes, the reverse 
works great too!) And, I didn't mention that the door seals are so good 
I need to roll down a window a bit to shut the door!
