That's what I love about this list. Lot's of people around who know so much 
more than the engineers.

Join the club, Tim. Just trying to save you all money. Throw it at whatever 
makes you feel good. Pretend to know better than those who conceived the 
design, built and tested it and gave it to you and others to abuse with 
"feel good" specs.

Stupid is as stupid does. Do as you will, as will I.
