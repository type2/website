It looks like a regular
VW jack, has a round base, but it has a hex bolt head that a handle would
go
onto for cranking.  The only markings on it are "Bilstein" on the part that

goes into the jackpad.

FWIW the jack that came with my 78' westy is just like this, it takes the
lug wrench to crank it up. Works fine, I use it frequently when camping to
level the bus. Fridge works better that way... My understanding of Bilstein
is that they made a number of things for VW including jacks and shock
absorbers.
