 >>It looks like a regular
VW jack, has a round base, but it has a hex bolt head that a handle 
would
go onto for cranking.  The only markings on it are "Bilstein" on the 
part that
goes into the jackpad.<<

i'm not sure exactly what you mean by "regular".

i'm not 100% but i believe what you are describing is the original jack 
that has
come with each of the 4 baywindow buses i have owned. the 'handle' that 
would
be used to crank up the jack is the tire iron.

BTW, the Bus Depot jack is a great bargain. it is much safer/stable 
than the original
one with the round base.
