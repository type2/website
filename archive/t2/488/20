Chuck Harvey was heard babbling something about [T2] 1973 bad engine; 1975 bad body:

'72 came with a type 4 engine (first year for it)

Just move it over with all FI related parts (the "brain" and the fuel pump
especially -- I think everything else is attached to the engine).

Someone else will have to field any wiring questions but I don't THINK any
of the control wiring goes up to the front of the bus so everything you
need to move should be in/near the engine compartment.
