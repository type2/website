Unless I'm missing something here, "solid as a rock" is what you want.
You're saying you tried to compress the lifter and it wouldn't compress?
That's a good lifter.

> The other lifters had varying degrees of compressibility.

Depending on how long it sat while you got around to pulling the heads - if
you've only got 1,200 miles after a year, this engine sat a lot - then some
bleed down of the lifters is to be expected, with the result being some
degree of compressability.

If I remember correctly, AVP regrinds their lifters.  It seems like there's
only about a couple of things that could be "wrong" with reground lifters:

1) "Inners" not functioning properly due to dirt, missing parts, whatever.
I'd think this would result in lifters that would never pump up properly.
Were the lifters noisy, never quieting down even after the engine was
completely warmed up?

2) Not grinding the "foot" of the lifters to a proper convex shape, meaning
they wouldn't rotate properly, resulting in rapid wear to the foot of the
lifter and the cam lobes.  Are you seeing this?

I'm not sure how either problem would result in significant overheating.
