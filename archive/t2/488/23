Will,

Yep, more than likely, you have something stuck in the valve.

The fuel pump injection tube(on a stock 34 type carb) is the usuall
culprit, but since you have DRLA's, it's a guess.

Generally, you pull the engine, pull the head, see what it was and pull it
back out.  If it was something brass(like a carb jet), then generally you
can just put everything back together and go on....something out of a 
harder material may have cause more probs....make sure the valve is not 
bent(probably not).

You will of course need to check the valve seat and see if the piston
or combustion chamber is torn up....you may have gotten lucky!

Cheers, dave
