Subject: Re: [T2] case splitting tool

I take absolutely no responsibility for anyone breaking their case
because of taking my advice, but I found it helpful to put the flywheel
on the crank and use that to pry against the casehalf flange.
Especially helpful because it's usually a tight fit around bearing no. 1
and it keeps the crank in the correct half...

also, a rubber mallet works nicely to tap around the case.  Plus, you
can tap on the studs sticking through the halves.

again, tap really lightly or you might crack the case....
