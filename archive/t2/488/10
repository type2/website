Gerald,  I didn't say it all, I leave the keys in the
cars also, have for 22 years and nobody has stolen any
of them, but I have had serval of them come up missing
from time to time, borrowed.. them damn neices and
nephews and friends. I have 2-68 1-70 1-71 T-3's 1-73
1-75 Bay window buses and 1-80 Westy, with one odd
ball 1-73 T-4 and the bad part of it all is that a
they are all road worthy and have insurance and
plates...
