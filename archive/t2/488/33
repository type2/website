In a 30 minute old brand new rebuilt engine, I had my intake valves seize.
You are lucky that you did not have more damage. One of my intake pushrods
got stuck under its rocker and the pushrod broke a huge, unrepairable, piece
out of the head in the pushrod tube o-ring sealing area. DO NOT RUN that
engine another second. You must remove the heads, and inspect the valve
train and pistons, etc.. and perform the necessary re-repairs. In my case,
my brand valves seized in their brand new perfectly reamed guides because of
bad fuel. Somebody put something in my gasoline tank while I was waiting for
parts and machine shop labor. I now have a locking gas cap. I don't want to
say in a public forum what I found in the fuel, but , Will Anderson, you can
email me off list and I will tell you. You should inspect your fuel and
inspect your fuel tank. An easy way to take a peak into the tank is from the
fuel level sender hole.
