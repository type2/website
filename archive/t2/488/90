Subject: Re: [T2] follow up on filler neck hose size

just want to let everyone know that Karl was right on with the fuel 
filler hose size for my 69 SC.

(2 1/2" [57mm] x 7" long)

i was able to easily find the exact replacement at NAPA for about 15 
bucks per foot.

i am not sure if the same size is for ALL 68-71 buses...

thanks Karl!!!
