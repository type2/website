Not stock. Something installed by engine rebuilders who offer a warranty
period. If the engine is run hotter than they are created for then they
fall off. I think there are various indicator types available. Some fall
off, some stay on and change color.

They only "indicate" (fall off or change color) if you run the engine
REALLY hot, or run it "slightly hot" for a long time.

It's that second one that usually bites people in the butt. Timing advanced
just a hair too far so that you're running hot, but not hot enough to
notice unless you have a full set of quality guages installed.
