Without disparaging the proper tool at all I have used a coin clamped in a
vice-grip in emergency situations.  Try a number of different
denominations for the best fit then clamp it hard in a vice-grip.

Further comments:

In that area of the engine there are other potential leak sources that
may show up as drops hanging from the relief valve.  Check the oil
pressure sender, the oil filter gasket, and the dipstick bellows.

I believe (from very old memory) that the gasket on the pressure relief
valve plug is a crush ring not an O-ring.  See part "U" at your page

but I could be wrong on that.

                             OOK!
