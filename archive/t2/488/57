Ben,, I am certainly no expert on hydraulic lifters,, but when I bled a
couple of sets here,, I found that a Rock solid lifter is GOOD....

These lifters need to be bled..... i found that if your not carefull when
your bleeding them,. they will become so SOLID that you can't get the
circlip in,, and you have to start over again,,,

If you had bad lifters,, the engine would knock, it would be noisy,,,
I can't see the engine getting hot because the valves would be closed
longer, and they would cool more,,

One thing that seems to be very common is rapid wear on NEW lifters put
into an engine with the existing cam,, as the cam and the lifters are not
a matched hardness,, the harder one will rapidly wear the softer one..

I have seen AVP warrenty stuff that I would NEVER expect to be covered,,,
they have no control over things like distributer timing, fuel air
mixtures, etc..

Do you have a CHT gauge, or oil temperature gauge? if so, what temps was
the engine running at,,
