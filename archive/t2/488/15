Doug,
I run a 1904cc (90.5 X 74 mm Demello fullcircle crank, web cam, chevy rods, 
Perfrmance Technology heads, full flowed with external cooler and fan, and 
4omm Delortos) in my '71. In the summer at 65-70 mph I was running 195 
degrees.  I have 22,000 miles on my Kurt Mezger motor since April.  It runs 
like a bat out of hell.  I switched over to a late 091 to keep the rpms down.

Joy Thru Air,
