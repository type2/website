Subject: New Exhaust Needed!

Hey guys,

        I have a 1973 with the 1800 motor (not original). Currently, the
Bus has one of those dual exhaust PaceSetter exhaust systems installed. 
I figure, the Bus is slow as hell, so there's really no point in trying
to make it fast. I enjoy the Bus for what it is. With that in mind, I
want it to look completely stock, but I still want my motor to run
efficiently. What exhaust system would you guys recommend as a
replacement for my Pace Setter dual exhaust system? I'd like to get
something that has only one exit pipe (like the Buses had from the
factory). 

I've never really been in any other Bus other than my own (and at a
junkyard) so I don't know what they're supposed to sound like.. but my
Bus sounds pretty loud. I mean, sitting at a traffic light, it doesn't
exactly sound like a 455 SD TransAm with open headers, but loud enough
that it's obnoxious. Are Busses supposed to be really loud? Please excuse
these questions if they sound ignorant, but I really have no idea. I'm
not even sure if the motor has mufflers attached, I think the pace setter
exhaust just uses the tips as resonators. It makes poping sounds too.


So, in short, what's a good FACTORY looking exhaust, that sounds
reasonable, (doesn't have to be quiet, but not really loud) is efficient,
and will not detract from my low-end torque.


Thanks!

Todd
