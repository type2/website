Subject: Carb Adjustment Again?

Hey guys, I fiddled with the carburetor as per the instructions you guys
gave me. Everything seems pretty good. The Bus felt like it ran pretty
decent before, but after adjust it, it ran even better. I took the Bus
for a 25 mile trip to buy a BBQ grill from Lowes. The car actually
started running BETTER, the further we drove (still gotta rebuild the
steering though). By the time we were maybe 2-3 miles from the house, the
motor was almost completey smooth, almost sounded like a smooth GM V6/60
and not a clattering Bus motor. However, when I stopped the Volkswagen at
the house, and turned off the key. The motor started to desiel for a
couple seconds, and then actually started right back up and ran for 2
seconds. (electric fuel pump so it died, regardless). 

The idle was running a little high too. In terms of a fuel to air ratio,
what does it mean when your motor deisels after you shut it off. It means
too much fuel, correct?


Thanks,

Todd
