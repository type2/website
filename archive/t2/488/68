Subject: vacuum advance:  theory

I'm trying to understand the functions of mechanical and vacuum advance.

The need for advance at high rpm makes sense to me.  The "burn" needs 
time to travel from plug to piston.

I understand how mechanical advance satisfies this need at high rpm.

I hear that vacuum advance exists to give a healthy slug of advance 
at low rpm when mechanical advance is minimal.

  What I don't get is why lots of advance is needed at low rpm and a 
just-off-idle throttle position.  Since rpm are low, there can be no 
need to compensate for burn travel time.

Can a guru step in and offer an explanation?

Thanks, jack
