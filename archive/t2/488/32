Hi Volks,

I am watching this thread intently.  I currently run a pair of Solex 
carbs on a 2L engine and have recently acquired the components I need 
to upgrade the Westfakia to L-Jet FI. All I need now is a warm space, 
some fuel line...and TIME.

Tweaking the carbs yesterday found me also considering if I would need 
a different throttle cable housing to go with the FI.  The bus is 
currently using the throttle cable from the 73 westy that originally 
owned the Solexes, which is fine since that's what's in place now. The 
throttle cable part is listed separately for 73-74 and 75-79 so I know 
I am going to need to add that to my list.... but I can't tell outright 
if I will also need to replace the cable housing.

Chuck, if you could measure and post the dimensions of these housings I 
would be much obliged.

Happy trails,
