Subject: Squealing Brakes

Patient: 83 Westfalia Air Cooled
Treatment so far: New Bendix Rotors, New Wheel Bearings and Seals, New
Metallic Brake Pads, New Calipers.
Are there any little fiber separators or something that will stop these
squealing brakes ?.
The old brakes were this way and I never did find a fix.
I followed the break in instructions of stopping gently for about 20
tiimes from 30 mph.
