You can can the Harleys AND the BMWs... what you need
is a Vespa or two!  I have a P125, GL, 50 Special, and
a couple Lambretta LD150s in the garage right now. 
The P125 is my daily rider and I have a nifty little
sidecar to restore this winter and bolt up in the
spring.

Vespas seem to be the one vehicle the Italians got
"right."  They run forever, are cheap and REALLY easy
to rebuild, and (get this) RELIABLE!  That and they're
way too much fun to ride, and the chicks dig them. 
They attract a lot mroe attention than Harleys do,
too.  Put an expansion chamber exhaust on one and
watch folks turn their heads as you whiz by!  8^)

Just my $.02,

Chris
