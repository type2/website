Subject: Re: [T2] Maintence on an old bus

To bring a fuel injected bus out of moth balls:

1.  Remove the cylinder tin and clean out any mouse, wasp or hornet nests.
(can be done with engine in bus)
2.  Replace ALL fuel lines and filter.
3.  Oil change (I like to use the Lucas oil additive from NAPA along with oil)
4.  While your under the bus, check out engine and tranny mounts.
5.  Flush brake lines with clean fluid.  (wouldn't hurt to pull a couple
wheels and check pads and shoes too)
6.  Do a full blown tune up, wires, cap, points, condenser, rotor, plugs.
7.  Clean battery terminals, check terminals (repalce if needed) and ground
points.
8.  Check and replace if need be the air cleaner.
9.  Add some injector cleaner to a couple tank fulls of gas.
10.  If you really want a bus that is ready to go, grease the front end and
the wheel bearings.  You might want to have the alignment checked also
which will let you know the condition of the ball joints.
