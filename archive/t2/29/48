Subject: *Bay window buses and VWs for sale*


Still makeing some room, so Im looking to sell a few 70/71 bay window buses 
that have titles, but all need engines. I also have a few other VWs for sale 
still, so go to this link and see what I have. Cash talks and the more you 
buy, the cheaper it gets. Go to this link.
