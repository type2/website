Some additional thoughts on what Rick Taylor wrote:

Yes.  And while it's out, clean it and repaint it, and crawl on top of and
underneath the engine with a small paint brush and a can of laquer thinner
and a rag, and clean off all the accumulated grease.  First thing my high
school auto shop teacher made us do.

Right.  Also the rubber grommets, usually missing, in the tin, especially
where the fuel line comes through.

> 4.  While your under the bus, check out engine and tranny mounts.

More places to clean grease.
