Subject: steering questions

Good afternoon, everyone --

I am slowly getting to all the little quirks on my
new-to-me 71 Westie hardtop, and I am going to tackle
steering and rear brakes now.  There is a good amount
of slop in the steering (slop at "centered" position,
that is).  It drives just fine this way, but I'd sure
like to tighten it up a bit.  I JUST got a Bentley
manual in the mail (as in I have just looked at the
front axle diagram for the first time about three
minutes ago), and suspect I need to check tie rods. 
Looks like there is not a separate tie rod end as on
my others cars... am I correct?  I hope I can get away
with a little wrench-turning, but I'll bet I need to
replace at least the right one, and that looks like it
requires a press setup to do.  Any easy way to check
this sort of stuff?

Thanks in advance!

Chris
