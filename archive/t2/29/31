I believe VW went to dual port to meet emission standards.

Single port provides slightly higher low end torque because of the
higher velocity of the air fuel mixture as it enters the cylinders.

Single port heads are not subject to all the cracking that you find
in dual port heads.

Single port provides more engine access especially when changing
number 1 and 3 spark plugs.
