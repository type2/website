Subject: Starter motors & DIY   successes

Hi guys,
Last weekend my wife Catriona & I drove up the coast &
the bus ran wonderfully....until we were about half
way to our destination when we pulled over for a
break.
Then she wouldn't start.....arrrgh!
Turned out to be the starter motor & the road service
mechanic from the NRMA told us to hit the starter
motor with a hammer to get it moving.
I didn't need ANY persuading to get me to hit the bus
with a hammer.....I've been tempted quite a few times
in the past:-)
Anyhow,we got up there & home in a very roundabout
manner only having to belt the bus a few times to get
her started.
So today I rang up about another starter motor & was
told they had a good 2nd hand one for AUD$150(about 60
quid I think).
There were no better offers around so I caught the
train over to the parts dealer & dragged the
replacement home.
At this point I should point out that until this point
in time my main skills with auto mechanics featured
that humble tool mentioned before.....a hammer.
So when I took out the old starter motor & put in the
replacement all by myself in 2 hours without stripping
ANY nuts or bolts & without hurting myself I was
suitably gratified & pleased with myself.
Millie,our microbus is now running AND starting fine.
Now I'm feeling more positive about fixing the single
cab, however I have a sinking feeling it may lead me
to bugger something up in the future in a much more
thorough manner than I ever have before.
:-)
Cheers
