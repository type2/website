My experience is about 70-30.  A few joints slide right off with only
finger pressure, but most require some persuasion.  Every new joint I've
installed required persuasion.

"beat your brains out"?  Hardly!  Just support the shaft in the middle and
use a brass hammer on the hub of the CV.  Go round and round with
light-to-moderate taps and you'll work the CV off.

Installation is the opposite of removal.  Get the thing started and use
the brass hammer to tap round and round the _hub_ of the CV and work it
back on.  When the axle starts to emerge, you can put a large socket over
it and tap through the socket with the brass hammer until you can get the
snap ring into its groove.

The reason to use a brass hammer is so the hammer will be softer than the
hardened steel of the hub.  In a pinch, you could use a steel hammer if
you hammer through a drift made of softer material.

I think that it's important to be able to do this without a press, since
you can't be sure that a press will be available if you need to change a
CV on the road.
