Set your hydraulic lifters at ONE TURN from just touching the lifter. NOT
the two turns in any of the manuals.

AFM adjustment: turn screw in = richer, back screw out = leaner

If you think your lifters are gunked up, run a pint of Marvel Mystery Oil
in the crankcase for about a week (500 miles) then change the oil, use
20/50 wt unless the temp is below 42 degrees and use straight 40 weight
for below 42 degree remps.
