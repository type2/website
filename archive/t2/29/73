Subject: Re: [T2] Extra dash warning lights

Hi Andrew,

VW fitted several types of brake warning lights of this will be one....

EITHER it will come on when the hand brake is on or there is unequal hyrdrualic fluid pressure between the dual brake circuits (caused by, for example, a failing wheel cylinder) when you press the foot brake.

OR it will come on during start up or due to unequal pressure between brake circuits.

OR it will light up when you push it (to test it works) or due to unequal pressure between brake circuits.

If when you put the battery in it does none of these things then either the light is bust or there is yet another type of switch used by VW, in which case check the list archives for any type of brake warning light I've forgotten about
