News Flash!!!

The Great Bus Tour and it's Hubcap is here in the St. Louis, Missouri are=
a.

For those who might have been wondering, the hubcap and it's case full of=

cool donated momentos is still on the move.

Rob Laffoon from Nebraska brought it to the Labor Day weekend Bus event w=
e
host called "Busses By The Arch / Busses Nowhere Near The Arch".  He had
planned to hand it off to one of the Kansas City Bus guys, but they left
prior to that ever happening.  So he surprised me by "handing it off" to =
me
and asking me to try to get it over to, and hand it off to them.  It is
currently on display on our dining room table.  It has been a lot of fun =
to
explore the contents of the trunk, check out the photos and read the Tour=

logbook.  As all before me have, I'm adding a couple of things to the tru=

before passing it on to the next Tour participant.  =


I might be able to deliver it to the Missouri Micro's (NEATO Chapter)  Fa=

campout at Graham Cave State Park on the weekend of Oct 13-14.  Hopefully=

there will be someone from the K.C. area there (driving the prerequisite
Type 2, of course) who can accept and continue the journey of the Hubcap
and it's trunk on it's way around the country.

I just wanted to send this update out so others will know where it
currently is.   What a great idea this Hubcap Tour was/is!!!  I'm delight=
ed
to be able to participate!  Could someone who is currently on the Type2
list please make sure that this makes it over there - thanks!
