hey everybody,

I've a 2.0L bus and I'm aware that the valves have hydraulic lifters, which do not need to be adjusted. Questions is, I still hear/read about adjusting these things. Is this something that's done by some folks? When should this be done on a hydraulic engine? I would assume when rebuilding, but when else, major tuneups?
