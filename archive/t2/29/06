Aren't you glad you didn't goto carbs!

Check the temp sensor near the #3 cyl. Make sure it's plugged in and
that it is within specs (check hot and cold - ohm measurements is in
the bentley/haynes or the archives).

You can check the engine code (at the case halfs near the oil
breather). Don't trust the # on the fan housing, they get swapped
sometimes. 78 and 79 bays come w/ hydralic lifters stock. Check the 
engine code #'s for sure on this page:

Hopefully someone didn't put solids lifters in a hydr. case, or
you'll hafta find another way to check the lifter type. Someone
(Karl?) mentioned something about checking the pushrods or something
but as you can tell by this sentence I have no idea what that
something is.

If the bus has been sitting it may take many miles for the lifters to
finally pump-up. When I start my bus up after it's winter nap, they
make a racket for awhile. John Anderson has a great writeup (in the
library) on hydr. lifters here:

From the library and Bartno tek pages:

Damn, I love http://www.type2.com

I missed Campers on Cape Cod/Transporter Fest, so I hope there are
some good trip reports/write-ups.
