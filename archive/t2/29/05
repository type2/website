So Ron, what you are basically implicating here is, if a person is going
to buy  any parts, purchase them locally, to defer warranty shipping
costs, and also to allow a guy to get back on the road as soon as
possible due to a defective parts situation, as mail order is not always
the right or fastest answer, when it comes time for  maintenance item's.
( bearings, suspension, exhaust, brakes, etc.) 

This is what I got from your testimonial.
