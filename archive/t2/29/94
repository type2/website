The first one I had, got it from Eastern Imports in Jacksonville, Fl. 
(904)384-8492. My second one I made myself and used it a couple weeks ago on 
my 78 2L, I used an wooden 3/4" dowel rod along with a spare engine with 
clutch, pressure plate, and drive plate installed. With an old clutch, i 
drove the dowel rod through several times insuring I keep teeth lined up each 
time, after teeth were cut into dowel rod and would push through with little 
pressue I then pushed it through clutch plate into drive plate that was 
installed on engine to get nipple on end. I have used the home made one at 
least a dozen times with a perfect slide in record (engine to tranny).
