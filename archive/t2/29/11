Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser Plugged SP conversion

Here is the trick...
Drill 2 (about 9mm)holes....At the point where the heat riser tube makes
it's sharp bend, under the manifold, do this in a manner where you are
creating a straight shot through the blocked riser tube.....

Find a welding rod (1/8") and strip all the shielding from it
bend a small area in it, almost like a hook. chuck it intal a drill, and
insert into the blocked area...Ream the heck out of it and keep soaking it
with spray carburetor cleaner..

After you are done, weld the 2 holes back up and you are done..

This is the best method I have found to get all the crud out.....Using the
proper heat riser gaskets, which are really hard to find does the job and
keeps the heat riser flow going only one direction, keeping this from
happening......
