Jacks are real handy for body work too. I bought a 71 Deluxe Clipper for
$300. The only major problem being that the nose was caved in on the drivers
side. I put a piece of plywood over the front of the wheel well then went
the hydraulic jack, 2x4, and a thick, folded up, fiberglass mat on the
inside of the nose (to more evenly distribute the pressure). Slowly I jacked
until. . . . THONK!! The nose popped into position with only a few minor
wrinkles.
