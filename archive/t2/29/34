Subject: another question on the Vanagon seat belt swappage

does anyone have a picture of the L brackets they made, or had made for them?

measurements would help too.  gonna start looking for Vanagon belts soon
so i can do this conversion. just want to make sure i know exactly what other
hardware i need to buy or have fabricated first.

TIA!
