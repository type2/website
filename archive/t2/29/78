I would follow the complete maintenance inspection schedule in Bentley.
Espezially, flush and bleed the brakes, then watch them closely for leaks.
The rust scale on the rotors and drums will contaminate the pads and shoes.
They can be cleaned with abrasive if still thick enough. The starter
problem could well be just a matter of cleaning the battery and terminals
and cable connections, including the ground strap at the front of the
tranny. Then test the alternator output under load, with the hi beams and
heater blower on full. When all that is verified in spec and you still have
a problem, the starter is showing it's age and should be replaced.
