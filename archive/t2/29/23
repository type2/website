Subject: DP to SP conversion

Ric,

I have a coupla extra manifolds.  If you have a DP center section with good 
heat risers, you can buy SP end "castings" (they're not really cast, and the 
fit isn't all that good - AMHIK).

Anyhoo, let me know what you need and I'll overnight it to you.  You can pay 
me back later.
