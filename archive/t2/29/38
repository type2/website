Well, that would be me!  :)

Placing a restriction in the path won't speed up flow unless flow goes
sonic in the throat, which is far from the case here!

whether to put the restriciton early or late in the path would seem to be
a "flip the coin" decision.  The restriction seems to be the same either
way.  The only difference is that putting the small hole on the left will
result in greater pressure fluctuation in the heat riser than putting the
small hole on the right.  Perhaps this pulsing will result in a
self-cleaning action.

Just a theory...
