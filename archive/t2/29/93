Hello all,

Am I killing my new engine by driving it with a rusty gas tank? The fuel =
filter get's cloudy after a while and I just change it.

But I am having a problem with fuel intake. When I start up  and drive, =
it's fine for about a mile. Then the carberator kinda chokes and it =
feels like no gas is getting in. If I rev it to high RPM's then =
accelerate, it takes off fine.

So two questions:

1. Would a rusty gas tank cause the carberator to choke?
2. Is it killing my engine?

Thanks-- >>
