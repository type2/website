Subject: Re-torquing heads?

best if left alone. It was designed that way, that is why there is no
mention 
of re-torque.

I have read varying pieces of advice re: this subject.  Some people claim
that to ensure maximum life for a rebuilt (or new) aircooled engine, the
engine should be removed from the vehicle after a certain amount of miles
(say, 500), the tinware removed and all case and head bolts retorqued to
specs.  Given the relative hassle in doing this, I suppose that most people
don't do it.  I would certainly think twice about it, having just managed to
reinstall my 1800.  However, I see the potential benefit of doing so, in
case something loosened up during break-in.  The famous Bob Hoover certainly
stressed the need to do this in his sermons.  However Tom Wilson, in his
famous VW engine rebuilding book, simply states that one shouldn't worry
about it.  As Max indicates, perhaps the VW designers themselves did not
feel the necessity of retorquing engines after breakin.  Then again, a
somewhat cynical person may say: sure, but if that means that the engine may
not last as long, it plays into the hands of a dealer who stands to sell you
a new engine sooner, or charge you for a rebuild sooner.  Interesting
debate...
