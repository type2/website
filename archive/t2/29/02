Hello fro the other half of Busses by the Bay.
Well, the now 229,000 mi Westy ran like a champ for the 5 hr trip down
and back from NJ, liking the cooler weather, doing 65mph at about 230
degrees and 30 psi.  The campground (Pt Lookout, Md) let me share Jeff's
site, thanks, Jeff.   Got to teach Jeff and his daughter how to play
Milles Borne.  Guess the wind and threat of rain kept them away!
