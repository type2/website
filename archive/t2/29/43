I think that VW had to go to dual port to flow enough mixture after the
displacement increase to 1600.  Keep in mind that the same basic head
design had been used from 1200 through 1500, and there wasn't enough metal
left to make the holes bigger.  Since they had to make a casting change
anyway, they went all the way to the dual port design.

I'm not sure that the cracking worries apply to the long-reach plug dual
port heads.  Anybody have any data on the long-reach heads?

Very true.  They also make it easier to seat the spark plug boots.  On
dual port tin, you have to be careful to get the boots behind the manifold
nuts.
