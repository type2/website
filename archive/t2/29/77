You need the VW engine stand adapter. Most of the VW vendors have them.
Even the one I got from JC Whipme years ago works well. Also, you could try
some bushings and longer bolts with the standard type mount, but in my
experience the standard type arms will not swing to the proper orientation
to center the VW motor so it is reasonably balanced.
