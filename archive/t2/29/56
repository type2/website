Jake and George,

I don't understand Jake's response that VW went to DP for fuel
injection.  VW didn't go to fuel injection on the uprights till 1975
in the USA. 1971 through 74 Beetles were DP carbs. 71 was the only
upright engine bus in the USA and it was DP carb.

Concerning George's answer that DP was required to satisfy the 1600cc
displacement, according to Bentley 68 through 70 buses were 1600 cc
single port.

I know I'm going up against the experts so fire away.
