It might well be that VW had FI in mind when they went to dual ports.  It
makes it easier to feed each cylinder individually.  Wouldn't be the first
time they thought agead.

Yes they were.  My theory is that they ran out of intake port capacity and
wanted more power so they switched to the dual port design.  The dual port
does breathe better, but for a bus engine where you don't want to
overstress anyway the single port is probably fine.

I like my dual port low compression engine, but it probably doesn't make
any more power than a single port.  I just don't spin it fast enough to
take advantage of the better breathing.
