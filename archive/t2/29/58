Subject: engine out, onto the stand

I have my engine out now and I'd like to put it on the stand.  I have an
engine stand that I borrowed from a friend, but when I try to put it
onto the engine, the clutch gets in the way.  the stand looks kinda like
this:

it seems like the collars at the ends of the 4 arms that slip over the
engine bolts aren't long enough to clear the clutch...

Should I try and find the front part of a tranny (bell housing?) and
attach it to the engine stand and then attach the engine to that?

Thanks,
Mike
