Might be the relay or it might be the contacts on the turn signal lever.
Do you hear a clicking under the dash when you move the lever?  If so,
your relay is bad and needs replacing.  On currently-available relays you
have to install a jumper between two pins to duplicate the function of the
original relay.  See the archives for details.

You might well find the relay to be full of water.  This is obviously
caused by a leak that needs fixing.  I also drill a small hole in the end
of the relay opposite the pins to allow any water that happens in to
drain.
