Subject: Bus junkyard north of Denver

Volks,
Some years ago, on one of my jaunts, I was headed north from Denver and
passed a VW junkyard.  I could not resist and did stop in.  It was full of
splits and bays and i lusted appropriately, then drove on.  Now I need to
know... what is the name of this yard???  anyone?
