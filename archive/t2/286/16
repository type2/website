Let me state an opposing viewpoint...

Yes, water comes in thru the vents when you drive in the rain and yes, it
drops onto the battery and into the tray, and, yes, that water ought to go
away.  The drain holes in the battery tray and its mirror are indeed
there to let that water out, but...

The plugs are there for a reason, too!  Those pans are located right
behind the rear wheels.  When water comes in thru the top (unless you are
next to a semi), it's rain water and benign.  As long as it goes away in a
day or two, all is well.  The water that the rear tires is kicking up is a
different kettle of salt cod! It is contaminated with dirt, rocks, salt,
and other unmentionable substances.  It should *not* be allowed into your
battery tray!  and that is why the plugs are there.  They block water from
below but do not seal the opening.  Water does drip out, slowly.  I would
leave them in.
