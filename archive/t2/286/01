Subject: Help with starter electrics

Just finally got my engine back in my bus and the
starter will not work.  It is not even clicking like a
dead starter would, it just does absolutely nothing
when you turn the key.  I checked the voltage going to
all the different connection points and they check out
fine, they are all well above 8 volts.  Am I missing
something here.  Is there a special order to putting
on the 3 wires on the terminal bolt.  To me, it seems
as though that the ground is missing or something.  I
haven't found anything that would indicate a ground
for the starter though.  Please help, Thanks
