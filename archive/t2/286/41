Subject: Lengthy: opposite Idle problem, other problem too.

Interesting. I have exactly the opposite problem that Jonathan has. My fuel 
injected '78 will start and idle, unattended, for about 2-3 minutes, and 
then cut out. It'll start up again fine. When I start it up drive away, 
regardless of whether or not I've let it idle in the driveway, it takes 5 
minutes of uninterrupted driving before you can come to a stop without 
stalling.I have noticed that it smells like it's running rich, but I don't 
recall smelling anything like leaking gas.

That problem has been compounded with a more recent problem: intermittent 
and sporadic coughing, jerking and the occasional backfire.
It's pretty much rendered the bus immobile. During the last half hour of a 
2.5 hour trip, the bus started skipping a beat, which progressed into 
coughing and heaving to the point I had to pull over. I couldn't find 
anything wrong and managed to limp home doing 15-30 miles an hour.

I'd also learned on that trip that I needed a new alternator. So, two weeks 
later, I successfully replaced the alternator. It's now charging at 13.8 
volts. I started it up and took it for a ride down the road. It took the 
usual 5 minutes to warm up, and drove fine for another 5 minutes around 
town. Then it started the sputtering and heaving again, but not as badly or 
consistently as last time. It seems to happen most noticeably when you shift 
to 3rd and give it some gas. It's like the whole bus just chokes up and 
shudders and then regains a little composure when you slow down and shift 
back into 2nd.

Any concrete ideas or similar experience are welcome.
One note: I live at the beach in New Hampshire, so salt corrosion is a 
factor to consider. Just ask my brake lights.

Thanks
Mat
