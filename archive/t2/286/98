this is VERY EXPENSIVE, and have obviously reduced this waste to
something reasonable. I haven't gotten one in forever, who knows if
they'll climb out of their financial hole, but at least this is a good
start. 
I really think that that was a cause of their problems. I don't recall
ever buying something from RMMW directly, and only one item was
drop-shipped from there by another vendor, yet they blasted me with a
bunch of catalogs. The only companies that can get away with this are
companies that buy items for $5 wholesale and sell for $100 retail to
willing customers, like Victoria's "Soft p*rn delivered to your mailbox
twice a week" Secret. 
By the time you have a bus for a year, you've found the vendors and
having them fight too much over customers isn't good for their health.
