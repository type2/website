I have an old freon 40lb tank (gotten when that stuff was $4 lb)

at one time they made a kit to convert the tanks, I have it and it has a
safety valve and guage and everything, was about $20 or so back in the
last century
   I think the safety valve is set at 150psi, I know I have put 125PSI in
it years ago but now don't put anymore than about 50-60psi in it
