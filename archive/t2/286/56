Subject: Re: [T2] tinting jalousie windows?

	Oh! Oh! Oh!

	I know the answer to that one!  Yes, you can - I disassembled mine a
couple years back, tinted them with 20% film from the FLAPS and reassembled
them using the old weather-stripping...  "Stupid Old Weather-stripping!" -
spoken in best Homer Simpson (tm) voice.  Whatta PITA!  Used the new outer
seal that came with my Wolfsburg West window rubber kit.

	Fast forward to about 4 months later - browsing the WW page and
guess what they are now/then marketing - a kit to COMPLETELY rebuild your
jalousies with everthing you could imagine...  Next time I was at their
shop, I asked if'n I could buy the new complete rebuild kits and have them
credit me the price of the outer seals.  "Sure thing..." sez they, after
checking their purchase records.  I haven't checked just recently, but
pretty sure the last time I was browsing they still sell the kit.
