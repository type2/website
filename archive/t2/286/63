Subject: Chugging engine at cold startup and then hard starts when

This new single port engine with a 31pict?? (whatever is stock on them) chugs like it's over choking first thing in the mornings. Takes a few good revs to help "clear" it. After it is fully warmed up and you come back to start it again (say you went to the mall and came back in 5 minutes to the parked car) It is hard to start, just cranks and cranks and then fires up on what seems like about 2-3 cylinders. Then if revved a couple of time it clears and idles ok. Any thoughts on this?? Compression is good right across the board. 1600 sp stock engine.

Thanks, Courtney
