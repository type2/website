Subject: Bar-b-que compressed air tank

It was said:

Then it was asked:

For those times when we need just a little bit of compressed air, like 
above, could a 20lb barbeque propane tank be fitted and used as a source??  
How much pressure would the propane tank be able to take?

Any suggestions on just what fittings would be needed.

And any other suggestions on its potential uses, like blowing out 
something..
