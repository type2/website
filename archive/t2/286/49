Subject: Engine on the floor

Is there any reason I should not tip the engine on it's side to work on
it..I need to install a thermostat.

How about painting the cooling tin, an inexpensive spray can job, for
cosmetic reasons.  Would it burn off?

I will be making many posts in this area, thanx in advance for your help!!

Respectfully,
