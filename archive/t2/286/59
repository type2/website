Jonathan,
	Have you torn the carb down and rebuilt it?  Could be a bad diaphragm or 
clogged orifice(air-bleed).  A good cleaning could solve the problem.  If 
you haven't looked in the bottom of your carb's fuel bowl recently, there 
may be a pile of rusty silt in there that made it past the fuel filter.

	Eron
