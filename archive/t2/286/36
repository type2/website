When my engine was out I cleaned up my trays.  Before I repainted them I
poured in some acid and neutralized it with baking soda and then used a wire
brush to remove the loose rust and flakes.  This was the result:

Plug or no plug the trays aren't perfectly flat and sometimes water can't
get to the hole to drain out so there's no easy solution.

The trays are obviously a poor design and I can see arguments for an against
the plug but I think I agree with the archive posts.  The problem I have
with the plug is that I believe it promotes rust around the hole so you have
to be diligent with it or the hole will grow and then no plug will fit in
it.

David's solution sounds like the right idea: favor fast drainage.
