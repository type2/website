looking in my T3 manual, i see that the sensor has 'a nominal value 
of 2500 ohms' and 'higher temperature makes resistance lower.'

i'm not sure that the signal output is of a sort that an be plugged 
into a guage - it might need the lil' digifant brain.
one parts page had a schematic: 
http://members.rennlist.com/pbanders/TS2.jpg    it shows the sensor 
grounding to the case; the interior was drawn as a box with a slash 
running from upper left to lower right. it then proceeded to the 
brain. i have NO idea how to read a schematic... is this a variable 
resistor, or what :)
