Subject: choking at idle

My bus used to stall at stop signs, try opening the choke a little more and
going through the carb procedure again--I think it is (for a single port
carb): make sure you are warmed up and on the lowest idle notch on the cam,
turn the idle speed screw out all the way and just in till it touches the
cam and another half turn or so, adjust idle mix screw (small one) till you
have the proper idle speed (850-900) then fiddle with the idle air screw
until it does whatever the book says (just starts to speed up or slow
down?).  Better to err on the ever so slightly rich side.

THEN once all that is dialed in and correct I would turn in the idle speed
screw a little tighter (the one thats on the accelerator linkage) maybe one
or two turns.  It may make your idle speed 950+ but it may have to
compensate for a worn idle cam as was the case with mine (it is very loose
on the choke shaft).  IF your choke is open enough when it warms up, it
shouldn't die at a stop sign.  If you opened the choke wide open (disabled),
it Definitely shouldn't die at a stop sign.  ever. but it would be hard to
start in the morning.  Hope it helps. (I usually have my choke a little more
open than indicated by the first notch, maybe 2 mm).
