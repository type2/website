Good info!

Also the relay that toggles between low beam and high beam. The contacts 
for the high beam may have fused leaving the relay stuck in the HB position.

If you have the Bentley schematic you could remove the relay and use a 
multimeter to see if the column switch is stuck in the high beam position 
or if it is clicking from HB to LB properly.

You could also do a continuity test through the relay to see if the relay 
is stuck with the HB contacts closed.
