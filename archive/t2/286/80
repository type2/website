Subject: Re: 63-71 Euro tail-lights into US spec Bus

 Hello,
Thanks for the responses.  I think I will probably go with Matt's info which
is here, or Sean Dorman's idea of just running a wire from the master
cylinder along the wiring harness back to the brakes.  But first I must ask
a few more questions to Matt:
 Sorry about misreading whatever it was I read.  I just did a search of the
archives and read something about Euro tail lights, but didn't realize it
was referring to Euro to US lights!!  Oh well.  Anyway, you said here to:

OK, that's cool, easy enough, but will my 'Zerds (hazards) still work?

 So do you think I should just unplug the wire out of the master cylinder
and run a new one to the brake lights, with a jumper wire?
Thanks again,
