Subject: Re: [T2] High beam stuck on

One thing to check would be if the wires that connect right below the
steeing wheel are actually connected. One night my bus would not
switch beams (mine stuck on low) nor would the horn work. Turned out
the connector on the steering column (nearest you while driving) had
jostled loose after a bump in the road. Easy & simple. I don't have
the bentley in front of me to check if the lights will actually
default to on, but they might.
