Ron, on Sunday, 10 Nov you said:

"Basically the same as they had before, but a bit more nicely put together

Ron, is Pacesetter making the BODY of the muffler in the USA??

A while back, when I talked with S&S Headers about their one piece muffler 
for my '78, S&S said that they imported the muffler body, but made and 
connected their own 'pipes'.
