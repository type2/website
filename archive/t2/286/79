Subject: Re: [T2] Flooded engine

the engine compartment has a negative pressure (compared to atmospheric)
when going down the road. The fan and carb(s) are sucking in more then is
being "forced" in thru the vents, regardless of year.

This being said, the hot air area under the engine is a lot more positive
pressure then the engine bay, you can figure out the rest. It's a good idea
to keep that sucker as isolated as possible.
