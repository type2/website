Subject: Brake pressure regulator is OK (maybe), master is out?

OK, I tried Karl's suggestion of loosening the output line at the 
pressure regulator. A good healthy squirt of fluid came out when the 
brakes were applied.

I don't get any fluid from either of the rear wheel bleeders.

So, if fluid is moving through the pressure regulator but doesn't reach 
the rear wheels, does this suggest that the master cylinder is dead? Or 
maybe I have a kink (or blockage)?
