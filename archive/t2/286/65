Have you got a link?  Just curious.  I talked a lot with Dworkin about
going the other way (Euro -> US) but not so much about doing the US ->
Euro conversion.

The reason why you do this is to free up a wire for the brake lights.
A stock Euro bus has 5 wires for the rear lighting:

brake
left turn
right turn
left tail
right tail

A stock US bus has 4 wires for the rear lighting:

left turn/brake
right turn/brake
left tail
right tail

By connecting the tail lights to the same wire, you free up one of the
tail light wires to be used as the stop wire.  You also put all your
rear running lights on one fuse, so make it a point to check your tail
lights occasionally.

You disconnect the wire between the turn signal switch and the brake
light switch.  This makes the turn/stop wires into turn wires only.  On
your Bus, this is probably done most easily by unplugging and taping up
the 54f wire at the hazard flasher switch.

Also at the hazard flasher switch, the 54 wire is the one you want to
connect to the "freed-up" tail light wire to run to the rear for the
stop lights.  Unplug the 54 wire from the hazard switch and the tail
light wire from the fuse box, and connect these two wires together.
Use a jumper wire if needed.

At the back, you'll need to make up a jumper to connect the "freed-up"
tail light wire to both brake lights.

Note that this conversion ends up putting your brake lights on a smaller
gauge wire than VW used.  On the 1970 Euro Bus, the brake light is on a
1.0 mm^2 (~16 AWG) wire, while on the US Bus, the brake/turn light is on
a 1.5 mm^2 (~14 AWG) wire.  Doing this conversion to a US Bus puts the
brake lights on an 0.75 mm^2 (~18 AWG) wire, which will result in more
voltage drop and less brightness at the brake lights.  To get around this,
leave the tail light wiring alone, disconnect the turn signal - brake
switch wire, and run a new 14 AWG wire for the brake lights.

I hope this helps!
