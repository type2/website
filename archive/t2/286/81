Thinking about it some more, no - only the front turn signals would flash
in hazard mode.  If you unplug the 54 wire at the hazard flasher switch and
leave the 54f wire connected, you'll isolate the brake and turn functions
(the rear yellow lamps will not light up when you step on the brakes) but
the yellow lamps in the rear will still flash in hazard mode.

That would get you closer to the original VW design.  Also, unplugging
the black/red stripe wire at the master cylinder is equivalent to
unplugging the 54 wire at the hazard flasher switch.
