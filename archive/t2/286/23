Hey, now my feelings are hurt.  Not! :-D

I do agree that this has gone on long enough, especially since Ron and I 
have settled our differences.

I think the he is a nice guy and his company should judged on the whole 
not based on one person's one time experience.  I apologize to all for 
this unfortunate thread we've had to follow.  It was my fault and I 
accept total responsibility.

Ron is welcome at our house on Maui anytime.  We've got extra room and 
would be honored to host him.
