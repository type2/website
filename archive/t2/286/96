I really think that that was a cause of their problems.  I don't recall
ever buying something from RMMW directly, and only one item was
drop-shipped from there by another vendor, yet they blasted me with a
bunch of catalogs.  The only companies that can get away with this are
companies that buy items for $5 wholesale and sell for $100 retail to
willing customers, like Victoria's "Soft p*rn delivered to your mailbox
twice a week" Secret.

By the time you have a bus for a year, you've found the vendors and having
them fight too much over customers isn't good for their health.
