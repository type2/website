Hiya Neale,

You need to remove the outside handle and check it over simply because that's 
the easiest thing to do first and the trouble may well be in that handle.  
But do know that the internal latch assembly may also be at fault.  It should 
be removed and inspected for wear.  Clean and lube both assemblies while they 
are out, repair what you need to and you should be in good shape.
