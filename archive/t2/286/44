They are originally glass and they can be tinted with some work. I 
recommend removing each pane for tinting.

I visited the local commercial glass shop who cut me tinted glass (tinting 
is IN the glass) and then sent it away for tempering.

One local shop could not get such narrow glass tempered, another shop could 
so shop around.

Wasn't too bad $$$ wise and lasts as long as the glass. My bus had very bad 
bubbled tinting when I got it and it had turned purple.

Newer tinting materials might be better.
