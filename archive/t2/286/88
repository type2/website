Subject: Re: [VB] using a cyl head temp sensor for oil temp?

 is this a variable resistor, or what :)
---------------------
The VDO sender for a temp gage is only about 15$ and even cheaper of you
go to a wrecking yard and get a sender from a VW, Audi, Porsche.
Or buy a set of gages from me .Buy these gages with the senders: $70.00,
Add $5.00 for delivery.
Oil Temp, Oil Pressure and the senders.
