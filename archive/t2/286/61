hey folks, I just visited Jim's VW in Leeds, Alabama (just outside of 
Birmingham) this past friday and his place is an excellent resource for bay 
window parts.

He has 60-80 bays scattered in the woods at his place in various states of 
dismantling.  I was able to freely roam the buses and get any parts I 
needed.  Jim is a really nice guy and Tracy has always been very 
helpful.  They have an excellent website at:
http://www.jimsvw.org/

In the past I've also emailed Tracy (Jim's office manager, I think) and 
have bought parts via mail.  You can email them and inquire as to parts 
availability, give them your zip code and they'll give you a price 
including shipping.  They don't take credit cards that I'm aware of, but 
you can send them a check, and when it clears, they'll send your part.

Just thought I'd share this with the folks on the list who might be interested.
