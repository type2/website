Subject: Rear Swaybar question

Okay folks - got a strange question.

Some Vanagons came with factory swaybars front and rear.

I have heard that certain Type 2 vans (ambulances?) came with factory 
swaybars front and rear.

The Vanagons used the same bar up front and out back.

Did the Type 2 vans that had dual sway bars use the same sway bar front and 
rear?

Anyone got pics?

At first glance in my mind's eye it works - but so does perpetual motion 
machines - so I need some expert guidance from somebody that operates 
regularly in reality - none of this armchair engineering that I do so 
regularly (it's much cheaper than real engineering though). I have checked 
ETKA and found all the suspension diagrams but I did not find any reference 
to a rear sway bar.

I know the catalogs offer aftermarket swaybars front and rear but I am 
looking for a cheaper alternative than $300 of matched front and rear bars. 
In other words I'm looking for the junkyard solution.

A friend tells me he knows of a '78 locally which we might be allowed to 
get some parts off of and I am trying to get a list together of the 
knickknacks that I need.

Sway bar, sun visors, seat belt items, instrument panel clips, etc. etc. etc.
