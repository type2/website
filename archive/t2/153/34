Okay folks,

Last time I took my '81 Westfalia in to get the mixture set they hit me =
with a $300 estimate to fix some vacuum leaks.  They said they adjusted =
the mixture but it still had vacuum leaks.  So I went in and repaired =
the vacuum leaks myself.  Now I'm wanting to play with the mixture some =
myself.  I get around 12 mpg and suspect it's running rich (fixed =
manifold vacuum leaks =3D less air).  Any tips someone can suggest? =20

Thanks!
Chris
