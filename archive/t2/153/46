Ouestie arrived Sept. 4 by transport from Florida to Maryland, and has =
spent the last eight months undergoing rebuild and restoration. Today, =
with her temporary tags, she hit the open road for the first time.

I am pleased to report on her 14-mile maiden jaunt she ran smoothly, =
performed almost flawlessly (one unexplained stall at a stop light) and =
hit highway speeds of 64 mph.

I am as pleased and proud as a father watching his daughter at =
graduation.

Cheers all,

 John Rogers
