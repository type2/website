Subject: burned valve 2.0L/quandry

Hello there,
i'll try to be direct.
2.0L engine in 75 westy solid lifters.
burned valve (i think) no compression in one cylinder
 i pulled the engine followed muirs instrucions of
tearing down to have the heads redone or replaced. now
i'm calling around San franisco bay area to get
rebuild prices and hearing prices like 2k to 4k.
can't do that in this bus   not worth it

any suggestions

p.s. i have a line on a 71 transporter with a rebuilt
type 1 and good body for 750. am considering buying it
putting my camper top/interior/new tires/stereo on it
and dealing with less power and simpler mechanics.
