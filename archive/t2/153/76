Subject: Modern Brake Switch

I would like to install a modern brake switch that goes on at the very
moment the brake pedal is depressed. Has anyone else done this? What parts
were used and where was it mounted? Anybody got this up on a website? 

I've had too many close calls with the standard slow responding switch
mounted on the master cylinder. I figure a modern switch would give those
tailgaters another second of warning to start to react sooner.
