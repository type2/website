Subject: 73 Bus for parting out in Tustin Cal.

Tustin California

73 Bus for parts. It still has original trans,
dash, steering column, seats (including
the middle bench seat and of course
outside fixtures  such as windows,
lenses, headlights and such. I will take
$300.00 for entire thing. Again, it's
for parts only. This bus cannot be put back on the road.
