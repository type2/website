what year auto tranny,  vacuum or govenor shift, not really important in
this case.
   who rebuilt the tranny, I haven't found anyone competent to rebuild an
auto tranny for much less than $1,000.

get a real flat 13mm open end wrench, crawl under and with a large
screwdriver move the torque converter around and as each of the three
bolts that hold the torque con to the flexplate and tighten them down real
tightif they are loose

I can feel your pain, mine just started rattling in reverse, it could be a
number of things, have heard of em running like that for years but not
sure I would trust it very far

leak shouldn't be related but if it is a rear bearing maybe it has damaged
the rear seal.   is the oil temp the engine or tranny,  engine oil temp is
probably not relevant.

is it getting worse, only in certain gears, at certain speeds??

the rear seal can be easily put in wrong and it will leak.  Flexplates can
break if a bolt comes loose

not sure who in that area works on auto trannys... I remember when you
started the trip, I'm in Maryland...

  what I would do, and this is just my gut feeling,  I would find a
working auto tranny and stuff it in the back of the bus, make sure I had
the tools to change it, and go on with my trip, if it gets real bad or
break down I would find someone who could help me change it out...rarely
does a kaput auto tranny do any other damage,  most often it is the ATF
pump that goes out and then you can frequently nurse it along, sometimes
having to stop and let it cool down and go again it is slow going but you
can at least get off the road

Good luck
Bob
