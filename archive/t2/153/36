Subject: reverse lights stay on 

hi all - just returned from my trip to portland. it was the first time
beyond my wee 40 mile perimeter in the doublecab. not much of a trip report
vw-wise. the usual - generator light dim, bright with headlights, very
very bright with wipers/blinkers. hadn't noticed that before i left because
i hardly drive at night and if then never far at all. all elsewise was a
blast except i had to sleep in the back cab three nights on city streets.
talk about your two pound cheese in a one pound package...odd thing that
happened during the trip was my back up lights now stay on with ignition
on. any thoughts on where to begin hunting with that one?    - steve
