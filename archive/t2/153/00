Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

Engine removal is much easier if you insure that the trans/engine is
parallel to the direction that the jack will roll.  If I raise up the
rear of the bus (about 5",  I also raise up the front.  Otherwise you
will have to change the height of the jack as you roll it back (or
later, forward).  It's easier in an early bus- like my 71- I just
lowered the trans of the rear-raised bus until it was parallel to the
ground- made access to the upper engine mounts more tolerable as you
could see over the fan shroud then.
