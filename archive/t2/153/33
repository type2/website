Sandblast. Just tape up the other end of the vents so you dont  make a
mess. Then vacuum out the reast.

I need a solution to my problem of rust in the air intake vents.
I've thought of sandblasting (carefully) but others have thougth this a bad

idea (messy, mostly).
Someone also suggested putting a piece of sandpaper on a screwdriver and
attacking the problem that way.
This method seems rather masochistic.
Anyone have any ideas on how to get rid of that rust?

Thanks,
