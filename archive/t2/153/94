Hi Adam,

Good post, very informative.

But personally I can't see a deficiency in the original switch design.

Why is it a problem if the switch doesn't come on until pressure builds in
the master cylinder?? A bus isn't going to start to slow down until this
pressure builds. That's when the signal is needed.

The deficiency here is not in the design of the bus, it's with the driver of
the vehicle following. There are very few things one can do to a bus to
rectify the problem in someone else's vehicle. Sending an early and
potentially false signal is not going to smarten up a tailgater, it will
make things worse as they try to second-guess you.

Personally, I'd sooner rig a "James Bond" style oil sprayer to deter
tailgaiters than to modify my brake lighting system. YMMV.

Happy trails,
