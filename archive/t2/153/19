Hello,
Believe it or not, These little sliding doors are
suppose to have a duct to them from the vent slots at
the front of the doors. The duct was made into the
clear plastic covering that goes behind the door
pannel. These ducts get torn and become useless. The
bus I had didn't even have the plastic there any more.
I bought 2 good used doors and discovered these
plastic film ducts. Has anyone else had any experience
with these? I will probably just duct tape mine back
together when I eventually mend the doors. Any way
that is what I know about them.

Have a nice day!
