Subject: Re: [T2] Key buzzer?

Hope I'm not out of line for reposting this but I didn't get much of a
response. I found the wire going from the drivers door light switch to the
fuse box in the wiring diagram in Bently. It does indicate the socket is for
a Key buzzer. Still looking for part numbers, and availability. Does anyone
have a buzzer they don't want? Any clues are most appreciated.
