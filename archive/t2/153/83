I installed the $300. Sway-a-Way set in my van and learned a couple of
things. When I replaced the front bar (the stock bar was wimpy) there was a
huge improvement in handling. The handling improved from dangerous to pretty
good. A couple of weeks later I got around to installing the rear bar, with
little or no improvement in handling. I would find someplace that just sells
the front bar and replace that. By the way, Fisher's "How to Hotrod VW's"
states strongly not to install a heavy duty bar in the rear without
upgrading the front bar. The front bar is far more important, and Fisher
says that installing a rear bar only will cause the handling to be worse.
