You can synchronize them fairly well with no special tools - it's not 
difficult.

Here is my procedure:

Step A is to get both throttle stops adjusted equally.  Easiest way is to 
turn the screws outward until they no longer contact the throttle stop (all 
the way closed), then turn the screws inward equally about 1-2 turns.  The 
better way is to remove the carbs and adjust the throttle stops according 
to the position of the throttle plates vs. the small holes in the throttle 
bore (make them stop at the same relative position).

Step B is to gently activate the throttle linkage with your hand and make 
sure that both carburator throttles begin opening at *exactly* the same 
time.  Turn the adjustable rod on the right carburator linkage if 
necessary.  It may help a bit to have the engine running for this 
step.  Once this is done, slight application of the throttle should produce 
a smooth increase in engine rpm.  You will get "chugging" if the linkage is 
misadjusted at this point because two cylinders will be doing more work 
than the other two.

Step C is to adjust your idle speed if necessary.  I keep mine a bit high, 
around 1100rpm.

Step D is to pull each plug wire at the distributor, one at a time and note 
the decrease in engine RPM.  The decrease should be identical for each 
cylinder (assuming the engine is otherwise healthy).  This is more of a 
double-check.  If the decrease is different between cylinders 1&2 and 
cylinders 3&4, that's an indication that the throttle stops are not set 
correctly.  This can happen if your throttle shaft bores are worn, which 
will cause Step A above to not be accurate.  Open the stop on the carb 
associated with the weaker two cylinders (less rpm drop) until the rpm drop 
is equal, then redo steps B through D.

That's it!
