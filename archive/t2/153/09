Hi Greg,

It sounds like the castoring action of the wheels has not been set correctly, this is how much the contact point of the wheel with the ground is behind the pivot point of the wheel.
I'm sure a purusal of Bently manual will tell you how to set it. If that wrong then have a carefull check of the toe-in and camber too.

Good luck
