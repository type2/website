Subject: Subject: Modern Brake Switch

The way the witch works on 'modern' brakes:
The switch is a "on" when not depressed, "off" when pressed.
A little mounting bracket holds said switch against the pedal arm,
Which in modern vehicles is above the pedal, thus under the dash. (in a bus
situation, I figure you're gonna have to put it under the floor).
Push the pedal, the arm leaves the switch, lights "on".
It's a really simple circut.
Now, a warning, anything to do with messing with brake lights is dangerous
business. One trick we did with my dads race car is we wired in a warning
light on the dash that warned him when he was "riding" the brakes, but it
also meant he knew when the lights were on.
If I was re-wiring my brake lights, I would consider a small LED to do this
same function. I'd sleep better for sure...but that's just me.
