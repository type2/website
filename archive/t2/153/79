Chris,

Another alternative is to 'roll your own'.  Find someone with a stock 
one, measure it, buy yourself a suitable quantity of 'Stressproof®'* bar 
stock, fire up the torch and bend away.  I built a pair for a Datsun 
racecar I had years ago.  Cost about $50 complete.

*Stressproof® = ASTM A-311 Class B. Cold rolled, cold finished. A 
patented product of Latrobe Steel IIRC.
