Subject: z-beds

So while pondering (yes pondering, pinky) how I want to go about
putting a nice bed like horizonal surface in my pass bus, i started
wondering how exactly the z-bed connections actually work. Does anyone
have any good pics that would let me see how these things work. I'm
sure I could come up w/ something that works good, but why re-invent
the wheel, when I can just steal the basic design :) TIA.
