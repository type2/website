Subject: Stuck rings

You can do one of two things, and hope for the best----to lossen up the
rings--

Pull the plugs, and load up the cylinder's with Marvel, or the best bet
in this situation would be to load up the holes with Kroil--
Put the plugs back in , and let the stuff soak for 4---5 days.

Pull the plugs back out turn the engine over to blow out the oil--put em
back in and start it----

I know guy's that have loosen up frozen piston's with this
stuff----engine's that have been sitting for year's and a good Kroil
soking will free them up---
