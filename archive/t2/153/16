Subject: Gas tank straps???  71 Single cab

Hey Volks,
Got a question for ya... I have a 71 Single Cab and removed the gas tank to
replace (rust in the tank)  When I did both bolts broke that hold the tank
straps on.  What would be the easiest way to repair?  For those that don't
know the gas tank in a Single Cab is more forward than a bus tank.  It does
not look like I can drill all the way thru and just put a nut on it.  I
couldn't see the bottom due to the frame.  I am guessing I need to drill
this out and retap but would welcome any other suggestions...
Any ideas what size this would be so I can go ahead and get replacement
bolts?

And yes the tank is out completely so that I can drill. I didn't want to
risk a spark...  and go BOOM!!!

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
