Subject: Re: [T2] adjusting FI mixture

>Last time I took my '81 Westfalia in to get the mixture set they hit me with
a $300 estimate to fix some vacuum leaks.  They said they adjusted the mixture
but it still had vacuum leaks.  So I went in and repaired the vacuum leaks
myself.  Now I'm wanting to play with the mixture some myself.  I get around
12 mpg and suspect it's running rich (fixed manifold vacuum leaks = less air).
Any tips someone can suggest?

Adjusting the idle mixture will only affect idle. To only get 12 mpg, you have
either excess fuel 'leaking' into the engine, i.e. the cold start valve leaks
or the fuel pressure regulator is leaking and vacuum is drawing fuel in; or
the cylinder head temp sensor is telling the engine it is cold; or the fuel
pressure is way off; or the air cleaner is plugged etc. Bottom line: you will
need to spend time and do some diagnosis.
