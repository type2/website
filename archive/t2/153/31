Subject: Sandblast: Aye or Nay?

I need a solution to my problem of rust in the air intake vents.
I've thought of sandblasting (carefully) but others have thougth this a bad 
idea (messy, mostly).
Someone also suggested putting a piece of sandpaper on a screwdriver and 
attacking the problem that way.
This method seems rather masochistic.
Anyone have any ideas on how to get rid of that rust?

Thanks,
