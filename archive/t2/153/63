Subject: fuel line size

Good evening all,
    Sorry to bring this common question up, but my search of the archives
didn't turn much up. On a 71 what is the correct size to use, 10mm or
5/16ths? FI line is the best from what I have read, right? Also is just
plain rubber fine vs the cloth covered that I have on now.

Thanks,
Paul Saulsbury
71 Dormobile "Darma"
