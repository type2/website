Just a quick tip: in racing, many folks orient their gauges so that
the dial is pointing straight up (vertical) when operating at
normal temp, pressure etc., so they don't have to worry with
remembering the correct readings.

I don't have non-stock gauges in my VWs (yet)
so I don't know what kind of dancing around they do, so this may
not be too practical.
