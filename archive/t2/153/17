Subject: sunroof retracting

If your sunroof hangs up when retracting an you tried
to close it without success... sounds like the cable
jumped the guide. You have to remove the handle and
the
plastic cover. Inside you will see a gear that graqbs
the rings on the cable and moves it along. Carefully
pull the cable down out of the guide track and the
pull it along untill it is once again tight. reinsert
it into the track and re-establish the line up with
the gear  or sprocket... donno what it is supposed to
be called... put the cover back on. This plastic cover
is the only retainer for the cable. If the screw  that
holds it in place loosens up. your cable will
jump the track and disengage from the "sprocket".
If you pull the cover and your cable has gotten kinked
from trying to move it.... ure scr*wed.
  Your only hope then is that some kind soul has a
xtra
set lying around as was my case.. these are NLA to the
best of my knowledge. IF it is kinked and IF you cant
find a replacement... p-mail me and I can tell you how
to make it functional without the cable.

 This is aa PITA job but is doable. Really!
