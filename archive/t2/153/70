the real advantages of guages are to monitor trends, if you normally run
at 200F and suddenly you are running at 250F then you know there is a
problem...  on mine (78) I consider the outside temp and usually add
100-150degrees, I slow down to 55 or so at 235-240F and pull over and let
it idle in the shade at 250F

oil presure probably shouldn't get below 10psi at idle and 25-30 at speed


these are very subjective
