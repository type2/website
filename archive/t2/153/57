Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap easy bus front seat upholstry

I also replaced my seat padding cheap. I first used carpet padding to 
cover the springs on the bottom and seat back. I used hog rings to hold 
that on. I then took and cut some thick foam from the reupholster shop 
to fit on the back and bottom. It's pretty comfy for the price about
$25.00 I was able to reuse my orig seat covers though with some minor 
repair.

We bought a queen sized foam mattress cover for about $20.00 and some slip covers, then cut the foam to fit slit the sides of the old seats and stuffed the foam in. The slip covers went on, took a couple of hours and probably cost $40.00 all told and work beautifully.
