Well, the T-4 does make more torque, but the reaction torque is
transferred to the chassis via a downward force on the rear engine mount,
not a twisting moment.

I don't see much problem in making a structural disconnect on the rear
apron the could handle the incidental twisting load that would be present
there.

It would be a project, though, and probably not worth it unless you pull
the engine a lot.  I prefer to leave the engine in and drive!
