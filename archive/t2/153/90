Subject: Late Model Westy Table Leg 

Hello Listees,

I was wondering if anyone could tell me the dimensions of the table leg for
a '78 westy table leg. I have the table but it is missing the leg and the
plate that the leg attaches to. I was planning on getting the correct size
metal tubing and using a pipe bender make my own leg. I just cant see
spending $79.00 for the leg at Go Westy plus more $$$ for the silly little
plate it attaches to. Maybe someone can measure theirs and send me a photo
with the dimensions...
TIA.
