Hi Michael,

I agree with the folks who say that gauges are inaccurate and are better 
used to monitor trends.  However, it's tough to tell what "normal" is if 
you've never used gauges in your Bus.  I have a 1979 Westy with a new T4 
2.0L FI tuned for 5,000-ft altitude.  So, here's a breakdown of what I see 
at normal highway speeds:

Speedo: 65-70 mph (indicated, pretty accurate)
Tach: 3700-3900 rpm
Oil press: 35-40 psi
Oil temp: 210-230 deg
Volts: 13-13.5 V (daytime with radio, no lights or wipers)

Oil temp reads higher if I'm heading up a slight hill at speed, and oil 
pressure drops as temp rises.  I've also noticed an "overlap" effect where 
my oil temp will climb for a little while after I crest the hill and head 
down the other side.  Also, I've noticed higher oil temps if the outside 
temp is higher, lower temps if it's lower.  Humidity also plays a part, as 
its evaporative effect affects the cooling ability of the air.

While you're installing gauges, you may want to put a cheap thermometer 
outside your Bus where you can see it from the driver's seat.  I clipped 
mine to the antenna, and can see it great.  Something to think about...

Good luck!
