Subject: RE: [T2] Modern Brake Switch

Actually, your not very far off another thing that I'm planning on doing. I
plan to install a flashing third brake light.
I've come to realize that most people are now almost totally dependant on
seeing that third light to recognize that you're braking. I figure that if I
make it flash, its more likely to get their attention.

A randomizer that just flashes the brakes whenever would  keep the
tailgaters on their toes. :)
