I assume we are talking manual?  CG is just on the engine side of the where
the 2 meet (with exhaust, alternator and starter installed) for me.  Unhook
starter, remove tranny nose mount going to torsion bar housing, remove bolts
holding tranny to it's mount, remove axles.  Rest stays the same except it's
easier!  Once I get the nose of tranny behind the torsion bar housing I
lower it and roll it on out.  A few 2x4 under the heater boxes and I'm
happy.  Do jack the bus somewhat so I can leave my carb on.

Have fun!
Bill

With all this talk of engine & tranny removal, I've decided to
remove them both together the next time (relatively soon.)  I
assume this will change the center of gravity and thus jack
placement, correct?  How much should I adjust for?  Also, any and all
tips on what else to disconnect are appreciated, never removed
my tranny before.

Thanks,
