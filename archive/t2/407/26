Subject: hi roof at junk yard

hey all, before it gets crushed, their is a safare hi
roof in the ecology junk yard in willmington, ca.  you
can get the top for 88$ so if any of you feel like
doing this to your bus get it quick before it is
crushed.  it still has the headliner and the windows
but somebody got the vent in the top already.
