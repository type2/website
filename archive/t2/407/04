Subject: Swap workshop Manuals!

Hello,

I recently got an 86 VW Vanagon Syncro & I know nothing about it so I am
looking for a workshop manual.

I have a couple of manuals from previous cars to trade.  I have one Robert
Bentley VW Type 2 Station Wagon/Bus Official workshop manual (1968-1978)
-AND- one Haynes VW 1600 Beetle/Sports Bug/Super Beetle (1970-1974) workshop
manual.

I will swap both manuals for a manual that covers the 86 VW Vanagon Syncro
or I will sell the two manuals ($20 Bentley VW Van Type 2, $10 Haynes VW
Beetle +ship)

Thanks - HC
