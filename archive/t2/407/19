Hiya John,

Thanks for more information the on availability of the Hoover Sermons.  In 
actuality I have not had occassion to access them myself, but I was told by Bob 
that they were available in the Archives.

I agree with you 100% that it's "sad that more people can't enjoy them."  
There is much valuable information within the Sermons.  I just cannot condone the 
use of that material without the author's permission.
