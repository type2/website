chris,

you don't have to have the step. it helps the seal, but it isn't imperative.

lapping is imperative, it will make a big difference on how well they seal.
you need a thick (1/2" or better) piece of glass and some valve grinding
paste. lap each cylinder in a pool of paste on top on the glass until very
smooth, this will take maybe 15-30 minutes per.

then place the cylinder into the head with paste applied and lap the two
together. another 15 minutes or so.

mark the cylinders 1,2,3,4 so you know which is which. clean everything
really well before assembly.
