Subject: Shifter Stop Plate

Quick question for the list. Last night I took off the gear shift to grease
the ball. Long story short I cant remember which way the stop plate fit in
there. The pieces that are angled up on the stop plate one long one short
which side does it go i.e. long side on the driver side or is it the other way
long side on passenger side? Thanks for all your help. And I will pay a bit
more attention to detail when doing those 2am after work quick fixes.

Hopefully I will be piloting again!!
