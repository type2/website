Subject: Brake Servo Rebuild/H & R Auto Parts Rebuilders...

Hey, as suggested by fellow listmemebers, I got my spare brake booster 
rebuilt by H & R; It only took a total of 6 days (including mailing days) to 
get my servo back. It was all rusted up and they cleaned it and powder 
coated it and it looks brand new.

If anyone else has a bad booster I reccomend them getting the old one 
rebuilt, instead of paying 300+ to buy a new one.

Here's their contact info:
