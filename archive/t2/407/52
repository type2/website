Subject: Engine rebuilding questions

I'm converting the engine in my 70 Type 2 to a doghouse oil cooler. Seems I
need the flat metal piece that connects the thermo flaps in the fan housing.
I assume this piece is like the one on the 70 but has a "step" in it to go
around the oil cooler shroud. Is this part available or do I need to
fabricate one (or modify mine)?

TIA,
