You must take it apart, and measure things.

Because you have no idea of the condition of the parts used, and to what 
tolerances
they were fitted.  Just another "unknown rebuild"--may last 5,000 miles, 
may last 90,000.

If you rebuild it yourself, you will know *exactly* what you have, and what 
degree of care
was taken in it's assembly.  I will also increase the "bond" between you 
and your transportation.
