This is a bit of a stretch of my memory but what isn't these days.

Many of the original "Sermons" date to a time when there was not a 
type2 list. They were in fact posted to the Vanagon list. After 
type2.com was founded web space was devoted to "The Sermons ...." as 
a collection. The originals remained in the archives of Vanagon.com. 
Some newer material was in the type2.com archives. I do not know the 
break dates but Hoop might.  When the issue of intellectual property 
surfaced over a vanagon.com archives CD for sale Hoover stuff was 
stripped  from the archives of vanagon.com. The sermons remained 
around for a while but were taken off line at Bob's request around 
the time he left the type2 list. I am not sure but I think that was 
before the vintagebus split off  (no pun intended) from the type2 
list.

However, if you go to type2.com, select archives, select vanagon 
(these files apparently are resident on the type2 server) do a search 
for Grendel. You might be surprised.  I even found Bob's posts from 
the Inuvik run. For the savvy and industrious Bob's stuff is out 
there  and it is worth finding.
