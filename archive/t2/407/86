I don't know the severity of your problem, but if you just need to start
the car, plug up the hole in the intake manifold and also plug the hole
in the "S" tube.  Then, if you're having trouble starting the engine,
hold the throttle open a little when you start the car to let it warm
up.  That should get you by...

Otherwise, check any FLAPS because they might happen to have a similar
elbow.

HTH,
Mike
