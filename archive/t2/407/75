Subject: proposition for south florida/miami bus owners

Greetings
My girlfriend and I are getting married in Nov. (23rd, week of
Thanksgiving.) We are thinking about going to Key West, FL for a
honeymoon.We thought, it would be great if we could take the bus (we have a
71 westy) but the time to drive it down there would eat into our short
vacation too much (pretty much from 11-24 until 11-29 or 11-30. So we are
going to fly into Miami and drive to the Keys.

So does any bus owner in Miami area wish to rent their bus to us for the
week? It would have to be a camper, westy or other. As an alternative, we
could trade a week vacation in New Oreleans, stay in our place and borrow
our bus (it runs well...) I know its a long shot but thought I would try....
