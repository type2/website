no.

shim the base, lose the top sealing ring. it is a LEAKING ring. set the CR
as desired with a shim of the correct thickness, many sizes are available.

lap the cylinders into the head with valve grinding paste. do your heads
have a step in the chamber? this step cut is a good trick for cylinder
sealing.
