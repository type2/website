Scott:

I have a nice thick piece of plate glass I use as a flat surface, but I
wouldn't think lapping the cylinders on the glass would be a good idea; it
seems to me that the valve grinding paste would serve to also cut the glass,
destroying the flat surface.

When I lapped my cylinders recently I used a large piece of crocus cloth
taped to the flat surface and lapped the cylinders on that.  The Crocus
cloth is used for very fine metal finishing or precious stone polishing and
seemed to work well here.
