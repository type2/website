Mark,

I just installed the VDO  dipstick sender a few weeks ago.. One goes 
to the gauge and the other is grounded to whatever looks good. I ran 
the copper spade to the gauge the brass one is ground the screw on 
the heat riser tin. If that does not work for you then do the 
opposite. Help with wiring the gauge it on the VDO website but there 
is no info on the sender.

Thanks
