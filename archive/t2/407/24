Subject: More Deck Height Confusion

volks,

thanks for all the good advice, i now have a good understanding of how to
do all the calculations and whatnot. i have no trouble calculating my
sweep volume, but my deck volume is still eluding me. what exactly is the
deck height and how do i measure it.

thanks for all the help, rebuilding my motor properly would be impossible
without all you guys.
