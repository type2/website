The original build of the TypeIV engine had a paper gasket between the
cylinders and the crankcase and the head ship between the head and the
cylinder.  As you know, VW later changed that to eliminate the head shim and
substitute a metal spacer for the paper gasket between the cylinders and
crankcase.

The very, very safest thing to do is to cc the heads, measure the deck
height (no gasket or shim), do the calculation for compression ratio, and
shim between the cylinders and crankcase accordingly.

If you can't or don't want to do that then you'll have to take a chance and
put it back together with what you've got.  If you purchased a gasket kit
from the Bus Depot then the kit most likely has the "head" shims.  Since the
head shims and cylinder/crankcase shims are completely different sizes you
can quickly tell which you have by trying to insert one in the head.  (Even
though VW said to stop using head shims years ago any gasket kit I've bought
has had those shims included.)

Since you didn't have the heads machined you should be OK going this route,
assuming the CR was basically OK to begin with and that the new
pistons/cylinders don't materially affect your deck height.
