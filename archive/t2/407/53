Subject: 1700 engine

Hello,

I am currently trying to split the halves on a 1700 engine
and have removed all the bolts and tin and all but I cant get it to seperate.
I noticed this large allen key bolt on one side of the engine - do you need to
remove
this to seperate the halves?
Any info. is helpfull.

Thanks,
Darren
