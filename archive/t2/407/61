you are right, the glass does get slightly hollowed where you do the
lapping.

i think that when you consider the cylinder is always moving during the
process, the cumulative effect would still be a very flat surface on the
cylinder top, even it was running on a slightly hollow surface. the hollow
is probably 2 or 3 thousandths of an inch over an 8" by 8" area.

all i know is i have taken my engine apart there are no head leaks at all.
every one i've ever seen with the sealing rings in the head has had terrible
leaks.
