is this the one that is in a deep depression in the case?

be careful with that one, if you damage it the case could be junk - it is a
critical part of the case where oil flows from one side to the other.

what is the problem with it? it is an 8mm bolt with a 13mm head size, just
like all the others. you do need a deep socket or extension to get at it.
you cannot split the case without removing ALL the bolts, including of
course this one.
