Well the Notmeyer's arrived safe and sound on the island the other day
and after an afternoon of conversation, dinner, and of course checking out
one anothers buses we delivered them safely to their trailhead in Port
Renfrew.

Their intent being to hike the west coast trail from Port Renfrew to
Bamfield.
Today being friday I figured to just give a shout and wish them well.
The west coat trail being Vancouver islands answer to how to get rid of both
ships
and tourists had a different idea.

Get the call this evening that Rebecca has twisted an ankle and they've had
to turn back.
So tired, filthy  and hungry, they've returned to Port Renfrew where we'll
pick them back
up tomorrow morning. At least they report that the trail was great, what
they did get to see of
it. So give them a thought and prayer for their safety.
I'm sure Chuck will have a great travelogue to post when he returns home.
