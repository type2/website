I have no intention of picking at any of the stuff that has scabbed over
now, but this is really wrong:

The CD *was* PDF specifically because the only way to do it which would run
on (and be searchable in) Linux, MacOS and Windoze, it was distributed in
hybrid HFS/ISO9660 format so all three platforms could read it, and
furthermore it included Acrobat Reader installers for all three platforms.

Surely I have many sins to answer for and I will probably end up in Hell but
it won't be because I am not scrupulous WRT cross-platform issues. =^ )

Encrusted with inclusiveness,

Happy Friday,

Ps, no I am not sending anybody anything "off the record" so don't ask me.
