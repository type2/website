no.

that is an oil pressure device and it doesn't keep the case halves together.

make very very sure there are no fasteners still attached. is the case clean
enough on the outside to able to SEE all of the fasteners? if it is really
dirty, take a few minutes to clean it and you might see something that was
hidden by grime.

have you removed the fastener that would live under the flywheel? have you
got the one just under the oil breather tower?  is the oil pump removed?

once you can answer yes, take another close look around just to be sure, if
there is just one still tight, you will barely be able to budge the halves
apart. one way to get things moving is to use two hammers swinging opposite
to one another, gently tapping on the rear (of the bus) of the case, on the
fan shroud bosses.

you can also tap on the nut end of the case through bolts to free them up a
bit, as they are held into the case with plastic pieces which are a tight
fit in the case.

vwalley.com also make a nifty case splitting tool which goes in the oil pump
bore and expands.
