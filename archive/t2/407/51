Subject: oil temp dipstick wiring

The new to me bus has oil dipstick temp sensor...... with a temp gauge in
the dash....  It has two male spade connectors sticking out of the dipstick
for wire connections....  Where do these terminals get wired to?  Any help
would be appreciated.  I had no luck in the archives.
Thanks in advance.....
Mark
