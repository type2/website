I don't think this is entirely true. While some of Bob's sermons are still in
the type2 archives, the articles that are considered "The Sermons of Bob
Hoover" are for the most part, not there.

I believe that most of Bob's articles were removed from the type2 archive at
his request some time ago. Others that know more about this can correct me, but
for the most part there are only a few Hoover posts here and there left in the
archives. Example: I tried to re-discover the "Neighbors" post from Hoover, but
I must not have been using in-correct search words, 'cause I couldn't find it
recently even tho' I _know_ I've read it in the archives before. I might still
be in there, but I can't find it.

Bob Hoover is alive an well, and posts to the RAMVA newgroup often. Lots of
theads about the availibility of the "Sermons" have been posted there, since
"the sermons" were pulled from being sold. Bob has even responded to some of
the threads himself on occasion.

Here's a search for "veeduber"'s posts on googlegroups:

Use the advanced search to find specific posts or to look up the TULZ series.

I bought the "Sermons" when it was available, and I think it's sad that more
people can't enjoy them.
