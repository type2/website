hi mike - the problem isn't very severe, the boot on the aux air reg is
split like a bagel and i've been taping it up since this morning. with
that i loose power under a little load when then engine starts running too
hot. i think a lot of you guys out there with hesitation problems should
check this boot first, especially if its an aftermarket one. mine lasted
about 1000 miles. i'll not be caught w/o extras again. so, it starts up
fine, and i might make it to seattle if i can get a hose clamp on it in
the morning.

on the other hand, do you mean to say if i plug the aux reg vac line and
plug its mate on the big "s" hose off the afm, i'll do just as well as if
i had the little 90 degree ruber boot?   - steve
