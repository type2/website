It's not illegal at all.  It's a completely restored 19xx beetle.
Truckers have been doing the same thing for years, putting "floater kits"
(the entire truck except the frame) on 30-year-old frame rails to
avoid taxes.

Now, getting the insurance company to acknowledge its worth might be a
problem.  Perhaps it would be better to just drive defensively?
