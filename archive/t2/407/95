Subject: Ignition Points for '71-79

Ignition points are cheap.  But you should change them every  XXX miles.

I had a white plastic rubbing block BREAK on me a week ago Friday (of 
course, June 13, Friday the thirteenth!!) and I got stranded on I-495 
Washingto DC beltway on the way to work .


Just before this, I did have a set of OLD ignition points for over 40K 
miles, and I replaced them 'just because'..  They had the brown fiber 
rubbing block, the kind that actually wears but does not break.


And let me tell you, when it breaks, your are INSTANTLY dead in the water, 
coasting  at 60 mph, looking for a break-down shoulder..

Anyway, I cannot find these old stlye points.  Bosch 01011 are now made in 
Brazil with the white plastic rubbing block.

However, I did find a source that seems to have the old style rubbing block, 
and made in Taiwan.


I have to buy in bulk to get the points, either 100, 250 or 500.

I only want about 10, if they are any good, and I won't know that until 
after I buy them and try them out.  Changing points every 10k miles is my 
thought.

These points come 'loose', not in any box or anything like that.


If anyone is interested in trying the points with me, I would resell them to 
you at $10/10 + actual mailing costs.  (I will buy the envelopes...)

They are FEDITCO P/N 032, comperable to Bosch P/N 01011.

So, if you are interest, pmail me your interest so I know how much to 
one-time order.  I am going with 100 unless interest is overwhelming...

No, you don't get a lower price if I get the larger order, you just get a 
nicer envelope..

BTW, they may even have the Bosch indicia on them, if you are a stickler for 
the 'real thing'.  The same as the Beck-Arnley points
