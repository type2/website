Subject: Type IV case/oil drain over-tightening?

Howdy all. It's been a looooonnnnnggggg time since I owned a late bay, but
I've been searching for a camper that'll fit my budget for the last year or
two, and came across one locally. It's a 77-ish Westy with a fairly recent
engine rebuild, but the guy overtightened the bolt when changing the oil,
and snapped the little piece inside the case that it threads into. So will
that require a new case? Any way to fix it without tearing it all down and
splitting the case? Unfortunately having moved I'm back to working in a
gravel driveway, and with the new baby I don't have the time or money for a
complete tear down & rebuild.
So is it really that bad? I'm just wondering if I should just keep looking.
Thanks,
