Volks, 
15 years ago when I bought my first bus, I saw postings on the T2 list that warned buyers away from GEX engines. 15 years later, I'm still hearing horror stories. Sure, there are a couple of positive ones out there, but I haven't ever seen the same amount of complaints for any other engine company- Boston Bob, Bergman, etc... Sure, you pay a bit more up front, but it seems to me that after years of seeing people take the cheap road over and over and getting screwed over and over, paying a bit more up front is worth it. I've also learned this lesson from personal experience. 
The way I work on and treat my bus now is WAY different than I did 15 years ago when I was a teenager. 
Just my dos centavos.
