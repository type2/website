The FWD offset is the killer. You'll need fairly substantial spacers and 
you'll also need to bore the hubs out to 66 mm. Not for the faint hearted. 
Find yourself some Mercedes C220 wheels instead.  Drill the lug bolt holes 
up to 14 mm (9/16") and bolt them on.  You *may* need a 5/16" spacer on the 
front and you WILL need longer studs.
