I don"t think my bus came with this piece.  I have seen anything like it, and there aren't any holes in the top of the bus or the fiberglass roof where it was attached to at one time.  

I really don't want to put straps on the outside, but the strap from one B pillar to the other side would be a good temp fix.  

I guess my hinges are worn out.  I have heard that the 73 hinges are best, but is there a source for a set?

Thanks
