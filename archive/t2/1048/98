Subject: vanagon pressure regulator

Hi All, I am trying to fix my 1981 Vanagon westy with some parts that just
came from the Bus Depot. New fuel pump and pressure regulator. I have
misplaced my Bently manual and can't find it at the moment. The new pressure
regulators output has threads on it, so I am trying to visualize how it
attaches to the tin. Is there a nut on the backside? What is the best way to
get access to the back of the regulator?
Trying to get this fixed in the next few days so I can go camping friday
night.

Thank you all in advance for your kind help!
-Jeff
