hello todd,

i'd guess you have a problem with the brake booster and the vacuum
lines that connect it to the engine. i've seen brake boosters do some
crazy things when they go. there are a few components you should
check:

*first off, check that there is adequate vacuum pressure at the
booster, you'll need to disconnect the vacuum line at the booster to
check this.
*there is a one way check valve just after the engine on the way to
the brake booster. you should be a able to blow air through one side,
but not the other. ( how you want to do this is up to you). make sure
its installed in the correct orientation, they are usually marked.

if both those check out then the booster itself may be bad. there is a
seal between the booster and master cylinder, when it goes, brake
fluid leaks into the booster and pretty much ruins it. sometimes this
is evident by rust at the bottom of the booster....sometimes you can't
tell.

I would also bleed your brakes for good measure. Air in the lines can
cause what you describe.

If in doubt, bring the bus to a mechanic. Busses stop remarkably well
when the brakes are in good working order... better than most modern
SUVs...(Muir said better than sports cars, but i won't go that far).
you should be able to stop on a dime, if not something is wrong and
needs to be fixed asap. brakes aren't something to mess around with.

>      Just thought of another thing that I'd like to take care of. The brakes in my VW Bus are horrible. This is my first Bus, so I don't have enough experience with them to know if it's normal or not, but I really have to apply a TON of pressure in order to get the Bus to stop. Whenever I apply the brakes, I can hear the engine revving up a little bit (I assume this is because I am using engine vacuum for the brake booster).
