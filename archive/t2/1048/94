Subject: Engine Idle

Well, after an engine pull this weekend, I have replaced my generator and have
the charging problem fixed.  I've done a valve job and set the timing as well,
when I got the engine in and a nagging problem I had before is still there
too.

I have a 1971 Westfalia with a 1776 single port.  But I have an engine idling
problem.  I am thinking carberator problems but I wanted to poll the group to
see where the best advisable are to look first might be.  Here are the overall
symptoms:


-          Engine will not crank with electric choke engaged.  I have tried
several times to adjust the electric choke but as long as the choke is engaged
(flap closed) there doesn't seem to be enough air to crank.

-          With choke open, the engine starts right up.  From there, if you
are driving the engine runs just fine.  It even idled well by itself when I
checked the timing.

-          After driving, when I come to a stop the engine dies sometimes.  I
thought it might be a vacuum leak associated with the brakes causing the
problem but I have checked all lines, replaced the check valve, etc... with no
results.  Also, since the engine quiting problem can occur anytime you slow
down (not just using the breaks) and RPM decrease, I am thinking it isn't a
brake vacuum issue.  But, the engine does need to be in neutral for it to quit
(although not every time).

Is thinking carb the wrong direction?  Does anyone think a carb rebuilt (I
even already have the kit) would solve the problem?

I feel like I am just missing something really obvious and need you folks
help.

Peace,

Michael in Montevallo


PS - Thanks for the advice on the generator.  It really helped out.  All of
you are great!!
