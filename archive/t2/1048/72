The hard part is getting the reservoir off.  Make sure you buy a new 
inlet gasket (the one that was just talked about a few days ago that's 
available at the vw dealer), and get two new gaskets for where the 
reservoir nipples seat in the master cylinder.  It takes a LOT of force 
to remove the reservoir from the master cylinder.  The rest is pretty 
trivial.
