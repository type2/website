Subject: Re: [T2] ignition tumber on my 79 bus

Scott,

Replaced mine on my 76 (should be same) a year ago.  Most air cooled VW
locksets will fit, I have a Beetle one in mine because I tried to do what
you are doing and bought a complete "bus" housing off Ebay and got a bug
setup.  I swapped the cylinders (defeating both without drilling holes) and
it worked fine.

Not that it was easy, but can be done.  Somebody has a good photospread of
taking apart the late model bus housing on line.  I used that and the
Bentley.

Good luck,

Billy
M'boro TN
