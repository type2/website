Subject: ignition tumber on my 79 bus

BlankI recently became the proud owner of my 5th VW.
I have a 69 ghia, 74 Acapulco version thing, 76 Westy, 74 bug and now this
fairly nice 79 bus.  The problem I have is this was removed from a repossessed
house and it sat in a wrecking yard for over a year.  There is no ignition key
and someone has crudely tried to drill out the ignition key.  The tumbler is
gone but the outer shell (cylinder) of the ignition switch is still in the
steering lock housing.  I have an official service manual and they show where
to drill a 3 mm hole in the housing to release the cylinder.  This was not
effective.  Before going crazy drilling holes a I thought I would try this
avenue.
    The second question I have is this.  Does anyone out there have an extra
pair of upper and lower switch housing trim.  These are the black plastic
pieces that wrap around the ignition and column.  The dingleberry that tried
so unsuccessfully to drill out the ignition ripped the plastic trim off and
broke it.  Name your price?  If you have an extra switch with a key that would
be great also.
    This is a great avenue for VW nuts to chat.



Thanks, Scott


Continuing the journey in His grip!
