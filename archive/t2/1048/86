Sounds like a sticky starter solenoid. I had this problem on an old
Ford Tempo, would have to turn the key, jump out of the car, jump
underneath with a hammer or similar tool and start tapping on the
starter solenoid to make it stop. Replacing the starter solenoid fixed
the problem although the old solenoid was repairable by cleaning out
the years of gunk in it and then re-lubricating.

Good luck
