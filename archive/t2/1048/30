I have had good luck with paraffin (US style, the stuff your grandmas used
to can jelly with). Heat the area with a torch, apply the paraffin (area
needs to be hot enough to melt the paraffin, not much more). As the area
cools, the paraffin gets drawn into the threads. This works especially well
to prevent galling the threads, where a thin penetrating oil (WD, etc.) acts
more as a cutting oil.. I think it's the combination of heat and good
lubrication that is the key.

(Heh. I just read that again. I'm not changing it.)
