Subject: Key cylinders

O.K. A locksmith told me that it is possible to remove the ignition lock
cylinder from a 1974 bus (without pulling the steering wheel) by finding a
small pin hole that releases the cylinder (if you have the key which I do).
I've searched high and low and can't find the hole. Anyone ever removed the
ignition cylinder this way?
