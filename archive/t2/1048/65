Any lube you can get to the threads is good.

Don't try to remove them continuously.  Screw the plug in all the way,
bring it out until it binds, Screw it in all the way again, bring it out
to the previous point plus 1/8 turn, squirt on a little more penetrating
oil, repeat over and over again, backing it out an additional 1/8 turn
each time.  Chances are it will come out OK if you don't try to take too
much each time.

After it is out, use a thread chaser to clean the threads and put a small
amount of anti-sieze on the new plug.  I find that NGK plugs are the
easiest on head threads.
