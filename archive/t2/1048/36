Subject: Plug removal

I agree with previous posts about the virtues of Liquid Wrench vs 
WD-40.  Use liquid wrench to loosen up the corrosion or contaminants.  
I'd use the existing plug as a ream and work it in and out a couple 
times, gently.  I'm a little obsessive about cleaning those threads 
before I pull plugs, so I would use a contact cleaner to blast the 
debris away from the plug hole occasionally before finally removing the 
plug.

As for my own project, I did an engine swap to tide me over until I get 
a carb.  She runs, but I still have a lot of inventing to do before I 
have clutch and brake on the handlebars and shift lever.  Has anyone 
ever constructed a vacuum tank to help with a brake booster?  It is 
turning out to be a bit expensive for the master and slave cylinders 
with the tubing and such.  I am also replacing all the wiring.  Is there 
a common scheme for coloring replacement wire when stock colors are not 
available?
