Subject: 5 x 112 VW FWD wheels on post 71 bus

Hey all;
 
According to reference material on the interweb, bolt pattern on post 71
buses and Vanagons is 5 x 112, same as the B5 FWD VW/Audi products.  I've
seen these wheels adapted to Vanagons, has anyone tried it on a standard
bus?  I assume there are wheel offset and possibly hub diameter
issues/considerations.  
 
I have an 00 Passat and a number of 5 x 112 wheels of various types and
diameters, some of which might look interesting on my 75.  Just seeing if
anyone on here has tried it before I do.
 
thanks
 
Joe
