Subject: Re: [T2] How to remove a stripped oil drain plug

Hey Dummy!  Good answer - wrong question.  I guess I am the Dummy for 
not reading the question correctly.

Only last week I  encountered the problem with a rounded out  
transmission check plug in my recently acquired 71 Westy and  ......   
Oh, well. Sorry about that.

I've had the hand impact wrench for over 30 years and have used less 
than a dozen times.  One of the most recent was when getting the 
Phillips head screws out of the engine compartment hinges.  It's a good 
addition to your tool collection.  With this "new" bus I'm sure it will 
be needed for the door hinges also.
