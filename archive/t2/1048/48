hey  y'all
2 questions about the vacuum ports on a weber progressive. there's  2
ports a smaller and a larger, smaller above the larger.  I believe  the
smaller is output for vacuum advance on distributor, is the  larger
suitable to provide brake vacuum?  It has been several years  since i've
run one and i wanted to be sure.

work?  call or  e mail or PM  me    later  mark d
