Doesn't sound too good, they may have been overtightened when installed, so the damage might already be done.

Definately soak them in Kroil or some other penetrating oil.

If they come out, but with difficulty, you definately want to use anti-sieze when you install the new ones.  

Also you may have to decide whether to run a thread chaser in the holes to clean up the thread...if you don't do this, the next plugs you screw in might wreck the thread for good.  The downside is that you might (probably) will get some tiny metal shavings in the piston.  I would probably risk it...the head (and shavings) are aluminum, so they would be softer than the P&C's and rings. 

The textbook answer is to pull the heads and then chase the threads, or repair as necessary.

I read that I should try
some CRC/WD-40 spray to try and loosen them, but are there any other tricks or
suggestions that I should try? The engine is still out, so I have good access
to all four.
