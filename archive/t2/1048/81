Subject: Starter won't disengage AND continues to run when key is

71 Westy

Starter won't disengage AND continues to run when key is switched OFF 
and removed.  The only way to turn it off is to disconnect the battery.  
Well I guess I could have crawled under and disconnected the wires ;-(

I thought the problem was with the starter so I installed another 
starter.  No change.

I'm now thinking that it may be the ignition switch.  Later this weekend 
I'll have another chance to "play with it" but if anyone has other 
thoughts or suggestions I'd welcome them.

 From the wiring diagram it appears that I could disconnect the 
Red-black wire at the downstream side of the T5 connector and connect it 
to a temporary switch, the other side of the switch picking up current 
with a new wire connected to the Red wire also in the T5 connector.  ???

Thanks,
Pat
