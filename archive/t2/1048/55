A torch ?  Sounds like you'll need to get the hot dogs and hamburgers 
for a barbeque. ;-)

Excuse me - back on track now.  I did have a problem with my bus and I 
purchased a 17mm hex bit socket (later to find a 4 piece set at a much 
lower price at one of the auto parts chains).  I already had a hand held 
impact wrench - the type that you hit with a big hammer and it 
(hopefully) moves whatever is stuck.  The combination of forcing the bit 
in and applying torque at the same time got it moving with just a couple 
of hits.   You can also make your own hex bit sockets by cutting a 
regular Allen wrench and mounting a short piece it in a regular socket.

Google for    hand impact wrench  or hex bit socket    to see an example 
of these.
