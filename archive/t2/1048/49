Subject: Re: [T2] GEX ponderings

You should pull both heads and replace or repair them.

Hopefully your bottom end is in good shape, but check the end play 
while you have it out.  The condition of the heads may explain your 
issues, but if they don't, you may have to dig deeper.

My GEX engine is still running well after having the heads redone by a 
local shop.  This is all from over 10 years ago, and I don't want to 
rehash it all again.  I think the bottom line is you get what you pay 
for.  GEX at the time was very reasonable and offered a good warranty.  
I even checked a few references and all seemed good.  This was back in 
the early days of the internet, so I didn't have the resources that are 
available today.
