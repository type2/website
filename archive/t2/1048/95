It was explained this way:

The typical VW changes hands about once every year or two.  This fits the
GEX longevity perfectly because someone will get a VW, put a rebuilt GEX
into it, spend a year cussing at it and trying to get it to run decently,
then finally put it up for sale in disgust.  Someone else buys it and
repeats the process.
