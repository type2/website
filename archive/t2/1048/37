Subject: QC with fuel pumps

OK, technically this isn't a problem specific to my Bus, but it could
be...  I have a 1600 in my Beetle and now twice in 8 months the pin in
the fuel pump has worked its way out the back of the body of the fuel
pump (towards the front of the car) and left me stranded.  I'm talking
about the pin that the tappet and spring assembly internal to the pump
rest upon - it just slid out on 2 separate pumps.  I got both of these
at NAPA - not sure what the brand is, but they're packaged in a NAPA
box.  The last time I brought it in for replacement, the guy there said
he's seen this frequently.  Has anyone else had this problem with a pump
in their 1600?  Is any brand better than the next?

-John
