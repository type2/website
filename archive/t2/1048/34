Subject: Voltage Regulator Location.

This may sound pretty stupid, but bear with me, this is my first
rebuild.



I am rewiring (95%) my 72 T2.  I have replaced the harness from the
engine to the front dash area. I am ready to wire in the Generator and
voltage regulator, but cannot find it.  At the end of 4 hours of wiring
in the Texas sun (105deg).  I did not crawl under the van to look, I am
looking in the engine compartment where the book says it is located
behing the air cleaner.  I suspect the air cleaner the refer to is the
small box on the roof of the engine compartment with a copper tube
running to it (disconnected).  Picture in the book was not clear and I
was tired, so I though I would ask before I got home tonight.



Also is it necessary for the "air cleaner" to be connected?  It looks
like a muffler of sorts or carbon bed exchanger.  I think I saw it in
the book while looking for something else one time.
