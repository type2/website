Subject: Stuck Spark Plugs

Over the weekend I had the engine out of a Type 2, 1976 kombi, and I managed
to get one out of the four spark plugs out. The other three, I could loosen,
however during the unscrewing process, they got tighter the further they came
out. I stopped, cautious of stripping the threads. I read that I should try
some CRC/WD-40 spray to try and loosen them, but are there any other tricks or
suggestions that I should try? The engine is still out, so I have good access
to all four.
