Subject: weber progressive vacuum ports

hey y'all
2 questions about the vacuum ports on a weber progressive. there's 2
ports a smaller and a larger, smaller above the larger.  I believe the
smaller is output for vacuum advance on distributor, is the larger
suitable to provide brake vacuum?  It has been several years since i've
run one and i wanted to be sure.
