I posted a while back about my bus not starting after it was running well. Just to give a quick idea of the original post...

Bus ran great. Twice it was shut off after running for a little bit and nothing would happen when you turned the key. After a bit it would start and run fine. After I drove it about 120 miles back to my house and let it sit for a couple weeks... it became real testy. I changed the cap, rotor, condensor, plugs, wires, and air filter. 

Today, I put on a new coil because it stopped getting spark past there. After a bit of time today I was able to get it started and idling great. If I pushed the gas down, it was very responsive and it sounded good. After a bit of idling (about 5-8 minutes), it died. When I went to start it again, it would only keep running if I had the gas to the floor and kept it there. Then, it also sounded rough.

If I had the cap on the distributor, and had the number one plug on the bottom right, then clockwise it should be 1,4,3,2 correct? I am also wondering if the plugs could be fouled or something. After starting it a few times, I held the gas down and it would, what I would call, backfiring, out of the carbs. Like a fireball or something. One after like 6-10 seconds of holding the gas down. Could it just be a matter of adjusting the carbs? I have dual webbers on a 1600cc motor. 

Any help appreciated. Hopefully I explained it well enough.

Thanks in advance,
