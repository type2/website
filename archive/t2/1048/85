Mark -

If connected incorrectly as you suggest would it have ever functioned 
correctly?  - I've had the bus for only a few months and until this 
incident it "appeared" to be functioning normally.  I'll admit that I 
could have connected them incorrectly since I merely connected the wires 
to the new starter just as the old ones had been connected.

Thanks,
Pat
