based on the teardown of my GEX some years ago I would not expect to
get away with anything less than. a complete ring job and new heads.
more likely need pistons and cyl too.
  and if they replaced bearings it was a crap shoot as to weather they
were the right size.

save your nickels and the head ache and get a Boston Engine or
Seattle Connecting rod engine, unless you really really really are
that broke and/or you just want to do the work yourself.

FWIW, I don't think Boston Bob will even take a GEX case as a core
anymore.
