	Perhaps youse younger grooovers can relate to  my failure to 
recognise most of the music you mention.  We are talking generation 
gap here  ...
	I may not have mentioned previously that, on the first 
evening heading down the coast from Vancouver to begin studying at 
Berkeley in the fall of '64 (almost beats name-dropping eh?) the 
young Canadian couple I'd brought to share costs had to ask me to 
stop singing the Dave Dudley hit 'Six Days on the Road'.  Actually my 
36 hp '57 bus did the thousand miles well inside 6 d, without missing 
a beat.
	Please rehearse 'Six Days on the Road' in key of A for a 
future BusFest ...    It has a moronic charm, and musical crudity, 
that appeals to musical simpletons like me.  But we'll ease in a B 
chord (at 'logbook') ...
