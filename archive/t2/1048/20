Subject: RE: [T2] 5 x 112 VW FWD wheels on post 71 bus

Thanks for the info, guys.

Are the spacers behind the wheels needed to clear the body through
suspension travel or allow full turning without interference on the inside?

I was going off one of the links from ratwell.com
(tyresave.co.uk/fitment.html) that shows Passat and Transporter as 5 x 112
with offset 35...40 and c/bore of 57.   As with a lot of things, what is
posted and written varies from place to place, I've seen the 6x mm bore
dimension somewhere too.  I guess the thing to do is pull a few wheels and
use verniers to measure hubs and bores and see how it shakes out.  I've got
15" passat steelies with snows for the B5 I could try as well as the 17"
Charleston alloys but the Charlestons don't have tires so measuring inner
and outer clearance will be difficult.  I imagine 17's would eliminate the
body roll but probably shake my fillings out, especially if I ever lower it
a little which might happen eventually.  

I work for a German machine company so we have a lot of machine shops that
do work for us, I imagine I could find someone to open up the bores for me
pretty accurately. Are the type 2 wheels lug or hub centric?

The alloy wheels are significantly thicker.  When I put the Merc wheels on
my Vanagon, I needed 50 mm long bolts on the front and 55 mm long studs in
the rear. Of maybe it was vice-versa.  But yeah, longer both front and rear.
