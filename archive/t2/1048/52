Hey Paul,

Mine is screwed to the right side of the firewall (behind which is the fuel 
tank) right next to the round cover that provides access to the fuel filler 
tube.

Which book? My Bentley manual says, "The regulator is mounted in the engine 
compartment, next to the battery."

That's the charcoal canister, which filters out fuel tank and crank case 
fumes. The air cleaner is the large black plastic assembly that sits on top 
of the engine and connects to the two carburetors, if you have a dual-carb 
engine.

It probably long dead and isn't filtering anymore anyway, but when connected 
correctly, it vents all the fumes back into the air cleaner so they can be 
burned. I had mine disconnected for a time but the smell of oil from the 
crankcase was so strong I couldn't sleep in the back...I reconnected it 
again.
