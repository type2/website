1..  did you put the correct fuel pump on it, the 79 is fuel injected
and needs 35PSI to operate correctly those pumps are $$$$$$

well bad starter sound like part of it, did you hit the right two
terminals??

???? the important relay is the double relay on the firewall in the
engine compartment.  don't know what relay would click under the dash.
unless someone put a hard start relay there, which sort of defeats the

first thing is get the starter motor to engage.
and CHANGE THE FUEL LINES!!!  all of them
get fire ext too.


good luck
