Subject: Does anyone else have this set up? - Timing

Hey Volks,

I just got the new motor put into my '74 and am still playing with the 
timing.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has this same set up and what 
you use for timing.


2.0ltr Hydro Valve (mine is engine code GE)
Single carb (dual barrel)  single vacuum port
SVDA distributor with Pertronix electronic ignition

I set the valves to 1.5 turns in after contact as per Richard Atwell's 
suggestions. 

Right now, I cannot seem to find a good place on the timing scale that 
works for this set up.  I am still experimenting but would appreciate 
some input.  What do you suggest?  BTDC?  ATDC?  Vacuum hose on or off?

Thanks
Andrew
