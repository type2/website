Richard asked:
 I need some help with my 69 westy top coming up in the front when driving. It
hold tight in the middle and doesn't come up in the back. I have new seals all
the way around.  It comes up about 2 inches in the front only. Please any
ideas welcome!

Very common problem when the front hinges are shot and worn out. Read these
