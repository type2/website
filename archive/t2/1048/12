Subject: Brake line grommet / seal

Ok you bayers out there...

You know that little rubber grommet / seal (usually part # 211611833C) that
fits in the plastic tube from the remote brake fluid reservoir to the master
cylinder...  Mine, like most, is all eat up and brake fluid is leaking.  Well,
many of our VW supply folks list them but I haven't found one in stock yet.

What are you folks on the list doing about this leaky spot?

I thought about replacing the line but with what?  I fabricated a rubber piece
but the brake fluid (of course) ate it up.

Suggestion?

Peace,

Michael in Montevallo
