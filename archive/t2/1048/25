Subject: Re: [T2] Does anyone else have this set up? - Timing

I would suggest 7.5 BTDC with the vacuum hose connected.  Make sure you 
have the vacuum hose connected to the port on the venturi of the carb 
which sees no vacuum at idle and some vacuum at part throttle.  Do not 
connect the hose to a port on the intake manifold.  If you are unsure, 
check the timing at idle with the hose on and off.  There should be no 
difference in the reading.
