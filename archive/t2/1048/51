Last year a few people commented that they wished it was earlier in the
season, as it can get a bit chilly at night here in late October.  I'd hate
to make it even later this year. 

I just spoke to the park ranger and they have the whole campground "loop"
that we used last time, available for Saturday October 4.  I'm thinking that
will be the best choice. I'll also reserve a handful of sites for Friday
October 3 for those who want to spend two nights.  

Anyone have a good reason NOT to choose this date? Also, it would help if
anyone who would like to stay BOTH nights emails me, so I can make sure to
reserve enough sites for Friday the 3rd.
