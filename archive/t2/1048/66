You may have a solid core, if you got lucky on the parts that GEX decided
to toss together.  You won't know until it comes apart, since a lot of the
"solidness" depends upon how small the journals have been machined,
condition of the main bearing saddles, etc.

I managed to get 40K miles out of a GEX "rebuild" in a carefully-driven
and well-maintained bug.  It finally lost compression in two cylinders
and ceased to idle.  I didn't even bother to take it apart, replacing it
with a new Mexican engine.
