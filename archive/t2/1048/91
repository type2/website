Subject: 79 auto trans bus with the anchor out.

I got back from the Hospital today to a friend in the driveway... and it was
as it appeared.. he was brokedown... or at least had an issue that needed
attended to.

The question we never did solve....  what could  make a bus run fine... then
drag.. or slow down as if the anchor was out.

Also.. from his report.. it was running very good.. he was able to reach
highway speed without effort.. and it started to hesitate..  and even now,,
it still won't get to highway speed without pushing the pedal hard.. and
waiting a while.

Could it be the engine... could it be the auto trans ?

Here is what I found.
1976 , 2 liter ,solid lifter, Efi , 009 Dist. timing set at 24 deg BTDC at
idle, 47 deg dwell, no vac to decel, recently calibrated injectors

he said,, running great,, very low miles on rebuilt engine.. then it started
to hesitate. somewhat like poor fuel delivery..

Vacuum is steady... fuel pressure corresponds to the vac... ie.. high vac..
low fuel pressure.. and visa-versa.  28-34 psi...

I changed out the 009 ,, I installed a SVDA connected to throttle body
port.. and set it at 7.5 deg BTDC.. with 48 deg dwell.   dist body said
0231-168-005  021-905-205P

No change .. still poor performance

I changed out the ignition coil

No change .. still poor performance

I added in the Decel valve vac connection from the air dist port as well as
the Fuel pressure regulator so all working

No change .. still poor performance

Valves are slightly loose.. I did not adjust them...

I noticed a injector seal on the engine tin.. uh-oh.. I pulled the injectors
to be sure they all had seals.. all good.

recap.. I have good fuel pressure.. good spark,, good valve train and with
steady good vac readings..
Could the trans be failing.. ???  fluid levels in the trans are within
spec..

did I miss anything..  something I did sound off to you....  ???

Thanks
