Subject: exhausting isn't it?

Hey again everyone!

Are there any dangers associated with running my motor without exhaust 
attached to it for a little while.  I'd like to warm it up, get the oil 
thoroughly circulated and generally be sure this is the motor I'm using 
before I take it to a machine shop for exhaust stud extraction.

Thanks,
Brad
