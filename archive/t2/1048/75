Subject: Another bus possibly taken from our roster

Hi,

Well she hasn't been sent to the crusher yet but my bus took a major
hit yesterday that may put her out of commission permanently.

I was turning into the parking lot at my office and was rear ended by
a driver at 35mph who apparently sneezed at an inconvienent moment.The
damage to both cars seems non-trivial. The bus engine still ran
afterwards but the muffler is now about 1" wide, the mustache bar
appears warped, all the body panels in the back (right rear corner,
left rear corner, apron, engine bay hatch, rear hatch, etc) have
suffered major damage. All the rear lights are smashed out and the
metal damage seems to have continued as far forward as both rear wheel
wells. The sliding door only opens about halfway. I couldn't open the
engine bay hatch due to the fact that there's other metal folded over
blocking so I still don't have any idea how my engine really fared..
well I hope - there's less than 4K miles on a full top end rebuild.

My back was slightly tweaked during the incident, I went to the
hospital to get checked out and the xrays show I didn't break
anything, but I'm in some moderated pain. Still, I should be OK in a
few days.

Considering how hard I got hit, and how much damage the other car took
I'm pretty amazed how well the bus held up.

Has anyone faced similar damage and repaired it? Any rough idea how
much money I'm looking at to get this all repaired?

Anyone know of any nice buses available in the Northeast as I am
currently without a vehicle?

peace
