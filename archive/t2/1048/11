Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV case/oil drain over-tightening?

I've been searching on Samba, and found this picture:

I'm pretty sure that tapped boss in the case is what broke off - he said he
had a small chunk that he pulled out.
Clearly that would need to have the case split and welded to fix.
:(
But as Bob mentioned, with a filter, do you need to open that cover? Would
the oil pickup tube stay in place if one were to say use JB weld or
something similarly ghetto to seal that plate, and therefore the pickup tube
in place? Honestly I barely have time to change the oil in my daily driver,
much less pull an engine for that kinda involved, serious project. Other
than that, the bus is in good running order, recently had a rebuild, etc.
The shop that he just paid a bunch of money to do all that quoted him $1800
just to fix it, and he's now done with it...needs money...and selling for
what would be an affordable price if I could fix it without getting heavily
into it...
