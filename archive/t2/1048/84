What's the name of the shop, Mike?

Did you notice any unusual increase in power after the first time they
worked on it? Possibly they advanced the timing too far, or there may be
some other problem with the distributor. If the airbox isn't up to spec, the
mixture could be off causing the engine to run too lean. Lots of
possibilities here, but it sounds like you have indeed overheated the
engine.

When you say "no spark," did you actually check for spark by removing the
coil wire and checking for spark while turning the engine over? If there is
truely no spark, that's an entirely different issue and could be a
relatively minor problem.
