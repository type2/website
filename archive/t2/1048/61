Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Flying 69 poptop

The hook and catch you are referring to started in 8/69 for the 1970 model yr.
He has a 1969.
I have pics of it here: http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/225010.jpg

The old Westfalia part numbers were 231 069 784A and 231 069 787 and 231 069
786A.
But they have been NLA for a loooong time.

Although I owned a 71 Westy when it was new I never realized that it had a
"securing" mechanism in the middle of the front edge of the pop-up top until I
bought one a few months ago.  It's hard to see - when the top is up you must
almost have to put you head under the top to see it - two metal pieces , one
affixed to the fiberglass top and another affixed to the roof of the vehicle.
Each is bent in such a manner that as the top is lowered it should slide into
these pieces;  the rivets for one show through the front edge of the
fiberglass top.I can't get to mine today to  take a picture but here is a
general idea; the first is the top in the up and unsecured position|() (    )
|    |-----------------------------------------------this would be the top
down and in the secured position||(()) | |The shape of each spring is somewhat
of an "S" and as the top is lowered correctly the tension in each "S" is quite
strong and pulls the top down "securely".I discoverer this when I couldn't get
the top to go down as well as it did before I put it up. What happened was
that the springs had ridden just past the correct stopping point when I erect
the top and they were "fighting each other".  A long wooden dowel  pushed
against one of the springs allowed the springs to correctly engage when the
top was then lowered.
. It hold tight in the middle and doesn't come up in the back. ........up
about 2 inches in the front only.
