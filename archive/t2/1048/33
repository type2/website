The fact that you were able to get the plug out a little is good.  Even 
with the use of something such as Kroil, you should consider alternately 
tightening and loosening but not too much of either.  Just work it back 
and forth hope to get a little more release each time.  Bear in mind 
that I'm recommending finesse and not just force.
