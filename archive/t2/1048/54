Subject: How to remove a stripped oil drain plug

My friend has a saab that has a stripped oi drain plug.  Its an aluminum case so I figured that dealing with the problem is probably similar to the bus...

He tried using vice grips but I guess it was just too stripped.  I was gonna go check it out tomorrow and was thinking about applying heat with a torch but I just wanted to check first if that was safe.  Any input appreciated!.

Thanks!
Mike
