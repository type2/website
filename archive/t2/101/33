Subject: Upgrade! (buy my '91 Vanagon)

Hey Volks,
	Tired of freezing in the winter and roasting in the summer? 
Tired of being in the slow lane? Tired of having to turn your radio 
all the way up just to hear it over the road noise?
Why not upgrade to a Vanagon? Don't get me wrong, I love my '74 
Westy, but my wife was a different story... She liked it, but she 
wanted more comfort, more heat, a/c, automatic transmission, larger 
motor, plusher interior, decent stereo, etc...
So that's what I did. Now she falls in love with the Eurovans, and I 
need to sell my Vanagon.
Power windows, power locks, power steering, power mirrors, power 
brakes, automatic tranny, cd player, rear window wiper, front and 
rear heaters, a/c. IT ALL WORKS GREAT! It's got the Weekender 
interior (fold down back seat, pop out table, rear facing jump seats) 
that seats 7 comfortably and also works well for a camping trip.
The engine has 150K on it, but is running strong. The heads were 
replaced by VW at about 100K, and DO NOT LEAK. I just put on a new 
S&S exhaust and many other new parts.
The biggest problem is that a back corner was hit by a car. The pics show all.
Check out my ad and pics on   thesamba.com
To find it, go to the search engine in the classifieds section and 
type in my email address.
I'm asking 5,500 or best offer.

Joel
