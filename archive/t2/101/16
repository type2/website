The ghia is all new, paint, motor, etc. The 70 Crew cab is all original, paint, motor, etc. The body is cherry, no dents, no rust (desert T2), motor runs strong.....just everything is 1970, its a true cream puff. Should I? Any thoughts on the 1970 crew model? How are parts availability for this model?
