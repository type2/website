Subject: Re:Pulling engine without autotrans attached

Courtney
I  have r&r'd the engine from the tranny many times...couple things...
As mentioned by Bob, be VERY careful for the oil pump shaft that is in the 
middle of the transmission and goes into the engine...if you  bend it, you 
are shafted...pull the engine out as straight from the tranny as 
possible...it's not attached to anything so it will just slide back into the 
tranny.
Also, definately replace the torque converter seal...it's just good practice 
every time you r&r the engine. In Bob's list, it was unclear to me on what he 
said about where to place the seal...in my experiance, I have found that you 
do not push the seal onto the trans shaft all the way back...I did this once, 
and it leaked a big red puddle when I fired her up...had to pull the engine 
again to reset the seal...what works is to slide the seal on the transmission 
shaft till its just on and let the torque converter seat itself to the seal 
when the engine is slid into the tranny...
Good Luck &
Aloha
