Subject: Re: [T2] Listee stickers

Andrew,
there was talk of this on the vintagebus list and the problems that arose in previous ventures.

I am proposing this....Since a good bit of our oversea listees are in Austrailia.  We can wait for a total number of stickers requested from your neck of the woods and the I can mail all of them to you or another listee for distribution.  I think this would be much easier than individually mailing out single stickers.

Any comments...suggestions are welcome...
