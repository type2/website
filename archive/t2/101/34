Subject: More vac from a prog?

List,
Prehaps i am exposing a lack of knowledge in the pneumatics area, but her=
e
goes anyway...
74 Bus is solid lift 1800/009/prog carb/std.

Word on the street is that a progressive carb (like the Weber we find on =
many
late busses) does not pull enough vacuum to actuate the canister on the s=
tock
distributor of a type4 engine. If i am mistaken here,  someone please adv=
ise
me; "No, clark. The progressive pulls more than enough vacuum to actuate =
the
canister on the stock type4 distributor." or something to that effect and=
 i'll
send you a beer - virtual of course.

The one i'm running has one little throttle body vac nipple on it which i=
s of
course, plugged.  If i drilled this port out slightly, will it pull more
vacuum? Do i need to?

If i pull enough through this port, then i can just tee off the brake boo=
ster
line for the retard and at least get away from the 009 hesitation issue.

TIA,


Clark Gordon
Morehead, ky.
