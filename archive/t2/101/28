Hi Beto,
Got a suggestion.
I'll go down to the local Post Office & see if I can
get postage stamps that will work when you send the
letter from your end.
If possible I'll post the applicable details on the
list for other Aussies to follow up.
Otherwise, I guess I'll just have to be patient :-)
Cheers
