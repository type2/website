I've been having problems with my brake lights blowing a fuse periodically
for the last year on my 76 westy.  I've looked and looked.  The PO put in
an under-dash button switch for the horn and re-wired the circuit.  I know
there are some original wires (-at-) the horn itself that are loose and
disconnected.  Maybe even some under dash.  I guess that could account for
the periodic blown fuse, (hit a bump, make contact, pow!)  I'll have to
check to see if the wires are hot.  I'll get back to y'all.
