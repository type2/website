Jamie,

No prob for the t4 in your bus if you go to aircooledtechnology.com

I've been drooling over Jake's t4-t1 conversions with the "gold" looking
kevlar type sheet metal.  I can't imagine how expensive it is, but it
looks waaaaay cool.

It's like art work instead of an engine.....

trying not to drool, dave
