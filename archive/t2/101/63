Hey, great site, thanks for putting that out there. It was nice to see =
what the interior is supposed to look like. I recently purchased a '77 =
Westy that had the stove, sink, and fridge removed (and they're WAY long =
gone). Are the 77 and 78 Westy interiors the same or did they change =
slightly between the two years? How about '79? I know someone who has an =
entire '79 (beds and all) interior for sale and was contemplating buying =
it.

Thanks,

Alex Vieira

This site has the Camper supplement for a 1978.  Check out page 24 for a =

picture of the table.  I just got lucky too and another VW owner I met =

Key West, FL, gave me the table for free, he recently had picked up in a =

Junk Yard.
