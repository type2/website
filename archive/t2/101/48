Clark,

The throttle body or intake manifold vacuum port creates vacuum for the
retard or distributor side of the canister and yes is surely enough to do
the trick. The ventury or carb neck port creates the advance vacuum or
outside canister port vacuum. i.e. when your foot is on the gas the carb is
sucking gas from the jet like made. When you let off the engine is still
trying to pull fuel but you because your foot is not on the gas the carb is
shut down hence much vacuum in the intake manifold. This is also another
good reason for the brake booster vacuum to be ported here.

I do not own a vacuum gauge.  I have somehow squeaked by without making that
investment.

So, the question stands:  does the progressive throttle body vacuum port
*allow the engine* to pull enough vacuum pressure to actuate the diaphragm
in
a stock (74-75 bus) dual vac distributor?

TIA,
