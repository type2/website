Richard,

I bought 2 1/4" (58mm) "gas filler hose" from the local NAPA store.
None of the other flaps carried that size.


I have pictures for my gas tank write-up.  It is fairly expensive as you
*have* to buy a foot($21.00).  It does work.  I need to go back and pull
mine and take a picture of how I cut it to fit even better since it does
not bend very well.  

It really doesn't need to bend too much though.  It also has wire
reinforcement inside of it.  You cut it with a very sharp knife and then
clip the wires and clean the excess up on a grinder.

Cheers, dave
