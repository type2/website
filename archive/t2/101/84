==============================>
Hella kit - 12 VDC 30 ampere relay.
Pin 86 (Yellow) - Ground
Pin 87 (Black) - Terminal 50 on Starter
Pin 85 (Blue) - Ignition switch (Connect to wire you removed from terminal 
50 on Starter)
Pin 30 (Fused Red) - To a constant 12 VDC, either off of the Voltage 
Regulator which is the same as right off of the battery, or off of the main 
voltage feed to the starter (Starter terminal 30)

I mounted my relay assembly under the oil bath air cleaner, on the oil bath 
air cleaner stand, using a long screw with some rubber spacers to act as 
shock mounts for the assembly.
