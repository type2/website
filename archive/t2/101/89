Subject: Fuel Filler hose


I searched the archives and I was wondering if there have been any updates
on the extinct fuel filler hose (211-201-125D) that connects the tank to the
filler neck on late bay models?

It seems there are a few options and I'm looking for leads:

- make/find a substitute piece

- hunt down one from VW for a lot of money if you can find it -- anyone have
a dealer number that carried one they bought?

- wait for the repro that is in the works -- when?

- use the Vanagon part and cut it to spec -- What's the part number?
