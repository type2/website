Subject: gauge mounting

    I have decided what gauges I am going to install  and decided on 
three to protect my new engine.
I am going to purchase a head temp and oil pressure first. Later on I'll 
add oil temp. So I want to plan
on provisions for three. I am not really sure where I want to mount them 
yet. Where are yours mounted and how do you like them there?
