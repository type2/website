Subject: Dual port manifold notched/bridged?

I'm in the process of breaking down my dual port 1600 (71 bus) engine and I
noticed that each manifold has had a notch cut between the ports right where
the manifold attaches to the head, effectively bridging the two air
channels. What is the purpose of this? Is it good? Bad? No biggie? Thanks
for any advice.
