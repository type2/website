I agree, that's why the mixture adjustment procedure specifies to disconnect
the sensor first.

As I understand the way these narrow band O2 sensors work, they are only
good at telling you if you are lean, stoich or rich. With these inputs the
ECU can only make fine adjustments to the mixture which again is why the
mixture is set in the first place without them connected. The ECU doesn't
change the fuel pressure or the intake air volume so it can only slightly
vary the pulse duration.

Billy, first remember where the current position of the idle mixture screw
is and count the turns. Second the engine has to be hot for the O2 sensor
activate because it's a low cost 1-wire model with no on-board heater.

With the ECU disconnected from the O2 sensor and the VOM attached instead
adjust the screw until you read 1/2 volt. If nothing else is wrong you
should be produce a normal volume of CO.

That engine with the O2 sensor is designed to run leaner than some earlier
models.  All the lambda explanations are in the Probst book.

That book is great but there are no model particulars so you don't know what
voltages correspond to your O2 sensor's lambda values: they vary from sensor
to sensor. These are rough values:

0.90 volts at lambda = 0.94
0.50 volts at lambda = 1.00
0.05 volts at lambda = 1.07

If you've already got one strike against you in the system, I recommend
going to a shop to get proof you'll pass the second time.
