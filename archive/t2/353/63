Subject: More Everybus Parts FS

I have the following parts available for sale at
Everybus. I will only bring these parts if someone
confirms in advance that they want them, otherwise I
won't bother with packing them.

The first list is from a 79 sunroof bus:
* 2 rear side sliding windows, $15 each.
* Rear Bumper, surface rust but otherwise good with
mounting brackets, $20.
* Brake Booster\MC\Brake pedal linkage, I'm pretty
sure the booster is good and the MC is bad, $5 for
rusty assembly.
* Steering wheel in EXCELLENT condition,$20.
*Ignition switch with key in housing, $20.
*Rear interior grab handles that run along the bottom
of the roof line, $3 each.
*Front door interior panels with plastic heater
channels, the drivers side is in pretty good shape,
the passenger side has some water damage in the bottom
rear corner. the plastic heat channels are great on
both sides, $15 each or $25 for the pair
*Complete set of seat belts including 2 front shoulder
straps, and the little plastic hooks that they hang on
when not in use, $20.
*Gear stick assembly, including stock black knob
(everything above the floor), $10.

This next list is from a 72 Bus:
* Rear hatch glass with defrost coils, $5
* Rear bench seat, black, and mildewy with a few rips,
good frame, $20
* Air Filter assembly in good shape, $10

Here's a couple of bug bits:
* 1966 (67-68??) & earlier glove box latch in good
condtion, $5
* License Plate light housing, $5

Let me know if you want anything, I will also consider
trades for 71 bus parts

Peace, John Baker
