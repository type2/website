Hey Doyt,

Well, I went to the test with it heated up at freeway speed....

79cal engine has no EGR.

See above.

Okay,

>a new oxygen sensor (just to be sure), a tank of 
>oxygenated fuel, 

I'm getting a new 02 sensor, and I filled up with high octane before the test.

>and a fresh catalytic converter if the hydrocarbons are 
>showing up high.

I passed closely on HC, my cat's about 2 years old.

>I wonder if you have an operating thermostat running your cooling >air flaps? I wonder if your engine HAS flaps at all?

Flaps are wired open (110F around here in summer)
No thermostat.

Okay, 10% alchohol, rubbing variety? Isoproply?

Doesn't taste good in the groundwater.

I've run STP injector cleaner recently, just for the heck of it.

Did that too.

Mine is welded in, and I don't weld.

>Remember, if you can find a fuel source that has an "10% alcohol >added" label on the pump, load up with it when your tank is close >to empty, and run it for a few days before and during the test.

Won't find that in California, have to do it myself.

I followed Richard's saga closely as well and printed out most of what you just copied me with.

It's a little different with my 79cal engine and having to deal with the dyno test as well.

thanks for taking the time to post, every piece of info
is appreciated.
