could help blow away the mozzies that sneak into the bus each night. 
Does an oscillating type of 12v fan exist?

Check out the fans from either computers/electronic equipment,
some are 12V. I have a pair mounted on my dash to demist the 
top of the windshield (sorta...). If you're tall like me, you'll under-
stand the view thru the top of the windshield...
