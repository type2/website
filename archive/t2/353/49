Subject: Items For Sale (-at-) Everybus

Hey Folks,
     Since I'm no longer a Bay window owner, I find myself with a few left
over items I need to get rid of. I will bring these to Everybus to sell. Here
goes:

3 Mahle oil filters, fit '72-'83, $4.00 each

Complete tail light assembly (2), incl. seal but not lens, fits
'73-'79, $15.00 each  PN 211 945 231

Rubber gasket for fuel filler neck (fits between fuel filler neck and body)
fits '72-79(?), new,never used $20.00

Known good air flow meter, fits '76-'77, used to be my spare that I carried.
Best offer.

Please pmail me if you want any of these items, as I don't want to bring this
stuff if there is no interest, which I kind of doubt. I'm sure I'll find more
stuff which I'll post later. Thanks,    Jeff
