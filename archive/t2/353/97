Subject: electronic ignition??

Fellow listees,

Was talking to my mechanic Sam tonight and he said it would be a good idea 
to install an eltronic ignition in my bus (1600 Single). He said that then 
you don't have to worry about the points or timing anymore.

Is this true? Has anyone done this? Am i missing out on something good for 
my bus?

Please fill me in on this mystery.

Thanks in advance of course!!
