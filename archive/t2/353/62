Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Rear Engine T1-->T2 Mount Adapter 

By reputation, they cause oil leaks. They are a plate that replaces the oil
pump cover plate. It provides the 3 mounting holes for the moustache bar.
Apparently the studs were never meant to hold that much pressure and torque
and eventually work loose. I suppose it is a way to use an otherwise
unusable earlier Bug Engine, but like most compromises...
