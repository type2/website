We did have a discussion about this maybe last summer. (archive check)
I think the oversize pulley did not fit without some tin modification.
I think the pulley I have, which is darn close to 7" dia is as big as you
could run without modes because there is just enough clearance to get the
belt on/off.
I suspect its the largest stock size.
Also the porsche pulley seems to be excellent (just overpriced)
My ration went from 1.6 to 2.2 and as soon as I get a warm day (we are
having an unseasonal cool spell) maybe at the endo of the week Ill know
for sure. I think my temps will be in the 15-20 deg cooler range.

I originally had a stock large lower pulley and stock gen pulley and a
905mm belt also stock.
This was getting me 1.6:1 ratio. So in this case I think stock sucked.
I had tried a smaller belt last summer 9.5x900 but the belt seemed to get
too much abuse running low in the pulley like it was.
With the new setup and an 875mm belt it rides high up in the porsche
pulley and used around half of the shims. This makes me and the
belt happier.
