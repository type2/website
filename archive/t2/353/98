 Looks like I need to replace the shock mounts that hold the fuel pump,
tho' this pic is not correct for my '79...

-------------------------------------------------------------------

You need the VW EKTA CD. That is where those pics came from.
The part number(s) for those mounts are:
211 261 325C  til the end of 1976 model year.
113 142 355B  from the beginning of 1977 model year.

You can also use the air cleaner supports for Mercedes diesel engines, 77-85. Available from your local MB
dealer. I can supply a part number tomorrow if anyone wants it.
