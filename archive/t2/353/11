Subject: Re: [T2] 12 volt fan for sleeping area?

Hola Paul-
Enjoy Panama! Aieeee!
Most small-medium yachts rely on 12v for domestic use, so there are lots of
fans available from any marine supply, including oscillating versions. When
we were headed to the tropics, however, I removed our regular fans and
installed several 4" computer fans. Try an electronics store, or one of
those fun South American Radio Shacks . They are 12v, dirt cheap, much more
quiet (can you hear yours running now?), and  more efficient (0.3amps). I
soldered on a small switch, and made various simple mounting brackets
(including a simple swivel) from small bits of brass angle. I have also seen
fans simply bungeed in place with a long cord so that they can be moved
wherever you want. The flat black colour is also less visually obtrusive in
a small space.
Have a cervesa for us!
Cheers,
Matthew
