Subject: wiring help???

 I just installed a new wiring harness for my 71 single cab and am having
problems getting the brake lights to work.

I have installed new taillights from Old Volks of Arizona.  They use a
double filament bulb and only have one bulb each.

I have looked over the Bentley (with color) and the wiring diagrams to the
taillights leave much to be desired.  I guessed and got taillights but no
brake lights or reverse at all.

This is how I wired it.:
Passenger side
Red wire from light to a single black with red stripe wire
Green Wire from light to a triple wire:
                            A double white with red
                            A Single white with black
Brown to ground
a brown wire with a very small male connector from wiring harness goes to
???

Drivers side:
Green wire from light to a double white with black stripe wire in wiring
harness
Red Wire from light to a black with yellow wire
Brown to ground
On this side I have a white with black that I don't know where it goes and a
brown wire with a very small male connector both from wiring harness

I have nothing hooked up to my reverse lights as I couldn't figure out which
to hook up.

Any help???Please?? If I get tail lights at least I can drive her again :)
