Subject: Bentley Manual vs. VW Factory manual

Karl mentioned (I think it was Karl) that the Bentley manual is a copy of 
the VW factory manual and Bentley left some of the factory manual out.

Could somebody figure out what was left out and get this scanned. I can 
host the pages. If somebody will send me good pictures I can convert it all 
to PDF and / or do the OCR work on it.

I have long relied on Muir's book for the layman's description of repairs. 
I have outgrown that book - by that I mean I know most everything that book 
has to offer - but I do rely heavily on the Bentley for specs and 
procedures. I'd like to have the most complete information I can get.
