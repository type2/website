Subject: Fan for sleeping area

 I have a couple of small fans I bought from a Marine supply
store...brand name Caframo.  Cost about $35 ea.  They have hard rubber
blades and no protective cage and come with a very effective suction cup
as well as a mounting plate to be attached with screws. They are
supplied with a plug that goes into a cigarette lighter or power point
outlet. Much quieter than the usual oscillating fans with  the hard
plastic blades and the wire cage.  Caframo.
