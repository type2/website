Has anyone tried out Biral Heads for their type-1?

I saw them after looking at Jake Raby's page and link to lneng's Nickies:

I'm curious about how they perform, although I really don't want to go any 
bigger bore than stock, so the likelyhood of me purchasing them is...well, 
low.  I guess if I heard some really convincing success stories from the 
"Pros", I might be more inclined though.

Anyone?

Bueller?
