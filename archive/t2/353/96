No, you don't need to remove the tin before dropping the engine.  Drop it as
one piece except for a few things (dip stick, AFM and air intake elbow) that
will give you clearance.

Elbow grease and your favorite degreaser are a good combination.  If you've
got a large garage sink you can wash many pieces of tin in hot water and
soap, though you'll be amazed how tenacious the dirt/oil combination can be,
especially in the corners.  I'm not a big fan of "spray-on/hose-off" stuff
since it tends to make a mess below the vehicle and ultimately ends up in
the groundwater/rivers/oceans.
