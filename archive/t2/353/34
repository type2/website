Subject: FAILED CA SMOG

Yes, I finally did it, or didn't. PLEASE indulge me and read thru this, I'll be brief:

"THE SMOG TEST FAILED DUE TO:"

1. "High emissions"

(-at-)15mph/2058 RPM:
%co2 = 10.50
%o2 = 1.34
%co = 5.62 (1.66 max)
HC(PPM) 196 (204 max)
NO(PPM = 727 (1534 max)

(-at-)25mph/2012 RPM:
%co2 = 10.68
%o2 = 1.48
%co = 5.39 (1.46 max)
HC(PPM) 165 (169 max)
NO(PPM) 670 (2591 max)

2. Thermostatic air cleaner missing

I understand per Karl, that these were never installed on buses, but I looked in the "mitchell" book with the guy, and they are shown.

3. EGR missing.

I have a 79cal engine which did not come with EGR, I will bring this up to the referee this week.

4. Fuel cap failed vacuum.

New locking type, will get old screw on type

5. o2 sensor present, not required

Another 79 addition

My main question is how to get the CO down, the other stuff is referee mayhem I'll have to fight over.

I have new W8CC plugs, 1 year old bosch wires, VW factory electronic ignition. Timing is set to 5 degrees after.

Your responses are very much appreciated,

Billy
