 dirt roads in state parks

sounds like a good reason to _not_ spend the extra dough on
all terrain tires.

 I like the idea of the higher load 
range, but the "highway" designation worries
 me as well as comments I've 
heard about poor performance on wet roads...<<

just curious as to where you heard that? i have had 2
sets of these tires & they are very good in the rain.

does it snow much where you live? if so, you'll probably
want to avoid the Yoko 356. it is not made for snow.

also, the all-terrain tires might make alot of noise on 
the highway, but i can't tell you for sure since i've
never had a set. i'm sure someone else can comment.

good luck,
