Apparently the studs were never meant to hold that much pressure and torque

and eventually work loose. I suppose it is a way to use an otherwise

My ol' 71 had a bug engine with that adaptor...It works, but I got to checkin'
the nuts on the studs (I used loc-tite when I mounted it, even...) on a weekly
basis...Lasted about three years, as did the used engine...YMMV
