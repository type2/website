There should be a nylon strap with a buckle connected
your westy stool, this strap hooks through this clip
in the picture to create a baby-sized little bed with
the jump seat and the stool making up the top surface
of the bed.  I have a picture of this in my Westy
Manual, I see if I can get it scanned and post it.
