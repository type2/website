Billy,

It looks to me like the oxygen sensor might be bad, resulting in a rich
mixture. If you disconnect the sensor on a properly tuned '79 CA bus, your
CO will go to about 6%, which is close to your numbers. The rest of your
numbers look pretty good.

Have you any idea how long it has been since the O2 sensor was replaced?
