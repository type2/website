Help! 
I'm in the middle of my first rebuild, trying to do everything right. Two
days ago, I painted the new jugs, just as Mr. Hoover suggests .... except
today, I realize that I used the GLOSS Rustoleum, not the FLAT I was
supposed to.

Is this a big deal? How much should I worry? Should I try to strip the old
stuff off and try again.?

Thanks, any advice appreciated.
