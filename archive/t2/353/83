I think he means www.gowesty.com. Page 36 of their 2002 catalog had VW dealer mudflaps but they haven't had them for a long time and aren't listed on the website anymore. They are working on their own for 68-79 busses. They may have the front ones available in a months time. The rears, I don't know.
