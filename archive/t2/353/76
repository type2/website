A new one...

- An ergonomically designed shift knob (for people with hands as
"ergonomically" sized as my own!  Might have my son help with making a knob
more suited to smaller hands.)

I got tired of shifting without a knob on the shaft.  G had a 50 lb. chrome
skull on the shaft and it was making the shifter a deadly weapon in turns...
