Check around the archives - something about solid mounting the engine to a 
steel bar and the resulting vibrations leading to problems - oil leaks, 
crack or loose hardware later (?).

The factory versions are rubber mounted I believe between the engine and 
the steel bar. I know this is true with the T-IV engines, dunno for sure 
about the T-I engines.
