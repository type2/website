Subject: Re: [T2] shocks

hi scott,

installing shocks is no real problem:
jack up the bus, remove wheel.
place something stable under the axle (jackstand, piece of wood, etc.). be
sure to have enough room
to access the bolts. let the bus go down a bit, so that the weight of your
bus is compressing
the shock a bit (makes it easier to remove the bolts).
remove bolts, install new shock, tourque as specified in your favorite
manual. (pretty tight, if i remember right)
jack up again, reinstall wheel, your done.
