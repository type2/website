Also, the fan(s) could help blow away the mozzies that sneak into the bus each night. Does an oscillating type of 12v fan exist?

Sure, I think I bought mine at Wal Mart.  That doesn't help you much though, since I don't think there are many Wally Worlds in Central America... right?  Maybe I'm wrong about that.  Anyway, I would follow the truck drivers.  Truckers love those fans and you will therefore find them in every truck stop or large filling station on the highway, even (especially?) in Central America, I would guess.

Computer fans are fairly efficient and also cheap, but they are not oscillating.
