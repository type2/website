Subject: 12 volt fan for sleeping area?

I'm now in northern Honduras touring Central America where it is 
friggin hot, humid, and buggy every night.  We are on our way to 
Panama in our '72 westy.

Can someone recommend a nice 12 volt fan (or pair of fans) that could 
be mounted/clipped to the ceiling to cool my wife and I as we sleep 
(on the fold out bed, not the cot)  Opening the louvered windows and 
rear hatch (with screen) doesn't cool us enough.  Also, the fan(s) 
could help blow away the mozzies that sneak into the bus each night. 
Does an oscillating type of 12v fan exist?

I have a second battery with a battery separator so I'm not too 
concerned if the fan(s) suck a lot of power, although the more 
efficient the fan(s) the better.

PS, hello to everyone we met as BBB in January!  So far the only 
trouble we've had was a plugged fuel filter due to crappy gas. 
Thanks to Ronnie in Havasu for suggesting we carry a spare fuel 
filter!
