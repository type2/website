I've been going through a similar issue with an '84 Vanagon so I took it to a
local VW shop that has enough of the right kind of equipment to tell me what my
issues are. In my case, all parts are there and operation within specs so they
grabbed their infrared gismo and pointed it at the front and rear of the cat. It
showed that the temperature difference between the front and rear was either too
great or too little (I forget which) indicating that the cat is clogged. As
muffler shops around here aren't open on Saturdays I was unable to proceed any
further in proving or disproving their analysis but should have something to
report in the next day or two. Can anyone confirm whether this test is standard
industry practice or not?

P.S. Never (at least in CA) get a smog test straight off the bat. Ask for a
pre-test to determine if you will pass. It costs a few dollars extra but you
save yourself the extended grief of having your vehicle labeled by the state as
being a polluter with the required contortions involved after the fact. It may
turn out that you have to do all the same stuff to pass, or maybe not, but if
you end up having to go to the smog referee you can bet that you won't get any
help proving your case because he's a government employee who is paid to keep
your gross polluter off the streets. The last time I had to navigate this
government maze was with my Type 3 Ghia just before the smog laws were changed
to make it exempt. I had to baby-sit the referee to make sure he didn't type it
in as a Type 1 Ghia and disqualify me for having stock dual carbs.
