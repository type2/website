Yeah - noticed they had a 4" speaker that I need for my motorcycle 
(replacement) for $10 each when NAPA had the same size for $20. WOW - Radio

Lot's of great prices on speakers too. Some less than $5 even and still 
pretty good. I've done business with them with excellent results. Just wish 
they had the 4" speaker I need right now...
