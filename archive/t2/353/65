Richard, Larry, Tom, and others who replied, thanks for your posts
they've been very helpful.

I guess I should:

1. Get a new bosch 02 sensor installed
2. Meter the single 02 wire to ground looking for 0.5V
3. Adjust the mixture screw, making note of its current setting, to
   achieve the 0.5V
4. Check my VIN against the DMV records
5. Go to the ref for the engine swap sticker, et al.
6. Go to a VW shop and have the test done unofficially to make sure
   I pass.
7. Go for retest.

Que no?
