Subject: Bus accident

I heard back from the insurance company they are staying the bus is a total loss.
They've offered $2,920, Plus another ~$200 in taxes (I didn't understand the taxes bit)
for a total payout of $3,249. 
 
I told them I was expecting a bit large value since they are totaling the vehicle,
Something in the range of $4,500-$5,000. 
 
So I brought up the NADA value and there answer was they don't use that source,
they use AutoSource. At this point the agent I was speaking with said they would do a 
"market analysis" of comparable buses and get back to me.
 
This morning I received a voice mail from the agent stating they were now offering 
a total payout of $3,510. This still seems low to me and I don't think they are 
taking into account the rebuilt engine so I'm going to bring this up again...
 
Would sending in classified ads from The Samba and eBay help at this time?
 
Also how does buying the bus back from them work? Would it have a salvage title?
