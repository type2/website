Subject: Stalling ... Carb problem with 1977 1600

I've got a problem with our bus ..

The old original carb was leaking slightly .. so I replaces the carb with a
new Bocar one .. I had to modify it slightly to make it fit (because of the
alternator) ...

It's fine when setup and the weather is ok .. but the second it get's even
slightly cold the car will almost not idle .. doesn't matter where I put the
bypass screw .. it will stall even when changeing gear ..

What can I do ?
