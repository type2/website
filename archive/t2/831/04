Subject: Re: [T2] What torque setting for CV Joints?? 33 or 25 ft lbs

I torqued mine to 28 ft. lbs.  I'd like to hear what Karl has to say on this 
too.

Karl, I looked at that card, and it says . . . constant vel. joint: 4.5 mkg

I have been torquing my CV joints to 25 ft lbs... Am I wrong in this
instance??
