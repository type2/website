They will, in part, base their valuation on _actual_ sale prices, not 
advertised prices. They won't look at advertised prices even if you 
provide them. ebay may help if you can pull down final sales bids, 
especially if they're in your region. Sale prices are very hard to 
establish for older vehicles since they are almost always a cash sale 
and the buyer and seller are the only two who know how much money 
actually changed hands, what with sales tax and all.

If you have receipts from a recent major repair to the van, like an 
engine rebuild or a paint job, they will take that into consideration. 
Small minor repairs are considered maintenance and do not affect the 
value, except as they cumulatively present a vehicle that is in above 
average condition. Wait until they give you their best price, then 
spring the receipts from the rebuild on them. For example, when I was 
told I'd get $3200 for my totaled van, I presented all the receipts for 
the past five years, including $3500 for an engine rebuild and related 
work from about 15,000 miles previous. They then offered me $4500, about 
$250 more than I had in the van. Can you say win-win?

Probably depends on the state. In my case, they 'sold me the van back' 
for something like $65. I kept the title, it never changed hands, and 
was unblemished. And I got to keep that 15000 mile engine.

You are at an advantage if you're not in a hurry and have other 
transportation. Keep after them, but don't seem anxious.
Good luck!
