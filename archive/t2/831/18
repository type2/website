 Wash it.
 
Super clean and simple green are good degreasers.   ya, avoid spraying water inside the engine.   Duct tape is your friend for sealing off ports.   Clean in between the fins.

Hey Y'all,
I've got the 1500 SP engine out of my wife's ride in
order to do a front oil seal replacement. While I've
got the engine out, I tore down all the tin and am
going to pressure wash it and paint it. Here's my
question:  The longblock is pretty grimy, dirty,
messy.  I am tempted to hit it with the pressure
washer, would anyone recommend AGAINST doing this???.
