I hear where you're coming from.  But I don't  have the right set up at home to do that kind of work.  And I hear  it's a PITA to get the engine loose from the transmission laying on  your back on a creeper.  Wouldn't think twice about it with a  lift.  And it would be very detrimental to my vocabulary .  Maybe I'm just lazy.  No, I am definitely lazy.  Cheers....KR

As a general rule, Kevin, it's good practice to move beyond the mindset 
that anything-is-preferable-to-dropping-the-engine. I know what that 
mindset feels like, but it's amazing how much faster you can get at 
dropping the engine and putting it back in with practice. Yes, it's 
more difficult with the later buses, but doing it without bellyaching 
(that's a self-reference) frees you up to enjoy your bus to a greater 
degree.
