Take the bottom bolt out, pop the arm from the bracket. Wrap one 
layer of electrical tape around the stem, cutting it where it crosses 
it's self. It will try to go cockeyed due to the conical nature of 
the stem, but I just used two pieces. I then remounted them in the 
stems and that helped quite a bit. I have to loosen them a little to 
get them adjust, which is fine by me. I used teflon tape on the 
threads into the body, for the same reason.

I have the el-cheapos. One it a total rust bucket. But on the other I 
rubbed it down with 0000 steel wool and painted it with duplicolor 
clear wheel paint. It is still holding up very well, at least 3 years 
later. But it isn't "chrome" shiny, more of a matte stainless look.
