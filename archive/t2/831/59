<<I heard back from the insurance company they are staying the bus is a
total loss. They've offered $2,920, Plus another ~$200 in taxes (I
didn't understand the taxes bit) for a total payout of $3,249.>>

<<This morning I received a voice mail from the agent stating they were
now offering a total payout of $3,510.>>

Alex,

The insurance adjuster is hanging the hook  and hope you take the bait.

He wanta outa this deal ASAP, and is throwing offer's at you.

If you have the time and patience do this.

Have you been to court yet?
I assume the young lady that smacked you got a ticket.

Do show up in court, do thell the judge that her insurance refuses to
pay a resonable sum.

The youg lady will et wacked by the judge for whatever she got citated
for.

This is good.

Now thell the insurance co, that your hiring a lawyer to get this ironed
out---be nice , but firm.

They will settle with you for a more resonable price if you can have a
loophole contact the insurance adjuster, or company themselves.

Rather than drag this out in litigation 9 times outa 10 they will pop up
with the cash.
If they don't hammer them with the legal fee's too, besides the Buses
damage.

This is what I would do.

Good Luck,
