Subject: Re: [T2] Lurch has done it again - diagnosis

Something's not right here.

My diagnosis is broken crank.

I can get the pulley to wiggle back and forth (axial direction) about 8 
mm (I'm trying to get the damn thing off).  I can move it in the radial 
direction about 1 mm.  At the same time, the flywheel is stock still 
(flywheel lock is installed).  Something tells me they should move as 
one.
