Subject: Interior Panels

Hey guys,

       I've just finished painting the inside of my Bus and I'm looking to get new interior panels. There seems to be a lot of options from the various vendors. Can anyone tell me what the inside interior panels typically looked like for a 1973 Volkswagen Deluxe Bus (I think it's a deluxe??). 

Also, did they ever make arm rests for the front doors? I found some door panels in the junkyard that I was using temporarily. They happened to have side air vents attached to them which I guess brought the air to the back. (Those holes where the vents usually go are covered up on my Bus, I guess it didn't come with that option). In any case, those seemed to work as arm rests, but I was just curious if there was a correct door panel for my year that had real arm rests? If anyone has any pictures, I'd appreciate it.

My bus is blue with a white top, white bumpers, and white wheels, so I'm looking for something that matches that color scheme.

Oh! One other thing... I saw that the Bus Depot sells the curtain rods which I plan to get. Does anyone know if any vendors also sell curtain kits with the pre-sewn fabric?




Thanks!!!
