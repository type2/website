Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender - bend the arm

If you find out let me know, mine registers 3/4 full when full. I suspect
the sender arm is bent so that it is not accurately giving the picture in
the tank. That means when mine reads empty it will probably have a lot of
gas left in it. Since mine has already had the cut under the back mat in my
westy, I am going to take the sender out this summer and bend the arm so
that it reads on reserve just as I get a gallon of fuel left.

Courtney



Hey guys.  My guage is working 1/2 way again  so I've postponed changing the
sender in the tank.  But in  searching the archives, I found info on how to
do it, or why I don't  want to do it myself, ha.  But I didn't find anything
that tells  exactly what happens with these things.  I've probably owned 30+
 cars in my short lifetime and I've never had a problem where the guage
reads 1/2 full when it's full.  What's different about VW's design  that
makes this happen?  But then curiosity killed the cat.   Cheers....KR
