Ah could be Don. Sometimes the resistor board on the sender is even broken,
some of the little wires worn through. I will see what I find this summer.
In the meanwhile, it's a mileage thing. BTW what mileage do people see in
everyday around town driving? I'm getting 21mpg to the Canadian gallon,
which is 1/5 bigger.

Mine used to register 3/4 when full. When I pulled the tank to have it
relined I used a pencil eraser on the contacts. 
 
Works beautifully now.
