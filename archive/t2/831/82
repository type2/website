Subject: Re: [T2] Stalling ... Carb problem with 1977 1600

Justin,
I am having similar issues with a new Bocar 34 PICT on a 1600. It is
not very good at idling close or above 950rpm. It seems to always
hover around 850 rpm or lower, leading to a tendency to flicker the
oil light and die when coming to a stop.

The engine idles easily when a 009 is used, timed around 5-7 BTDC, the
mix and volume screws are very responsive and do their job well. But
when I time for the stock dizzy at 5 ATDC the idling gets poor and
driving in traffic becomes a stressing three foot job exercise.

One (temporary) fix is to up the idle jet from the stock 55 (i think)
to a bigger 65. It does the job here. To figure if this is going to
work for you, slowly unscrew the idle jet and find if engine revs
faster. Another thing that may is to close the choke a bit more in
winter so the engine gets more time to warm up before left on it's own
(idle circuit). I also did the alternator filing thing to install the
carb and wondered if some metal chip got in there to obstruct the idle
circuit. I took it apart and blew carb cleaner through all orifices I
could find. Made no difference.

Maybe you and I got a so-so carb from the same batch.

Cheers and happy holidays. I'll be flying above UK soon and will send
you good Bocar idling vibes.
