Vanagons are also.

Perhaps VW upped the torqued value on the
triple-square bolts?"

Great answer Karl.

However . . .

the card in question is for a '77 (allen bolt head??), and it is printed in 
1976, (lower right corner - 1st edition 9/76) yet it says 33 ft lbs

But I will go with the reasoning that allen = 25 ft lb; triple square = 33 
ft lbs, based on the different hardness of the different bolts.
