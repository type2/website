Subject: Parts for nearly free

I sold my 78 camper last year. I thought there might be another 
aircooled purchase in the future,but the
vanagon has become a real member of the family. I have a bunch of parts 
from the baywindow I would like
to get rid of. I have several fan hubs,the plastic covers for the tail 
lights,tons of 78/79 engine tin. I have the
rear suspension parts,a engine door,some glass,lenses ect...I would 
like if someone would come and pick up the whole lot. $75.00 and its 
yours.

I also have some new sheet metal from busdepot a purchased a couple 
years ago. The two rear corner panels from the bottom up to the rain 
gutter including the vents. A couple battery trays, the peice below the 
engine lid and a couple filler panels I forget where they go. $200.00 
for it all.

Its all located in Mystic,CT. I don't want to ship anything unless you 
really need something to get back on the road.

Happy Holiday
Bill M
Mystic,CT
