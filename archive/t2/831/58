	Alex, I can't speak for most of the insurance stuff cause I'm not
very savy in that area.  But I can tell you that when our bus was 'totaled'
by our insurance company after being rear ended, getting the price of
recently sold vehicles from classifieds and auction sites like eBay did
indeed help get the value raised.  Also, in our case we had receipts showing
the cost of recent engine rebuilds etc which helped out as well.

My .02        good luck.

Would sending in classified ads from The Samba and eBay help at this time?
