Subject: Re: [T2] What torque setting for CV Joints?? 33 or 25 ft lbs

My 70 bus has triple square bolts. Not sure if they're original or not.
There were no washers under the bolts, just the two hole plates. I reused
the bolts when I replaced the axles/cv's, and used star style lock washers.
Those bolts are probably better than the new ones you can buy.

"But the wrinkle is 77's are normally Allen [hex] and
the triple-square cam later. Most 79's were
triple-square and, unless someone put Allens in, all
Vanagons are also.

Perhaps VW upped the torqued value on the
triple-square bolts?"

 the card in question is for a '77 (allen bolt head??), and it is printed in
1976, (lower right corner - 1st edition 9/76) yet it says 33 ft lbs

But I will go with the reasoning that allen = 25 ft lb; triple square = 33
ft lbs, based on the different hardness of the different bolts.
