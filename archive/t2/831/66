I wonder how that little title thing is working in this sale? He mentions a 
lien sale. I wonder if he can sell it with clear title?
Too many question marks on this deal...something a little less than kosher.

Am I the only one that thinks its weird that this guys "friend" left
this on his property before he went to Europe...and now he's selling it.
I'm gonna see if I have any of my friends stuff to sell on Ebarf too :)
