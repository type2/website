Subject: fuel sender

Hey guys.  My guage is working 1/2 way again  so I've postponed changing the sender in the tank.  But in  searching the archives, I found info on how to do it, or why I don't  want to do it myself, ha.  But I didn't find anything that tells  exactly what happens with these things.  I've probably owned 30+  cars in my short lifetime and I've never had a problem where the guage  reads 1/2 full when it's full.  What's different about VW's design  that makes this happen?  But then curiosity killed the cat.   Cheers....KR
