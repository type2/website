Subject: Re: [VB] Belt-eating crank pulley

I've used sandpaper to clean off the pulley where it shreads belts... worked fine afterwards.   You can use a stiff wire brush too. 
 
I think the crank pulley nut should be torqued to 30 ft lbs.   the number is in the Idiot Book, though, you might want to check it.    
 
-----Original Message-----Still working on this 1500 SP. I noticed that the
inside surface of the crank pulley is pitted and rough
from sitting so long before I got it.  It tends to
shred belts!
