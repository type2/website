Subject: Re: [T2] To spray or not to spray???

I do it all the time with no problems. Just make sure you really button up
any holes, like intake ports etc. Don't aim the water dirrectly at these
spots. I've found that inexpensive oven cleaner by EasyOff left to soak for
awhile really cuts the grease. It says don't use it on aluminum, but I've
been doing it for years and no worries. Toothbrush, bottle brush etc to
clean. After that blow dry with yur compressor and wait till it's totally
dry. Then a THIN coat of flat black lacquer (its the thinnest paint) spray
paint to dissipate heat better and you're good to go.

Hey Y'all, 
I've got the 1500 SP engine out of my wife's ride in 
Order to do a front oil seal replacement. While I've 
Got the engine out, I tore down all the tin and am 
Going to pressure wash it and paint it. Here's my 
Question: The longblock is pretty grimy, dirty, 
Messy. I am tempted to hit it with the pressure 
Washer, would anyone recommend AGAINST doing this???. 
I know that I don't want to get water in any of the 
Ports or anything. Basically, it is the cylinders and 
Case that are really grimy. Any advice or 
Suggestions??
