Subject: Different inlet manifolds question ...

I've aquired a good used TP inlet manifold which has nice clear preheat 
tubes.  I've pulled the old one off the engine (preheat tubes very 
blocked!) and noticed there is a difference in the aluminum castings.  
The one from the bus (part number 211...) has a tag cast into it to 
attach it to the block, whilst the "new" one I have does not have this 
tag and has a part number 043...  It has a servo pipe on the down tube 
so I guess it's right for a bus. 

Question is how critical is this fixing point for the manifold ? and 
will I be getting into a bunch of trouble by installing the non extra 
fixing manifold ??
