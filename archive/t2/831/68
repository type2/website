Subject: Mirror woes

I recently replaced the mirrors and now im having troubles.  The
mirrors wont stay put under the wind load of 50mph or better.

Suggestions?

Ive tried tack weld in them (melted the whole damn thing), JBWeld
just made a mess, Im ready to replace them with some aftermarket
versions that I just bought from Manny, Moe and Jack.
