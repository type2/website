Well, the engine is out.

I have pulled all the tin off, and I have yet to find where oil spewed 
from.  I mean, when it happened, the racket was hellacious.  I was sure 
that a rod has busted through the case.

I will continue to tear things down tomorrow.  Perhaps when I pull the 
heads, something will reveal itself.

Anyhoo, this engine has only 39,481.9 miles on it since the last 
rebuild.  I mentioned earlier this year about a noise the engine was 
making (I can't find it in the archives, so it must have been after May 
2005).  I thought it might have been a loose head, so a torqued the 
head nuts i could get to, to no effect.  in retrospect, that noise 
could have been a knocking rod.  If so, it has been like that for 
prolly close to 8,000 miles.  It sounded like an expensive noise and it 
made me nervous, but I drove on with it.   :-(

The engine (longblock and accouterments) that I ordered shipped out 
yesterday, so I may not see it until early next week.  I've had to 
order some more parts (cable boots, mostly) that I noticed needed 
replacing after I pulled the engine out.

I have planned all year for this 2-week vacation, and THIS is what I'm 
doing with it.  I'm at home without a ride, and so I'll clean every 
part (with a toothbrush) before I put it on the new engine.  Maybe I'll 
even get the BN-2 up and running and plumbed under the rear seat.
