Ric-
There's a reason the vacuum can is connected to the left port on the
carburetor.  It pulls the correct amount vacuum to actuate the vacuum assist
diaphragm for this distributor design.  Connecting to the other port puts
way too much stress on the vacuum diaphragm stretching and could eventually
rip the diaphragm from too much "pull" on the vacuum rod.

You may have ruined and overstretched the vacuum assist diaphragm, which may
cause an inaccurate movement of the points plate sending your timing all
over the place under load.  You will probably have to replace it to get the
"stock" specs back into the vacuum assist portion of the distributor.
Everything's designed to work a certain way.  Running something outside of
normal installation specification is just asking for trouble IMO.

The SVDA is the best distributor to run with the H30/31 Carb.  Rarely have a
problem with them when they're timed right, as long as they aren't the
Chinese variety now popping up as these are garbage.  Aircooled.net does not
sell Chinese (that I know of), only good, original Bosch.
