Subject: What I learned today

Steel studs + aluminum heads + cheap "Dork" wrench =  :(

Why oh why didn't I heed Mr Atwell's advice - perhaps it was the excitement
of receiving my shiny new carburetor or maybe my lean bankroll, whatever the
reason, I am a sad panda...

Lesson learned the hard way as usual! Off I go to buy a "real" torque
wrench.
