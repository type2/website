It is a tight fit so it doesn't need a clamp. The Engine Case side  
dipstick tube is flared, which keeps it snug. I use a small amount of  
assembly grease to help it along. Try not to use any metal tools, the  
viton will tear. Before I got a small plastic pry-tool, I used a dull  
bamboo kabob stick to get the edge of the bellows started over the  
flared lip.
