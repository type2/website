Great article Jamie, sorry I didn't mention it in my previous post.

Almost forgot about something else, too.  Back in 2002 I snapped a 
picture of that little box (the "vibrator") to send to someone who asked 
this same question.  After a little digging I was able to find it:

Turns out my set screw does not have a screwdriver slot in it but needed 
to be grabbed by a small pliers instead.  This may not have been 
original for 1973 because over the past 20-some years I have swapped in 
so many junkyard parts, I can't remember what is original anymore. 
Anyway, the arrow points at the doohickey that you need to turn to 
adjust the gauge... on some busses at least.
