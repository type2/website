Subject: Battery charger negative cable sparks when moved on engine?

I put my charger at 2 amps onto my postive terminal of the battery, and the
engine case for the negative. I then plugged it in. Just to make sure, I
"rubbed" the negative clamp where it was on the engine case, and got some
sparks/snap/crackles. It stopped when I stopped moving it.
Just wondering if this is normal when it's plugged in?? Doesn't do it when
it's not plugged in, so I'm thinking that 2 amps are trying to do their job
and get to ground?
Thanks,
Courtney
