NAPA is the best!! The local guy closes at 5:00pm, so it would be an
impossibility to pick up ordered parts. He told me that if I prepaid for the
parts, he would leave them with the gas station owner across the street for
me. Also, what the heck is nut brown? Is that a local term? (I live near
Boston)
