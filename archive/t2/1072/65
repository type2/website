Grease is good.
Grease grease grease

your bus loves grease

grease is good

Grease till it comes out nice and thick and clean. B  not thin and sloppy. B 
Sometimes there is water in the swing lever pin. B Flush that old ick out with
new grease




As awesome as grease is, it doesn't really 'take up slop'. B  If your link
and/or king pins are worn, well grease will not fix them. B  Have you adjusted
your link pins every 6K miles? B  It says how in the Muir Idiot book at well
as the Bentley.




The grease seals for the king pins and trailing arms are available through
wolfsburg west. B B 

To replace the ones in the spindles you need to press them apart and back
together, which requires some special tools to keep it lined up correctly. B 
Basically, they get replaced when the spindles are rebuildt.

Any recomendations for a really thick grease that would tend to take up some
of the slop, at least tempararily.

Thanks,
