Subject: Trade for your Westy

I have a 1998 New Beetle and I would like to trade it for a  
Westfalia.  Preferrebly a 1978 or 1979 with a 2.0 litre fuel injected  
since that is the engine I know the most about and have had the most  
experience with.

The Beetle has 181K on it and needs a couple of things but runs like a  
champ.

If you are interested please send me an e mail and we will go from  
there.  I can deliver the Beetle up to 300 miles in either direction.   
I am located in Hazlehurst, GA.

Thanks,

Charlie Ford
