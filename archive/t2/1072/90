what kind of fuel pump? I got three different pumps before I found one that
work. Remember that fuel flow is different then fuel presser. So if your fuel
pump is putting out more then your van can burn and you have no return line
that could make it flood. What your fuel presser? it should be  3- 2.5 psi.
Check your needles in the carbs for wear.
 
That all I think of but if you still have problem, I will find my book and
send you to some website I found.
