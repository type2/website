Subject: bus parts &VW memorbelia for sale cheap in Raleigh, NC area

hi out there in type2 land! long time no type.  I have some parts and 
memorabilia I am selling here in the Raleigh NC area.  Wanted to see if any 
locals would be interested before I put this stuff on ebay?  I would much 
prefer to give a fellow type2 busser a great deal on a stash of VW goodies!

basic rundown:

(qty 2) lower torsion arms with brand new ball joints.  ordered from busboys 
several years ago.
I believe these are lower but I am not 100% sure.  have pics.  grease seals 
included along with an original (used) bump stop.
see diagram here: http://www.bus-boys.com/bbbjarms2.htm they are the ones on 
the right with the stud & threads.  brand new these are $180 a pair but they 
are very heavy & I would like to avoid shipping.

Brazilian.
OUTER TIE ROD END LEFT AND RIGHT:  STD BEETLE 5/68-77 / GHIA 5/68-74

various pieces (qty 4-6?) of USED chrome 'beltline trim' and a handful of
