>these are pretty standard AVP and they still need the standard VW
gasket between the top of the cyl and the head. I tore an engine with
AVP heads down 3 times before I was tipped off on this, when I "Yelled"
at AVP they admited that they should be there, and even sent me a set.

No gasket is required at the top of the cylinder where it meets the
head. Check the VW bulletin in the link below. Note that the 1.6 mm
shims are for stock heads that do not have a step machined into them. I
believe that the step is designed to be the same thickness as the
original gasket when compressed. You may still need to have shims at the
base of the cylinders to adjust the compression ratio.

I also found an interesting guide to estimating compression ratio from
your compression in the Type 2 library. Of course it is only an
indication but it suggests you may have a lower than stock compression
ratio. You will need to check it to be sure - instructions in the Type 2
library. What a great resource!
