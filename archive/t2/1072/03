Subject: Re: [T2] Please help solve our Vanagon alloy wheel mounting

While I don't have an answer to your stud length problem, it would presume
that since alloy wheels are thicker, the studs would have to be longer.

What I do know, however, is that you definitely want the taper to perfectly
fit the wheel. So don't substitute a conical for a ball-shaped one or
vice-versa. With a mismatch, the contact surface between wheel and fastener
is reduced to a thin ring shape. The fasteners will come off and so will the
wheel. Preventing this by tightening with more torque will damage the wheel
and may cause the stud or bolt to break, usually while driving.
