Subject: Re: [T2] Please help solve our Vanagon alloy wheel mounting 

You don't have to replace any studs to use Vanagon alloys on a Bay Bus, front or rear. 

Brian, I am not trying to put Vanagon Alloys on a Bay Window, I am trying to put Vanagon Alloys on a Vanagon that came with steel wheels. 

Everybody, do you know what year VW started putting alloy wheels on Vanagons?
