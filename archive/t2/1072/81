Subject: Sheet metal for wheel arch/seat support

This is the part on which the front seats are mounted - and it extends  
downward to the floor.

First question would be "what's the correct name for this sheet metal"  
- perhaps it's really 2 pieces.??

I've not been able to locate any such piece in several of the printed  
and on-line parts listings and I definitely need both passenger and  
driver side pieces.

Second and subsequent questions??

A good source for them.

Possible suggestions for making a substitute for them.

Thanks,
Pat
