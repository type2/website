Subject: Automatic Transmission Problems

I have a 1976 auto 2.0 litre Kombi.

Symptoms are :



When engine cold only

1. Takes at least 10 minutes to get into Reverse

and/or

2. Takes at least 10 minutes to get into third gear once driving down the
road, ie. sits in 2nd.

3. When waiting for it to get into Reverse, when it finally goes into reverse,
it slams home the gear, loud bang, and I'm in reverse.

4. 1st and 2nd gear I never have a problem.



If the engine is warm, then none of these symptoms exist.



I have checked the auto transmission fluid many times, and the dipstick
indicates the correct amount of fluid.



Looking at trying to fix this problem over winter, and would appreciate some
advise on what to look for.



Thanks,

Chris.
