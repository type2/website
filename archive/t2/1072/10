I would use that diagram that Dan just sent to the list and probably the 
easiest thing to do would be to use a continuity tester to see if 
anything is shorting to ground that shouldn't be.  I'd also use the 
continuity tester to make sure that wires are shorting to each other. 
Disconnect the battery before you do this.

Then if that's all normal, I'd hook up the battery and see if you're 
getting voltage where you should.  If you're frying it with the AFR 
flap, I'd check that circuitry/wiring as well.
