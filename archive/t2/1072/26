Subject: Re: [T2] Calibrating the Fuel Gauge

Your instrument cluster should have a small box attached behind the fuel 
gauge with a wire coming from it.  If you're lucky, this box will have a 
very small set screw in it (I've seen some with and some without).  You 
will probably need a jeweler's screwdriver to turn it.  This seems to 
adjust the span on the gauge but if I remember correctly it adjusts the 
low and high side of the gauge simultaneously.  You may have to 
experiment with it or perhaps someone else here knows more about it than 
I do and can explain.
