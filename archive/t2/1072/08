Subject: Cooking Double Relays

OK, I have a project bus that is ready to roll. '75 Transporter with  
'78 fuel injection.

Problem is I keep frying double relays. This is getting expensive.

Opening up the failed relays, the metal thread between 86 and 86a is  
fried on all the units. I believe this is a design that protect the  
computer from over-voltage or shorting out?

A clue is one of the relays blew when i opened the air intake sensor  
to start the fuel pump

The last test of my last relay, I installed a 7.5amp fuse between the:
starter to relay
relay to fuel pump
relay to coil

The bus started and ran fine so I figured the other two relays were  
just old and busted.

I pulled the fuses and there went my last relay.

Now I have no relays and need some help on how to chase this before I  
keep killing relays. Is this a short in the wiring or a over-voltage  
problem from the coil, starter or battery?

Also, can the bridge that failed on the relays be re-soldered and  
repaired?

Thanks,

Jon Stiles
