Subject: Re: [T2] Please help solve our Vanagon alloy wheel mounting  

"Your trying to put the normal 14 inch stock Vanagon alloys on your 
Vanagon correct? 
they should mount right up without any mods needed at all, if the alloys 
your trying to put on are really the normal 14 inch bone stock ones from 
another Vanagon. 

I know they just bolt right onto a baywindow without any mods, and the 
baywindows use the same exact steel wheels that the Vanagon does, so it 
should bolt right up to a vanagon as well." 


They don't, you can get about 2 turns on the rear nuts, the front wouldn't be an issue for length if we could find bolts with the conical taper rather than the ball. They really are 14" bone stock ones from a Vanagon.
