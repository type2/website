Subject: head shims, gaskets, and piston rings.

Hello all,
It's been 3 years since i've posted and lurked on this list.  I hope  
everyone is well.

I've finally found time again to revive my 74 Westy.  Yeah!

I bought an engine from AVP 3 years ago and have had trouble ever  
since.  They (AVP) kept telling me ignition and/or carburetor  
problems, even after I told them I only have 100 psi compression.   
I've double checked valve adjustment, bought an SVDA dizzy, and dual  
duals webers from aircooled.net.
To no avail.  So I finally took the heads off and discovered they  
(AVP) put 2.0L valves on a 1.8 L head.  Too small.  Had that problem  
fixed at a local machine shop.  Still did not help with compression.   
So i took out the motor again, and dug a little deeper.  I took off  
the cylinders and lo and behold I think I found the problem.  The  
piston ring's gap with either all lined up or just a 1/4" apart from  
one another.  UGGGHH, that AVP!  I thought they knew how to build.  I  
guess you get what you pay for!

So now my question is:
1.  I want to buy new piston rings, is the $90 set (Deves) from air  
cooled.net worth the extra?
2.  I noticed there was a .060" metal shim between cylinder and case.   
Is this normal?  I also found silicon between cylinder and case as  
well.  Is this correct?
3.  There was also the same looking shim used as head gaskets.  Is  
this correct?  Is it worth the extra $ for the copper head gaskets  
offered from aircooled.net?

I was also wondering if there was a way to check base timing (not  
ignition) without splitting the case?  Is it possible to screw up base  
timing too?

Thanks to all in advance.  I miss my good running bus!

David
