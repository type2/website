	I wouldn't use that figure in any dispute with the 
disreputable engine rebuilder.  100 psi, even if on a properly 
warmed-up engine with the throttle wide (as compression tests always 
should be), let alone if motor is not warmed-up &/or cylinders can't 
take in a full charge of air, is not a figure to cause serious 
concern, is it?
	There may well be plenty wrong with your motor, david, but 
this figure 100 psi is not strong evidence of fault.
