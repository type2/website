Subject: head gaskets, piston rings take 2.

Thanks for the replies thus far.  Perhaps, I need to make some  
clarifications.

I have 4000 miles on this rebuild.  Compression is just under 100 psi  
all cylinders.  It has always ran rich, and terrible gas mileage.   
I've been thru the ignition and carbs over and over and over.   
Including idle air adjustments to jetting.  No avail.  The motor also  
has low power, most noticably on the highway cruising a 55 mph, going  
up slight hill.   Something is just not right since receiving from  
AVP.    Also when at full op. temp, the motor had long crank before  
starting.

I was taught that the end gaps of the three piston rings should be  
staggered at least 90 degrees apart.  Upon removal of cylinders, found  
#1 and #4 pistons, the ring end gaps were perfectly lined up!  #2 and  
#3 rings gaps were staggered maybe 10-15 degrees apart.   The rings  
also had pretty sharp edges.  Would this not cause a low compression  
reading?  Figured air could blow right by the rings!

The heads have a "raised" step on the piston side.  Looks like a  
"spacer" was "machined" into the heads.   Is this normal?

is a .060" shim between cylinder and case a "normal" size.  or should  
I go thinner?

Has anyone ever had a rebuild with "base" timing off?  (timing between  
crank and cam shafts).

David
