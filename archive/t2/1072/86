Subject: speedo cable routing

All,

 

I removed the speedo cable last fall to lube it and got side tracked with
wiring issues, etc, and now it is time to put it back. I don't recall
exactly the path it took to get from the speedo to the wheel. Can anyone
describe it's path... or a diagram or pics would help. It is for a 68 westy.


Thanks!
