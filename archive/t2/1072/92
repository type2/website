Subject: Vacuum Problem

I just had an 1800 engine installed in my '74 bus.

In the process however they've messed up the DUAL carbs somehow. It won't idle and on the highway I had a difficult time keeping it above the 40 mph minimum :( Sputters when you step on the gas from a stop. 

The guy says there is a vacuum leak from the bushing on driver's side carb.  It looks to me that they may have missed some of the vacuum hoses.  The engine looks a little different from my old one, but there are definitely hoses missing.

Is there a diagram somewhere?  Or might someone be willing to talk me through it?

Thanks,
Steve
