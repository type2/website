Hello again
 
I replaced my fuel lines and filters the other day after having some running
issues with my 72 bus. I thought I had run out of gas...guage issues...and
sucked up some crud and the bus would run well for a minute and then die.
Found it wasnt getting gas and replaced the fuel pump with a 5 1/2lb electric
and fuel regulator. Now I have gas and I flooded it good. The last time I did
this (flooded) it took 2 days before it would start again!!! and its doing the
same thing today. I have dual Webbers on her which need to be rebuilt, but had
them dialed in real nicely right before putting on the pump. Any ideas?
 
I have a sign on my bus which reads...If you are behind me you will be late.
Soon to have another that will say...Its your fault...if you had left sooner
you wouldnt be behind me.
 
Mike
72 bus "Gamera"
