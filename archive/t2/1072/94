Subject: re:flooding

On our new engine with the dual carbs, it ran fine with the stock fuel pump
and no fuel pressure regulator for months! We moved from 4,000 ft. elevation
to sea level again, and began flooding the engine. When it sat overnight, the
fuel tank slowly dripped into the engine - the oil change the next day was a
mess! The needle valve on one of the carbs blew through. Replaced the needle
valve, installed a fuel pressure regulator (even though the new engine manuf.
said we 'shouldn't' need one) no flooding since then.
