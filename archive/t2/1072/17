Subject: Are there clamps for the dipstick rubber?

Does my new rubber dipstick bellows need a clamp on either end, or is it just depending on a snug fit? Should I put the top smaller part on first, then pull it down onto the lower end? I remember someone saying it's a beggar to do?
Thanks,
Courtney
