Subject: Front end grease.

Howdy all,

I was under my bus front end today and squirted in a fresh charge of grease.

First, I was wondering if there is any consensus as to a good brand and type 
of grease to use. I looked in the archives and didn't notice anything in 
particular.

Second, I noticed that all my seals on the torsion arms and the king pins 
are badly cracked and one on a king pin is falling off.  Any recomendations 
on sourcing these? Not that I like ripping all that stuff apart to install 
them. Want some that will last more than 5 years parked in a garage.

Chris
