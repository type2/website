Subject: Window Sticker

Hello.

I want to have made a window sticker for the inside of my VW bus
It will be of a drawing, and there will be some detail that I want to
capture.  Probably a sign shop could not create such, but I don't know.

If you only know something off-the-wall event (stickers made at a flea
market, or VW event show..), or foreign POC, that would be helpful.

I have a quality JPG file which I could send.
