Subject: Re: [T2] Please help solve our Vanagon alloy wheel mounting

Thanks to everybody that wrote back and an extra thanks to those that pointed out removing the locating bolts from the rear drum, that saved me from removing the hubs and installing new studs. 



After several tries by different parts stores Napa was able to get us the exact stud we needed for the fronts, with those studs and the locating bolts removed we were able to exceed the 7.5 turns we desired all the way around. 



We got the wheels mounted up Monday night while brewing up a 10 gallon batch of nut brown, the tires he mounted are General's that are C rated, they look really nice, I am sure they will get him into most campsites, I believe that this is the tire http://www.generaltire.com/tires/T5/Grabber-ATsup2-sup 



Thank you,
