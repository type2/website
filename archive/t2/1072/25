dip stick for auto trannny must be checked with warm tranny, engine
running or it will read high.

best prochedure for checking auto tranny fluid,

. let engine/tranny get warm
. put on parking brake or block wheels
. shift slowly (With brakes on) P-R-N-D-2-1-2-D-N-R-N
. leave in neutral with engine idling.
. check fluid, pull dipstick wipe check again, this is the accurate
reading.

if it still does the sticky shift thing I would suspect a dirty
valve body in the tranny.

this is one of the few thing that can be done on the auto tranny with
the tranny in and by the average mechanic.  the prochedure is in the
Bentley so just follow it step by step  (chapter 10 section 5.1)I
would not take the valve body apart but just clean it real well. make
sure the ATF strainer is cleaned also.  I forget if there is a gasket
between the parts but I don't think so, if so me very careful with it.

if that doesn't work (or you've already tried it) I would see if you
could find, beg, borrow another known working valve body and test it,
remember the 003 and 010 trannys are not interchangable so get one
from another matching tranny

easy way to tell which you have, the shift coupling from the shift
lever is on left side (drivers side USA bus)on a 003 tranny and on the
passenger side of an 010 tranny

good luck
