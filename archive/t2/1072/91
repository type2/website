Part Number for the Type 2 68-79 Fiche is/was 000.7350.05.21  Last issued in
1997 before they fully switched to ETKA.

Not that it will do you any good.  VW & Dealers doesn't recognize those
fiche part numbers anymore in their system.

The earlier dated fiche, the better.  That way you usually have the original
part numbers for those discontinued items for the earlier (like 68-74)
models.

And no, mine are not for sale.....
