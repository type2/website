Subject: Rubber step up pads

I have a 1974 Transporter. I've lost the link to a place that had step-up
pads. These are the rubber pads that attach in the recessed area of the door
to prevent slipping when people stand on them. Does anyone have a source for
these? In the meantime I'll keep looking for that link. Thank you as always
for the help!
