The heads have a "raised" step on the piston side. Looks like a "spacer"
was "machined" into the heads. Is this normal?

Yes, on new AMC heads the step avoids the need for a gasket between the
head and the cylinder. As for the spacer on the end of the barrel that
would be there to adjust the compression ratio. You should take some
measurements and work out what your compression ratio is (covered in
detail elsewhere). A lower compression ratio would also give you lower
compression readings and less power but I understand some rebuilders
build engines that way for longevity. As others have noted, though 100
psi is not alarmingly low.

Another thought is that your cam may be worn if the wrong oil has been
used. Modern oils have less zinc, etc and can cause accelerated wear of
the camshaft (don't want to start an oil debate - been covered before!)
