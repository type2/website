Subject: Fwd: [T2] Please help solve our Vanagon alloy wheel mounting

"Do you have the locator bolts for the rear drums still in place? if
so, they're probably what's getting in your way. Try mounting them
without the bolts in place."



Don, do the locator bolts usually interfere with alloy wheels?B If that is the
case we definitely need them removed. I guess it is good to check if a wheel
is flat against the drum.



Thank you,

James
