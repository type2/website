The Napa kept trying until they got it right, everybody else gave up pretty quickly, including our VW shop, I appreciate that attitude a lot, I have dealt with the other side with my bus as well as my IH Scouts and 1975 164 Volvo, sometimes I get turned away and the person hasn't tried looking up a single thing.
