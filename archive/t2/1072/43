Subject: Re: [T2] Cooking Double Relays

Solved. I traced the issue back to the brand-spanking-new wiring  
harness from Kyle Automotive Specialties. The small pins on the plug,  
leading to the Double Relay terminals 86 and 86a were reversed.

After "reinforcing" and repairing the trace on the Double Relay, it  
was possible to start the bus by opening the air flap on the Air Flow  
Meter! That is what tipped me off.

Kyle has been very gracious, guarantees his work and is sending me a  
replacement Double Relay. His product is absolutely amazing in  
quality, detail and accuracy. But the lesson for the day, check all  
the parts, even if they are new!
