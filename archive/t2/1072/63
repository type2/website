Subject: Found a neat trick

I purchased the 'accordion' rubber tube for the bottom of the dipstick on my
'74 Westy about 8 months ago and upon recent reassembly of 1.8 L motor, took
it out of it's platic bag, and inserted it.  The motor has not been fired, and
been in dry storage in Garage, and the other day I had to remove same piece,
and it was totally ful  of surface cracks!!  Everywhere!  I got angry..then
creative.. and bought a product called Starbrire liquid electrical tape.  You
brush it on, let it cure, and stays flexible...so I painted the whole part
with it, let it dry, and it is even tougher than new...and fleixible to boot!
Cheers
