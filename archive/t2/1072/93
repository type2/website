Subject: MAYDAY-MAYDAY Oil screen removed for oil change

I just started my spring oil change.

It appears I dropped the oil screen.

It has a paper gasket saturated by oil.

Thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated to ensure no leaks on re-installation.

I am expecting torque to be 11 inch pounds.

Thanks,

Alan
