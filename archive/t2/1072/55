Subject: Stud lengths?

While getting ready to install my 1.8 L motor in my "74 Westy, I tried to find
the appropriate lower engine studs to fit into transaxle....but, after getting
the longest ones from a Vanagon, they were still "short" in length, and they
were the longest ones made...97mm, and were still 'short', so we backed them
out to apoint where we could attach a nut and tighten them up, and then had to
deal with the longer starter "D" bolt, which we also cured.  My Question
is..why were the 'longest' engine studs, 'short', if they were wound all the
way into motor boss, to 'tight' fit, and...are there longer studs made by VW?
Long day...but thanks to Phil and Capt Hook...motor is in..jeez, 8 years
doesn't seem that long...when you are retired!
