Subject: Re: [T2] Sheet metal for wheel arch/seat support

Patrick, I haven't seen that part available either? I wonder if Schofield in 
the UK does it, he makes alot of his own stuff, and it's reasonable. The 
other option is to look on the Samba for someone parting out a bus; they 
often cut pieces to order for you. Ask for it to be cut on the spot welds 
etc, to make sure you're getting a good useable piece you can put back in.
HTH,
Courtney
