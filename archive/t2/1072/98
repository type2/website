Subject: distributor backlash

Hi all,

 

 I FINALLY started the type4 rebuild. I have all the innards in the case
including the distributor drive shaft. My problem seems to be the shaft. The
crank and cam shafts work perfectly forward and backward. When I index the
distributor shaft, according to Bug Me Video and Jake Raby, the engine binds
about a quarter turn in reverse. It still turns freely clockwise though. Any
suggestions? I don't want to torque the case until I get the problem fixed.

 

Thanks,

 

Bob
