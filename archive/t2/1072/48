I think the only follow-up to that is they should be load range D tires, 
but many people run with the C's.  Not the best thing in the world, but 
doable.  Handling and wear improve greatly with the load range D tires 
because they are rated for the bus weight and allow you to fill them to 
the proper inflation levels.  That being said, we ran for years and 
years and years on load range C tires until this past tire change at 
which point I opted for the Hankook Ds.
