Hi Courtney,

Perfectly normal, and a great example of why you never, ever attach the
ground cable to the negative terminal on a lead acid battery. If the battery
was venting hydrogen in sufficient amounts, those sparks would set off an
explosion that could be incidental, or kill you. My brother in law lost his
eyesight from just such an accident.

Ground is still part of the whole ckt. You would also get sparks if you
jiggled the positive connection, which is why you hook up the + first on the
battery. If you want to make sure its a good connection, jiggle it around to
cut through the grease or gunk. At that point, the circuit is incomplete,
since the ground return is not yet hooked up, so no sparks. Then you connect
the negative to ground some place on the chassis, not at the - terminal,
just like you did, so if it sparks, no problems. Same thing applies when you
want to jump start your battery from another car.
