Subject: Re: [T2] Are there clamps for the dipstick rubber?

Actually I think Dave's thought is a great idea for this sort of application
and use these all the time in places like this.  I use good quality larger
ones on pretty much all the boots in every location on an L-jet system
actually and on the manifold runner tubes, as real hose clamps get to be
overkill, too bulky, and can actually contribute to demise of some rubber
parts by cutting in.  However all zip ties are not equal, getting some good
ones that can stand up to heat is a good idea.  On the dipstick tube though
like others I usually just meticulously clean everything then apply a thin
coating of black silicone RTV to the male ends of each side when installing
the boot.  Back in the day with real made in Germany boots, they didn't need
anything, today not so lucky.

Just about anything you might use to clamp it will eventually contribute to
its demise. It isn't supposed to need anything, but - I have successfully
clamped it with tiny zip ties and they have rounded enough edges that they
don't tear. You should be fine with no clamps.
