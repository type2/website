Subject: Re: [T2] tire size 72 westy ?'s

I pulled a spare from a 77(?) Westy that looked NEVER used, it was a
Kelly, stock spec, but said made in Germany.  Put it on my Westy's front
and drove it to a car show about 1.5 hrs away.   About 30 min on the
return to home,the Westy  had the only blowout in 230,000 miles - the
tread had separated and peeled off the tire.  Morale- don't use old
tires even if they look perfect- tire guy said that the elasicizers they
put in the rubber doesn't stay put and the rubber gets brittle.  I've
ridden passenger load range D tires most of this Westy's life (36psi
rating, 1540 lbs load).  Put on the high load range Michelin's (60 psi
max, can't remember load....main difference is that they are much more
stable under side to side loads like uneven roads and in wind.
