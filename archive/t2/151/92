That's why they're spec. T-II's don't handle cross winds nearly as good 
without them. In this case, spec tires means FAR BETTER results than just a 
step down to lesser specs. It's the difference between night and day. The 
ultra stiff sidewalls of the commercial rated tires are not optional if you 
want it to handle as intended by the Meanereers who designed it.
