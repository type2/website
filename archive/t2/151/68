Subject: Points keep frying...

Hey all...

I'm usually pretty good at figuring things out myself, but I'm stumped on 
this one. My points keep fouling after 50 - 100 miles.

Here's what I have...

(71?) Mexican 1600 w/Pict 30/31 Carb (new carb)
009 Distributor

What I've done...

1. New plugs, points, condensor, coil, wires, cap, rotor about 5 months ago 
with less than 2000 miles since.

2. Broke down last month, replaced points (fried) and plugs (black) -- 
everything else looked good. Plugs were black due to old carb problems -- 
didn't replace plugs w/new carb install.

3. Broke down last week. Thought it was a fuel issue, but turned out to be 
points -- replaced. Checked plugs -- beautiful condition.

4. Broke down yesterday. Points had a little of that solder-looking stuff, 
filed it off (didn't have a new set on-hand), re-installed and she ran fine.

Other info...

1. The coil is not the Bosch Blue -- it's a black one from the local FLAPS.

2. Plugs are Bosch (regular, not "super").

3. Rotor, cap and wires are from FLAPS.

4. Points are Bosch

5. When she runs, she runs great -- smooth idle and acceleration, no 
backfiring, no hesitation. When this happens, she basically just cuts out 
without warning -- no sputtering, etc.


What am I missing here? I know that points are a regular "wear" item, but 
they've always lasted at least 5000 miles for me. Any ideas or suggestions 
appreciated...
