Shawn,

What you know is that *a* ground wire has come loose.  Waht you don't know
is *which* ground wire has come loose, nor do you know which end of that
wire is loose, whether it is the end that should be attached to the body
or if it is the end that should be attached to some bit of the electrical
system.  I know you are thinking that it is the ground for the hi/lo and
that it has come adrift from that system, but that is not necessarily so.
Every ground wire in the bus is that same color and it could be any of a
dozen or more that run around up front there.

Terminal 5 on the rear of the hi/lo relay, located in the fuse box, should
have a brown wire with a white stripe attached to it.  With the lights and
ignition key off, the resistance between this wire and the body should be
infinite.  when you pull on the turn signal switch, the resistance should
drop to zero.

Terminal 5 on the turn signal switch, located in the steering column,
should have the other end of the brown/white wire from the hi/lo relay
attached to it.  Like its other end, the resistance between this wire and
the body should be infinite.  When you pull on the turn signal switch, the
resistance should also drop to zero.

Terminal 31, also on the turn signal switch, located in the steering
column should have a solid brown wire attached to it.  This *may* be the
loose wire you have found, but maybe not. First, look to see if there is a
solid brown wire on that switch already.  See if it runs to the body.  If
so, then you have found a different ground wire, to who knows what.

The color convention in VW's is that solid  brown is ground and should
have no resistance between that wire and the body.  Brown with a trace of
any color is *switched* ground and shuld have infinite resistance until
the switch is activated, then it has no resistance.

Lastly, I want to say that tech writers are *so* underpaid!!!!  This would
be *so* easy to show you and it is *SO* difficult to describe :-(((((
