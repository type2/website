Subject: Fwd: [T2] 34 pict 3 problems

Bruce:  No solution, here, but lots of sympathy.

I could have written your post. Same vehicle. Same distributor. Same 
problem. I bought the engine sight unseen with a 31 PICT and it would 
not idle. Before putting the engine in my '71, I rebuilt the top end. 
New heads,  a 34PICT-3 that had run well on another engine, new tin, 
coil, etc.

Started it on my test stand. Still wouldn't idle.  Compression is 
good. Timing and dwell are right on. Stripped, dipped, wire-reamed 
the little ports inside the throat, and rebuilt the 34 PICT-3. No 
idle.  Sprayed almost a can of WD-40 on all vacuum joints. No 
increase in rpm.

So no idle with either of two carbs.

I've posted this to the list on more than one occasion and have 
gotten lots of tips.  None has lead to a solution. One member 
suggested a diagnostic technique that involved loosening a jet on the 
right hand side of the carb. I did more than loosten it. I removed 
it. This, and a twist of the distributor to give additional advance 
(too much, I know), gave me the idle I needed.  This is obviously a 
band aid and not a solution. I'm sure that these symptoms would lead 
a real mechanic to the real problem. But not me.

Because I am anxious to move the bus (after sitting in the driveway 
for 14 months), I  intend to put the engine back in tomorrow and just 
drive the bus.

This is the first time in many years of rebuilding acvws that I have 
not been able to fix a no-idle problem and it sure is frustrating.

Good luck with yours.
