I had virtually no mechanical experience, but lots of youthful =
cockiness, prior to rebuilding my first engine a year or so ago and it =
wasn't that hard. Buy some books, read as much as possible before doing =
it, and go slowly. You can save yourself some money and have some real =
pride in what you accomplish. I loved it and it makes me feel more =
united with my 71 beast. I would recommend a fairly stock engine though =
as I built a stroker for my first engine and ran into a plethora of =
problems. Although now I could throw a stock engine together in no time =
after what I was forced to learn. Good luck!=20
