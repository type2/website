Subject: Re: [T2] Points keep frying...

Sounds like you need to add an external ballast resistor to lower the voltage
going into the coil. Almost all Bosch coils have an internal built-in
resistor. Most after market coils do not unless it says it has one on the body
of the coil.
Years ago I used to get a Delco D1110 resistor to fix this, but I am not sure
they are around any more. They were used on 55-57 Chevys. [I am dating myself]
