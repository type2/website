First off those are not allen screws.  They require a different tool.  Which
the name escapes me at the moment.

Second...  Spray some Kroil or PB blaster on there,  If you have already
stripped the heads. The best thing to do would be to cut a groove in the
head with a dremel tool and use a flat head to take them out.  Remember if
they are in any kind of a bind they won't budge.

Hope this helps
