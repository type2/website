Has anyone tried to patch up holes in their canvas?  Has anyone tried to =
cut holes in their canvas and sew in more screens?  My PO cut a large rec=
tangle in the side of the canvas.  The bus came with a piece of plastic s=
creen that fits the hole, but how do I get it to stay on?  I was debating=
 between sewing it or using some type of glue that remains flexible.  Has=
 anyone attempted anything like this?  I would prefer to have the screen =
zip out and also have a piece of canvas that will cover it (like they usu=
ally come new).  Any suggestions are appreciated.  I'm just trying to sav=
e a few dollars.
Thanks for reading,
Kyle
