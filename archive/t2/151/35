Got plenty of time; so what would anyone recommend for "unsticking"
an engine that's been sitting for (?) long? Anything to pour into the
spark plug holes/fill the engine before trying to "gently" turn the en-
gine over by hand....Both VW and H2O engines were "donated" to me
in similar condition, so info/experience with either would be appreci-
ated...
TIA
