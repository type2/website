Subject: 2.0L Engine Source?

Hi All,

My 77 Westy may need a new engine soon (possible rod
knock).  I'm in San Diego, and was wondering if anyone could
recommend a local, reliable air-cooled mechanic to diagnose my
problem.  Also, who are your favored vendors for rebuilt 2.0 L
engines?

Thanks,
RickG
