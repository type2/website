Subject: Wire Disconnected from Fuse Box


Good Afternoon,

My lights don't flick from high to low beam and I want to fix them.  I have
been trying to interpret the Bentley wiring diagrams and my wiring Bundle
under the Steering Wheel, and I located a brown wire that is dis-connected
and just hanging.  I believe this to be the culprit.

How do I know where to plug the wire from reading the Bentley book?  To
which fuse and which place?   It is on track 22 for the 1973 Bus wiring
diagram, but I can't figure out where to connect it from the book.

Can someone please advise how to read this out of the Bentley manual.  It
should stop snowing here and be warm this weekend so I hope to get to work
on the bus Sat & Sun!

Thank you,
Shawn
Montreal, Qc
