I'm not too sure this is correct bob. Section 5 page 49 of my bentley
says this:
note: <excess stuff removed> The oil seal must be seated squarely in
the crankcase recess

From this i take it that seated means all the way to the back of the
lip. Now bentley doesn't say one way or the other "all the way till
bottoming out" but I have always considered seated to mean that.
Anyone have any comments?
