well that pretty much says it.

I just got done replacing the rear (square cage) bushing for my 78 westy.=
  What a pain in the ass that was.
I put the new bushing on the front last week, and still couldn't get into=
 4th.
doin 50 on the highway in 3rd is no fun.
so I decide to replace the other one in back.

There was no room to work, smelly whale oil up to my elbows, and I sure h=
ope it stays together so I never have to change it again.

But it shifts a whole lot better now, the old cage was basically free to =
spin, it's a wonder I could shift at all before.

If anyone is thinking of trying it, be prepared to spent a while doing it=
 and don't let the neigbor's kids hear the kind of language you'll use to=
 accomplish the task at hand.

Grind it till it fits
78 westy
