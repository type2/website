Subject: shift linkage sucks!

 
--Word, I'm staring down the barrel of this one, as my shifter sucks as well.  Have to shove it into 2nd/4th most of the time. Having currently learned from Bolen and Dolan (I'm a poet) that I'm missing a spring among other things, I guess this is next.

Do you have to drop the tranny for this one, or is that just the rear shift rod bushings?

I'm working on it.
