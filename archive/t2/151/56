Thanks for the offer.

I planned ahead (for a change) and saved both the left and right bearing 
housings and stub axle from a '73 I stripped for parts a few years ago.

I've got parts, just got to do the work.

Definitely agree on doing the work yourself. I HATE paying somebody to do 
what i can do for myself. At my hourly pay it would take several hours to 
pay the going shop rate. In other words my time is cheap!!

Take care.
