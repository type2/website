Concur whole-heartedly. For the coil, either a good used Bosch item from 
any similar era motor, or a NOS or used Bosch Blue. The Blue Coils now 
being supplied under the same number as the Blue Coil are from Brazil, 
silver case with a dark blue sticker. As they have been around a year or so 
now, it would seem they do the job just dandy. I haven't heard of anything 
negative as yet about the Brazillian "Blue", but I've only sold 3 or so. 
And, as appears to be expected, when original German parts are replaced by 
other world production, the price of the replacement remains the same as 
the original German part price.

Bottom line, if you make ALL components in the WHOLE ignition system Bosch, 
you will eliminate all ignition problems. How much will it save in 
time/money not to continue with repeated failures for the next month?? Use 
that time/money to install Bosch for everything in the system now, then the 
only remaining ignition system service will be by factory maintenance 
inspections only for an undeterminable amount of years.
