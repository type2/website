Subject: 90.5s in a bus

Re my '71 Westy, immobile since Feb 01:

I'm inching closer and closer to abandoning my usual practice of 
cobbling together engines from parts I have lying around and used 
cases I find.  My recent track record for rebuilds has not been good. 
As much as I like fiddling and rebuilding, I enjoy driving even more.

Many thousand miles ago, my son bought a GB kit for his '69 bus and 
has never had to even tweak it, much less rebuild it. This approach 
is suddenly very appealing to me.

Despite my misgivings about how pricey these GB kits are, I visited 
his web site.  I read there where, for his 1776 kit in a bus, he 
recommends using 88 mm Ps&Cs instead of 90.5s. He simply states that 
the engine will last a little longer.

I have a set of GB 90.5mm heads, Ps&Cs that I sure would like to reuse.

Is anyone running 90.5s in his bus? Any longevity or temperature data 
to guide me toward 88s or 90.5s?

Thanks, Jack
