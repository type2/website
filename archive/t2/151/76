I believe Home Depot sells a liquid latex used to dip tool handles in -
comes in blue, red, black.  Personally I use E600 or a liquid urethane
similar to GOOP.  Very tough- layer this on some cloth and then I dare
you to rip it with your hands!  For big holes, you may need to put the
goop on a patch first and then stick it over the hole.  Bridge over it
with masking tape if you are working vertically.  Use goop or patch
cement for vinyl in small screen holes.  For really big ones, I use a
piece of screening and sew it over the old screen.  Yes youcan glue the
edges, but doesn't look as ince.
