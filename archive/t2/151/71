Did you replace the condenser at the same time as the points?  With a Bosch 
one?  Like Muir says,
"points and condenser go together like bread and butter."

I personally, would not use ANY ignition parts other than Bosch.  I have 
had nothing but trouble when
I have done so.  I would begin with replacing that non-Bosch 
coil....................
