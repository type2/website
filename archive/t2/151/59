Subject: A/C Condenser fans needed

Volks,

I am in need of a couple of fans, the ones that sit on top of the large 
square A/C condenser that is attached underneath many busses that were 
fitted with aftermarket air.  Both of mine have died.  :(

I am having a very hard time finding other fans to replace them - the 
standard flat fans that everyone sells are all too big - they only sell 10" 
and I need 8".  I bought a pair of 10" fans thinking I could make them fit, 
but there is interference on both sides from steel tubes which contain 
either accelerator/parking brake cables or the wiring harness, and I'm not 
about to move those.  I'm looking into possibly installing a different 
condenser that does not have all of these clearance problems, but until I 
can do that, I could really use one or two of the original fans to get me 
through another 100-degree summer here in Dallas.  I will make it worth 
your time!

Thanks,

-David
