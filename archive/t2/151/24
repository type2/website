I have a 71 Westy with a stock distributor (not 009) and dp 1600.  The 
problem is that I can not get my carb to idle without it shutting down.  
It will fast idle with choke ok but as soon as carb butterfly opens then 
carb will die.  I have rebuilt carb, blown out jets with compressed air 
and followed Bentley as close as possible.  Short of buying a new one 
for $170, please help!  Thanks. Bruce.
