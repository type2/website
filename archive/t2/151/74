Does anyone have any previous experience with the work BAP Import Parts does, w/their Virtually New Engines? 
i've recently installed one of their 1600DP in my 70'Westy. replaced the topend on her. and have just rolled over 500Miles, breakin it in. w/no problems sofar;)
But i would really appreciate any info that you all might have, on the work they do. 
we're gettin ready to move back to the midwest from Oregon. and it would be nice to have any heads-up, that might help me out along the way. 
thanks in advance for your time and attention, it's much appreciated!! a gr8ful peace out to you and yours, -chris
