Subject: Re: [T2] Urgent! Need help with alignment

I checked the camber with a borrowed bubble protractor (great tool!) and 
found it within specs, so I do think the toe-out was causing the tire wear. 
Handling seems better now and I'm going to watch the tire wear on this 
roadtrip. Incidentally, in the midst of the alignment work I discovered 
where the clunk in the front end was coming from. It seems the clamp on the 
drag link end had worked itself loose and the drag link end was banging back 
and forth on its threads. (Lucky it didn't come off!). I tightened it back 
up and the clunk disappeared, along with about half of the play in the 
steering, but the damage is done and the drag link end will have to be 
replaced. Can you buy these individually, like tie rod ends, or must you 
purchase the whole drag link? I've only seen the latter advertised.

Thanks,
