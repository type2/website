Subject: tire size 72 westy ?'s

what is the tire size i need on my 72 west, i
currently have car tires on it and want to go with
something more appropriate like light truck tires.  if
a wider size would be better than stock then that
would be cool also but stock is just fine with me as
i'm going for functionality over looks on this.
