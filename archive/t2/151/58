Subject: Re: [T2] Tires

Good info, but a minor correction:  The Michelin Agilis61 is not a highway
rib tire, but rather an all-season tire which is one reason why I selected
it over some of the other choices you mention.  Yes, it is super pricey :-)

I think there are some models of the Agilis that are more of a highway rib
design but the Agilis61 in 185R14 is not.  Those retail for right around
$100 each.
