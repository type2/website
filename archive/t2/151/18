Subject: early bus front beam to '69 Bay?

Weird question.

I've got a '69 that will be donating it's front beam for my 23-window 
project. I've got many split bus link-pin beams lying around. Since 
the bolt pattern is the same, I should be able to bolt one of these 
up to the '69 bus...right? I know it's going backwards in every way, 
but just wondered if anyone has done it or knows of any problems 
other than it sitting lower in the front with the old bus beam?
