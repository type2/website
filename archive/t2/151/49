Hi All

I've got a type IV long block out of an 80 Westfalia. 
It has 88K on it, but got 23 mpg on trips and 17 mpg
local when in the vanagon camper.  It was leaking oil
at push rod tubes and other common places.  In order
to keep wife happy and driveway clean I had it
replaced.  Aside from oil drips, it has demonstrated
great performance.  $590.  Give me an email
<robandjeanne(-at-)access4less.net>

Rob
