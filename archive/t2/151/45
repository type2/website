Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump connection

Edward

There is 2 connections that point upwards,, they are larger,[inlet]  and
smaller,[to carbs], the other one that is much smaller, points to the bottom, is
a vent,,and originally it had a hose on it that went into the tin that the
intake breather draws air from,,,, but most I have seen just leave the 4" hose
hanging down towards the ground.

Hope that helps
