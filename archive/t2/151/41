Jim,
I (think?!) I have it squared away.  After hooking up
the VR, I had a couple of wires that wouldn't match
up.  The "Gen" light stayed on after ignition and I
went through the troubleshoot list in Bentley.  I was
getting ever closer to the remove Alternator remedie
when I finally made sense of the wiring diagram.  The
problem that I had with the engine swap was that it
left me with a male push-on connector (to the Gen
light and brake warning light) and a male connector
coming off of the D+ of the VR.  In addition, the
wires weren't even close to the same colors.  Slipped
on a wire with female ends to connect the two, fired
it up and the light went away.  Problem solved.  Moral
of the story, when dealing with thirty year old
engines from a different chasis, never assume that the
wiring done by any of the previous owners matches
exactly to the diagrams in the manual.  I am now a big
believer in diagnosis over brute force removal and
replacement.  I would have been very sad if I had
spent my weekend replacing the alternator only to find
the wiring still wasn't right.
