Matt,

You can put por-15 anyplace that does *not* already have grease or paint.

Go back and read the faq at their site.  

Lot's of rust flakes is no good, shiny new metal like a "key" is no 
good....

Por-15 "wants" something with "tooth" to stick to.
And it better be clean...as in no salt or dirt residue left on it....that 
is why the push their "metal ready" and "marine clean" type stuff.


Cheers, dave
