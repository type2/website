Subject: clutch cable

snapped my clutch cable today, way out in the desert.
I was able to drive it back by elegant shifting and
masterly driving. (Yeah, right. The jeep tracks were
ok, but those stop lights when i got back to
civilization...) 

I got bentley and Muir and a smidgeon of experience.

But, before I start, does any experienced hands have
hard-won tips on getting then new one in? (Please
don't tell me that the '68 takes a cable found only in
the Smithsonian.)

tnx.
