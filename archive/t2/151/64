The best luck I've had is with liquid latex. It creates a semi-flexible 
but very tough bond. They used to sell  this in quart bottles at camping 
supply shops back when tents were made of canvas. You might be able to 
find it at a high-end bicycle shop. Racers use it to coat the sidewalls 
of sew-up tires.

For patching holes in the screens I went to a fabric shop and bought 
tule, doubled it over and glued it directly to the screen. For a 
temporary patch job this works quite well and is WAY cheaper than tent 
screening.
