Our daughter, now 16 and learning to drive, has literally grown up with
our 78 Westy, bought  when she was 1 yr old from the first owner with
60K on it.  Now it has 233,000 mi on it with nothing more needed than
pushrod seals, muffler, shocks, starter, a clutch replacement, front
rotors, and cv joints (still working but a treat while clutch was being
done.)  Definitely worth the $3500 we paid.
The mods (especially the extra center bed) can be seen at the following
web site (pemail me for pics) , but please, don't all acess it at once
or they will shut it down for too many hits like get on when the day of
the mo. = letter in the alphabet of your name?)!
