Subject: Re: [T2] !!still!! missing.

I just went through a similar epic trouble shoot on my 72 with a FI 1800.
I found several contributing problems largely due to sloppy maintenance on
my part.(clogged air cleaner and fuel filter.
I also found that the driver side intake manifold was loose and causing a
vacuum leak.
My timing was slightly off as well.
The wiring harness plug to the double relay was also loose in the socket so
i put electric grease on it and taped it together.
This work killed the miss I had at lower rpm, idle and cruise (the vac leak
I think was critical)
I still had a miss under load at high rpm and this indeed turned out to be
the fuel pump.
I hooked a fuel line up to a compression test guage I bought for 5 bucks at
garage sale and kept a fire extinguisher handy. Did the test as per Bently
manual, all checked out. Drove it again, same problem.
Hooked up makeshift fuel press. guage again and pumped accellerator linkage
by hand to "load motor"
and low and behold my fuel press dropped below 18psi for 5 or 10
seconds.........BINGO!!
I dont want to get you chasing your fuel system needlessly but if you exaust
your other options I would do the above test and then do the step by step FI
troubleshoot layed out in the bently book.
I feel your pain!!
