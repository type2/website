Subject: Re: [T2] Question for the electrical experts

Some quick answers and a question or two.
1. the bug switch does not have a built in relay, only contacts that switch from
open to closed
2. Yes it can be described in layman's terms but a few questions need to be
asked first

Questions before proceeding.
1. Am I correct in guessing that the blower only has two leads coming out of it,

    One for power and one for ground?
2. What does the package list the current draw as (in amps)?
     I need a value for this one, for instance 3 amps, 10 amps, etc.

That should be enough to get us going for now.
