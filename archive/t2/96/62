Subject: Bodywork Question

Here's a question for all you bodywork experts out there...........

I'm getting The Duck ready for a paint job later this month.  I've been 
stripping her down.  I took off the center runner cover behind the sliding 
door.  No problems; it turned out to be a pretty easy job.  However, I am 
running in to problems with the runner cover on the DRIVER side.  There is no 
sliding door on this side, but a cover is used on this side also.  I managed 
to get the three screws out from the bottom.  But this thing will not budge.  
Doesn't even wiggle.  I know it cannot have the same screw driven pressure 
mechanism holding it in place as the sliding door side cover.  So, what 
gives?  How do I get this cover out?

Sure would appreciate some input on this one.
