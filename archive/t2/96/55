I am using the single vacuum distributor from the 78 engine. The P.o. thought it was
a major selling point for his dead bus that it had a 009 dizzy? Asked if he still
had the original, he said he threw that piece o junk out years ago. Oh well, he is
entitled to his opinion. I have stopped the port that points to the rear of the bus
and plan to set the timing at 7.5 btdc per 78 specs.

Other than the distributor and the long block from the 78, everything else is 75
vintage. Unfortunately the 78 engine didn't come with the ECU or the intake air
sensor. I have stored all of the other F.I. parts in the hope that once my budget
recuperates from the rebuild, I will switch to the 78 F.I.
Thanks,
Tom
