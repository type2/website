Subject: RE: [VB] Stripped Threads, oil drain plate

In the past I have salvaged old 40hp blocks with all sorts of stripped
thread problems. The method I use is the same as the head studs, I insert a
6mm case saver. I will have to go out to my tool box and check the drill
size and tap size for the external threads. I insert them with a little JB
Weld on the outside threads into a thoroughly cleaned case and after 24
hours of setting, I insert the 6mm studs with a little locktight, I use 524
red. The case savers I get come from a local bolt and nut dealer called
Tacoma Screw. They can get anything metric and it has been a life saver for
me. The only items I can't get are the fancy half round head screws for the
hinges and striker plates and such.

On an old 1600 DP engine I'm working on, I have discovered that one of the
holes where the studs that hold on the oil drain plate is stripped out.  So
would you either: 1)Re-tap the threads with the next bigger size,  2)Put
some sort of heliocoil in there (if so what, how, where do I get it) or
3)Just deal with the 3 inch puddle of oil that collects under the car where
it is leaking around this stud.  All the other holes around the drain plate
are fine, so I can tighten it down ALMOST enough with these other nuts to
stop the oil leak, but not quite all the way.
P.S. I know this message is a grammatical (or is it grammarical?) nightmare,
so If there are any English teachers out there, please ignor (or better yet,
diagram these sentences for me and return it by the end of the day!)
