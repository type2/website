It's in better shape than you would expect for $500, I
just want to get rid of it so I can get the new westy
on the road. The reason I am considering the engine
transplant is because the 74 westy is the one I wrote
about with the sloppily installed beetle engine.

Ah, now we see. It's OK to trash the 411 to save the
Bus...I can see it now... A pitched battle between the
411 and Bus vigilantes. To the victor belongs the
engine!
