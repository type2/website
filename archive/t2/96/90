Subject: Recovering the seat cushions - HELP!

How much material do I need to reupholster the interior of our '78 Westy? 
We plan to recover everything.

I've heard 12 yards of fabric but I want to get a second opinion.

By the way when any of you start looking for fabric - and it you want to 
stray from the original colors - look around your city or town. Locally we 
have a surplus furniture upholstery supplier - they get the ends of the 
rolls of fabric for couch and recliner manufacturers here in the south 
east. Some of it has UV inhibitors in the fabric (won't fade badly).

We found another store about 30 miles from home with a better selection and 
possibly better prices (at first glance) .

Both are deals where you need to buy what you need the first time b/c they 
may not be able to get more and thus the reason I want to be sure to get 
enough material.
