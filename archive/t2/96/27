Subject: FS: Freshened Square port heads

Hi Gang...

Title says it....this is a pair of freshened square port heads to fit 79
2.0 Bays or 80 to 83 Vanagons.

I had them freshened with valves faced, and seats done(replaced with the
harder Stelite material and super swaged<SP?>) and lapped to be sure
they were 100%.

Engine they came from was rebuilt less than 3000 miles ago, but the cam
went south in a hurry, so I pulled it.

Make me an offer, and they're yours before ebay gets them...digital pics
available on request...

Will be interested in a trade for new cam and lifters from Engle or
Webcam..

Give me a hoot if you're interested...

Thanks, Den
