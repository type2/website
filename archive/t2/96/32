I agree on both counts. Certainly this is not for everybody. It's not for a
person who wants a vintage Westy camper interior, as a used one in good
shape could be found for less money.  It's for someone who wants a more
modern camper setup, but with the looks and mechanicals of a bus - a
Vanagon/Eurovan Westy on the inside but a bus on the outside, so to speak.
