Subject: Carb Question

Carburetor Question:
1970 type 2 w/ original stock equipped engine:
Specifically, question on the Throttle Valve Positioner adjustment via 
"pull rod".
Visual Reference:
Bentley manual page 17; Fig. 5-17
Bentley manual page 29; Fig. 7-6
Bentley manual page 28/29; para. 7.3

The pull rod on the one piece throttle valve positioner adjusts as to 
length, as described in the Bentley manual.... OK, I understand.

But, Further QUESTION:
On the actual carburetor body, is there / was there a boss or cast knob 
upon which the end of the pull rod would have fit on to, or might there 
have been a pin that served as a double mating piece to secure this rod to 
the carburetor?
