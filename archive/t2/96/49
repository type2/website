Subject: Re: [T2] Shell Rotella/XLA

Thanks for all the responses. The consensus seems to be that Rotella is a
pretty good oil, so I'll check my local sources to see what's available.
Your comment on ash is noted, Steve, but I notice in the specs on the page
you linked that the Castrol in 15W40 has more ash than the Rotella in the
same viscosity. The Castrol 20W50 does list a lower ash content, though.
That shouldn't be a problem since I plan to change the oil frequently, like
at 2000 miles.

Thanks again for the advice,
Dave
