Pete,

I know you have the problem solved, but let me add one more data point for
the archives...  I use a 6" stiff putty knife and 1 kilo sledge. insert
the knife in the underside of the cover, up against the junction between
the cover and body clip, then giive the end of the knife a couple whacks
with the sledge.  Move the knife along a bit and do it again.  After 2-3
trips up and down the cover, it is popped along its length.
