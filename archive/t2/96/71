Subject: Side Glass

Good evening everyone.

While I was gazing upon my Bus, wondering about the steering column, my eyes
wandered back to the left rear window.  The ventwing is all askew and I
can't open it, and the seal around the whole thing is bad.

Can I swap in a right rear glass into the left rear position?  I don't
really want a ventwing there, and it looks like it would fit(ie, it looks
completely flat), but I thought I'd better ask before I start ripping and
tearing.  Anyone?

Thanks much.
