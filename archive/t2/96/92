Subject: Re: [T2] Recovering the seat cushions - HELP!


If you are not married to replacing everything to original specs...
I went with a marine quality fabric.  It comes in a variety of colors and 
styles, It costs a little more but it is some sort of super scotchguarded, 
Melissa and i have found it to be very durable, and easy to clean, esp with 
2 kids under 2 and the dog.

fwiw,
