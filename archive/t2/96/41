Rotella's good stuff. It's made for diesels, which run at higher temps than
gas engines. (However, a diesel has even lower tolerance for overheating
than a VW aircooled engine does, if that's possible.) I run the 30-weight in
my Bug (in the Bus I am trying a few different things; right now I've got
SAE 40 Exxon Superflo in it since it's the only SL-rated oil the FLAPS I
went to had) and would recommend you do the same between April and October.
