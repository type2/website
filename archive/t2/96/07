Holy schmokes, Mr. Gates!  No doubt our friends who emptied the coffers at
Chrysler will be glad to sell you the fuel line by the meter full, but I
bought it by the foot from a little hole in the wall foreign car parts store
here in Flint (home of GM, no less) for a whole lot less than that.  I'd
shop around a little, just stick to German or foreigh car part shops and
make sure you get the metric, not the American standard, hose.
