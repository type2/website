 I had a tough problem getting the passenger side cover off my bus.  The trick for me was to use a 2x4 and a rubber mallet to knock it off.  Put the 2x4 lengthwise against the bottom of the cover and give it several knocks with the rubber mallet.

I'm getting The Duck ready for a paint job later this month. I've been 
stripping her down. I took off the center runner cover behind the sliding 
door. No problems; it turned out to be a pretty easy job. However, I am 
running in to problems with the runner cover on the DRIVER side. There is no 
sliding door on this side, but a cover is used on this side also. I managed 
to get the three screws out from the bottom. But this thing will not budge. 
Doesn't even wiggle. I know it cannot have the same screw driven pressure 
mechanism holding it in place as the sliding door side cover. So, what 
gives? How do I get this cover out?

Sure would appreciate some input on this one.
