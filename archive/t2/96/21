Subject: Dead Front axle beam (Was: UPDATE: NJ inspection woes)

Patrick,

Point a browser at:

That is a dying beam.  look at the uprights on either end of your beam for
any sign of rust.  Since my experience has been that the beam rusts out
from the inside, by the time you see it, the only solution is to replace.
Also, replace quickly!  The first sign means that vast areas are thin and
you can go from godd to marginal to dead in a matter of months.
