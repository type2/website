Hi Volks,

I've removed this part from 4 different rusty Ontario buses, and the way
that has worked for me is with a 12" length of 1x4, slipped UNDER the cover
so it will apply force as closely as possible to the slot where the cover is
binding.

Whack the board, move forward 6", give it another whack. Keep moving along
the cover from end to end working back and forth, and eventually it will let
loose.

With the buses I've dismantled the screws almost always break as they're
coming apart. One trick I've found is to TIGHTEN the screws very slightly
before trying to loosen them, this will break the corrosion without
stripping the threads you need to back the screw out. It's a technique that
also helps with rounded out engine tin screws.


Happy trails,
