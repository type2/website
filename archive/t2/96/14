Hi thee to Home Depot and check out their rolls of 6 ft wide carpeting
which is not cut but looped-(berber??) - We cut it with tin snips after
marking it.   Do judicious measuring to make a graph template or Use
newspaper to make a template of the floor, folding the edges, and taping
in the piece that indents by the fridge.   Plan it so the edge facing
the sliding door is a finished edge.  We pull it out and shake out the
sand after shore trips.
