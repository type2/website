Subject: 74-79 camper wanted in NC/SC/VA /GA

Hello all,
 A club member is looking for a 74 to 79 camper.
He says
"I'm in the market for a replacement and just wanted to get the word out if
you might know of any on the market.  I don't need perfect, but I also can't
take on a major restore right now.  I'm completely sold on the type that
pops from the back. ('74-'78?)  If you have any leads, they would be most
appreciated."

Any one have one within 5 to 6 hrs driving distance of Charlotte NC ??
Thanks
Bryan
