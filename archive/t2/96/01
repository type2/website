Anyone have an explanation for oil dripping (streaming) off the engine
between the #3 & 4 cylinders?  Only happens when the engine is first started
on cold mornings?  I know the usual suspect is a cracked case by the oil
cooler but I'm hoping there are other potential (less expensive) causes.

Thanks in advance
