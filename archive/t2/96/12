I had a local kid stop by the house and offer me a '73 Westy (VERY rough) 
if I would get it out of his parents' driveway. Seems they were threatening 
him about it. Went and got a pickup from my in-law and the car dolly from 
my father 90 miles south and went across my town to fetch it. Hooked up to 
it and said a few prayers b/c we were at the top of a long, steep driveway. 
The rear brakes were locked up so I had to drag it all the way down the 
hill. Then I backed it up a bit and the brakes came loose and the trip home 
was fine. We stripped the drivetrain (I wanted the engine) and offered the 
rest of the bus to friends and to this list. Some folks came from Nashville 
and got some panels using my Sawz-All.

All went well until a few weeks later when the kid showed up and wanted his 
bus back or some money. I told him he could take the bus if he wanted it 
but he better do it quick before I cut it up and took it to the crusher 
(everything worth anything was gone) and I did not have any money to give 
him b/c that wasn't the deal.

Never saw him again but I heard through mutual friends he had a "habit" and 
had run out of money.

Oh well. Hope he is still out there and at a better place in life.

Sawed the bus into 2 big pieces and loaded it onto my little 8x10 ft. 
utility trailer. Think they gave me enough to wash my bus after slithering 
around in the mud at the scrap yard.

Ciao!
