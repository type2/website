Mike,
    You asked..."Can I swap in a right rear glass into the left rear =
position?  I don't
really want a ventwing there, and it looks like it would fit(ie, it =
looks
completely flat), but I thought I'd better ask before I start ripping =
and
tearing.  Anyone?"

    Yes you can.  Get yourself another right rear glass and put it into =
the left rear position using a right rear seal.  I've personally done =
it, as have many others before you, and it works fine.  The openings are =
the same size.
