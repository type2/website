Subject: Windows and Columns

Thanks everyone for the info and advice on swapping rear windows and the
steering column on a bay.

For reasons I won't go into now,  I want a different ignition switch in my
76, and I think I have that figured out.  But I don't know what to do with
the present switch mount, short of getting out the ziz wheel.  Oh what to
do.  The window will be an easier conversion, and I appreciate the responses
to my questions.
