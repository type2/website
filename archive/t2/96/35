Subject: Re: [T2] 411 Engine

Hi,
For those of you who have been asking about the 411
itself, it is a 2dr wagon with a 1.7 and auto tranny.
It's in better shape than you would expect for $500, I
just want to get rid of it so I can get the new westy
on the road. The reason I am considering the engine
transplant is because the 74 westy is the one I wrote
about with the sloppily installed beetle engine.
Thanks, 
Tyler
BTW I am located in Englewood,
Colorado
