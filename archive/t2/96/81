there is no connection on my current set-up from the coil to the second 
battery relay - should there be?

  the relay is good. i have several of these relays, which are all good 
(from another parts car, it's just a 30A bosch relay).
but the wiring on my current set-up doesn't make sense to me, since 
there is no way that i can see for the relay to switch on and off. a 
wire from the coil would make sense to me, and i will try it.
