Hi,

I came in kinda late here but on early model bays the was throw out 
bearing sleeve in the bell housing the kept the TO bearing from 
coming off the throw out arm and reeking havoc in the bell housing. 
The item was dropped sometime in 70 or 71 when the 3 arm pressure 
plate was replaced by the multi finger variety. Could this be what 
you are referring to?
