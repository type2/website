Jim,

If your looking to run Rotella, try Rotella T.
Diesel oils are  heavier duty, resist fuel wash, and have good viscosity
durability.

If you don't run Rotella T, try Kendall--another excellent heavy duty
diesel motor oil, that will give you excellent performance, in a air
cooled engine.

Later,

Terry

What is the opinion on the list of the Shell Rotella 15W40 dino oil? It
would be for use in a daily driver 1974 T2, 1.8 ltr, with hydraulic
lifters. I live and drive in western KY where the winter temps rarely go
as low as 0F and usually average in the 30's to low 40's. In the summer
we can have daytime temps of 90+ for days or weeks at a time. Most of my
driving is short trips, ie, 10 miles to work, 5 miles to Wally World, 20
or 30 miles of errands around town, with an occasional 50 mile trip to
the big city. 
Just looking for opinions, especially from those who have used this oil. 
Rotella's good stuff. It's made for diesels, which run at higher temps
than gas engines. (However, a diesel has even lower tolerance for
overheating than a VW aircooled engine does, if that's possible.) I run
the 30-weight in my Bug (in the Bus I am trying a few different things;
right now I've got SAE 40 Exxon Superflo in it since it's the only
SL-rated oil the FLAPS I went to had) and would recommend you do the
same between April and October.
