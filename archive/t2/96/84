Subject: Heater Blower relay

I am fairly certain that the relay for the aux. heater 
blower on my 72 Westy has given up the ghost. I know 
where I can get one but it's kind of expensive. I of 
course will check boneyards before I give up. 
My question: Is the stock relay the only one that will 
work or can another of similar amp rating work with 
minimal jury-rigging? BTW what is the amp rating for 
this relay?
TIA

Mike
