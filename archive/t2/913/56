Hi Tony,

That statistic is more than a decade out of date. It ignores the  
energy recovered by using wastes from the distillation produce as  
feedstock for domestic animals. There are a LOT of ways that these  
byproducts can be utilized. Then start using more efficient methods to  
distill and your yeild per btu gets a LOT higher.

Another little-known fact is that petroleum distillation also uses  
more energy than it produces. We're throwing away more than we use no  
matter how we get the fuel.

Happy trails,

Greg
