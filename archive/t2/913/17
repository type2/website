Subject: More windshield wiper troubles...

I was having some troubles with my wipers, so I tried to fix them.  It sounded simple enough, so i thought I'd give it a shot.  2 wiper assemblies later, I'm in a jam.  I ended up tightening the screw on the outside too tight, and stripped the thread of the wiper shaft.......twice. 

Where I'm at now, is trying to get the the one good thread from the one assembly, and trying to put it on the other assembly.  The problem is, I can't figure out how to get this darn circlip off to remove the shaft.  Does anyone know how I would go about getting this small part off?  If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's a small washer like piece holding the smaller shaft in a larger tube.  Any suggestions?   I'm aiming to get it off with out destroying it.  I may just end up buying a new one from a parts bus.  Thanks in advance.
