 We call these turret tops. Doc Ric has a '68 that has this top on it:

 In fact James Garrison had one of those tops to sell, but nobody makes the canvas replacement for it. I am
not sure if he still has it. He is in
 Greensboro, NC if anyone wants it and he still has it. Let me know and I'll call him.

West Coast Metric shows the canvas as "Canvas, Square Frame 3 Window Westfalia (European Only)"  68-79 as part
