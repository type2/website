That's a real shame.  I've been scuba diving around sting rays for years and have never even heard of such a thing.  Heck, you can feed them most places and then they won't leave you alone.  I've even been near Manta rays.  Those suckers are huge.  But any wild animal can get spooked if you get them into a corner.  And that thing probably hit him in the only fatal place that it could have. 
   
  More bus content:  I can't wait to take mine down to Pennekamp State Park in Key Largo for a lot more diving.  About the only decent diving near the mainland anymore.  The reefs are all dead not very far north of there.  RIP mate...KR

Got too close to a stingray apparently.
