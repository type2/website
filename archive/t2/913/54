ADM's scions on K Street were also behind the 54 cent per gallon
tariff on sugar-based ethanol from Brazil...Not to mention that 
without subsidies (which means that the taxpayers pre-pay the
corn growers for the corn...;-( , corn is just not an economical
source of ethanol...Add in the petro-based fuels and chemicals
used to grow it and the equation runs to the negative...i.e. you
could just be putting in more BTU's to make ethanol from corn
than you get back burning the ethanol... ;-(
