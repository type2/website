Subject: FW: [arizonabusclub] Jerome Update! 

Greetings,

 

Pre-Jerome Tune up Parties this Saturday the 9th  9am - 4pm


No excuse for not having a running ride to Jerome as the ABC sponsors tune
up parties at VW Island and Arizona Auto Care. 

Bring your air-cooled VW in and pick the brains of the friendliest and most
knowledgeable folks around; your ABC buddies. 


West Side     VW Island 4970 N. 7th Ave (602) 277-9078
East Side      AZ Auto Care 5235 S. Kyrene #42 (480) 820-2693

 

Join the caravan out of Phoenix Friday September 15th. Departing Home Depot
I-17 and Thunderbird at 8am sharp. 

 

Rules? Hardly any; show up in a VW, don't climb the rocky slopes, no
fireworks, do what Will says, bring cans of tuna for Evie, patronize our
generous donors and thank the folks who've built this raffle bus from the
ground up..... but most of all come and have FUN!
