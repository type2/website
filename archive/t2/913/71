$15,000 starting bid but the promo states that it was a
joint VW/TVA venture in '79...IIRC, the weight was about
4,500 empty and the the '79 bus (with double sliding doors)
looked like it needed a lot of work...Included is an official
looking VW manual...As they say in chess...Your move... ;-)

And an entire car-full of lithium ion batteries... ;-)

BTW, I read about some, well, you can't call 'em hotrodders, but...They
built an electric dragster that ran on something like a life-sized slot car
track and were up in AA Fuel Dragster country...The 'lectric motor was
mounted transversely in the rear of the rail and the slicks were mounted
to the motor's shaft...Hit the "switch" and the thing just keeps
accelerating...
To paraphrase Mazda, "Whir. Whir."
