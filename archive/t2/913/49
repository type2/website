Subject: Multi tasking German engineering

Checking the BD site for products, and I came across this:


 *Seal, Spark Plug Wire or Foot Pedals*
Spark Plug Wire Hole thru sheet metal, OR Clutch/Brake Pedal Shaft thru
floor

Wow...  The spark plug seal doubles as the clutch/brake pedal shaft seal ! !
!   What won't those german engineers come up with next ? ? ?
