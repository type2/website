I'm gonna depart from my normal diagnoses here and go
out on a limb... Replace the ignition points in the
distributor. Be sure to clean the surface under the
points with contact cleaner and a clean rag (don't get
carried away with the contact cleaner) and spray the
contact cleaner on the surface of the new points, too.
It wouldn't hurt to replace the condensor while yer at
it.

If this doesn't totally solve your problem I'll be
surprised... However, there are a number of other
possibilities. Someone else had a single loose wire in
the midst of the big double-relay multi-wire plugs
that has also happened to me but I had forgotten the
nightmare! If it makes an attempt to run it could be a
FI problem like a jammed vane in the airflow meter but
I doubt it. I think it is an electrical continuity
problem and probably that you are getting enough spark
only when conditions are perfect. Have you looked
recently at ALL of the hoses in the engine
compartment? The formed vacuum hoses are decaying away
and sometimes will appear to be attached firmly when
they are barely hanging on there. Any one of them not
firmly attached would cause no-start. Theoretically it
would be a consistent no-start however. Start at the
points in my opinion. - BaH
