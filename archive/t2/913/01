It really does work, I've used that trick for years and it's usually
successful.  Another helpful technique when threads are rusty
is to loosen a couple turns, then tighten it a turn, then loosen,
etc.  It takes time and can be a PITA, but it beats having bolts
& studs snap off.  Drilling & tapping takes even *more8* time.
