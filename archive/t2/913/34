You're in luck, Rob. I just happen to have one of
those assemblies sitting here in my living room! I dug
it out of the heap and proceeded to pop one of the
circlips loose. I just used needle-nosed pliers
pushing as equally as I could on both the ends at the
same time and on the fourth try it came loose. The
previous tries one side or the other of the pliers
slipped off.

You could also use a thread file if the threads are
just crossed up a bit. On the ones I have messed up
over the years, the nut has always given up before the
threads on the shaft. Have you really studied that?
