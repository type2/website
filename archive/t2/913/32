Sounds like a classic hot-start relay issue. The
majority of buses probably experience this to some
degree.

The road-side fix is to let the solenoid cool off,
might take 45min+, beat on the solenoid with a hammer
or screwdriver handle to loosen it up, or use a screw
driver to short the terminals (potentially dangerous,
be VERY sure you are out of gear)

The long-term fix is to install a hot-start relay (a
new solenoid might help for a while, but the problem
is mostly the old, long wiring to the ignition switch
in the cab). See the Type2 archives and library for details.
