The non-return flaps at the bottom of the heat-exchanger keep heated
air from the heat exchangers that's driven by the auxiliary blower fan
from entering the engine cooling tin at idle.  I'm not convinced these
make a big difference on engine temperatures, since they really only
close at idle when the auxiliary blower fan is on.  I'm also missing
these flaps, and my CHT doesn't rise at idle with the auxiliary blower
fan on.  These do make a difference to cabin heat, but mainly at idle.

The non-return flaps built into the auxiliary blower fan housing keep
heated air from from the heat exchangers that's driven by the engine
cooling fan from re-entering the engine compartment and getting
recirculated by the engine cooling fan.  These definitely make a
difference to engine temperatures.  I found that one side was missing
in my housing.  Sealing off the blower fan in the summer reduced the
CHT by 25 to 50 degrees.  These flaps will generally close above idle,
or anytime the auxiliary blower fan is off.
