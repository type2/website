Subject: Emissions Test Maryland 79 Bus

Patrick,
         Are you aware of Maryland's 'Historic' plate category?  Your 79 
vehicle is 25+ years old and should qualify.  You would not be subject to 
emissions testing, IIRC.

Some years ago you gave me several VW parts (maybe a Bay windshield).  If you 
need to borrow one, I have a 1970s era emissions tester, proctologist style.  
Have not used it lately but it was working when put up on the shelf.  I am 
across the Bay Bridge from you.

I got  a notice for the test, I have recently tuned the van, would an
emissions additive be recommended, any other suggestions.  Rather not do
$450 worth of fixes to perfectly running bus, thanks!
