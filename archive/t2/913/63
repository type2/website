Anyone notice I changed my sig line about 2 weeks ago?


Current solar cell efficiency is about 6%....the other problem is that 
they are still expensive.

I'm really begining to think about this at home as the prices for 
electricity rise.

Bus Content:  Anyone still have plans for electrifying a bus?

What this country needs is not a 5 cent cigar, but a cheap efficient 
battery...we have all the sunlight we can use....as long as we can store 
the power from it someplace besides biomass or heavy batteries.

Anyone seen the folks that are supposed to be producing the 250m range new 
eletric car that looks kinda like a ferrari or something?...and out 
accelerates it?

The only problem there is that it is expensive to be green...only $100,000


LOL! 

Cheers, dave.

Enough sunlight reaches the Earth *every* hour to meet the world's
energy demand for an entire year...The problem is, that sunlight is free.
