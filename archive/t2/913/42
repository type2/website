Subject: Odd occasional start problem

Hi everyone,

Thank you for the suggestions. I am receiving the correspondence
through digest mode right now so I apologize for the delay in
responding.

The solenoid idea sounds like a winner to me. I have a new ignition
switch, and have replaced the wire that goes from the coil to the
front of the bus so resistance should be very low.

Don, I haven't tested the voltage at the battery when she acts dead,
it is not my primary vehicle at the moment, but I will throw a
multimeter in the bus and drive it this weekend to try and replicate
the problem, then test the voltage. Since it didn't start with jumper
cables I figured the battery was just completely dead.

Thank you all for the help,

Max Bronsema
