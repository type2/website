Subject: [T2]empty master cylinder

bleeding brakes had hole in brake fluid reservoir.....

fixed that... bleeding brakes now and bunches of bubbles in back lines...

i can here the squeesh from the master cylinder...

i am guessing it is empty how to fill the master cylinder again or at least get past this....?

front brakes seem fine.... plenty of fluid and no air bubbles but back ones are awful...
slam full of air.....


thanks
chai
