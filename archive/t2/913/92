This is superseded to 311 911 023D.  We carry this in Bosch as an 023D (new)
and an 023DX (rebuilt; X always denotes rebuilt). The new one costs a bit
more, but you do save the expense of shipping back your core (and you get a
brand new starter).

The equivalent Bosch part numbers are SR15N and SR15X, respectively. (Our
site cross-references many Bosch numbers, including this one, so if you were
to type in the Bosch number it would simply take you to the equivalent VW
number.)
