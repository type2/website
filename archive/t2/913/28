I pass Cali smog every two years with flying colors.
Immediately before the test I do all this stuff:

Cap & Rotor
Plugs (if they are young ones, I check the gap)
Point Gap (replace if not pristine)
Check plug wires.
New Air filter
Fresh Oil
Valve adjustment
Check Idle speed & timing
Premium fill up
Temporarily re-install EGR hardware.
High power highway run to make sue it all works hot.

Since my mileage is low, this keeps P-II in good
running order between mileage-based maintenance. I'd
rather do all this stuff proactively, than attempt a
hail-mary smog-test and have to deal with smog-failure
complexities.

My AFM is pretty ratty, but doesn't seem to cause an
issue. 

Good Luck!
