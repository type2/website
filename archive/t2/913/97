Subject: Transmission Carrier Bolts

While under the bus yesterday, I noticed that one of the transmission
carrier bolts are missing.  Can anyone give me the size of that bolt?
Is there any special about it other than being hardened?  There is a
pretty good machine shop near by that should be able to hook me up
with a replacement if there is nothing magical about it.

Thanks in advance,
Ken
