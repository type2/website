Sometimes these things rust and come adrift


hey george  Come adrift???   heck these things just break  plum off the axle 
and I have only seen it happen on Bays. never seen a splittie  do it.  I have 
seen some very different methods of welding them back and  trying to beef them 
up. Angle iron welded across and up and down and all around  this part of the 
axle. Tom Hughes won the How Did You Get Here Award at Everybus  one year 
after having to do some fancy welding after his broke in a parking lot  half way 
there. I think this was a very weak design and they should have kept it  like 
it was on splitties  later  Mark  dearing
