Subject: [T2]steering box?

went to turn this morning to the right and pop i felt and then it was loose feeling...

pulled over and checked nothing rubbing nothing came loose...
got back and and every turn after that to the right popped and got loose...

lots of play there after the pop and each time it doesnt always pop as loud as the first time but its popping pretty much everytime you turn to the right...
...

 this sound like a possible bad going bad or already bad steering box?
