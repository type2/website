Subject: [T2] Serious & Simple Vacuum Leak Finding

Finding Vacuum leaks.
    
(1)  If engine is running, then spray starter fluid
along various vacuum leak candidate locations.  When
the engine flares, you've located your culprit.
  
(2)  If engine is not running, have a cancer-stick
user blow smoke into a vacuum line to see where the
smoke comes out.
   
Answer to a question not asked:
   
To find exhaust leak location(s), have a cancer-stick
user blow smoke into the exhaust pipe to see where the
smoke comes out.  May need several puffs.
