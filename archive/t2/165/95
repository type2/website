Subject: Small parts needed plus climbing shoes!

Hey Y'all,
Anybody got an extra starter\engine mount bolt laying around (the one with the "D" shaped head)? How about a tranny ground strap? I'm pretty sure year doesn't matter, but if it helps, they are for the '66 Kombi. I can give you cash or trade, I have a few trinkets on the shelves in the garage. Speaking of trading (are you reading this Frank B?) Are there any rock climbers out there on the list. I have an almost new pair of climbing shoes, high ankle, lace up, "Climb High" brand that I would trade for some VW stuff. Pretty much any VW stuff. I forget the size (european size) but I think the U.S. equivalent is about a men's size 9.5, I bought them at a going out of business sale from a local gear shop, and I got the size wrong. And of "No return" on clearance items. They have been used less than 15 times and then my feet just started hurting too much! They retail for about $100 beans, but I'd take MUCH less than that in trade merchandise! Let me know..
Your Pal, Horse-Tradin' Johnny B.
