Subject: woodworking bus/westy owners...

My neighbor has a Westy that they take out 2/3 times a year (NFS, I asked).
I built a small cabinet for them from birch plywood which leads to my next
question: A commercial building supply warehouse saves their cut-outs and
culls (bad one side) from their door inventory for me. Lots of birch and al-
most as much oak. Most doors are 1 3/4 thick and I've used the "slabs" to
make built-in cabinets and desks, etc. What I'd like to find out, is if anyone
has or can come up with a method of slicing the veneer from the doors. 
The doors are "solid" with a wooden edging and a low-density chipboard filler.
If you've done much woodworking/remodeling, I'm sure you know the type
of door I'm speaking of...I'd love to have a really cheap source of plywood
to redo my bus in oak...
TIA for any tips...
