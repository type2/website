Bad day at the office John?  I can understand your frustration in trying to
spread the word on timing issues that keep coming up on this list.  However,
you response seems a little harsh.  I can assure you that Chris was passing on
what he thought to be good information and that he was clarifying what he
thought to be a miscommunication between you and James.  I'm sure that he's
willing to defer to your knowledge and expertise in this area.

Myself, I've been following posts on this subject for a couple years and I'm
still confused about it, as others seem to be.

I've contemplated one of your SVDAs, but was under the impression they were
more suited to the type 4.  I take it from your post that this is incorrect.
In any event, I'd hate to think I'd receive a response like your last post if I
needed further information from you after the purchase of one of your products.

I think the list is probably a better place without the profanity.

Thanks,
