Subject: Ohio Valley Tribe

I've been thinking since Everybus that the
bussers in the valley need a way to communicate. 
You know, talk about carabussing, Frank's chili,
Baker's homebrew and tshirts, whatever.  So here
it is: 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ohiovalleytribe/.  

Join us if you live in West Virginia, Ohio,
Kentucky, Indiana, Pennsylvania (if you don't say
yuins too much), or anywhere else in the
universe, and would like to talk about busses.  I
would encourage you to join fullmoonbusclub also.
 LIMBO types are invited as well.  (It's not like
you're busy attending all those Limbo events
located outside of Mass....) :)

Peace and blessings,
