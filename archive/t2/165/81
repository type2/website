I think that we're describing the same thing in different ways, a common
problem in my profession.

The important thing is :

throttle closed, no vacuum
partial throttle, big vacuum
WOT throttle, not much vacuum

Whether you think of it as being transfer of vacuum from the manifold past
the butterfly or as vacuum due to Bernoulli at the signal port it
still works the same.
