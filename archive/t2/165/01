To the list,

Just drop off my 71 Westy the right front brake is pulling and locking up.
He had swooped the caliper from my 72 that had been work good with no
pulling. The master cylinder and hose have been replaced.

Chris,
From what I have been told 71 is one year only calipers.  72 should not
work.. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
