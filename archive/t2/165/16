Subject: Fan shroud refurbishing update (long)

Hello List, 

Well, the POR 15 that I ordered a couple weeks ago
just came in.  Usually, you receive the stuff that you
ordered within a week or so but they were having
computer problems. They even had a guy call me in
response to my email to them about the shipping delay.
Not only was he polite and professional, he even made
suggestions about my order that I had not considered
and helped me get what I really needed.

 Any way, I pulled the fan shroud out of the shop
where I had sat it after  I had sand blasted it. Well,
the aluminum was dull and spotted from the moisture in
the air so I used a bell brush on my angle grinder and
cleaned it up. I was shocked at how bright it turned
out. I wire brushed all the nooks and crannies with my
dremel tool. I then went over the hole thing with
steel wool. Next I used their Marine Clean to clean it
and rinsed it with water. The instructions say to use
the metal ready on the metal next. I tested this on
the bottom of the shroud where it couldn't be seen. It
turned the metal dark grey. I decided to take my
chances and paint the clear POR 15 on the rest of it
without the metal ready so it would stay nice and
bright. ( I hope this wasn't a mistake). Well, so far
so good. I am going to wait until I get back from work
tonight and then I will put another coat on it. As
soon as I am done I will send some more pictures. Any
way Have a nice day!

David Kelly
