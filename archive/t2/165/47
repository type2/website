Tony,

I know this would be one hell of a feat---just grabbing the glued on
veneer---

The glues that are used to stick this stuff on the composition board, is
almost bullet proof, and would be tough to lift just the veneer without
splitting or damaging it---

I think almost impossible--unless you had a band saw with a large enough
throat to accept the door's---but even then, you'd need a huge fence,
darn near on both sides, to get a straight cut just below the veneer---

Almost not doable

My thoughts on this one--

Later,

Terry

My neighbor has a Westy that they take out 2/3 times a year (NFS, I
asked). I built a small cabinet for them from birch plywood which leads
to my next question: A commercial building supply warehouse saves their
cut-outs and culls (bad one side) from their door inventory for me. Lots
of birch and al- most as much oak. Most doors are 1 3/4 thick and I've
used the "slabs" to make built-in cabinets and desks, etc. What I'd like
to find out, is if anyone has or can come up with a method of slicing
the veneer from the doors. The doors are "solid" with a wooden edging
and a low-density chipboard filler. If you've done much wood
working/remodelling, I'm sure you know the type of door I'm speaking
of...I'd love to have a really cheap source of plywood to redo my bus in
oak... 
TIA for any tips...
