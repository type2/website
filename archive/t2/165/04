Subject: Re: [T2] stuck valve covers


PO must've used Liquid Nails?  Contrary to the logical, cool VC removal 
process, I would suggest heating them up first.  Obviously they will spew 
oil, so have a drip pan(2) handy.  Rubber mallet under the bottom lip should 
free the gasket's bite.  Nothing wrong with gasket adhesive(if you use the 
right type) and it's applied sparingly.   I have tried them all, and have 
fallen-in-like with Aviation gasket.  It never hardens(remains tacky), 
brushes on easily, and wipes off(yes after many heat cycles) with some 
solvent.  Leak-proof(if your covers are straight).
