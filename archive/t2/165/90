Subject: Ball Joints

The subject line almost sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?! BUT it's not about some prostitute bar, it's regarding front ball joint replacement on an early bay (71). Is this the kind of job that the average shadetree VW mechanic like myself can do, or is it best left up to the "professionals" (as if there are any professionals in southwest Ohio). I have all the tools, experience, and knowledge to do things such as center pin bushings, engine R&R, clutch, brakes, tune-ups, etc. But are the ball joints one of those jobs that is best not attempted by oneself? Any advice or shared experiences appreciated.
