Maybe.  Some people claim that cracks in the exhaust ports are no 
problem.  Mark Stephens said this in fact (but then again he's out of 
business).  His documentation said that "stress-relief" cracks were normal 
and would appear quickly in new heads.  A friend of mine showed me a set of 
just-rebuilt heads from MSHP and they had several cracks in the exhaust 
ports.  I made sure there were none in my heads though - I picked them up 
in person.

My point is that while I don't believe cracks in the exhaust ports are 
normal, they might not be as bad of a sign as you think.  See if you can 
tell if they extend close to the seat area - if so, that's definitely trouble.
