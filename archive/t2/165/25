Subject: [T2] Engine dies   :)      Weber carb now

Rob,
	I haven't yet worked on any vw carbs. My only carb experience is w/
my IH Scout, so double check, but....

here is how a modern (relatively) carb works.

basically it's a air tunnel that gets smaller at a point in order to
create an area of lower pressure. This is how the gas gets pushed out
of the bowl & into the air stream atomized. This is very similar to
that old perfume pump thingies that women used to use (atomizer). Ok
so this is how we get gas into the airstream when the engine is
running. What about when not? Accelerator valve. This is some sort of
mechanical device that when you press the throttle it gives a squirt
of gas. This does a few things, one is on start-up to give the engine
something to start with since it's at a stand still. Another is when
you accelerate (see where the name comes from) & more gas is injected
into the air stream. This is to help overcome the delay in pressing
the throttle & the engine speed increasing.

Sorry for the quick lesson, but it might help you solve you problem.
Now, I would suspect that your main jet, or one of it's paths is
clogged. This is were all the gas has to come from, except for the
squirt from the pump (which is what you are witnessing). Unless there
is air flowing through the carb there should not be any trickel of
gas. I would try Snoopy's advice & try and clean the holy crap out of
it. all it takes is a small bit of particle to get stuck somewhere.
That carb soak kit works wonders as well. Hope this helps.
