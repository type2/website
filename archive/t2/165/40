Subject: Electrical woes... still

Whelp, as I said, switch is out, charger is out, new lighter installed,
radio is disconnected... all extraneous equipment removed... I jumped her
this morning and she started right up, drove around running errands all day,
stopped and started her, (she started right up again) parked her about 5
hours ago and her battery is already dead again...

I think it's time I brought her to the mechanics... sigh...
