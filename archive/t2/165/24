Subject: Front seat belts for Bay Windows.

I just trudged all over my local wrecking yard, seeking a suitable setup for
replacing those dreadful fixed seatbelts on my 70 Bus. I think I found
something pretty good- the rear shoulder seatbelts from an 86 Jetta. I found
a pair that look brand new and unused. It took some creative solutions, but
it seems it may just work out great. Those belts are one of the most
aggravating things on my bus!!
