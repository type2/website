excerpt from

EGR Valves - Ported vs. Manifold Vacuum

Contributed By: Michael Baxter

There are two sources of vacuum which is used to power many systems on our
FSJs. Manifold vacuum, which is the present in the intake manifold, is the
main source. It powers systems like the power brakes, heater controls,
diverter/air management valve, etc.

The manifold vacuum signal is high at idle and even higher when
decelerating at relatively high engine speed with the throttle valves
closed.
...
Now it is possible you confused manifold vacuum with port vacuum. Port
vacuum signal is generated via Burneulli's Principle in the carb's
venturi. The larger the volume of air flowing through the carb., the
stronger the vac. signal. At idle there is very little air flowing through
the carb and the vac. signal is very small. Basically no vacuum. At
wide-open throttle (WOT) and high RPM, the port vacuum signal is
strongest.
...

I know someone is running around with a vac gauge attached. What does it
show?
