Well, I would disconnect the battery from the battery cables and connect a
multimeter to each of the cables and test for the existence of  an open
circuit. If there is none you simply have a battery that does not hold a
charge.

 If you determine there is an open circuit, take out each fuse one at a time
until the circuit closes. You then know where to look for the short.

If you remove all fuses and the open circuit remains, you have narrowed the
hunt to a few locations.



Ok, that's done...  Didn't find anything... the multimeter read 3.5 the
whole time, pulled every fuse and nuthin... what's left?

Thanks,
