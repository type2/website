excuse my french, but this advice is bullshit.

It is true that you don't want to exceed 30-32 on a wedge chamber (no semi
hemi) engine UNDER FULL LOAD, but part throttle cruise requires another
10-15 degrees of timing (unless you like losing 4mpg and a hotter running
engine). If you understand how vacuum advance works, it disappears at 1/2
throttle, leaving you with the hose-disconnected timing (Wow, 30-32 degrees,
remember?).

Don't perpetuate the 009 timing settings as being all encompassing,
including vac advance distributors. If you don't believe me, take a stock
1974' or newer car and rev it in the driveway and tell me what timing #s you
come up with, it's not "acceptable for a T-4", it doesn't matter which
engine it is.

Tell ya' what. I have $1k that says that SVDA will run cooler, and get 3mpg
better mileage, then a 009, if timed as I say to time it. Wanna' put your $
where your mouth is?
