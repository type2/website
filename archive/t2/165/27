It runs, it runs!!!

Apparently I had a dirty carb. I took it apart and cleaned it with carb
cleaner, blowing out the fittings with holes (jets?) and reassembled it.

It took a few seconds for the gas to do its thing, but it fired up and drove
around the block real good.

A more extensive test drive is in order, but I am ready for a shower and a
cigar!!

I couldn't have done it without the list. Another $125 or so saved.
