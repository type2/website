Ported vacuum as required by vacuum advance distributors IS manifold vacuum,
with one exception. Because of the location of the hole, there is no vacuum
at a closed throttle (since the hole is then above the throttle plate).
Contrary to some rumors, ported vacuum is NOT manifold vacuum or venturi
vacuum, etc.
