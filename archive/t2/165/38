Unfortunately, no, and the manufacturer has no plans to offer them.  I'm
still trying to convince them to make Vanagon ones (same CV's, different
axle length), and so far so luck, even though there is a much bigger market
for those than for automatic busses.  So I'd rate the chances of them
offering auto bus ones very slim.
