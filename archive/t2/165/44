Hiya Paul,

I think that Matt had some very good ideas concerning alternative insulating 
of the Bus.  However, some List members have pointed out that there are 
definite downsides to some of the techniques Matt has mentioned.  

For me...........I am taking his basic premise to heart - that the factory 
insulation in VWs of that era was pathetic.  Almost anything you do at this 
point will be an improvement.  So, I am using some of his ideas, others I 
will leave alone.

As to the NASA insulation trapping moisture and becoming a rust problem.  I 
have not heard of that particular problem.  But I would hasten to point out 
that in order to be effective that insulation must not let air move behind 
it.  So your insulation should be affixed (with glue?) to the surface behind 
it to prevent air movement.  I would think that such sealing. properly done, 
would also keep out any moisture.

The exhaust wrap question has been batted around more than just a few times.  
Those on the pro side seem to feel that wrapping both eliminates heat and 
helps to increase power by keeping the exhaust hot.  On the other side of the 
question folks believe that the wrap makes the exhaust tubing too hot (early 
failure) and promotes rust and rot.  Your choice, I would guess,  would 
depend on which side of the question you find yourself.
