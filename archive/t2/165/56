the leve on my newly aquired single port 1600 1969
stock engine wass above the full mark i drained some
out then 2 days later checked again and it was high 
so i drained out some more checked the next day high
again    i'm not draining anymore
what's the capacity anyway like 2.5 Q  i've drained
about 1.
