I have rescued my 73 bus from an abusive home and it needs some seious =
help.  Among one of the major issues is the wiring under the dash.  =
There are so many wires that are not hooked up or that have splices to =
other stuff it boggles the mind.  What I really need is a schematic for =
the stuff under the dash.  can anyone help save this poor, abused bus?
