Subject:  Engine dies  :(

Update:

I have fire at the spark plugs so I believed it was a fuel problem.

 I couldn't for the life of me get my head above the carb throat to check
for a gas spray so I just pulled the carb off the manifold. With a long
length of fuel line attached to it and sitting on a table behind the bus and
gas shooting into it I pulled the accelerator and only a little gas comes
out of the bottom of the carb. A little spray and dribble. I guess the carb
is clogged, which would make sense since it would run for a couple seconds
only.

So now that the single weber is off  where exactly can I look to unclog
things? I have never done this before, but I am very ready!!! I need to do
it today/tonight to drive the bus to the campout this weekend. I looked in
the archives under single weber rebuild, but came up short. Is there a link
on the web for this?

Thanks for all the response!!
