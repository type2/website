Rob,

Two things.

First, Tell James I need that 205T tomorrow and to check his e-mail 
for my contact info.

Second. If that dizzy advances to a total 45 degrees the motor will 
be toast before he makes it halfway to Greensboro tomorrow. A type 4 
dizzy will advance that much but and should but not a type 1. Do you 
have a timing light that show how much advance you are getting? Make 
sure it only gets as far as 30 btdc. Otherwise Set it at 0 with the 
vac connected. Rev it and see how high it goes. If TDC is 12 o'clock 
on the pulley than 30 degress is 11 o'clock is should not go past 
11:00.
