That initial 'shot' of fuel was from the accelerator pump.  It compensates 
for the mass of air that is pulled into the cylinders when you step on the 
acceleratorpedal, by shooting extra gasoline into the air stream.  The carb 
should not continue to pump fuel.  The cylinders are the pump.  You are 
correct in assuming that the vacuum created by the engine draws fuel into 
the cylinders.

Should the gas keep coming out if I leave the throttle held open?
