The argument about the ported vac of the carb dropping to 0 at WOT is
proven false by vacuum only distributors using this port.

NOW we are talking here about multiple types of carbs with an assortment
of arrangments for different purposes.
As I see it if I put his modified SVDA on my bus with a 30pict1 and timed
it for 32 mechanical I would have to add the vacuum advance hmmmmm

light goes on. Question. SVDA.
John does the vac advance add to the centrifugal or is the total advance
of the unit limited mechanically before that. ie centrifugal gives around
25deg, vac gives 15deg add them together at max and still only get 25 deg.
I hope that makes sense. It would explain a lot of things for me.
