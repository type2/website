The entire assembly, including the driveshaft itself, is brand new and U.S.
made.  These are not just new CV's on used axles.  In the past I have
avoided offering complete assemblies like this, because they were all either
rebuilt, or Chinese or Mexican made. These are the first ones I've seen that
seem to be similar to OEM quality based on the look and feel. But since they
are a new product, I can't claim to have any track record or history on
them, just first impressions.
