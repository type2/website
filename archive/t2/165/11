I had a set of the 195/75/14C D-load rated tires
(over 2000lb max load).  Now Moonie Maddog has
them.  They are nice and firmer.  They probably
have the most aggressive tread of the 185R14C
tires.  They are load range D as well.  (Remember
the first C means commercial.)  

The 195's really knocked out the swaying in the
wind in my old vanagon.  It was really a pleasure
to drive (double wishbone front suspension you
know.)  Not so noticeable on my loaf westy that
seems to have about 90 degrees of play in the
steering box or swing lever.  Unfortunately, the
tires are gone, so I will never be able to test
them once I get my loaf's front end right.  

Some commented that Cooper lost a suit or settled
a case of some sort.  This is true, but is also
true of all the tire compnaies.  It is the nature
of the beast with American juries.  I got
thousands of hits on yahoo or google search of
"Michelin tire law suit" and you know they are
good tires.
