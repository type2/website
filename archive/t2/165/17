Subject: '70 Front Beam Replacement



	Well,
I ordered a new front beam from Bus Depot, and it arrived a few days ago.  
Now, as I plan the attack to build-up this beast, I am faced with the sad 
reality that the tortion-arm seals are NLA.  Is this really the final blow 
here?  Cna they be removed without damage, from the original beam?  Are 
there any plans to reproduce them?  Has anyone out there tried their local 
FLAPS to see if any of them have a few left in stock?  I know it's not 
probable, but should be possible.  If anyone comes across any, I would 
GREATLY appreciate it.  Another question to pose.  Has anyone tried adding 
power-assisted steering to an old loaf?  Thank you all.

	Eron
