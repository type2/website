Subject: ignition switches

Hi all,

 

Has anyone had trouble with going through beetle ignition switches quickly?
I just replaced my for the 2nd time in 4 months! The counter guy at FLAPS
said that there might be too much amps/voltage going through the switch and
there may be a bad ground somewhere in the wiring.

 

I'm getting so good at changing them, I can do it in 20 minutes and on the
side of the road!

 

Any comments would be appreciated!
