Subject: 1975 camper Bus

Hi everyone. I haven't written in a while, but I do read everything. I'm
having an issue with my camper bus. The last time I wrote in, I was looking
for an engine for it. I now have the new engine, and it's been installed and
my BUGABUS runs awesome!!
The problem, well before the engine, it shifted gears like a hot knife going
through butter. Now I can't seem to get it into first or second gear without
fighting. Could this be a clutch problem or is it a transmission problem.
Also the BUGABUS sat for a year while waiting for a new engine. Is it possible
that maybe the shifter just needs to be lubed???
