When the heater control cable covering gets stuck to the heater guide, 
you need the strongest, most flexible piece of metal you can find.  That 
is why I ended up using an antenna, as spring steel is very tough stuff. 
  But even that was not enough for some really nasty sections of my 
heater guide and I had to cut them out and use copper pipe in its place. 
  That said, when I first did this, I didn't spray brake cleaner in 
there and was using the antenna alone - and that sucker got HOT!  When I 
did this again on someone else's bus, his heater cable was melted in the 
heater guide tube by a fire and we had to use the same techniques, but 
this time I tried the brake cleaner and it really softened things up. 
But man, when we initially were pulling the cable out, it was feet and 
feet and feet of the control cable sheath that came out forever - 
remember, there's a center core (the part that moves the flappers), a 
plastic cover over that, a metal outer cover, and then the 
rubber/plastic coating.  Then all of that slides through the guide to 
the back, and it's the rubber/plastic coating that glues itself to the 
sides of the heater cable guide after years and years.
