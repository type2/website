Subject: Re: [T2] O rings between caliper halves on Vanagon/Type II

I had to dig.  And mean REALLY dig into my reference archives because
ETKA and most fiche plates don't show the part number anymore.

In my library I have a 1980 dated fiche plate which has become a "holy
grail" of knowledge, especially for first year Vanagon stuff that has
been consigned to the dustbin of history.  And it shows the O-Ring for
the calipers (which were used on 73-79 Bays as well as 80-85
Vanagons).

VW 311 615 277
Quantity per caliper: 2
Obsoleted by Volkswagen August 2003
Also fits Ghia and Type 3 Calipers
Caliper Repair Kits have NEVER supplied the O-Rings, even from VW.

Speaking from experience and because the O-Rings haven't been
available for a LONG time, I have rarely found the need to split the
caliper halves.  My recommendation is to find an old-time parts house
that has a brake fluid-resistant selection of o-rings to select from.
This means no Autozone, no Advace Auto, no O-Reillys, no Carquest, no
Pep Boys.  I'm talking about an Independently owned parts store that's
been in operation for 30-50 years that would have this kind of stuff.

The only other alternative is to put 'em back together and turn them
in as core exchange toward as set of remans sone by Nu-Geon.  The
rebuilding manufacturer would have the right O-Rings, but do not deal
with the public and will not sell components to even the warehouses or
parts stores (I've tried numerous times when looking for them myself).

If someone out there has a concrete lead on these, I would love have
that info as well.
