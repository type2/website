Sami, those newer strings with all the sharp edges (sort of like extruded in a
Torx profile) might be just the thing.  But the reason I use the "clothesline
wire" is that a drill will spin 8-10 feet of it without it twisting up due to
it's rigidity.  Something I'm not sure will happen even to the speedo cable or
certainly the plastic if it starts to really dig in and have some torque on
it.  Plus you'd have to be sure it is safe for your solvent if you use it, and
if you do break it off and lose it, might end up in a bigger bind than you
started.  You don't have to spin it of course, solvent and a nice in and out
motion can be enough 8-)

Anyway certainly it all works wonders, and like Mike
mentions, the solvent can do wonders for 40+ year old rock solid
grease/whatever else is in there even without rust.  I've always used the
spray kerosene (WD-40) but brake cleaner is a smart idea for being lighter and
more apt to thin stuff faster.

It is AMAZING/DISGUSTING what will shoot out
the end of tube when you blast through with the roto-rooter, at least on a
rust belt bus.
