Our local air cooled club has been forwarding this about, I have no idea about
the cause or anything, but the Ghia is pretty enough, and I popped for a
couple, so maybe someone on one of the lists will have interest as well, only
couple of days left to get in on it.  Hopefully it isn't a scam.

We still
haven't reached our goal of selling 1,000 tickets and the
drawing for the
Karmann Ghia and 2nd place Yamaha Motorcycle 
is this Saturday, August 25th.  
There must be a few more people out there who would love to own 
this
beautiful classic Ghia! 

Would you forward this email to your members, as a
'last minute'
reminder?  Maybe there's just one more person who intended to 
purchase raffle tickets but forgot to do so? 

Even one more ticket sold will
help PALS fundraising effort and... 
it might just be the ticket that wins the
Ghia!

Tickets can be ordered online until August 23rd with Master Card, 
Visa
or Pay Pal at PALS website. http://palslodi.org  
(Click on Car & Cycle
Raffle)

At this late date physical tickets will not be mailed.  Rather, a 
confirmation email, with the ticket(s) number will be sent to purchaser.  
Contact information and ticket numbers are automatically entered 
into the
raffle.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me at
209-210-7921.

I've attached just one picture this time. It's of the Karmann
Ghia and 
the Yamaha 'Special' Motorcycle.

Again, thank you so much for your
time and consideration,
