Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Accelerator Cable 1980 Vanagon

My brother and I owned owned one of the first ever buses imported into the
Unites States. I believe it was a 1952.  He drove from Maryland to California
in the fall of 1961. On the trip the accelerator cable broke.  He tells me he
walked over to a fence, cut a strip of fence wire, somehow tied it on and made
the connection and drove it the rest of the way to California.

Two or three
years later he ran into a telephone pole, pretty well destroying the bus.  It
was only then, a few weeks afterward, that we were contacted by someone who
wanted to buy and restore this vintage vehicle. I do not remember a whole lot
about it. It had 16 inch wheels, a non-synchronized tranny, jail bars and a
canvas roof. It was fun. And the first of many since.
