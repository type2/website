Adjusting the shift plate takes a lot of patience and trial and error when you
do it for the first time.

I should have added the following in my instructions, which are actually
straight from Bentley (get yourself a copy, it's priceless): shift into second
gear, then position the shifter so that its base sticks out vertically when
viewed from the back of the bus and inclined towards the rear by 30 deg. when
viewed from the side. Now tap the plate  forward (to the front of the bus) and
towards the left until it touches the shifter, i.e., when the shifter barely
starts moving. The bolts need to be properly tightened before you get out of
second and test the 4 gears. If it's not right, repeat and don't despair. The
tiniest adjustment at the plate makes a big difference.
