Subject: [T2] Accel cable.

I've used this same technique, with a old speedometer cable, to clean out
heater cable tubes, the accelerator cable tube and the sunroof drain tubes, on
a bus from up north.  Never seen so much rust (and dirt and leaves in the
sunroof). I don't know how you guys deal with all that rust.
