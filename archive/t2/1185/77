Subject: 1975 camper bus

Thank you everyone for your help!!! I have been adjusting the plate and put
lube on the shifter and pretty much everywhere! Got it to start shifting
almost back to normal, but now when I drive it for a little bit it goes back
to not being able to shift, or after shutting off bus and starting it again,
it gies back to not wanting to shift. I'm getting desperate here! I really
want to drive my BUGABUS but if it's not shifting that makes it a little
difficult.
