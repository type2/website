Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Accelerator Cable 1980 Vanagon

I broke an accelerator cable by stomping on it so as to get
out of the way of an approaching semi.  Luckily, I was able
to jump a curb instead.  Drove home by using a small vice-grip
to clamp the "idle speed" at something like 2500 and staying
in first gear.  Always carry a spare now.
