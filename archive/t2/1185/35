Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Accelerator  Cable 1980 Vanagon

I had to do this on the side of the road once. You can buy them for about $4
at bus depot. It has been a long time since I did it, but I remember how easy
it was. I would grease up the new cable or spray some PB Blaster on it first.
It will give some corrosion protection and help it slide. You could tie the
ends together but make sure that union will pass through the tube before you
jam it in there.
Good luck.
