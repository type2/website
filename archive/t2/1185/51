I've heard that doing so with the end of the cable frayed a bit (if you can
get it in easily) actually works better than my longstanding technique as each
little fray scrubs a bit like a wire brush.

I've used this same
technique, with a old speedometer cable, to clean out
heater cable tubes, the
accelerator cable tube and the sunroof drain tubes, on
a bus from up north. 
Never seen so much rust (and dirt and leaves in the
sunroof). I don't know how
you guys deal with all that rust.
