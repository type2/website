Subject: 76 Back Door Lock busted... Suggestions?

Hi folks,

we've made it as far as Arizona and apart from a few minor incidences we've
done just fine. But I've reached the first one I can't fix.. Just got to
Sedona and the back door access (above engine door) lock is no longer
working.

Key just turns round and round. No longer feels like it grabs the 'teeth'
inside. It's permanently locked which is better than permanently open but
it's a bit of a pain not being able to get access to our luggage!

Has anyone any suggestions? Is there a way to open form the inside. Both
the John Muir Bible and the Service manual don't seem to cover the back
door. Heading Grand Canyon - Vegas - Yosemite as the next steps on the road
if it needs replacing and people have suggestions/mechanics.

Thanks all.

Steve
