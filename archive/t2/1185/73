Steve,

You pretty much figured it out. The key releases the pins and the cylinder
slides out when the hold-in screw is unfastened.

Just reinsert the cylinder, Remove the key, Pop the access panel off the
door and screw it back together from the inside.

Just take the key out first or you will have a cylinder and pins to find on
the ground, usually in a gravel parking lot, in the rain, at night...

P.S. what does this sentence mean? "defo no interior latch handle
Mr.Stiles" I'm not hip enough to understand.
