Jack,

Thanks for the posts. Drove the 101 many times in the 70's and 80's in 
my 64DD Kamper Kit. What memories.
One time, maybe 1975, it was the coldest winter on record for maybe 
100 years. As I drove down just north of Santa Maria, the farmers had 
left their sprinklers running and there were ice cakes on the fields 
several feet deep as it was barely going above freezing during the 
day. My heat wasn't working and I stopped to absorb a little sun on 
the side of the road. What a loss, after a few minutes of thumping 
myself  I jumped back in to continue my frigid ride.
