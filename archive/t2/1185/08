Subject: Auto tranny woes

Access Bob.. I have one for u.. On the servo line going to engine I have a
very small (2mm) splitter going off that I do not  know where it goes
My symptoms are the bus starts, idles and drives up to second gear, but at
third it dies
I have replaced the hoses from servo to engine, as well as the elbow in the
engine bay
This is a 73 dual carb set up
Thank u in advance
