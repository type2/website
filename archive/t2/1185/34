Hello Janyce, you will need to disconnect the cable at the rear and pull it
out from the front. Then, insert the new one from the front, greasing it with
a moly grease as you go. Does your new cable have a boot on the pedal end? If
not, try and save the old one. It should also have a small metal piece crimped
on it a few inches from the pedal end. Hope this helps, Timo
