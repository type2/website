Subject: Re: [T2] Accel cable.

Hey Guys!

Thanks for all the great ideas on how to clear out my accel cable 
tube. I suppose I need to stow a bit of wire in my kit just in case 
the original eventually breaks on my watch and I need to limp home. 
Maybe I'll luck out and my kids will have to fix it after I'm gone in 
20 or 30 more years.

One the other hand, maybe I'll install FI and go drive by wire 
(electrical) and then the problem goes away.
