Hi,
Try adjusting your stop plate, which would be too far to the right. Try to go
into second gear (but not reverse!). Loosen the two bolts holding down the
shift assembly to the cab floor, just slightly, maybe a couple of turns each.
Slide the stop plate to the left until it touches the shifter. It doesn't take
much, sometimes just a mm, less than a 1/16th of an inch. Tighten the 2 bolts,
get out of second gear and try all 4 gears and reverse. Repeat ad nauseum. :)
