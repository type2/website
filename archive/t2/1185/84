Subject: Buses By The Depot (& Annual BusDepot Warehouse Sale)

I've been getting a lot of emails asking when BBD is this year, so while I
don't have the website up for it yet, I thought I'd at least mention the
date - the weekend of Oct. 6.

This event has been growing every year, and I really look forward to it.
It's in a wooded county park near our shop in eastern PA (about mid point
between Philly, Allentown, and Reading). You can make it a day trip (at no
cost) if you live close enough, or camp for either one or two nights. The
park has playgounds, walking/hiking trails, and lakes, and we have a potluck
dinner Saturday evening.

BBD is now a LiMBO co-sponsored event, and that means we will have the upper
camping area all to ourselves. Those who were there last year may recall
that the park repurposed the upper camping area for "organizations," leaving
some doubt as to whether we'd get to use it again. Thanks to LiMBO's help we
now qualify to keep using that area for our event, and will even be able to
reduce the site cost.

As in years past, there will also be a caravan through the park to the
annual Bus Depot Warehouse Sale and Open House, which is 2-4 pm that
Saturday. Once a year we open our warehouse to the general public, and also
mark down all of our inventory in-store only (by as much as 90% on
scratch-and-dent items).

I'll post more details within the next several days or a week, but
meanwhile, mark your calendar!
