VW Golf switches for the late 90s cars are often crap too. $14 at NAPA. 
I've replaced mine two or three times in 76K miles.

The nylon is soft so the metal key cylinder wallows out the hole in the 
one end of the switch, the melt over time which tells me the plastic has 
too low a melting point, and perhaps the contacts are made of metal too 
cheap - needs to be copper instead of low grade cheap metal with a flash 
plating of copper. My car is 100% stock so the replacement switch isn't 
enduring extra current from things like extra lights or stereo amps or 
anything.

Hang in there and source your ignition switches elsewhere. Where? i 
don't know...

I'm going to try a VW dealer next time.
