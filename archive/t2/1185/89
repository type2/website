If you're east coast (even mid or west, really.  he's figured out how to 
ship them), Jeff Power here in central Florida is building his own 
variations of factory interiors for a few years now.

Good stuff, and he'll work with you to get what you want.  Tell him I sent 
you.  He's got my 100% personal recommendation.


Just one of his more custom builds:

Typical so33 or so42 style interior runs $1250 + shipping - you add foam 
and covers.

His focus has primarily been the split bus crowd (he originally designed 
and built his SO-33/mosiac variant for himself...), but he's definitely 
doing bay interiors now - I know he has a so-42 style that will fit your 
'71 nicely if you're looking to stay near stock.

He also builds cut-down blind-side cabinets for those that prefer them... 
;)


And if anyone is crazy enough to want an so-44 style kit, mine is 
available to him for pattern making. ;)
