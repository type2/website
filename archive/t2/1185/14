I second Bradley, run the proper front to rear bias for correct handling.
 Though I tend to run a bit less than him, and a bit more than the 30/40,
usually I go around 30-32/40-42.  To me most buses get a bit "floaty" when you
get up around 35 in the front, though it does make steering effort at slow
speed better of course.  I adjust withing the 30-35/37-45 ranges VW proffered
to get what I like for handling from the particular tire and loading at hand,
but maintaining the bias is important.

And keep your spare at 45 so you can
reduce it down to whichever position you need it in.

I have them on a '72 Westy.  I have 35 in the front and 45 in the rear.  The
tire pressure label inside the gas cap lid on mine says 30 for the front and
40 for the rear.
