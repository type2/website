Bob, I too hate electrical gremlins. My license plate light did a similar
thing, '71 manual. I checked all of the usual as you have and everything
was OK. It turned out that the wire was heavily corroded on the inside of
the insulation. I simply spliced in a new wire about a foot back from where
the power comes, found with a multi-meter, and it has been good since.

Another thing to check would be to see if you have power to the bulb holder
by sticking the wire with your meter. It could be some serious corrosion in
the holder itself.

Best of luck.
