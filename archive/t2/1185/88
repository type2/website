Subject: [Q] Interiors ('71 Westy)

All-

Am finally close to finishing my project!  Unfortunately, the interior
remains...

Curious as to suggestions (can you say photos) of traditional
possibilities.  My hope is that something vintage Westy will make the
decision process easier, not to mention I like the look.

So, for starters, I am soliciting opinions on the following:

1. Updated front seats (headrests) versus the original low-profile seats.
2. Black "kick" board (cover for the front wall, under the windshield,
around the steering column).  I am not sure this is the right name for it.
I am interested in black versus white.
3. Black floor pads -- is there any other color?
4. Door panel color scheme ideas -- can you say photos?
5. Insulation for the major framed areas?

And last but not least, does anyone have (or know of a source for) complete
interiors?  What I thought I'd look for one last time is a complete vintage
interior out of an existing bus -- this might be a way to save some $.
