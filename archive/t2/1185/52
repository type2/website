and when it gets really bad, an antenna with the tip bent and sharpened 
and attached to a drill can really help out - this is one area I'm 
unfortunately an expert.

That said, spraying brake cleaner in the tubes does wonders to break 
down the rubber and gunk that gets stuck to the tubes.  30+ y/o heater 
cables do *not* like to come out and tend to come out in pieces.  I've 
also had to chop out sections of the heater cable guide tubes and then 
use rubber to "patch" them back into place.  Works great and still keeps 
the intention of the system in tact.
