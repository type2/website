Subject: Fire prevention control - fire detection

I just had a big idea...

For fire detection, use a "flame rollout switch" from a gas furnace. 
These are used to detect flames that are "backfiring" from a home's gas 
furnace b/c of holes in the heat exchanger. When they are licked by 
fire, they "blow" like a fuse and open the circuit aka stop the flow of 
power through them. There are many different types including versions 
that have a reset button I think.

The version I have in my hand is a one use type affair that requires the 
service tech to simply replace it when it blows. It has two spade 
connectors that would join with the standard crimp connector that we use 
on our vans. It doesn't care what voltage is run through it - 12V or 24V 
or 6V. I think HVAC systems use 24V DC.

They are really cheap too. Like $15 cheap.

Mount them in series around the engine bay - say two or three of them - 
use them to lock out an AFC121SS fuel solenoid (~$50) or turn on a light 
on the dash or a buzzer or all three. Use a hidden toggle switch to 
bypass a false alarm that might otherwise leave a person stranded once 
you confirm that there isn't really a fire.

Place them on the ceiling of the engine bay. Perfect application for them.

Use them to activate an onboard extinguisher system if you like.

Use them to activate a Dixie Horn or send out an SOS by Morse Code via 
your ham radio linked to an Arduino to generate the Morse Code and a GPS 
module to add the global coordinates...

GRIN!

Just thought I'd share.
