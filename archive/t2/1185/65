To all of my list friends,
I have been putting off sending this letter out, but time has come to
start 
planning in earnest for the future of my "VW stuff".
 
I have cancer.  I am currently working through a treatment that appears
to be 
making progress against my rare and aggressive Sarcoma.  At this point,
even if I can beat 
the disease, the chance that I will go back to full time work is looking
less and less likely.
 
As a professional mechanic from 1968, and specializing in VW, Porsche and
Audi since 1979
I have a wealth of knowledge and am a confirmed bus "nut".  Not the sort
of trailer queen, show circuit
type, but more the love to drive them kind.  I have owned a dozen buses
since the early 1990's and 
have collected a lot of stuff since then as well.
 
Here is what I would like to have happen.
 
I live in Snohomish, Washington (state), about 30 miles NE of Seattle,
kind of out in the boonies, but easily
accessible from a number of major highways.  
I need to have the vehicles and the parts go away, and each project needs
to go completely,  in other words
I can't just start breaking things up. I will send descriptions of the
two projects in a separate email
if you would like.
If you have a place to store the vehicles, that would be best.  There is
quite a bit of value in the parts that
are included, but only to a fellow VW nut!  As far as cost goes, I would
leave that up to you,  Lets just say $500.00 OBO.  
I won't deliver either one, unless it is less than 50 miles each way.
If you live within driving distance and have the equipment to pick up
either of these projects, just let me know.
I can send pictures if you would like them.
