When I cleaned out my fuel line tube on my Beetle I used an old 
accelerator wire. it was a cheap replacement cable I think that was 
solid instead of stranded. I simply pushed it through and the toughness 
of the crud that I scraped out of the tube was really something. Clumps 
of rust, hardened dirt/grease, etc.

Because of that I don't expect a nylon trimmer string to do as well as a 
frayed clutch cable or speed cable spun with a drill.

Clean it out, and in the case of clutch, accelerator and heater flapper 
cables - oil them up b/c in the process of cleaning the tube it's 
probably exposed alot of bare naked steel. WD-40 isn't going to do the 
job. Oil or grease.

Guess this makes a good argument for renewing the cable tube end 
grommets - those little rubber do-dads that keep the crud mostly out.

I'd argue for modern e-brake cables with the steel cable encased inside 
a nylon sheath inside the e-brake cable cover. That nylon makes it all 
slide so nice and makes it resistant to rust.
