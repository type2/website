Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Back Door Lock busted... Suggestions?

So I tried one of the spare keys and low and behold the whole unit came out.

It's still intact, and has the teeth in position. I can see in the door the
screw that it seemed to have loosened from. So here's my questions..


1. can I rotate the 'holder' where the lock unit fit to open the latch and
therefore open the door? (or open the door from the inside? defo no
interior latch handle Mr.Stiles)

2. if the teeth still fit can i just screw the lock unit back into place
and have a reworking lock?

This seems to me to be a reasonable explanation of what happened, an
unscrewing of the lock unit from the screw that held it in place at the
back that has now come loose and free. If it's so and can fit back in I'm
pretty certain I can put this back together.

Ah the things you learn on the road...

Thanks again folks,
Steve
