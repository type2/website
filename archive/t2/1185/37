Actually since it broke the way it did Janyce, you are right on, you can in
this situation use the old one to pull through, since I presume the bent hook
bit for the front snapped off (or if the hooked bit broke in half and wouldn't
go through, you can snip it off all the way.)  Then you can take a bit of tape
or heat shrink tubing and attach the new to the old and pull it through and
out the back.  Generally you have to push em through, which in a Vanagon is
usually OK as I think the tube is plastic on even an air cooled, bus ones can
get pretty rusty and tough in the rust belt and pulling them through if
possible is always smart.

HI Guys
My  accelerator cable broke
at the connection to the pedal.  Any words of
wisdom for installing the new
one?  I was thinking I could tape the new one to
the old one and pull it
through to the engine.
