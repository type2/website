In WV I would routinely roto-root the tubes with a stiff piece of "clothesline
wire" in an electric drill, with liberal application of WD-40 squirted in a
few times in the process as well.  Mind you I don't know what that wire was
actually, did they sell it for clothesline?  Dad being a EE for AT&T came by
all sorts of odd stuff.  Was probably about 8-10 gage galvanized steel wire,
straight, and stiff, could have been surplus from power transmission lines
installed during WW2 in WV in lieu of copper, oh yeah they did that believe it
or not.  Essentially the diameter of the crimped carb/TB end.  Does a
wonderful job.  I've done the same essentially to clear a bug fuel line
plugged with varnish, just using gas as the solvent there.

the wire I had attached. The problem here
is that with the double 
doors, there is a belly pan and the the tube is not
accessable. When I 
had the bus restored in 03, the mechanic didn't want to
mess with it.

Anyone have words of wisdom for the day I really need a new
cable?
And its a low mileage bus, only 316,000.
