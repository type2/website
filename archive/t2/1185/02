78 auto tranny.


I hate electrical gremlins.
  both tail lights and both stop lights have gone out. tail lights first 
then a bit later the stop lights.

. no power at bulb holder
. turn signals work normally
. good grounds
. power from switches at front.
. fuses checked (including with a meter)
. no apparent damage to cable to rear.  (need to check with meter, have to 
make up longer wire to meter)

??? 3 seperate circuits all at the same time but nothing else.
engine runs normally in fact if someone hadn't told me I wouldn't have 
known they were out.


any ideas.  I can understand one or another but all three without 
affecting turn signals or anything else.
