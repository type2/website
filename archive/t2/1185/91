Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Interiors ('71 Westy)

I liked the units mentioned by Dave and Max. All but one of the 
Westfalia style campers included a side closet that prevented the 
sliding in of a 4x 8 sheet of plywood through the rear hatch. If you 
install a closet, check the clearance at the hatch, the extra bed 
width is also nice if you actually sleep in your bus. I hauled a lot 
of material with my bus.

Cheers!
