Subject: Re: [T2] What's the correct Bosch Plug?

Sounds a bit cold.  A friend in LA runs W8CC plugs in his Mexi-Beetle
with the 3/4" reach plugs.  If you alot of highway/freeway driving,
then W7CC would be slightly a better choice.  But being on the
islands, there isn't enough of long distance high speed highway
driving to really use the W7's

Stock 1600 original 1/2" reach plugs are W8AC.

Just my nickel's worth.
