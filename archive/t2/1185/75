>Is it possible that maybe the shifter just needs to be lubed???

First check your clutch has been adjusted correctly and check the stop plate
at the base of the shifter. If those are ok, check the shift coupler. Given
that the problems commenced after an engine install I'd be leaning towards it
being an adjustment problem.
