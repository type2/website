Subject: A Great Big Thank You

I would like to take this opportunity to send out a great Big Thank You to
everyone who sent their help suggestions and diagrams for my 1975 BugABus
shifting situation. The problem has been solved! We took apart the shifter and
adjusted the stop plate, and adjusted the clutch assembly. BUGABUS is up and
running!!!!!!!! So THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!!!!
