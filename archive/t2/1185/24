Sounds like it goes to the Automatic Trans Modulator Valve (Do you
have an automatic?).  These were used on 003 Auto Trans on Buses
73-75, Type 3s 68-73 and 411/412s 69-74.  Of course they are different
for each of the models (there are 4 different ones for the 411/412).
Could be the diaphragm in the Modulator has a leak.

Of course, these are IMPOSSIBLE to find (I need one for my 72 411
Wagon, looking for two years now)
