Hi Jim,

Thanks for the information!! I'll order one of these to keep on hand! And
yes the switch is white and so is the one I just replaced. There were no
signs of anything wrong with it!

Thanks again!

Bob

Bob -

The trick is to know what is OE and what is crap.

For your 78 Bus - If the switch is all white, then it's Chinese made
and has developed a bad reputation for poor quality.  If the switch is
a white/black combo, then it is made by Kostal, the OE manufacturer to
VW.

Airhead Parts sells the Kostal made switches.

Note:  The photo in this link shows a Chinese switch.  I'm trying to
get this updated, but I can assure you these are the REAL deal.

I went thru the same problem on one of my Vanagons and my 914 from
previous owner crappy replacements.

For your 73 Super - Airhead has not been getting any of these switches
back (different from your Bus).  They've always been OE that I know of
from the suppliers we have dealt with.
