Here are some photos of insulation, flooring, and my cabin interior that I
have had for a few years. My Mom and brother who both sew helped remove the
old seat covers to make patterns.

If I didn't have an interior I would love David's recommendation. If you go
that way, try for the later interior with the coat closet on the driver
side, not the passenger side.
