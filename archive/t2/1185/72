Subject: Anyone done a before and after test with FI cleaners??

Just wondering, has anyone ever looked at an injector before, then after
they've used a FI cleaner treatment like Techron etc.? Some brag about better
in one treatment. Just wondering if it's been documented by a listee after
using it??? Spray pattern, volume etc??
