Subject: Riddle me this, Batman - Gas in my oil??? 77 Westy 2.0L

Well, it's been sitting since 2009 and has been started occassionally to move
around the parking area at my house. Now bear in mind there is not a flat
level spot anywhere in my yard to park it, so it's been tilted at different
angles.
I insured it today and drove it to the gas station to fill it up. When I went
to check the oil, the dipstick was way over the full line. I thougth that was
odd, so smelled it, and it smells of gas. Leaky injector?? I can't figure how
this would happen on a stock 2.0L F.I. engine? Never happened to me before,
but I'm sure it's to do with it sitting for so long??? I'm changing the oil
right now, but it ran beautifully with tons of power to the gas station and
back.
Dazed and confused,
Courtney
