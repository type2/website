I saw this technique done for cleaning out the heater cable tubes on a
beetle on YouTube. They used a straightened coat hanger attached to a drill
as beetle tubes are not that long. The results were amazing! A ton of dirt,
old grease and oil came out of the tubes. I'm in the middle of replacing the
heater cables on my beetle and plan to do the same thing on it and on the
bus.

In WV I would routinely roto-root the tubes with a stiff piece of
"clothesline
wire" in an electric drill, with liberal application of WD-40 squirted in a
few times in the process as well.  Mind you I don't know what that wire was
actually, did they sell it for clothesline?  Dad being a EE for AT&T came by
all sorts of odd stuff.  Was probably about 8-10 gage galvanized steel wire,
straight, and stiff, could have been surplus from power transmission lines
installed during WW2 in WV in lieu of copper, oh yeah they did that believe
it
or not.  Essentially the diameter of the crimped carb/TB end.  Does a
wonderful job.  I've done the same essentially to clear a bug fuel line
plugged with varnish, just using gas as the solvent there.
