Steve,

In the short term until you can replace your lock cylinder...

Pop the panel off with a couple of (plastic) butter knives between the
black hold-down plugs. Avoid two screwdrivers if you want to keep your
paint nice. After the panel is off, the lock and latch are easily accessed.

There was an optional interior hatch handle from VW, but they are few and
far between. I have only personally seen two over the years.

To "make" and interior latch:

Drill or somehow make a small hole in the panel above the latch release
Take a piece of long stiff wire and attach one side to the latch release.
(There will be two holes to loop it through)
Thread the long piece of wire through the back side of the panel and
through your new hole.
Attach the other side to a key ring (not your car keys, heh).
Clip off the excess wire.
Pull the ring, and pop open the door.

Hope this helps! Have a great trip!

P.S. Keep your Muir manual for the beautiful illustrations. Rely on your
Bentley for actual instructions.
