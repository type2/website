	Good thinking, 99 ; indeed, a key idea for doing it smoothly


	But before any of that:  I slapped a couple pix on The Samba. 
If the break is near enough to the front end, you may get away with 
leaving the whole cable alone and adding only a slightly longer 
fitting clamped to the front end.  You will probably have to dream up 
the fitting; quite a range of designs suggest themselves.
