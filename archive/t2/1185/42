Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Accelerator  Cable 1980 Vanagon

That is a funny story. My girlfriend then, now wife and I were going on our
first trip in my bus to the smoky mountains for a week. We hadn't even gotten
out of town when the accelerator cable snapped. It was 5:00 on Friday. I had
no spare. I called Darrell at silver Lake VW. He only had one junk bus at his
shop at the time and it jus so happened to be a 68 like mine and the
accelerator cable was still in it. He pulled it out for me on the spot. My
wife and I had to take a taxi to go get it. I installed it on the side of the
road and we continued on our way to the mountains. I broke down 12 times on
that trip, but it always worked out without needing a tow. Met some cool
people along the way too.

Cheers!
