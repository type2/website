Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV lower cooling tin question

Bob, the set that has been removed by the DPO is the set above the
pushrods. The lowest cooling tins are in place.

I too am considering this engine suspect until I can prove otherwise.

Why do people do stupid stuff like removing parts which the original
engineers obviously intended to be there?  Hopefully no major problems
with the engine. It's runs and idles well.  No idea how long the PO
had been running without these, if at all, the bus has sat for a
number of years. The bus didn't run until I fixed a few vacuum routing
issues, no doubt the reason the PO abandoned this project.

Now that the weather here is conducive to outdoor vehicular work I'll
be digging into to these issues and more. Thanks everyone for the
advice, this list remains one of the best resources on the internet.

Thanks
