Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling tin on bottom of heater boxes

It would be interesting to make a set of bottom "tins" out of a heavy  
screen, which would serve as heater box stabilizer and stone  
deflector, but act more or less transparent to the flow of air. If  
there were a drop in head temperatures and oil temperatures, it might  
be a useful mod.
