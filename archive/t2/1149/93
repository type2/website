I would stay away from over-sizing the Pistons and Cylinders above 2.1L.
Especially if you are running Fuel Injection. Porting and polishing the
heads should only be attempted by a pro with specific knowledge of VW
engines and their flow characteristics.

Dave has good advice regarding balancing.

In addition to balancing the flywheel, crankshaft, caps/rods and
Pistons/Wristpins, don't forget to balance the cooling fan and pulley. Many
people opt for balancing the pressure plate as well. Just be sure the
pressure plate bolts back up in the exact same position when installed onto
the flywheel during final assembly.

The smoother a motor runs, the less the engine wastes energy on vibration.
Balancing is a inexpensive performance mod and is generally considered
standard operating procedure by most professional engine builders. The
results are an improvement of the engines specifications and performance by
a simple and tried-and-true hot-rodding technique.

Mileage: Improved
Reliability: Improved
NVH: Improved
Longevity: Improved
Durability: Improved
Cooling: Improved

The only danger I am aware of is unintentional over-revving past
manufacter's specifications. But a tachometer or a rev-limiting rotor can be
added to help.
