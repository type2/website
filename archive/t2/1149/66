Subject: RE: Screeching Fan belt?

Hi Kevin,

B B B B B B B B  The belt tension testers are available at most auto tool
outlets.B  Not expensive. The problem with the 1/2 in deflection is that 
who
knows how much pressure to put on the belt.B  Most folks don't have a
calibrated elbow. The tester I use has a spring inside and threeB  arms.B 
Press
 the handle to open over the belt and let go.B  The arms go on either
side of the belt, two outside and in between them one on the other 
side.B 
Amount of tension is read on the scale when the handle is let go 
and the
spring clamps the arms on the belt.

I use one of these which are a bit more expensive.B  I bought mine used.

Alternately use one of these from Gates (who make a lot of belts :) )

Alternator disassembly isn't a big deal.B  Lots of info on the web.B  Not
sure if it's covered in the Bently.


Remove the pulley (may need a puller), mark the case so you get it back
together correctly, remove the brush block/regulator,
 remove the bolts
holding the case ends on. Slide off one end, slide off
 the other end.B  Keep
track of how things are assembled, washers, shims,
 etc.. Press the bearings
out of the case or pull them off the shaft.B  
Replace with new bearings. If
you are unable to get new bearings, 
carefully pry out the seals on the
bearings, flush out the old grease, 
replace with new grease (only fill 2/3 of
the space-no more), press the 
seals back in to the same depth they were
before.B  Give the slip rings a
 scrub with coarse Scotchbrite pads (never use
emery cloth the grains embed in the copper), reassemble, preferably with new
brushes (cheap).B  Some alternators need their brushes held back on 
assembly
with a straight paper clip.B  Reinstall with new belt and 
anti-seize on all
the bolts.

The comment, about how long has the vehicle has been sitting, is for folks
that get a "barn job", or buy a used alternator from a swap and do everything
except look inside the alternator.

Wow Jonb&thanks for all the info.snip> If I were to get/find a tensioner,
what should the tension be?
 B snip>As far as how long the vehicle has been sittingb&it sat for a while
over the winter, but I started driving it again a few weeks ago. I donbt
remember the screech last fall before I parked it for the winter. B snip>As
for flushing and lubing the alternator-is this procedure detailed in the
Bentley, or is it pretty self-explanatory?
