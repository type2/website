It's normal for the alternator not to charge until about 1000 RPM.

Your belt should not be slipping when properly adjusted. Fan belt
spray can help with a squeaking fan belt.

Belt deflection should be 1/2 inch with firm but not excessive pressure.

Replace your belt when it is too stretched to adjust within specs or
when cord is fraying.
