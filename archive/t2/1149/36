Subject: Re: [T2] Shocks

	A further 2 cents' worth: those air-adjustable shocks which 
have been briefly mentioned are, in principle (I know nothing of 
different mfrs or quality) useful.
	A trailer has a very wide range of payload-to-tare, and is 
probably the vehicle that most benefits from blowing the 
air-adjustable shocks up to 120 psi or more.  A very light open 
trailer can carry a ton of coal holding the road nicely (while towed 
by a 3-cyl DKW but that's a Friday story).  Any T2 expected to carry 
about a ton now & again can similarly benefit, I predict.  The rear 
suspension will squat less if you blow up the shocks hard.  I forget 
the lowest setting  -  ? 20 psi?
	 Those quaint little open-tray T2 trucks would in theory 
benefit from the adjustable shocks, if loaded as they're capable of 
receiving.
   	Could these shocks be useful on the *front* too?  If it's a 
king-cab truck, packed with good ole bwahs or similar (payload 
perhaps 3/4 ton?, fairly far fw), and if there's no load in the tray 
....  :-/
	Also I suspect that even if the bus proper is not heavily 
loaded a 'T2 rig' featuring a heavy trailer might handle better if 
the middle 'axle'( i.e the rear susp of the T2) is air-adj.


	The types I've experienced here offer a Schrader valve on 
thin flexible air-hose (hardish plastic).  I've seen these valves 
installed recessed in holes esp made in rear bumpers  ...  there are 
doubtless many other less bodgieish options for protected mountings.
