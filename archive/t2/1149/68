Subject: RE: Screeching Fan belt?

Wowb&just went to adjust the belt and tighten it up. Turned out there was no
woodruff key on the alternator pulley. That was not good. Luckily the thing
had been turning by itself, without the key. I guess the screeching was it
slipping.



Thanks for the suggestions, I found a local place that carries that lube for
the alternator. Hopefully they will have the right size woodruff key. Does
anyone know the correct size? When I search online, all I get is woodruff key,
without a size. I figure with an actual size, I can buy one from a local shop.
