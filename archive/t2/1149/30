Yes, I do have them again. Availability is very inconsistent, as Koni takes
forever to make them for me when they make them at all. Each time I try to
reorder I never know if they will agree again; it's not exactly a lucrative
product for them. 

They are without question the best shocks you can buy for your Bus -
expensive but worth it, just  like everyone is saying. They are
user-adjustable so if you find the ride too firm or too soft you can
readjust them to taste on installation or reinstallation. This also allows
you to adjust them to compensate for wear as they age (all shocks soften
with age).  Between this and the lifetime warranty, these are the last
shocks you will ever have to buy for your Bus.

If those are outside your budget, my recommendation is the Boge shocks. We
have them in two flavors - the standard Boges sold everywhere else, which is
what your Bus came with when new; or the upgraded ones that Boge does not
sell in the U.S. but we import ourselves, which have better performance and
load capacity than the stock Boges.

Although we also sell the KYB's, they are a much harder riding shock than
any of the above. Some people don't mind this or even prefer it, but I have
had other customers refer to them as "bone jarring."  It really depends on
your preference, I suppose.
