Subject: screeching fan belt?

Hey Guys,

 

Whenever I start my Singlecab the generator light stays on, until I hit the
accelerator a little extra. The PO actually swapped an alternator onto the
engine. I never really thought much about this. But recently when idling, if
I go to accelerate quickly I hear a loud screeching noise, it sounds like
the fan belt slipping. 

 

I think they sell some stuff  you can spray on the fan belt to keep it from
slipping, but I was wondering does this noise mean the belt is too loose?
When I checked it, it didn't look as though there was too much play in it.or
does it mean the belt is at the end of its life? How long should a belt last
anyway?

 

Sorry for the probably stupid question.
