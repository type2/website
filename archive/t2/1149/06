Not an uncommon sight over here in Germany, and by no means all
of them registered in cities with Volkswagenwerks (which makes
them potential Volkswagen company cars) either.  Either way,
roughly half as many Phaetons are sold than are S-Classes,
7-series, or A8s.  That's nothing to sneer at; Lexuses, for
instance, do much worse here.  Or Jaguars.

As for ill-advised ... well, I don't know.  It received rather
good critiques whenever (and whatever against) it was tested.
Its V10 TDI is one of the more impressive sounds I've ever
heard in normal traffic.  And the whole development is -- in
my humble opinion -- more or less a by-product of the Bentley
Continental and VW Touareg efforts, none of which can really
be called flops.  Also, it's VW's first real effort in that
segment.  Remember the Audi V8?  That was called a flop (and
worse) in its time as well; today, Audi is on par with BMW
and Mercedes in the luxury-car segment both in perception
and sales.  Who'd've thought?  And who says VW can't follow?

It's not what Volkswagen traditionally is supposed to be about,
no question about that.  But it is a really rather good car,
and in my opinion, while certainly not a great success, it's
far from a flop.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Avantime -- that's a flop. 
(Still an extremely cool car, though.)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel.
