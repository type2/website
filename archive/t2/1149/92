Subject: location of headlight adjusting screws

Upon reassembling my '73 Westie headlights which were completely
disassembled I noticed that I did not pay enough attention to were the
adjusting screws were located.  The "buckets" seem to have cut outs for
different positions.

 

I am assuming at the top (12 o'clock) position for both and in the outboard
position, that is 3 o'clock for the driver's side and 9 o'clock for the
passenger side, when viewed looking at the bus from the front.

 

Thanks,

Tom
