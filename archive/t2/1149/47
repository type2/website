	1. If only to ease your mind, inquire about borrowing a 
petrol-powered fan.  NZ fire stations have fans c.60cm across, on a 
'pallet', driven by the Honda GC160H 5 hp, for blowing air into bldgs 
where smoke inhalation is a threat to life of people who haven't 
(yet) emerged.  Slap one of those babies humming away e.g inside the 
container (so you're less likely to hit it in your manoeuvrings :-X) 
and you should get plenty turnover of air for the brief time in 
question  -  esp as you plan to be blowing your exhaust outside, 
rather than reversing the van in.
	I have been an expert witness in legal hearings regarding 
whether fuel-powered forklifts should be required to be driven in 
such circumstances (the trade union in question advocating that 
electric forklifts be kept in that function; the owners wanting to 
save money by selling them).  My impression (at this point please 
read in disclaimers like those issued by Doyt) is that your health 
will not be significantly endangered even if you can't borrow one of 
those fire-service fans.
	I suggest you start holding your breath for what you estimate 
to be the second half of your
>about a minute of driving in there.
