Subject: C02 in a box

My van lives in a nice, dry, secure, shipping container at a local storage 
place. I'm about the build the second set of ramps to make getting it in and 
out possible.

My problem is that when I used the last set, driving in forwards was 
difficult as there isn't a straight run at the entrance. Because I can't 
easily see the front wheels from the driving seat this makes swinging in a 
nightmare as you end up driving at the side of the frame and turning in at 
the last minute. A 2 man job really.

In an ideal world, I'd back in. The big mirrors would make that easy. BUT - 
this means the exhaust gasses will be in the container for the few seconds 
I'm backing in.

How bad is this ? I know that if I shut the container door and run the 
engine I'd die but I'm not planning to do that. What I need is about a 
minute of driving in there. Once I shut the engine off, how long would the 
gas take to disipate so I can sut the container up with air rather than C02 
inside ? There's no electricity for a fan to drive it out but the container 
opens to the outside air.

The box is 8ft by 8ft by 20ft if this helps.

Thanks

Phil
