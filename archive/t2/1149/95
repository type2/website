Robert,
           You are most correct about the application of a file to a larger
woodruff key to get a good fit.  Kind of hard to hold in the vise though. 
Also correct with the pop-can shims. Found along most roads within walking
distance of where the bus broke down.  Having been one of those apprentice
file-wielders during my 10,000 hour slog.  And most y'all have no idea how
long a sentence that seemed to a teenager at the beginning.  ;)  Files will do
so much more than most folks care to know, and do it fast.  Sure we can do
many things with a grinder, or belt sander, but a sharp, clean, un-dinged, set
of files are well worth keeping around.  Files are one of the things in my
toolbox that you need not ever ask about borrowing.  The answer will always be
no.  One ding and they are never the same for quality work.  Clean them groove
by groove with a flattened cartridge case, never with a file card or wire
brush.  The hardened wires
 only dull the edges.  Keep files physically separated from each other for the
same reason.

Only met Burt once, out on the sands at Muriwai. Wasn't riding the Indian, had
a Manx or some other single. A great presence, and extremely knowledgeable. 
Later managed to sideways a couple of propeller root sections (for him to make
connecting rods out of) from "the sponsor", AirNZ.  Somewhere there is a
careful thank you note from him.

  I've never been a metalwork apprentice, but I gather these
keys are a 'favourite' category of exercise for apprentices.  So you
can express solidarity for countless low-rank file-wielders, and
commune with the spirit of the file king Burt Munro, by making your
own :-P
