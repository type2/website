I would recommend having the crank/flywheel assembly balanced, and
balancing the rods end to end. Also CC the heads to get matching
combustion chambers (not sure how much this helps though). The beauty
of all this is that your engine is still 'stock', you have just built
it to exceed factory spec. Last time I had mine measured on the
rolling road I was getting something like 82-84 BHP, stock is 70.
