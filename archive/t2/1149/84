When the engine is confined inside the body, getting air to it is a
challenge, as well as separation of cool air from hot air. When the
engine is hanging out in the open air on a Baja, access to air is not
as difficult, and hot air is dissipated such that not such a big
proportion is sucked back into the cooling system.

That depends on your environment and how close you are running to
critical engine temp levels (Captain! The dilithium crystals can't
take anymore!)

I'm more in favor of booster fans or misting something cold into the
air stream, like liquid nitrogen.
