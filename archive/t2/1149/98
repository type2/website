that is the interesting thing about mother nature....  if you work with
her,, things are easy!

so... it isn;t that difficult at all to get air inside a car body... just
use a fan to create a low pressure area.. and atmospheric pressure will push
the air you need into that car body.

and as for separating cool air from hot...  if you can speed up the air as
it tries to get the that low pressure area I mentioned before , then the air
cools by nature. So the vw engineers created a venturi  like area in the bay
buses to ensure the air speed increases and the temps drop before the air
hits the fan! lol
