usually it is a slipping fan belt, you should make sure it is tight to 
spec.

also you may get better results with the "Cogged" type fan belt (inside 
sort of looks like saw cuts were made in the belt.) these tend to slip 
less

I have not had any experience with the spray on stuff and would tend to 
avoid it as a belt should not slip under normal conditions, I would take 
this as a warning of something isn't quite right.
