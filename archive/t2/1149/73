Subject: RE: [T2] Was that '97 BMW power windows for buses?

I tried the early 90's cars first and they didn't have the right regulators.
Then I found the right ones in the late 80's cars.  The '86 and '87 had them.
I got them out of the '87 just because it looked like it hadn't been as
abused(interior).
