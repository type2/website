Subject: Type IV lower cooling tin question

Hi,

I recently picked up a 78 with type IV engine and while cleaning up
the interior found a set of lower engine cooling tins in a drawer.
Naturally this has me a bit concerned about the state of the engine -
going to do compression testing and baby the engine until I can verify
everything is functioning normally.

One question maybe you all could help me with before I start work -
can the lower engine tins be installed without removing the exhaust
manifolds?

Thanks
