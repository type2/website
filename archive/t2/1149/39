Subject: Sold my Van (thankyou)

Well, I sold my Van. $6200.00

I want to thank each and every one of you for your help and understanding.

Mostly, I want you all to know that when I had a problem and I asked a question that the answer was usually only minutes away.

This was most convienient.

I have never been around a support group with your knowledge and tenacity.

Thank you all.
