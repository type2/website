Thanks. I was able to get a woodruff key at my local hardware store-not
quite the right size, but it fits. It is a bit small, but I think it should
keep the pulley from spinning freely. Hopefully I'll be near a real shop
that would carry that in the right size, and now I know the size to ask for.

5x5mm metric.   My pulley is missing the woodruff key but it's torqued 
on damn tight and there's a lock washer under the nut.
