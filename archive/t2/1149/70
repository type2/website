Subject: 77 Deluxe Westy with propane questions

I have been getting no propane to my built in two burner stove. I removed the
fat orange hose from the end of the regulator and put my air hose into it. I
then turned on the two stove knobs as if there was gas and listened for air
hissing out at 70psi. Nothing. I can't believe the line is blocked since it's
never been disconnected before, but I'm not getting anything through it to the
burners. What am I missing? Does it need to be a higher psi??
