	Baja Boot. & similar beach-buggy VWs
typically have no means to build up any surplus
air pressure above the fan intake; no engine
door, nor any engine compartment which could have
a door!
	What oil or cyl head temps they attain
I'd be interested to learn.  I expect they're
hotter than a similar motor in original housing.
Only a small minority of those I've seen have any
crude close-fitting tin in some attempt to
improve cooling-air flow.
	I suppose the fact these doon-buggy
motors don't quickly blow up or seize is some
indirect evidence of how little it matters to
optimise all aspects of your cooling, and that
includes the flexible gasket sealing the motor in
the engine-compartment floor (one of my hobby
themes :-X).
	Anyhow, yes some do neglect the role of
the engine compartment, or even its existence;
and we know little of how long their engines
last.  But I bet there is some penalty, if not
overwhelmingly prompt.

	While we're on the theme and now learn of
electric servos from Munich, what do people think
about servo-controlled extensions to the air
scoops on the top rear of the T2 body?  Of course
they'd be expected to increase drag, but couldn't
the extra cooling they afford justify that?  The
idea is that you'd poke out/fw extra 'M. Mouse
esq' ears when you need extra air, and then
retract them when you were no longer climbing
flat-out  ...
