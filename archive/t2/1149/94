Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling tin on bottom of heater boxes

I'd like to throw in that the bottom tins have another purpose. For all
years, the lower tins act to stabilize the heater boxes. If your heater
boxes are old (heh) they are most likely loose or VERY loose around the
exhaust tubes. Leaving the lower tins off can create quite a racket. In
addition with less support it will allow the heater-boxes to vibrate, making
conditions worse (especially on Type 1 Buses).

Also (as partially mentioned earlier in this thread), if a thermostat is
being used, the lower tins act to protect the thermostat from dust, dirt and
grime as well as protect the push-rod tubes.

As for the discussion on cylinder head temperatures, I've never tested it,
but I'll be keeping mine on.
