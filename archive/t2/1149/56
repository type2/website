May I suggest this:

Not mine but I really like the idea. I would have added about 12" of 
width though.

What I did was adopt a used 10x12 ft shed from my grandparents when they 
moved, put it at my house and then extended it another 4ft. To the back 
of the shed I added two wide doors and that's where I park my Beetle - 
until it gets a resto job from me someday.
