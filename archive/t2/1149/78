Eron, don't know about BMW ones but I've rebuilt and repacked tons of VW and
Audi ones from the 80-90s, the cable style ones, replacing the cables that
snap.  After totally, and I mean totally removing the rock hard old lithium on
those, with elbow gease AND solvent, I repack those with a any good synthetic
moly, and have had excellent luck.  I presume BMW would have used similar
lithium initially, and that stuff usually has become rock hard glue.
 
YMMV, I know nothing about BMW regulators.  Lithium greases and moly were
incompatible in the day, and although things are more stable now, I clean
things anally when I change.

Speaking of which...
Anybody repack the drive gear with grease in these things before?  I would
assume that whatever they had in them - it's wasted by now?
I'd hate to install them only to have them DRAG.
