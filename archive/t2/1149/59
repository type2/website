Hi Bob.  Yes, I would think it would DEFINITELY fit in ALL our cars.  BMW
installed them under the rear plastic(?) window in the convertible top.  It
was housed in a VERY shallow space and is very thin.  I don't see why you
couldn't use it under the cowl in the bug, or in the rear under the back
window.  The unit has a relay mounted to it as well.  I'm going to put it in
the rear hatch of the bay under the 'defroster' glass.  I figure I can use the
stock defroster switch to activate it :^D
