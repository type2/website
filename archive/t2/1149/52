Subject: Power Window Motors and Bosch electric servo for thermostat

Howdy all,
While I was at the Pick-and-Pull this afternoon chasing down some parts for my
Passat and grabbing the electric window motors out of a '97 BMW 3-series to
install in my bus(per the recent link/writeup on the Samba) I noticed that the
Bavarians decided to actuate the cold and warm air via the climate control via
electronic servos behind the heater controls!  Not only did they look small
and robustly built, they already had the socket-and-ball rods attatched to
them!  For $5 I got the pair of servos, the harness, the relays and sockets
too(Bosch of course).  If anybody wants to see pics, e-mail me and I'll send
you a few.  All I need now is a thermostatic or timer circuit to act as a
controller.  I may be off-base here, but I don't see why a timer wouldn't do
the job.  You could even add a thermistor to the timer to lengthen the opening
and closing times for thermostat flap control.
Not a bad day!
I also grabbed the coolest self-contained defroster that contains a fan and
heating element in one VERY slim package out of a BMW convertible.
