Subject: Lower Ball Joint/Torsion arm question

Hi,

I have a bus with one bad ball joint. I've done the procedure for
replacing all four (pre-installed on the torsion arms) before. in this
case I'm looking to replace just the lower driver side torsion arm
with new ball joint pre-installed.

All the procedures I'm familiar with deal with replacing all 4, has
anyone ever replaced just a single lower torsion arm? I'd do all four
but would like to avoid the $50+ surcharge of getting an alignment
done after popping the top joints with their eccentric bushings.

Thanks
