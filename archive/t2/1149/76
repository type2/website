I'd start at the burner and remove the gas line and hook up air to it. 
If it works, remove the hose that runs from the coupling and see if it's 
clear, then check the coupling, then check the hose that runs from the 
tank to the regulator, and then check that propane is coming out of the 
regulator.  I'm pretty sure you'll then find out where the stoppage is. 
  This is also a great time to put new gas-rated teflon tape and test 
all of the connections for leakage and/or replace worn hoses.
