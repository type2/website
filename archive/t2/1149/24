Subject: 72-74 exhaust flanges

some months ago someone from one of the smaller companies had some custom 
cut replacement flanges made up for the 72-74 exhaust system.  had all the 
problems with my engine so just now getting to it, and I can't find the 
information I left for myself, anyone remember who it was.  they were 
custom made of  heavy steel think they were about $25 or so each.


thanks
Bob
