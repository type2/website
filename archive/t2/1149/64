Damn that is a pretty fair little heater then Eron, perhaps an honest 350-375W
or so.  Which isn't actually bad for this sort of thing.  Of course being the
acessory heater in a BMW with all the heat you could want blowing out of a
dash, and really helping an air cooled VW that much are very different things,
but still a heck of a lot better than the ridiculous 100W things that used to
sell on JC Whitless and now on $bay.
 
But again the hair dryer analogy is very apt.  About 1/4 of an average hair
dryer output (less than one running on low heat setting), so targeted on a
small spot on the windshield, sure might help.  Will it dent a bus, or even a
bug much for real interior heat, not really.
 
Now for my Bobcat, perhaps just the little ticket.  The big rig one wasn't
worth the money or the wiring headache, this might be if I can find one.
