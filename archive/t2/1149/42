So, Phil wants to back in and leave the exhaust gases outside. He could 
clamp a 25 foot flexible hose Of appropriate diameter to your tailpipe and 
swing the free end around to the front of the bus, secured so that it moves 
with the bus and he don't drive over it. IF the engine runs with that much 
back pressure, back the bus into the container, shut down the engine, get 
out and close it all up. The fumes never go inside. Note that I never said 
I tried it, or that it would work or be inexpensive. It would be an 
experiment. All the safety consequences are on Phil to work out if he 
decides to try this. But some shops do use hoses to pipe exhaust gases 
outside while they check engines of vehicles on the shop floor. I just 
don't think they drive around that way very long.
