Although this sounds real cool (or warm) and I'm impressed BMW installed it,
standard problem applies.   Even running on a 40A breaker right to the battery
and assuming a nice generous 13.2V or so, you are still only getting 500W out
of an electric heater.  I'll bet this thing isn't even for a 20A circuit as
well, and making those assumptions in an air cooled VW (the 40A to spare with
lights on at night and say a radio) may be optimistic.  So 1/6-1/3 the output
of a hair dryer, vs the volume of your car, might it help defrost a tiny area
on a windshield, maybe, just.  25-30 years ago, the VW mags always had this
glossy full page add for "the ultimate electric heater" can't recall the name
(picture of a shivering guy in a VW on the page) but of course in high school
I saved up a 2 weeks $2.35/hr wages and bought one for the '76 only to realize
this reality despite my dad (the EE) mentioning many times before I blew the
money how unlikely I was to be
 satisfied.  And it truely was 40A direct to the battery.
 
Still sounds cool as hell, what sort of convertible was it out of a Z3/4 or a
3 series?
 
I looked into these (12V electric heaters) again 2 years ago for my Bobcat cab
(very small 443B Bobcat, maybe a whopping 25-30 cubic feet space at most in
the cab, 1/2 a Bug interior at most.)  I got a little aircraft coolant heated
unit first and couldn't find a spot to mount and plumb it the cab is so
small.  Figured electric would be more compact and they do make a pretty HD
unit now days as a truckers accessory, but it (a whopping 800-900W unit I
think I recall) required full size battery cable runs, and although the little
25hp Bobcat has a 90A alternator, I decided that for the few times it was that
cold it was a lot easier to just put on my Carharts, instead of risking not
being able to start the little diesel beast because I'd been stressing my
battery.
 
YMMV.
