	Without knowing the full scene of
alternatives in the USA, let me offer my opinions
(USA translation: 2g worth):-
	Shock absorbers (better called dampers)
are not a luxury.  They damp the oscillations of
the wheel after hitting a bump as the springs
kick back almost all the energy that the bump
slapped into them.  Thus the tyre treads are on
the road more of the time.  This is worth real
money.  Fluttering of the wheels increases the
chances that the brakes will lock, if you're
braking hard at the time; and keeping the tyres
on the deck helps in other ways too!
	With decent dampers you get better
braking, which could keep you out of a crash;
better cornering (ditto); and savings in tyre
wear which will defray the cost of the dampers.
	Either spend the money or at least
caution your passengers, and other road users,
that you have less control of where your bus goes
and what it may hit.
