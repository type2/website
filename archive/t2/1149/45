there are two sets of lower tin.
one set is fairly small  4x6 inches and fits between and below the cyl 
above the push rod tubes.  this is a very critical piece and if they are 
not installed I would consider the engine suspect.

the push rod tubes have to be removed to install this tin.

there is another larger piece that actually attaches to the heater box and 
is not critical

hope this helps some.
