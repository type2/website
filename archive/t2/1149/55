Fasten some wooden guides for the inside edge of the tires (left and 
right) so the bus basically guides itself into the parking space. Add a 
2x4 at the end where the front tires or rear tires (whatever end goes in 
first) need to stop.

I use a 12x16 shed to store my Beetle and use a similar method.
