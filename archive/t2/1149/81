Subject: Cooling tin on bottom of heater boxes

I watched a video on Youtube yesterday, where a fellow expressed the opinion
that the front cooling tin (where trans and engine meet) that deflects the
cooling air down and "around" the cylinder there is crucial. I agree with
this. He then said that the bottom tin that goes under the heater boxes
carries the air to the back of the engine where the gap about a human hand
width acts as you drive to create a vacuum and draw the air out in a
slipstream effect. I have the front cooling tin in place, but replaced my
heater boxes with a set of headers and there is no way to put the tin back on.
I'd like to hear from the armchair engineers amongst us as to what they think
of  this, especially if you also have this heater box bottom tin missing and
what your engine reliability is like. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
