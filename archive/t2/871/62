 From Kevin H. Roberts:

 Speedo needle works so that is the problem.  I'm not sure I'm in a  hurry to fix it.  It does bother me that
I can't check my gas  mileage and measure distances but I'll never know what the actual  mileage is.  Could be
387,000 plus whatever I've put on it in 6 or 7 years.

 They show an 11 tooth gear for a VW Super Beetle.  Is that the same one?

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I just went out and counted one on a Vanagon speedo. It is 17 teeth.

 This site does not show a 17 [single]:

 The original site I sent does:

 Like the above link says in red: Please count the teeth before ordering.
