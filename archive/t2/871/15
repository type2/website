I see people talk about this subject alot.  What I want to know is, what do
I replace them with so I don't have to do this every year?  I mean is there
some upgraded hose out there that is designed to last longer than a few
years?  (I am going for reliability here not "I'm lazy and want something
that will last forever so I don't have to think about it")

I guess this leads me to another question.   What is it about busses that
make life so difficult for the fuel lines?  Is it just age or a combination
of factors that make busses so prone to fuel line problems?   Maybe its jus=
t
my being naieve and maybe this is common with all old cars but it seems
particularly important with busses.
