Subject: 1974 Automatic Transmission Problems

A friend is having problems with the automatic transmission on his 1972 Westy.
(Transmission slips on upshifts).
He has had a qualified mechanic open the tranny and he is now looking for
parts. (Shims, thrust washers etc). Hoping that someone on the list may know
of a parts supplier or have a good used Automatic. Thanks.
