Subject: RE: Breakdown in CA: Help needed (Update)

Something similar happened to me last year. I found out that it was the head
temp sensor that was in fault: Intermittent malfunctioning. I changed it for
a new and it did the trick. (Resistance test was negative BTW) My friend had
also a similar problem and the problem was that it kept on coming on loose.
When I say loose I don't mean it fell off the socket, just a few turns. It
might be worth trying to torque it.  How did you measure the HTII sensor
resistance? Did you take the sensor off?

Good luck

I replaced the cap rotor and coil. Nada. It seemed there was an improvement,
but that could be due to the bus being cold too. Speaking of cold, I also
tested the temp sensor II. Because the bus cuts out completely I wasn't
worried about any specific resistance, but whether at various temps it still
maintained SOME resistance, but never going open. Passed that test.
(Example: at 200 degrees it showed 375ohms. I was unable to test cold.)

I pulled and reattached all the plugs and wires I could find, checking for
looseness and corrosion. Everything looks good.

The problem came on gradually, starting out just occasionally at the high
end of 2nd and only when the bus was warm. Now it's in all gears and all
load levels, WOT, part throttle, whatever. Intermittent bucking and engine
just shutting off for a moment.
