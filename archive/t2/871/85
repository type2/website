I have a set of plans by Popular Mechanics 0n how to build a Phoenix Camper. 
Phoenix is built on a stock vw Transporter chassie,Any year 67 or later 
bus,Combi,Transporter,or caravette may be used. This is a sharp looking camper I 
believe these plans were from 1969 at the time the price was $15:00 any one 
interested just make a donation. This is your chance to build something totally 
differnt.I will be out of town until 5-13
