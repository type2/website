Subject: T2-T3 parts interchangability

Hi all,
I have a 2L '77 bus. There is some one wrecking a '82 (T3) high top camper not far 
from me.

I was wondering whether the motor and transmission (manual) are interchangable?
I have never had a T3, so don't know how different thay are, especially the trans.
I am aware the T3 motor will have different EFI and exhaust (square exhaust 
ports), and tinware, but is the rest the same?

Thanks,
Richard
