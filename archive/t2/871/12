Dante,

Welcome!  Grab yourself an official manual published by Bentley (It's Green)
and familiarize yourself on buses at our man Richard Atwell's site

www.ratwell.com (right guys?)

Richard started out as newbie a few years ago about the same time as I joined
the list
and he is now a genius folk hero while I have remained an anonymous noodler.

Welcome again,

Billy
Murfreesboro, TN
