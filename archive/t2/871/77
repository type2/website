Subject: hylomar; accept no substitutes

I'd like to add a data point to the Hylomar discussion that was on 
the list a while back.

There was a nice product  - Permatex Holomar HPF - that hung on the 
racks in all the parts stores that I haunt. I've gone through three 
tubes of this over the year. As I was nearing the last brutal squeeze 
at the bottom of my current tube, I had to replenish. As the list 
said, I could not find it on the racks. I Googled, and found a 
product  - Hylomar Universal Blue Racing Formula Gasket and Jointing 
Coumpound. This sounded similar enough. I bought it by mail order.

It shares the name Hylomar, but that's about all.

The original was stiff enough to stay where you put it,  tacky enough 
to make gaskets stay in place as you joined them, and, magically, 
easily separated years after application. What more could a guy want?

The UBRFG&JC squirts out of the tube, runs down a valve cover, and is 
not tacky enough to hold parts in place.

This stuff may have its use, but it is not a substitute for Permatex Hylomar.

Has anyone found a replacement?

Jack
