Well, guess what? It was the filter and/or the fat hose between the filter
and the pump. That hose was disintegrating, and looked like it was
collapsing when the pump ran. The filter was full of rubber chunks too.

Test drive went perfectly.

I'll pick up another spare filter and get outta dodge!

Thanks for all your help everybody!
