Subject: 1600 DP engine (new) with bad #2 cylinder

To recap:

New meximotor (December 2005 - 5,000 miles or so)

#2 cylinder fires only occasionally after having sucked in the 
accelerator pump injection tube

pulling spark plug wires from distributor drops RPMs on #3, #4, #1 
about the same - on #2 about half as much as the rest

switching spark plug wires 1 & 2 (the two long ones) does not change 
anything

all spark plug wires measure about 1000 ohms resistance (also tested 
from the distributor cap contact to the spark plug electrode)

spare distributor cap (not new) does not change anything (in partial 
response to Airic's and Jamie's post - haven't swapped rotors yet, I 
may drop in the old 009)

new spark plugs (Bosch W8AC vs NGK BP5ES-A) yields same result - #3, 
#4, #1 all gray/brown, #2 black (not oily) indicating incomplete 
combustion (in response to Airic's post)

compression is 115 lbs all the way around (in response to Arnaud's post)

vacuum steady at idle (about 15" - idle at about 950 RPM) - unable to 
do leakdown test presently (in response to Jamie's post)
