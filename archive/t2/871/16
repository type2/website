I think it's just the proximity of the leak to things that can start
fires. If a fuel line breaks or wears out on my Mustang, it will just
leak, and stink most likely, but not only that but uless it leaks up
near the engine, there is little or less chance of it catching fire.

In my 74 bay, I had a couple leaks that should have been the end of
her, they were hard to see but you could smell them bad, and they leak
in the engine compartment where there is ample opportunity for it to
ignite.

Right now, my 68 is stinkin of gas pretty bad and I have "looked" for
a leak but can't see one. This means that I need to go buy some line
and just start replacing it, eventually I will have it all freshened
up and I won't need to worry about it for years, likely.

later,
