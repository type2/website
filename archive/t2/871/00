Glenn,

**Use** freeze12.   You can use it in an old r12 system or a new 
r134 type system.

Just make sure that you have a new dryer, and then fill-er up!

Oh, and make sure to go ahead and change out the oil in the compressor to 
the oil that likes either 134 or r12....available at your finer FLAPS.

Used the freeze12 in my new install last year on the recomendation of a 
buddy who has been in the automotive A/C design business since we were in 
college(35 years).

Actually, he is the one who designed the bay window system's when we 
worked for Volkswagen.

Cheers, dave

I have heard of Freeze12, but I also heard it contains Butane!  Not something I would want to have leak into my Bus.
