I have the same engine and if you can wait, I can get you some pics of mine. I
have all the vacuum hoses connected, except for the cracked balance pipe
elbow. I will check my pc today and see if I already have some pics. When I
was setting up my carbs last year, I got some pics that might show the lines
you are interested in or get you close. Their is not really much that needs to
be connected on this motor.
