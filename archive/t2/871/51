It's a matter of two things:

1. The V6 has about three decades of additional development in it.

2. The VW, being aircooled, probably runs a bit rich at high power
settings to keep the engine cooler.  A watercooled engine does not need
this extra cooling and can be run leaner.

The fuel you put in is basically porportional to the work you get out.  It
takes pretty much the same amount of work to push a VW bus around as it
does your quest, so the fuel use is the same.  The only difference is that
the Quest has more power on tap when you want it, but if you used that
power all the time you would certainly get less mileage.  For normal use
you are pulling the same power from the engine most of the time.
