On my '77, can't say for the other years, there was a 3" section of hose
making the 90 degree bend where the vent from the tank gets attached to
the tube leading up to the condenser unit welded in the fresh air duct
on the left hand side. You can't see the bend, feel around up there or
use a mirror. It won't overflow on normal fill ups, but if the van's
leaning to the left, you've got Niagra going on! Something to check,
anyway. Because I'm running a 1600cc engine I've got no use for the
charcoal canister or condenser, so I connect  both vent lines together
and run it out the hole in the tin on the side opposite the battery.
