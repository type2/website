Subject: FI's cleaned - no FART, please

I received 8 FI's from CruzinPeformance this week and I am really pleased
with the work.

Rich returned EVERYTHING with the cleaned and tested and documented FI's,
which included, for each of the FI's, the hose that was cut off (1 1/2 hose,
and I am going to replace with Karls recommended Continental 7.5 x 3mm FI
hose from the local MB dealer, which I measured to be not much - if any-
different from the 7 x 3mm FI hose I have with the VW stamp on it) and the
base rings and the pintle caps (new pintle caps were put on) and the
filters.  Boy, are those filters tiny!!

Oh, yes, Rich also returned the Sunbeam bread twist ties I was using to
identify which of my FI's were bad (blue color twist tie) and which of them
were good for project use (white color twist ties)
