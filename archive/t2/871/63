Subject: Re: [T2] Milage of my Quest vs bus

The Nissan has the same displacement as the VW motor (500 cc per cylinder)
but benefits from overhead cams, larger valves, higher compression, computer
ignition and retard control, computer controlled transmission, much better
aerodynamics etc... But, with no personality! :)

Check out the latest HOT VW's, it has an article about a feller designing a
four-valve head for the type 1 motor! He even slapped on twin turbos if I
remember right!

Perhaps modern technology will catch the VW crowd. I am running MPFI in my
DC and I can't wait to see what that does for modern drivability.

 Hey it's Friday-the short question is why does a 3 liter V6 get the same
 milage as our bus, when the V6 is much faster and powerful?
