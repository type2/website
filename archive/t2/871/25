Subject: Walmart awning

Hey, guys.  I had several requests to put the Walmart awning pics  and installation instructions up on my website.  Thanks to Daniel  Nelson doing some html coding for me, I finally got it up.  He  found one at a pretty good price on Ebarf.  I paid the regular  price...$29.96.  No complaints.  (It's not an original idea  as I saw one of these at Bugapalooza last year.)   Again, these  may be discontinued so you might rush to your local Walmart to  see.  It's the Ozark Trail 11 x 8 ft. Dining Canopy. The numbers  on the ticket are: 
  
ST# 5251, DP#0000072,  TR#04589
