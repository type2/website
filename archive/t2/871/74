Subject: RE: [T2] fuel injection systems

Congrats on getting a VW 78 FI Bus.  I have one too, but it is a camper.

As Jules said, and I second it, Change all fuel lines it will save your life
and the life of your bus.  Change all the little piddley stuff that costs
nothing. Your local VW Store can tell you want hose to buy to replace it.  I
would buy extra just in case. Also make sure that clamps get back on and
they are secure.>

Same for the battery tray. Get one welded in there.

Websites: http://www.ratwell.com/ is where you need to look at. Also buy the
Bentley's Green Book. It will help you out when you're under the bus.

Places to buy stuff: Check your local VW stores first. Busdepot.com is very
good. Too many to list, but start there.  (Check Ratwell's for more.

Gas Tank cleaning: I am going to do that, but read Ratwell's version and do
it on a very dry day. You will have to pull the engine (or at lest drop it
to get the gas tank out). If you do, that would be the time to inspect the
clutch, tyranny and all that stuff.  Not trying to scare you, but spending
time and $$ now will save you headaches later.

www.hueymungus.com/VW has photos of my 78 FI camper bus and what engines
look like out.

ps: I had a lot of help in my engine pullout and I am not by any means
knowledgeable about how VW's work.  I did gain a lot of info doing it and
having others show and explain.  So I pass this along just to help you out.
