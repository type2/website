Subject: Don's Road Trip - Heading Home (1)

After fixing the fuel filter and getting everybody loaded into the Guac, it
was around 4pm. My wife still really wanted to visit her old friend in Big
Bear, so up we went. We took the "side" way through Redlands (hwy 30) since
her friend lives in Sugarloaf. Got there around 6:30, visited for a while,
then headed out for some dinner. We ended up at the Carl's Jr that I worked
at when I lived there.

We got back on the road around 9pm, and went down the desert side (hwy 18).
Stopped and took a picture at a sign I'd never seen before: Happy Trails
Highway. WTF? Couldn't pass up that photo op... ;-)

Landed in Barstow at 11-ish and I was fading fast so stopped for the night.
Travelodge on Main St. AVOID. Non-smoking room smells like smoke, cig ashes
UNDER the bedspread, a dirty footprint under the bedspread on the other bed,
roaches, thin towels, and $80 a night. Ugh.

The Guac thought he was a sports car the whole way. He kept sneaking the
speed to 80 without my knowing! =)
