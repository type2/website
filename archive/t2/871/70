Richard,

Replace the missing battery tray with a new one. Hot air will be drawn
into your cool air-stream without it and you will run hot. As for the
fuel lines there's plenty of pictures of burnt out buses out there,
its a good idea to replace ALL questionable fuel lines. You'll
probably need to drop and clean your tank out, or stock up on fuel
filters as you'll be replacing them often if you don't (ask me how I
know). Sorry I can't offer any suggestions on FI I'm running a carbed
1600.

Good luck!

peace
