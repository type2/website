Subject: Re: [T2] towlng a bus from CA. to WI.

I will be towing another car (not my bus) this summer and am going to use a uhaul truck along with an auto transport trailer (not an auto dolly) to keep all 4 wheels off the ground. In looking at the uhaul instructions, I see that the heavy end of the towed vehicle must be loaded toward the front. If a bus were being loaded backwards, I might turn the mirrors out of the wind stream or take them off. Also make durn sure the doors are shut tight and locked. They also strongly warn against loading the towed vehicle up with 'stuff'. Bulky, lightweight items might be ok. There is also a max weight issue and the bus is fairly heavy. You can stop by a uhaul dealer and get their instructions for the details.

Good luck,

depends a lot on what she is towing it with, a bus is pretty heavy for
it's size.  and I would bet that she would fill it up with "Stuff" for the
move.  she also needs to cross the mountains something that will put a
strain on both the tow vehicles engine and on the brakes.  personally I
would rent a BIG U-haul truck and a large trailer that could carry the
bus.
