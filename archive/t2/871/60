Subject: speedo working but Odometer does not change!

I bought a 73 thing to get going, as if I do not have enough vehicles. It  
has a speedo that shows the speed (after replacing the grease cap with a square  
hole, instead of a round hole) but the odometer does not change. Is this  
probably the same problem.
