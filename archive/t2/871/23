While there are longer lasting materials out there, I think that the best
route is to use stock materials and replace them regularly.  The fuel tank
should really be drained every couple of years (completely, through the
big nut if possible) and this is a convenient time to take a half hour and
replace the hoses.  Even in aircraft, where top of the line materials are
used, lines are replaced every five years.

Buses are not particularly tough on hoses.  They just last long enough
that hoses can become an issue.

There are a couple of design issues that might need addressing in a
"forever bus".

The metal fuel line passes through the engine tin on the type 1 engine and
the hole is protected by a grommet.  The grommet fails after a few years
and the tin
vibrates its way through the metal tube causing a leak both inside and
outside the engine bay, right over the #3 exhaust pipe.  Bad News.  I
replaced the grommet with a roll of inner-tube rubber that has lasted for
a decade without deterioration.  When it does deteriorate it will do so
slowly and give me time to notice.  I also replaced the fuel line that
goes through the tin, extending the part that goes forward another few
inches to keep the rubber fuel line under the tank away from the heat of
the exhaust pipe.
