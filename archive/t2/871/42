Joe,

Once upon a time many years ago in a 72 bus, I had some problems
with it pulling hard to the left....all the time.

Replaced a lot of things, but since it was only 1978, the bus 
was fairly "new", so I couldn't understand what was going on.

This problem persisted across two new sets of tires and a full 4 wheel 
alignment by the local VW house.  The tires never showed any weird wear, 
so I just go used to it.

I finally swapped the left and right front wheels and lo and behold, the 
problem was now that it pulled to the left.

When all else seems to fail, look at the tires.

Since you are going to replace the tires, I suggest that you do so and 
then see how it feels.  

Then go to a a place that specializes in alignment, not "european" cars.

I've never had a problem getting any of my "older" VW's aligned at the
local tire/alignment place.

Cheers, dave
