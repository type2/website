Subject: Re: [T2] Milage of my Quest vs bus

quoth John Stiles:The Nissan has the same displacement as the VW motor 
(500 cc per cylinder)
but benefits from overhead cams, larger valves, higher compression, computer
ignition and retard control, computer controlled transmission, much better
aerodynamics etc... But, with no personality! :)

Yeah, same displacement per cylinder but 6 of them not four!  So it will 
cruise at 70 but get the same milage as the bus doing 55!
