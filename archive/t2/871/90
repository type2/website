Richard's had some luck with barbeque paint. I tried header paint on an Empi
muffler and it didn't do well, though that's probably more due to the Empi
muffler than the paint itself.

More than likely, the paint on the muffler currently will cook off quickly.
The manufacturers put paint on to protect the muffler during storage and
shipping, but not for use.

If you have the $$, get the whole thing ceramic coated. That'll be your best
chance at long term protection.
