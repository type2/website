   At the local VW meeting last night a story was relayed of a '65 (I 
believe) that was in good shape but didn't run for sale for $900. The guy 
looked at it and it started but died as soon as the gas pedal was pressed. 
He argued that $900 was steep for a bus that didn't run and wound up buying 
it for $300 (crazy).

   After some investigating he discovered a small bit of metal tubing used 
to splice the fuel line that was coroded and full of rust. I think he said 
the new fuel line was about $1.42 and the bus ran like a champ.

   $301.42 for a '65 bus running and in good shape seems like a sweet deal 
to me!  :)
