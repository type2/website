Jerry, exactly what is ABC's position these days.
 Are they still "dedicated to the restoration,
preservation, and enjoyment of the pre-1968
Volkswagen Transporter?"  We can show up in a
loaf bus, but we cannot enjoy or preserve them? 
Cannot mention them?  What exactly does that
mean?  

I guess I've never gotten over the bad taste that
statement leaves in my mouth.
