Subject: Megasquirt on 82 Vanagon

Hello list,  I am making slow progress installing a new Megasquirt 
injection system on the bus and could use a leg up from the guys who 
have done this on the same engine.
I am using MS-II, V3.0 board, fuel only until I get everything running 
well, then ignition control as well.
I cannot get it to idle, and only runs when I advance the ignition a lot.
I would love to get your .msq and VE tables if you have arrived at a 
tuning set-up that you are happy with.  Are you running the original low 
impedance injectors? with PWM or resistors?

Thanks very much. I will take this off list now, I just wanted to 
contact the VW guys on megasquirt as directly as I could.
