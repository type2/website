Or go to your local BMW motorcycle (or possibly car) dealer.

Apparently, Permatex was buying hylomar from the manufacturer and
packaging it themselves.  The manufacturer tried to force a major price
increase on Permatex and that is why Permatex stopped carrying the product
in their line.

If you check the hylomar.com site you will find the following:

-----------------------------------------
For anyone worrying about getting their Hylomar since Permatex stopped
carrying .Hylomar HPF. - Worry no more! We have huge stocks of Racing
formula, and Universal Blue AF( sic. HPF ) in stock around the world if
you can't find it at your nearest stockist just e-mail  info(-at-)hylomar.com
and give us their contact details and we will show them the error of their
ways or find  a stockist near you who is carrying Hylomar!
----------------------------------------

Production has certainly not stopped, but the price has most likely gone
up!  Still, at the rate I use it I don't think that I'll have to choose
between food and Hylomar.
