This type of "ultra van"?

"The Corvair UltraVan is the world's greatest vehicle. Essentially it is an 
airplane without wings, having no chassis and being of monocoque 
construction. Due to its light weight (and UNIQUE shape) it's not uncommon 
for it to get 15-17 mpg running 70 mph on the Interstate. And it gets more 
looks than anything else on the road. Approximately 375 of these were 
constructed between 1959 and 1971, on mostly a custom manufacture basis."
