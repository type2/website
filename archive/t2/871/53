OK it's Saturday morning but I will pretend it's still Friday.  I 
recently purchased a chevy corvair greenbrier van (which might be for 
sale if anyone is interested) and have just discovered the ultra van, 
which is probably the largest air cooled camper ever made.  Thinking 
about it, did I see one at everybus?  If so I'd love to here more about it.
