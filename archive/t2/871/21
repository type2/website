Subject: Alignment & Tire Question...

Finally got the bus back on the road after a year of slumber... replaced the front beam, ball
joints, tie rods, drag link, etc..  Basically, a whole new front end on kinda rusty '69 Westy.

I took the Bus in for a front end alignment to the local European auto shop.  Got it back the
first time, they didn't center the steering wheel (crossbars were straight up and down instead of
across).  Got it "close" the second time, but acceptable.

The problem is, it Bus still seems a little shaky.  The only parts on the front end that aren't
new (or proper) are the passenger car tires that are on it (Duralon 195/75/14, I believe).  I'm
planning on replacing them with either Hankook RA08 or Continental Vanco 8 tires in the near
future, but can the wrong tires make the bus feel like the front end is still loose?  It almost
feels worse now then it did before the front end went bad.  I'll get kind of a shimmy back and
forth occasionally, and it seems to pull to the right at times.  

Just curious at this point.  I'm thinking about bringing the bus back again to the shop about the
pulling to the right thing, but I'd like some advice how much effect the tires will have.
