Subject: Re: [T2] Milage of my Quest vs bus

Speedo needle works so that is the problem.  I'm not sure I'm in a  hurry to fix it.  It does bother me that I can't check my gas  mileage and measure distances but I'll never know what the actual  mileage is.  Could be 387,000 plus whatever I've put on it in 6 or  7 years.  
  
  They show an 11 tooth gear for a VW Super Beetle.  Is that the same one?  $29 shippped.  Thanks...KR
  
  


"odometer sensor in tranny (ouch)"

 Is that why mine has been stuck on 87,000 since I got the bus?  How much are they?  Cheers...KR

You are referring to your 76 camper?

If yes, does the speedometer needle work?

If yes, you have a broken gear on the end of the odometer shaft. Common problem. This place sells them but
they are not cheap:

You will need to count the number of teeth on yours. I think it is 11 but it has been a long time since I
counted one.
