Subject: Don's Road Trip - Heading Home (2)

Stopped in Richfield, UT, for the night. Against my better judgement we
stayed at yet another Travelodge. Happily, this one was nice and a few bucks
cheaper than the one we stayed in last night.

Again the Guac ran well, but now it's showing that it's tired of the road
trip. I've developed a chirp that I believe is an exhaust leak. No power
loss, just chirping at idle and low RPMs. The oil leak is growing. Instead
of 3 little dots, there's a single larger smear after parking all night. And
finally, the hot start issue has hit me for the first time. If I stop for
gas, no problem. If I stop for 30-45 minutes, like to eat, the starter
doesn't even click. A screwdriver to the terminals starts it right up.
Voltage at the battery is still nearly 13v, so the voltage drop has to be
across the ignition switch or the wires to-from. Guess it's a relay for me
when I get a chance.

Today I get to go over the Rockies. At least it'll be daylight. heh
