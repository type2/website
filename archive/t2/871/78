Hi Volks,

Two weeks later and It's finally uploaded:
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/VW_type2/EB2006

Many thanks to the Auch and Cybulski Families for making our family's  
best vacation ever possible.  And thanks again to all those behind  
the Golden Pancake Award.

It was a great time, and I can't wait to do it again soon. See you at  
BusFusion!!

Happy trails,
