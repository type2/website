From Troy: 
 
It's never a bad time to mention it.  When I did the rebuild on the engine
that's in the Guac, there was no better time to replace all the lines.  I
replaced all the vent lines as well.  I wanted to replace the larger line
from the pump to the filter with the correct one instead of something that
would just work from FLAPS.
