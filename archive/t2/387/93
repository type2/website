Subject: wiring ? heater fan 78

Hi!  I found a fan to install in the bus.  but I don't have a clue on how it
should be wired up.  I have the little 2" or so square box and the accepting
plug.  out of that comes a brown and black striped wire that I assume hooks up
with the brown and black strip wire on the fan?  But as it leaves the little
box it goes about 8" and goes into a two plug female flat plug and then out
again with a brown and black strip wire... huh?  then ends in a female wire
clip after about 4" of wire.

There is a ground male stub on the fan housing support, I assume that is
ground...

So what is the flat two slot plug for?

 It appears that someone spliced a short wire on the hot wire (red with in
line fuse) going the box???? that should be removed unless someone tells me it
is needed?

O great bastion of knowledge can you help me?  Thanks in advance!
