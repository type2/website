The only alternative freon that I have found that works real is R-409
which has a small amount of R-12 in it--same head pressure's--excellent
cooling properties, and mixes with the mineral oil--no changes
necessary.

But--the problem with it is--in small quantifies it isn't
available--only a 30 lbs. bottle--and it is $200.00 bucks a bottle--

Not really good for a once in awhile top off--

And you have to have a license to buy it--

I use it in Semi's so I usually have a bottle  laying around.

This all goes to show ya--there isn't an easy way around this AC dilemma
short of just converting to 134--and getting it over with.

It just doesn't blow as cold--and is a pain to do the conversion
properly--
And I don't mean dumping some sort of snake oil into the system that
will convert your mineral oil to be compatible with the 134.

I would be a little concerned with this propane / butane stuff--it just
doesn't sound really appealing to me--especially in a pressurized
environment--

Probably a mix of propane and butane, which is what F-12 originally
replaced. It will probably work fine, but if you have your system
evacuated by a pro AC guy he will cuss you out because you contaminated
the R-12 that he was going to resell. 
Some say that this stuff is dangerous because it is flammable, but it
seems that a pound of flammable propane is trivial compared to the
hundred pounds of gasoline that we carry around without worry. 
I love the "organic" label. Well, it is, seeing as it is made of carbon
compounds!
