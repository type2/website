As for the fuel pump, I turned the motor by hand and gas spewed out.  
Also, It doesn't have the familiar attribute of fuel starvation.  Motor 
doesn't cut out, only doesn't accelerate.  Rolling resistance-- well I 
can push the bus by hand--tires OK.  Sediment--I did replace the fuel 
lines, fuel filter looks clean.

Gotta go to work now, but will catch up tom'w.  Thanks.
