Hi Meg,

Jeff Stewart ran into this problem a couple years back when working on
his 76 westy. His solution was deceptively simple:

The hinge bolt to the door and body differently, but the pins are the
same. Drive out the hinge pin and you can match the new door up to the
old hinge.

It couldn't hurt to give it a try.

Happy trails,
