Subject: Re: where to find GL4 80W90 gear oil

Rick,

I did find some GL4 90W at the local Carquest put it in my tranny and drove it 
around the block several times and it seems to have quieted the noise that I 
was hearing that I suspected was the pinion bearing, for now. This bus is still 
not road worthy yet so I guess I really won't know for a while.
