Subject: RE: [T2] Cyl Head temperature Sensors

Mine was a little tight last time. I used some antisieze when I installed
the new one. Try using a torque wrench to remove it. If it takes a lot of
torque without moving, stop! (I never found a spec, but assumed similar to
spark plugs)  Then maybe run the engine to get it hot. Things usually
(depending on material) come apart more readily hot than cold. DON'T
re-install while hot; let cool all the way down first(couple hours).

On the subject of temp. senders, how difficult is it to remove the FI Head
temp sender?  I've never changed this, and have owned my bus since 1989.  I
am worried it is stuck in the head, and will booger the hole when I try to
get it out. Any tips??
