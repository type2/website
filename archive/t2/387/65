Subject: correct vacuum elbow?

Looks to me like the big one is the auxilliary air regulator elbow, which continually blows on mine and other's engines. 

The aux air regulator is mounted to the top of the case sort of underneath the plenum but accessible.

replacements should be available for your part number, I've bought them for under 2 bucks at a vwflaps.
