Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

so Will A. ,where can i find the pressure plate and clutch disc i dont see it (-at-) the Depot?
I have me a list figured out here of 
Throw out bearing($19.95)
Pilot Bearing($3.95)
Flywheel ($159.95)
Rear main seal($9.95)
Clutch Disc($?where?)
Pressure Plate($?where?)
I am willing to get all this stuff new if this is going to take care of the job?
I want it all replaced and right not just to do for now, this is going to be a daily driver for me and i will be useing it for work and to get my daughter back and forth from school.
money is an issue but i also bought this bus in mind that it was going to be a investment in which it has been.
i named her grace and grace well she has been very mistreated and ruffed up.
She has found a good home though and lots of love that i have been pouring into her.
peace and thanks
Cha




Money is an issue but 
Would not hurt to get a 
new
pressure plate too and if you want to do it right resurface the flywheel.
Definitely worth it to replace the main seal while you are there, and
replace the throwout bearing, and many would say to replace the pilot
bearing too, which is like a $3 part. . . Anyway if you do all that for
about $100 you shouldn't need to pull it again for a while.
