Subject: [T2] Re: where to find GL4 80W90 gear oil

If you're running anything but straight GL-4, you should probably research
the archives on this subject. I don'y have any experience, but saw enough
threads on that subject to make me go order some GL-4 on the internet.

Why not just use some Castrol 80W90 Hypoy C gear oil which says on the
back "exceeds GL5 standards". I've run it before and not had any problems. I
honestly couldn't tell you what GL3,4,5 means so I might be missing
something
here.
