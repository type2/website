Subject: What causes a 30# compression reading?

My 1979 2000 engine started misfiring and I troubleshot down to a 30#
compression on the #4 cylinder.  Now I suspect that either the piston ring or
valve seat has failed.  I heard that type II engines are known for valve seats
to fail.  Is this true and how will I know when I look at it?
