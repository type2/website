Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

heya bob 
well i priced everything and comes up to 318.45 from bus depot.
I am east coast and they usually get what i need to me within 3 or 4 days or so weekdays that is.
I live in upstate South carolina.

I want to have the flywheel i have resurfaced but how would i go about such ?
does it need to be taken to a machine shop or what? how much does that usually cost.
the price above is with all new parts.
now how hard is it going to be to do all this stuff?
can i do it fairly easy once the engine is out?
Am I  going to have to take all kinds of stuff off just to get all these itiems replaced?
