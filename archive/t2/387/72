BTW, I've been able to get a line on some N-scale splitties that were part
of a group of miniatures that I gave away to a model railroading friend some
time back.  He's going to return the minis to me so that I can look into
casting repros of them.  Hopefully it'll be something that I can legally use
to produce some solid resin buses.
