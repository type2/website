Subject: Buses By The Mill - thank you Amy and Bill

I'd like to thank Bill and Amy Monk for their efforts to organize
Buses By The Mill.  Even though my wife Kathy and I didn't get there
until 9PM on Saturday we enjoyed it.  I got to sit around Saturday
night's campfire with old friends and new and then woke up Sunday
morning to a breakfast that was unbelievable.  I did manage to tank
some pictures, you can find them at
