Mike,

You can get the case modified to accept a larger pin in the case
with the normal end for the bearing.

I have only seen this once and had it done on a case that I almost
ruined...not from running, but after it was out of the car.

They made a "special" pin to fit.

Piece of cake for a machine shop.

Cheers, dave
