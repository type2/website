Kyle,

What's your CCA, or cold cranking amps rating?

You probably don't know unless you have a hell of a multi-meter.

Last time I was in your shoes, my battery was reading 12.5 volts but wouldn't turn over the starter.

Took it to a shop for a real charge, they topped off the water and showed me the CCA before and after, I was only at half my rating, like 200 out of 400.

Bus fired up right away.

Cost about 15 bucks at shell.

Billy
