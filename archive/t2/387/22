I did this laying under my bus for lack of money. Could have gotten ALOT 
more expensive had I made the slightest mistake. If you drill too far 
you'll go right into the combustion chamber I believe. I used - catch this 
- Chevy small block exhaust studs. The threads were coarse enough to bite 
the stripped hole (once drilled larger and tapped) and still not so large 
that the headers wouldn't fit (with some drilling on the header pipes). Oh 
- and that was all I could get locally in my small town. I've got maybe 30K 
miles on this Frankenstein repair and no leaks. YMMV.

Yeah - I'd like to here that answer too. My only info would be that 1 it's 
going to endanger you and your passengers because of carbon monoxide leaks. 
2 it's going to wear away the metal of the head or pipe if it leaks for a 
long time (I had a loose head on a Beetle and that cut a big hole in the 
top of one of the cylinders - didn't hurt the head). 3 it's obnoxious. 4 as 
I understand it the pressure pulses going through an exhaust system from 
each cylinder influence the other cylinders and when correct they help 
remove the exhaust from the combustion chamber but if one is out of whack 
(from a leak) - would this hinder the other cylinders?

Yeah - too much information is just about right...
