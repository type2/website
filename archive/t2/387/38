--Chris,

I'm throwing your reply to the list, as this is getting beyond my experience level and I don't want to steer you wrong.

Seems like more oil and try again, since you did get a measureable change. I suggest getting that ring nice and juicey and see what happens.

Either way, it's looking like a head/cyl/valve thing one way or another.

Yes, but let's see what the other's say first.

>The only thing it could be is the alignment - right?

You mean valve adjustment? Yeah, I guess if you were way off you'd have low readings like that, but the oil in the cylinder tells a tale to me.

Naturally, get more list advice and double check everything before dropping the engine.
