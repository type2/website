Well lots of nibbles but no takers on Pokey yet. I have 
dropped the price to $6000 Canadian / $4000 US. You can view 
details at: 

www.vanagon.ORG

I may go another week or so, otherwise I am putting her up 
for sale on that "oxion" site that starts with e and ends in 
Bay.

Thanks,
Chris

P.S. The air cooled AC Unit is SOLD
