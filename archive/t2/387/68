Seth,

The correct dizzy should be a 205T. There is only one vac port on the 
can and the dizzy is vac advance only. Timing is set at 0 TDC at idle 
of 850 with hose disconnected and plugged. IF you have a 30pict2 or 3 
the vac port should be on the left side FIF. If you are not sure try 
all the ports on the carb. Only one will make it advance correctly 
(fully)

All the above if from memory so check after me. Everything you ever 
wanted to know about VW dizzies can be found at

Happy Advancing
