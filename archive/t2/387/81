 sensor for the FI system that is placed right next to where the intake

 sensor (like for a gauge) to hook there.


 You are thinking of 2.0 heads..... 1.8 FI heads have the sensor above #3 intake port. If you look at just
about all [except 79 and up] 3/4 upper cylinder tin, you will see a rubber plug in a 1" hole above #3 intake.
That is where the 1.8 sensor goes. A major PITA to change! The hole in the head is on a 45 degree angle.
The only pic in the Bentley about the sensor is in section 10, page 15, figure 4-12. It is only a drawing but
it is the 1.8 sensor, not the 2.0. Look at the angle and the cooling fins.....
