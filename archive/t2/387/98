Subject: Barter Question

Still rather a newbie, I  have a question...

I changed the bulbs in my rear lights this morning only to discover that
while the lenses are in good shape, the housings are shot.  Even a light
touch in spots can break away a chip that crumbles to dust.  Inevitably, I'm
going to need to find a pair of `77 Transporter tail light housings.
Thankfully, I was able to reassemble them in working condition.

So, whilst pondering this, I had an idea.  I'm getting ready to start
releasing the line of bus repros that I'm currently working on and wondered
if it would be generally acceptable to listees if I offered a barter.

As I release the repros, I'd be willing to trade a number of them, on a
mutually agreeable and equitable basis, for items that I need for Giacomo.
What sayest thou(s)?

I'll work up a list of the parts that I need, and post it to the CF&Son
website.  I'm pouring some of the production molds this week and will post a
list of the repros and their release dates at the website, too.

Needless to say, one of the first items will be those tail light housings
(sans lenses, as I do not need them).
