Subject: RE: [T2] Wires???

The front wires sound like the original horn wires...does your horn work?
Maybe you have a (louder) aftermarket horn located  somewhere else...

The engine wires might be either the FI harness test plug OR the flywheel
RPM sensor. Both of these are used only for diagnostic purposes. However
it's kind of hard to say for sure based on a verbal description. Can you
post a digital photo?

The next set of 2 wires is directly underneith the bus (drivers side foot
panel area) behind the bumper.  These look like they have been cut at one
time
and they are just hanging in thin air.
