They are at the Depot as well, look under kits or click the "expanded listing" button when you come to the end of the listings. Or search by part number from the main screen. Ask for your 5% listmember discount for orders over 50 bucks.

Also, where are you in the country?

Busboys carries all this stuff and you could save on shipping if you are west-coastal. I find their prices to be a little lower on most items also. Also, when you call busboys you get busdriver level help, not an answering person.
