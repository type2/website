Probably a mix of propane and butane, which is what F-12 originally
replaced.  It will probably work fine, but if you have your system
evacuated by a pro AC guy he will cuss you out because you contamimated
the R-12 that he was going to resell.

Some say that this stuff is dangerous because it is flammable, but it
seems that a pound of flammable propane is trivial compared to the hundred
pounds of gasoline that we carry around without worry.

I love the "organic" label.  Well, it is, seeing as it is made of carbon
compounds!
