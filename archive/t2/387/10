Subject: main #4 bearing dowel pin loose

The dowel pin on the #4 bearing is slightly loose in it's hole.  It
looks like the #4 main bearing siezed up because it's really hard to
spin.  Does this mean the case is shot?  This is what it says in the
library:

"The next area I inspect is the the main thrust bearing dowel pin hole.
I think this area is often overlooked. If the dowel pin has any movement
in the hole I trash the case. The movement means the end play was not
set correctly and the excessive end play caused the dowel pin to oval
out the hole."

The pin actually elongated the hole side to side, not forward/back.  All
3 other dowel pins are tight in their holes.  

This is from a 78 westy.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Thanks,
MIke
