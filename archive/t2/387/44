Subject: Dizzy swap?

I want to take off this 009 off my 69 1600 and replace it. I looked at some 
dizzy on epay that was called 034 thats all. E-mailed seller and got no 
response, was trying to get the rest of the #s as per one reply I got to 
determine whether or not it would work on my bus or not. I've got another dizzy 
here which came off of the motor out of my 76 Westy(Bosch part#231 168 005)(VW 
part#021 905 205P) will this work on a 1600? I looked all over the library and 
couldn't find anything on a crossover for it or maybe I overlooked it. Any 
clues?
