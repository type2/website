Chris,

I agree with Mr. Faster-Laster about the compression check.

You've verified spark, and your plugs are "wet" so before pulling apart the injectors (not a likely source of problem from listening to a few years of list troubleshooting) to verify fuel, a compression tester sounds like a smart investment, especially if you'll be driving buses/vw's for awhile.

Were your sparkplugs tight? I've blown one out and experienced the lose of power/noise you describe.

Sounded horrible, fix was cheap and easy.

Verify timing, spark and all the simple stuff first.

Billy
