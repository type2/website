My suggestion is to get a razor blade that comes with a small plastic device that you would usually use to get off stickers from glass with.
also you might want to try something along with a rag and the razor called OOPS!
it removes stickers,goo,tar,all kinds of stuff with a little elbow into it.
can you not take the tailights off and take them inside and sit down and scrape them over some newspaper spread out?
just my 2 cents worth.
