Subject: correct vacuum elbow?

'79 Westy.  I removed the 3 largest vacuum hoses today, figured I'd soak
'em in full strength simple green to clean 'em up somewhat, rinse with a
pressure hose and dry, then shrink 'em with some giant heavy duty shrink
tubing my roomie scrounged last year.  EZ way to make sure they're not
leaking.  I am also going to clamp all vac lines eventually, starting
with these today.

After removing the hose that comes from the oil breather I was feeling
around down there and plucked out an elbow that was toast.  (Maybe
that's my hesitation problem?  Doh.)

The one I pulled out has a p/n of 021 129 639, and a bd search
identified it as "elbow".  Fortunately, I had a few 021 129 637 that
seem to fit just fine, even tho' they appear to be smaller.  A bd search
on that p/n pulls up c (dual carb intake to balance pipe),d (elbow) and
e (elbow) versions, no plain.

Any clue which is the correct part?  The old one seemed a bit large,
considering the new one fit just fine.
