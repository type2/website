Subject: How do I tell if it is the battery or alternator?

ok,
so i have been jumped twice today.
2 different batteries.
neither would start up after I shut it off after being jumped. The first 
time I let the bus run for 25 minutes. The second time I let it run for an 
hour 20 minutes.
now I put a 3rd battery in there (it is not fully charged, it only had like 
11.5 volts when I put it in) My lights work, but it doesn't start. I know 
that 12.6 is fully charged and 12.15 is only 25%.
How do I tell if it is the battery or the alternator?
please help
Thanks,
Kyle
