Subject: Advice on interpreting my compression  check results on 78Westy

When I acquired my 76 w/ 79 cal engine it had valve clatter for days.

Took me two years to get around to adjusting the valves per the hydraulic procedures in the Bentley.

My engine was easily 2/3 quieter, unbelievable.

I could talk to my kids in the backseat now.

Have bentley? Need to ask questions?
Pmail me, or ask the list.
