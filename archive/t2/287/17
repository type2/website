My beetle went through this very problem. It had a small nylon plastic 
contact plate that had tiny nylon knobs that gets pushed down by the back 
of the ignition lock. Eventually these little knobs wear down so that when 
they are pushed inwards towards the electrical contacts they can't make 
contact. Wiggling the key helps push the knob a little further in and this 
fixes it for a while.

Your only solution is to replace the ignition switch.

Seems like I may have disassembled mine and mated a new electrical contact 
with the old lock. Been about 10 years... This isn't a part that is 
supposed to be disassembled - it involves bending tabs and drilling out 
rivets I'm sure on the switch housing. Now if you go the replacement switch 
route you can just expect to drill out the rivets that hold the assembly to 
the steering column.
