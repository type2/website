At my school, we used to store the acids on an open shelf in a poly bin.
Everything in the storeroom was rusted.  Concentrated sulfuric acid is the
worst, as it will gas out from a tightly-sealed glass bottle, even if the
cap is wrapped with tape.  We now keep the acids and bases in their own
cabinets with the sulferic kept in a small cabinet by itself.

For home storage (if you must) I suggest storage in an outside wood
cabinet with positive ventilation.  Store acids and bases (like drain
openers) separately in wooden cabinets.  Real acid storage cabinets are
all wood, with no metal at all.  Even the hinges are wood.  Best bet is to
minimize the time that you have to keep the nasty stuff around.
