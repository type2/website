David,

I am no expert, but...  I have also heard the 1.5HP consumption figure for
the rotary compressors, but I have only heard it, I have no proof.  If it
is true, then the 1.5 should be what it takes to make it run.  It will
take *some* more to get it started, but I don't know how much.  A 2HP
motor should do fine, tho.  If you are thinking about this for any
application, tho, remember you also need to run two fans. One on the
condensor and one on the coil, so for electricity consumption, figure
2.5HP or so total (1/4 HP motors on the fans are enough).
