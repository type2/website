Ronnie,

Had one that sat for 8 years.

Picture #12 shows what happened to the gas.  1/4 of rock hard
residue all in the bottom of the tank...and that was after letting
paint thinner sit in it for 3 weeks.

Take it out and *look*.  Then take it to a radiator shop that will "boil"
it out.  Trust me, don't bother with any other chemicals on the inside.

Go back after it is done, but don't delay as it will start rusting almost 
immediately.  

Clean the inside after that with por-15 marine clean and then decide 
whether to coat the inside or not.  I did not as I have an FI tank with 
lots of protrusions inside.

Paint it outside with por-15.

Reinstall.

Cheers ,dave
