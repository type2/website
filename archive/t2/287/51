Subject: Re: [T2] BMW, Get a hint VWoA

I have to agree with BMW's support having chased parts for both my '83 and '55
BMW motorcycles. I was amazed to find the parts, right down to bolts with BMW
stamped in them still available. (I was also amazed at the price :-)). The odd
parts are made to order though, so waiting is quite long and price steep. I
have not tried them for major engine/trans parts though. Supposedly in the
history of the '55 bike, it had been sent back to the factory for a complete
overhaul. Don't know if they still do that though.
VW's are much more affordable, despite sometimes a lack in quality in
aftermarket stuff.
(I seem to have a leaning towards air cooled boxer motor's, I just need that
porche one day!).
