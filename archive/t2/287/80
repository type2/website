The manufacturers will have the Euro government set a flat standard.  And
no, owners won't be forced to scrap their cars, they will just have to pay
for outrageously expensive "preventative maintainance" (like replacing the
entire brake system at a set age) to keep the car on the road.  The
Japanese are masters at this.  Keeps the auto industry humming!
