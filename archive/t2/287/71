Subject: RE:Which =?iso-8859-1?q?Keyblank=3F?= - 74 bus

Clark, 
my 73 Bus has a key labeled V81V on one side and on the other side is
labeled V29R.  My 74 Bus has V81V on one side and "FITS VW" on the
other.  This key also has the name of Taylor U.S.A. on it.  Hope this
helps.  My guess is V81V which you did not list.

Kevin

Does anyone happen to know which of the keyblanks
below(if any) will work for a 74 bus?
My choices are v12, v24, v25, v26, v28, v29, v32 .

Danke,
clark
