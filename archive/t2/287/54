John,

Ticking where?  Might be a lot of things including generator bearing or
brush noise...get out your stethoscope and listen in various places to 
figure out where.

A long screwdriver with you on the soft end works also....just put it on 
the bone close to your ear and listen.

Don't always assume the worst!

Cheers, dave
