Sounds good for anyone interested in body parts, if VWoA or any counterpart
would do that for us. Too bad about the engines. I think that there are
enough aftermarket engine part suppliers that VW wouldn't want to start that
up again. Heck, for twenty years you have been able to build a complete
engine without one OEM part.

  Last night on speed vision there was a story on BMW motorcycles, not that
this has anything to do with VW's, but wait, yes it does. Do you know that
BMW cars and motor cycles FULLY SUPPORT their vintage market and are
bringing out old dies and molds to remake parts for their VINTAGE
cars/motorcycles! The goal of BMW is to be able to furnish any part
necessary to help you restore your BMW, from sheet metal to the most minute
screw. WAY to go BMW almost make me want to convert!!!

ps. They also stated that they WILL NOT reproduce any part that is already
being done in the aftermarket, now this is customer loyalty and support !!!!
