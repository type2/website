Subject: RE:ignition switch and lock problems

It certainly sounds to me like the problem in the first case that the 
problem is the switch.  It;s a pain to change, but worth it.  I agree with 
the recommendation to NOT rewire it.  How many times have we all had to sort 
throu "rewiring" on somebody's VW?

In the second case, I'd clean the lock with electrical cleaner from the 
electrical supply store.  Get a non-residual cleaner, not the crap that 
radio shack sells.  Spray, let set, spray again.  After it dries, lube with 
Tri-flow.  Don't use graphite.  It bonds with the VW grease to form 
something akin to a cross between glue and concrete.  I would think a 
code-cut key would improve things.  If you want to get one without pulling 
the ignition, there's a pretty good chance I can decode your existing key 
from a scan and generate a new key back to factory specs.

Let me know if either of you need more information.
