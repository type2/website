Run the engine at night with all nearby lights nearby off.  If you see
spark energy jumping thru the insulation, then they are *bad*.

Yes :-)

NOOOOOOOO!!!!!  Ron (www.busdepot.com) lists them at $19.95 for Bosch.
Search his site for part #09171.  Ron is generally the best price, but
FLAPS should *NOT* be $80 higher! If you go to a FLAPS, take that # with
you.  I think that's the Bosch # for this set.

I think the girl at the FLAPS you are going to is (a) very confused or (b)
ripping you off.  Since I try never to blame on evil what can be blamed on
stupidity, I will go for (a) :-)  Since Ron lists the wires for the Golf
at $95 (It's the "Turbonium", son :-), I'll bet that is what she was
looking at.
