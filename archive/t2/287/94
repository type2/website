Subject: Odd question, How much hp does it really take (a/c question)

Hello List,

I have an odd question that keeps bugging me. I
understand that the old YORK compressors found on many
older a/c units required around 6-7hp to opperate.
According to some spec sheets that I saw in the past,
the rotary style compressor used to replace the YORK
only requires 1.5hp to opperate. That being said,
would it be possible to run one of these rotary
compressors using a 2hp electric motor? Am I missing
somthing here? Yes, I know that is an odd question but
it has been bothering me. The 1.5 hp rating, Does that
include the energy needed to start turning the
compressor or is that just the energy needed to keep
the compressor turning or does it not make any
difference? ANy thoughts on this would be appreciated.
Thanks again!
