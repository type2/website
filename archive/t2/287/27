Home Depot is a cheap source for muratic acid (pool section only not concrete cleaning section). The VW workshop manuals have always recommended using acid.

This was my fear as well as I couldn't find a place to do it for a reasonable price so I went the POR-15 tank repair route.

You can see the kind of build up I had and the results of the chemicals at each stage by following the URL below. It was a time consuming process but it was worth it.  I had black sludge and rust in my tank, not quite like the varnish that Dave Bolen had but it's all the same gasoline after all.

It really doesn't cost much to experiment with a 50/50 acid solution and the POR-15 Marine Clean but you do need a work place you can dump these liquids like a backyard.
