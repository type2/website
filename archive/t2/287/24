  Diluted muratic acid will do the same thing. 3 dollars a gallon at a pool
supply

ronnie  the other? one

ps. You have to be real careful on older gas tanks. I learned my lesson on
an old 356 Porsche tank. Had it hot tanked at a radiator shop, came out
beautiful. Painted it, finished restoring the car 1955 356. Went to put gas
in it and it leaked live a sieve. The chemicals in the hot tank ate the
solder away and it leaked at the seams!!!!
