So, who is gonna decide what a usefull life is???

"the EU will pass stringent recycling legislation requiring auto makers to
take back their cars after they've outlived their useful lives..."

On one hand, if one manufacturer say 8 years and another says 15 years,
whose car will you buy?


Just a question without an answer, dave
