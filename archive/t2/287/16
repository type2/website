Subject: gas tank resto  varnish/sludge

Finally made time to work on getting the 57 on the road. It's been sitting
since 88 when it was driven down to one of the so cal shows and back and
had been parked for an unknown amount of time prior to 88. You can smell the
varnish when you open the tank. fuel resevrve switch was completely clogged
and gummed up to the point that I had to remove it to drain the tank.
Looking at the por-15 kit they claim their chemicals will clean this out but
the hot rod guys I've talked to say nothing will and I should have it sand
blasted inside. Anyone have hands on experience with cleaning out a tank
with 10-15 years of varnish build up? Using this product or any
other?http://www.por15.com/tankseal_fuelpreserve.html
