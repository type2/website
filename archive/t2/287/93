Subject: Plug wires and synchronizer readings...

Two questions for you all Im working on getting my 73 Transporter back
to running, and Im curious if there is a way to check my plug wires and
make sure they are still good. Or should I just go and buy another set?
(On a side note, has anyone ever heard of paying 100 bucks for wires?
The gal at my FLAPS tried to sell me some at that price tonight) Also,
is there a benchmark level to test where the little red float in my carb
synchronizer should read? Any suggestions as to why the left bank pushes
the float all the way up to the top, while the right bank only gets an
inch or so off the bottom would also be greatly appreciated. For
clarification its a 73 Bus, manual transmission, carbureted.
Vielen Dank!
