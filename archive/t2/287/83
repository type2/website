Subject: Oil drain plug

Someone mentioned that they lost their oil drain plug, and were considering 
replacements.

Wait a minute!!  Isn't the oil drain plug a 14mm, and isn't the spark plug 
also a 14mm!!

I mean, you could use the spark plug from #3, 'cause that's usually the 
weakest cyl anyways.

The question I have is, do I use the torque specs for the oil drain plug, or 
for the spark plug??

Thanks for reading this far.
