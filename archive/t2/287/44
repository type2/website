Subject: BayWindow Crewcab???

How hard is it ti come by Bay Window Crews?  I saw on today in someone yard
over a hill annd hidden by bushes.  I called the Lady who owns and seh would
give me a starting price.  Said to come and see it to make an offer.  Said it
ran fine and that someone offered to buy it at ashow some time ago.I'll post
some pictures after seeing it and then see what folks think it's worth.
