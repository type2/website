Subject: '71 front axle beam + discs, calipers, etc. FREE last chance

	Folks,
	The Grim Reaper takes it this Friday unless someone else
                             ---- ------
speaks for it first. I'm happy either way, but if you always
wanted to convert a 68-70 to disc brakes or need parts for
your 71-79 front end, prices will never be cheaper :)
	Complete '71 front axle beam, shocks, brakes, steering 
stuff. As removed from donor bus some time before 1995.
	FREE to new home, but you've got to come around and take it.
Its in Oakland, California, conveniently located for the whole
Bay Area. You don't have to take it by Friday, but you DO have 
to tell me you want and will come for it by Friday.

	If I had time I'd take it apart just for fun, but
I don't. :( Think of the dirty-handed satisfaction you could
have tearing this jewel to pieces over the winter for the
edification of yourself and the neighborhood kids. Of all ages :)
