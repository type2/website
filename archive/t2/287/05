when I was desperate some years ago I picked up a working 1700/1800 from a
411/412 at a salvage yard, these engines are similar enough that they can
be swapped and people don't seem to price them anywhere near as high, 
  did have to swap the FI system between the engines but that was a couple
hour job, otherwise it just bolted in and worked fine until I could get my
engine rebuilt
