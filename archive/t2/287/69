I think you 2 guys are exactly right. I stepped out of the office for about 30
minutes this morning and did a quick compression check. I found: #1=140,
#2=135, #3=140, and #4=135. So am I right to rule out valve damage according
to these readings?
Anyway, as I was doing this I felt a little "puff" of air coming out of the
exaust where the exhaust tips meet the muffler (bug muffler) and there seems
to be a bit of a leak here.  So my diagnosis and paln of action for now:
Listen to the radio instead of focuusing so intently of tiny little engine
noises!
