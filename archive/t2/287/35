Hi Folks,
	Having read posts recently on stuck plugs I was wondering if
anyone has tried using one of these with the head(s) in place.  I realize
it is MUCH preferable to remove the head for this job, but this might be
useful in a pinch. I recently picked up a flyer from NAPA where a similar
tool was advertised for significantly less money.
