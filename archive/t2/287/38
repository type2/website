That's the way I looked at it but if you are really worried, neutralize the muratic acid with household baking soda before you dispose of it.  It's one way they clean up industrial acid spills.

HCL + NaHCO3 <-> H2CO3 + NaCl 

Anyone, please correct my chemistry. You get a salt and a weak carbonic acid. If you get the ratio of baking soda to acid right, bottoms up!

Out of curiostity at the time, I looked up the MSDS on Marine clean and found out that it was microbial (yep, it eats the sludge). It's non-toxic and biodegradable and runner up for bus chemical of the year. Of course the award won't be allowed to have any VW logos on it. :-(
