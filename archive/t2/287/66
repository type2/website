Subject: Re: [T2] coleman heater in a bus

Contrary to what has been posted, the catalytic Colman propane heaters
do not release CO- only CO2 and water- and yes, they do use oxygen.  For
the bus, the $49 compact one that rests on its tank works fine, it takes
8 hrs to consume a small tank.  They are touted to work in tents, a
tighter environment than the bus.   In a typical tent, an opening
minimum of 2x2" is recc. to prevent O2 depletion.  This is equal to
cracking you window about 1/8" over a 16" span.  Leaky louvre windows
more than equal this I/m sure.  To concur with the poster re
condensation, I have used this to heat my Westy last year, and
condensation is a problem, especially on the front windows- this I solve
by using a very tight curtain between cab and rear, and venting the
front to let out moisture.  I have more success while driving using an
electric blanket running off the 12 volts.
