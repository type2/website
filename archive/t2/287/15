Subject: RE: [T2] Ignition LOCK trouble

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Please don't wire a switch to the dash. This, like moving
to the breakdown lane to let faster cars pass is the first sign of a
downward spiral resulting in your bus ending up here on our parts shelves.

You can do this. I have always tackled this problem with the entire steering
column out of the car. You do not need to break or drill anything other than
the shear bolt. I would replace the steering coupler while your at this. Let
me know if you get stuck on anything.
