Subject: Seeking 2L engine

Dear List,

I'm posting this for a friend.  About a year ago after doing a trip with me 
in my 79 Westfalia he decided to sell his Toyota van and stumbled across a 
running 78 Champaign Edition Westfalia at a good price. Since then he's put 
a fair amount of cash into new engine seals, Hyd. lifters (for some reason 
it had solid ones) tires, and a bunch of other stuff I can't recall at the 
moment. The engine which had good compression has been rebuilt before (GEX, 
I know the story, please spare me) but unknown how many miles were on the 
engine other than a fair amount.

His bus is his only car and is also used for his small business 
(www.ula-equipment.com). While returning from a trip his bus began to loose 
power and he ended up leaving the bus in Boise and borrowing a car from a 
relative to get him back to Logan Utah. A mechanic in Boise said the cam was 
flat and that his engine needed the full meal deal.  It seems to me that a 
sucked valve seat would be more likely?? Any thoughts?? He has since driven 
the slow bus back to Logan where it sits contemplating its future and 
perhaps a visit to our mechanic in Ogden.

Because he also just bought a house and is short on time he is looking for a 
cheap engine that is worth putting in his bus. I know this is a long shot as 
I'm sure anyone who has a spare 2 liter laying around probabaly would rather 
not part with it. But any insight/ideas/suggestions would be greatly 
appreaciated. If it is the head I thought about AVP and helping him do just 
the head?? But its winter and its been a number of years since I've had an 
engine that far apart.

For the curious Logan Utah is about 90 miles north a Salt Lake.

Thanks,
Brandt
