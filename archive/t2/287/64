Hi TJ,

The problem with propane heaters is two-fold.

1.  Propane burners inside the vehicle create some CO and a lot of CO2. 
They also consume oxygen. You need to keep a window open to let fresh 
air in or you could be asphyxiated.

2. Propane heaters also create H2O. This fogs up your windows something 
fierce. Through the winter of '99 I used a propane heater in my daily 
driven 73 westy and by February I had major frost build-up on my seats 
and interior. Scraping the frost off the inside windshield while 
driving is not much fun, even if it is a Canadian Tradition (TM).

A furnace is much preferable. That vents combustion byproducts outside 
the vehicle, and provides warm, dry heat. Wabasto, Espar and other 
manufacturers have gasoline or propane powered units that are much 
better options in the long term. I'm looking into a furnace for my 
Dad's "new" 81 vanagon work truck, and will let the list know what we 
come up with. Dad wants to keep the truck heated through the winter to 
keep his tools and supplies (paint etc) from freezing.

Sometime soon, my own bus has a BN-4 gas furnace in its future.

Happy trails,
