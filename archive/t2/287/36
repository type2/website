350,000 world wide for BMW...4 million for VW last year...
Both Ford and VW are snapping at BMW's heels; the Rover
takeover was way overpriced and so far has only produced
the nouveau Mini (35,000 so far). The 90's boom has left
most manufacturers with excess capacity and not enough
market to split so many ways. The final four or five will
probably end up being "platform" manufacturers with models
spun off or "badge engineered" (Opel/Catera, etc.) to suit
marketing whims...
Remember the shake out of the British auto industry? Lots
of Marques survived the war but gradually ground down to a 
precious few and then winked out...
