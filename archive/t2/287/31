Subject: pop top replacement

hi class...i've been out of the busrealm for the 
past few months now. but my priorities are 
back inorder;) and i'm once again in the shop 
workin on my wagon. 
and what i'm gonna be lookin for, here soon, is 
a new poptop for my 70'camper.

junkyard, or a personal source. i'm livin in the
