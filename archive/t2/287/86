As long as the exhaust hasn't ruined the mating surface between the 
cylinders and heads you should be okay for a while.

Question is did you ruin anything running it with such low power 
(overheating damage).

Torque it up and go again.

Hopefully this does not mean the studs are pulled out of the block.

Good luck and keep us posted.
