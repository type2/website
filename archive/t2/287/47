Subject: Need a life!

You ever stay up late just to watch the news weather so you know how cold it
will be when you drive your bus into work in the morning?? Man, I really need
to get a life!!!!  
On a technical note, my bus engine seems to be "ticking" a little more than it
should (71 Westy w 1600 DP engine). I just replaced a fuel tank which was not
vented correctly, and as a result was basically starving my engine of gas. 
Will running lean for an extended period of time (3 months) cause valve damage
or the like?  The bus is running better than ever, and the ticking is not
really loud enough to be of a real concern, I just don't remember hearing it
before. What about a worn out fuel pump, will it get "clickety" as it starts
to wear out and the push rod pushes up and down in it? 
I did adjust valves last night, #2 & #3 were a little tight, but correcting
that still didn't kill the clicking sound. It's probably just me being
paranoid, as I said the bus is running greater than ever now that I have
gotten the fuel tank thing worked out and the timing set correctly and
accurately (thanks to my new timing light!)
