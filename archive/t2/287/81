Subject: new vw bus owner, help in boulder?

hello I am a new vw bus owner. my name is rosh and I
am 25. i recently purchased a 1971 riviera and have
been learning to work on it. I am wonder if there are
any boulder, co locals on this site who may be willing
to help me work on my bus. I need to drop the engine
to change the main seal i think. I can exchange my
time or money or childcare for help. I am also new to
this sight. thanks
