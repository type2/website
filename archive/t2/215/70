Excuse me.. I got that wrong.. It's somewhere near Pasco. There's a huge
store there that sells country merchantile stuff and they specialize in
Walla Walla sweet onions.. That's where I got screwed up. And I had to check
my refrigerator to make sure, because we've got a bottle of their wonderful
onion salad dressing in there right now. I'll tell you what.. We were just
passing through, and you know how road trips get kinda blurry in memory..
But Jim (vegjam(-at-)aol.com) knows where it is. Ask him. He's a real helpful
fellow on the overall. Tell him I'm the one that bought the blue VW bus from
him.
I definitely think it is off Hwy 90, on the north side of the road, probably
somewhere between Pasco and Spokane. I remember noticing it and seeing acres
and acres of cars. Jim asked me if I had noticed it when we finally got to
Couer d'Alene.. And I guess you are right, that it would be south and west
of there. Jan B
