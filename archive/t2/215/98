Subject: The trip continues....

Ok..

My bus: 73 single carb, 1700

I threw my spare coil & condenser into the bus.
Same problem.

There were a number of terminal splitters on the positive side of the coil. 
I took them off and made sure the connections were good.

I've test driven it and problems have not reappeared.

If it happens again I am going to bypass the switch system with a wire from the battery to the coil. If it acts up after that then I think it could only be gas related.

The reason I do not think it is gas is that when it quits it just stops. No sputtering or missing.
After I get it started again it back fires once or twice sometimes.

When it is acting up and I turn the key to start it fires and runs smoothly, but as soon as the key returns to the on position it dies.

I think I am going to go for it.
Maybe it was just bad connections at the coil.
 (I HOPE)

Jason
