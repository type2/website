Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil

Apologies if this has already been said, as I missed the start of this
thread.
I know you have FI, but I had a similar situation in my 2.0L carb engine.
I had an electric fuel pump at the time and over night fuel would flow past
the pump and leak over the needle in the carb and fill up the sump,
Scary!!!!
I repaired the original fuel pump (they don't free flow when the engine is
off) and replaced the needles in the carb to fix the problem. Despite my
engine is not 'new' there were no other ring/piston problems causing fuel to
get into the oil.
Just my $0.02 worth.
