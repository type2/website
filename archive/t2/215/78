Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil

I live on a hill, my drive way is steep with a side slope to boot. I learned 
to park my carbureted VWs nose down and the MGs nose up to avoid filling the 
crankcase with gas.
I have never had this problem while parking my 77 FI Bus on the hill.

By the way I have heard that a leaky vacuum can on the distributor, 
(carbureted models) can be a path of gas to the crankcase via the 
distributor.

It's not hard to see how a properly functioning fuel injector could leak 
some false fuel into the intake manifold. 2 drops per minute under full 
pressure (around 36 psi) per injector is considered the limit.

A normal L-jetronic FI system has pressure for a long time after the key is 
off (15 psi after 20 minutes). A marginal system with all injectors at the 2 
drop limit might start to be a gas in the crankcase problem, with out 
showing over rich running problems or sooty plugs.
