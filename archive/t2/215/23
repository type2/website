Billy Bob---

So what you have just explained here is the reason I always wondered why
in the heck I saw all kinds of Buses broke down on the side of the road
within a 200 miles radius of a Grateful Dead concert---

Over stressed vehicles.

I love to drive my 74 --but after yanking the engine to replace the
heads---after "over stressing" the baby on its maiden voyage, on the
return trip home after I bought it---no more of that---:>)

It's "don't leave home thinking your going to get anywhere too
quick"----

Kinda remids me of driving my Crosley wagon---slow mo--- and screamng at
50 mph---but at least it was pretty dependable, and never left me
DOTSOTR--:>)


Later,

TK---

Drive it really far, it just might make it 
In approximately seven years I drove my Westy 145K. Most trips were 250
mile camping turnarounds. Several (more than 10) trips were in excess of
3000 miles. Driving the distances is more a matter of just getting in
and doing it. Many VW repairs can be just a matter of a few minutes down
town if you have the simple parts required. 
My Westy is an 83 and I can safely run 70 mph all day when winds and
temperatures are moderate but I meet many people with Bays and Splits
that are locked into the 60-65 mph range. These folks make equally long
trips successfully simply because they read their conditions and don't
overstress their vehicles. 
I'm not discounting the condition of the vehicle but if you're proud of
your Westy or Van, more than likely its in good enough condition to make
the trips you want. 
If your vehicle is displaying tell tale signs of poor performance, fix
it before the trip. 
AAA is good trip insurance for those that are interested, the AIRS road
support group is good insurance and common sense driving is good
insurance. 
With older vehicles there is always a slight chance that some obscure
part will fail when it is *put to the test*, but most parts fail slowly
and you'll have warning signs before disaster happens. Get out there and
make those trips in your Vans.

In a recent post you said........People, take your bus out on the road.
Drive it really far, it just might make it 
And not only do we use our bus for trips, we use it as a daily driver
too, day in and day out.
