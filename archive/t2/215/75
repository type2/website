Richard,

I sure sounds to me like your float level is high.  I don't have much
experience with those carbs (yet) but looking at the exploded view, I
can't think of anything else.

It would follow that this is happening right after a rebuild.  Maybe you
got the wrong measurement when setting them.

Let us know what you find

Good luck!
