My '74 was the same when when I first got it. I took the top cabinet out
of the back (four bolts) and slid all the panels out. I then sanded then
down and stained them. Took all of about three hours and looks fantastic -
probably better than new. It's surprisingly easy, just take your time.

I'm actually looking to buy some more of this panelling to cut new door
panels so it matches.
