Subject: Re: [T2] Any benefit to buying Diesel oil instead of auto oil?

Deisal oils can most certainly take one heck of a ot more fuel wash
and contamination prior to breaking down--a good selection--
Straight weight oils are superior to multi grade oils in duration of
lubricating qualities, and thermal breakdown.
And I'm talking dino oils---not synthetics--

Rotella T and Kendall are two superior oils--

I can buy straight 40 or 50wt in diesel or auto grades. Any advantage to
using the diesel oil? My thoughts were that if it can prevent scuffing
and wear at compression ratios of diesel type, then it should be pretty
awesome oil??? Higher zinc content?? Courtney
