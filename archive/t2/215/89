Okay..
Dave i hope you don't mind me posting your reply to
the list...

Let me just run these settings by you guys...
74, 1800, aftermarket 'universal grind' cam, weber
DFEV, rebuilt dual vac dist which came with the drive
tang installed 180deg out and the hole in the side is
round, not square. I don't have the number handy.

The two Carb jets in the bowl are 145 and 155. Not
sure which is which.
Idle mix screw is set 1.5 turns out, speed screw 2.25
turns in.

With vac line OFF, i have it set at 3deg BTDC.
With the vac line ON, it jumps to 9deg BTDC and idles
at ~900rpm.
On a high rev, which might be around 3-4k, it jumps to
around 34deg BTDC.
Engine runs good, but i'm scared the timing is too far
advanced. Is it?

Now, the manual advises that 73 and 74 engines should
be set at 10 ATDC???
My engine will run at that setting, but it sure as
hell doesn't want to.
Why do these engines get this 10ATDC setting when the
FI engines get 7.5deg BTDC?

Please help, folks.
The VW spirits are crowding the fragile, eggshell
mind...

TIA,
clark
