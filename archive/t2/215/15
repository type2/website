Hi

I've been shopping around for a new motor for my '71 Westy. I live in Oregon
so I've looking pretty much across the West coast.
I'm very close to ordering a turnkey 1776 from BAP Import, for specifics,
point your browser to http://www.bapimportparts.com/vw-engines.html
I do like the 12 month, 12k warranty.

My question to the list: Does anybody have an opinion or real experience on
BAP and the motors they sell? They appear to be very big in Arizona. Do they
take care of customers or just fill your order and wish you luck? Do the
motors last?

Thanks,

Pete
