Subject: Bus oil Low pressure Help

Need some reccomendations on what kind of oil to use in my 70 westfalia with 
a 1600 in it. I have the same problem that others have been having when I am 
at idle after driving for a while my oil light comes on and goes away when I 
push the gas.
I just rebuilt the engine and am quite frustrated. I am missing some engine 
seal in the compartment and some tin screws and a piece of tin under the 
pushrod tube. Would this cause the oil light to come on.

Casey
