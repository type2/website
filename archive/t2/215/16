Subject: Drive it really far, it just might make it

Chuck,
    In a recent post you said........People, take your bus out on the road.
Drive it really far, it just might make it.".......
A couple of summers ago my wife Kathy and I used our '71 westy for a 1 week
vacation from Long Island, NY to lower MI and back again.  In those 7 days
we drove over 2000 trouble free miles.  Does that count as really far?  We
slept in our bus every night, even when we were parked in the driveway of
friends.  And not only do we use our bus for trips, we use it as a daily
driver too, day in and day out.
    Happy friday everybody.
