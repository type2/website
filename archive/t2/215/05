Subject: Re: [bus-life] more panelling decorating ideas...

hey, i just had a thought! for someone who travels alot in their bus, you
could collect paper napkins from all the places you go, or to go menus or
even local band flyers, and decoupage them all over the interior... sorta
like the old suitcases covered in stickers from different contries and
stuff! that would be neat!!!

decoupage-the art of covering object with decorative paper and glue.
often times a final layer of glue acts as laquer to protect the piece.
