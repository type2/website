Subject: AIRS--Road Trippers need help in Boise

Hello,

Two young men from WA state who are doing a tour of the west are in need of a VW part source/junkyard.  They 
stopped by Vegas and crashed with my family for a couple of days.  They are between Salt Lake City and Boise now 
and they are having some problems with their linkage.  As they described it to me, all the grommets that are supposed 
to be between the "cage" and the transmission have worn out and are gone.  They were pretty sure they would make it 
to Boise and a friend's house.  However, they would like to repair it before heading back to Washington.

If anyone can help point them to a parts place, they would appreciate it.  They will be calling me back later tonight, so 
please p-mail with any info.

For those who would like to view the chronicles of their trip you can see their website at  http://trippin.us

Thanks,

Kevin
