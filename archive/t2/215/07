Going to try an expirament tomorrow.  First i will have to go buy 
something i dont own.  An iron.  I am  going to see what happens if i 
try to do t-shirt transfers on to some of the paneling in my westy.  If 
it works I will put a clear coat over it.  Got a bunch of that t-shirt 
stuff for my printer left over from another  project.
