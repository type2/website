Subject: canvas waterproofing, was: Re: [T2] Westy

I make canvas tents (hobby) and the fabric is the same as the pop top 
fabric.  Scotchguard doesn't waterproof canvas very well and is harmful to 
the fibers if you use it a lot. I have found the best way to re-waterproof 
canvas is to get Thompson's water seal ULTRA, this is in the plastic blue 
bottle and looks like elmer's glue.  mask off anything you do not want water 
seal on (interior, fiberglass).  Cut the Thompsons at least in half with 
water, put it in a manual garden sprayer (they are plastic, cost about $12 
and work by pumping them up with air, then pulling the trigger) and spray it 
down.  Where it runs, use a damp sponge to sort of "push" it into the 
canvas.  Pay special attention to the seams. Let it dry. wash your sprayer, 
really good.
This method is very effective and will not break down the fibers in the 
fabric.  It will also not make the canvas hard or "crunchy". It is also safe 
to use. It is ok to repeat if the coverage is not what you want.  I have used 
this method with 12 tents over the past 6 years.
