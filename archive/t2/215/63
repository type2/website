This goes back a while but I think it is still on topic.

Back in 1960, I and seven other high school/college buddies chipped in $50
each and bought a 1949 bus off a car lot for $400. Our goal was to go to
Mexico that summer. The Octagons.

We never went, and the bus more or less by default fell to the care and
keeping of my brother, Will, who the next year drove across country from
Maryland to UCLA with a few friends aboard.

Over the course of several years he and the bus made numerous cross-country
trips with hardly a complaint. That bus had 16-in wheels, no heat, a
non-syncro tranny, canvas roof, was red and black, had the flip-out turn
signals and of course gobs of windows. Seats were Spartan. But it ran.

About 1963 or 64 it met its demise, a telephone poll on a sharp turn on a
country road, and was hauled away the next day to a junkyard after chalking
up 70,000+ miles in our care and who knows how many before.

Two weeks letter a letter came. Someone even back then interested in these
things had tracked down this bus as being one of the first to enter the U.S.
and was interested in making an offer for it.  I wish the letter had come
sooner, not for the money, but for the idea that such an early bus in the
right hands -- not those of a bunch of kids -- might have met that it would
have been kept going forever.

Even so in my own mind it is still going strong.
