Subject: [t2] Oil pressure 40 wt oil

Alright I will try the 40 wt or 50wt oil. Will this keep the engine temp 
down and will this be hard to burn up. I am so sick of this type 1 oil 
problems. i want a reliable engine that has power. What is a reccomendation 
for a engine with these aspects. Also what kind of 40 wt or 50wt oil should 
I buy is there a specific name so that when I go to purchase it they dont 
look at me like an idiot. As usual. I need a engine so I can travel with no 
worries I have eveything new on the car except the engine and I want to go 
camping far away from home.

Thanks All
Casey
