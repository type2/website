I never realized that to work on a vehicle one must be an electrician by 
trade.  Now that the bug is in rehab the Saab and the bus can see each other 
and are trading secrets, which has me almost nuts.  I have always played 
"chase the short" with the Saab; random lights and other electrical 
components refuse to work on any given day, and now the bus is doing the same 
thing.  Except there is a bonus in that you don't have to look far to find it 
when the site starts smoking.  Is there anyone who knows where to get the 
electrical schematic or map or whatever for a 1975 1800 pancake, dual carb?  

My husband slid one of the "Zits" comics into my book as a bookmark: they are 
high-fiving it as they pass a radar screen that has their speed at 6.  

How do you know the true mileage of the bus?  Do you go by the odometer or by 
the longest stretch in between rebuilding the motor?  If by the former I have 
114k, the latter I have no idea; the Saab has 248k, the bug has 49k original.
