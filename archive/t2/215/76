Wow! I just got out the map and looked it up.. I'm getting to relive the
trip from the armchair. We only took Hwy 90 from Ritzville, at the end of
395. Pasco is actually just north of Kennewick and that is really not so far
from Walla Walla after all, and pretty far south of Spokane. I would say now
that this junkyard would likely be closer to Spokane, but definitely on the
west side of the city. It would take a large city to feed a bone yard of
that size. I'll say one other thing.. If one wants to pick parts or
salvageable cars from a junkyard, might as well go where they are
well-preserved. And there is not much rain and precipitation east of the
Cascades, or in Idaho in general. That's one of the biggest reasons we went
up there to get that bus.. There was so little rust on it. Jim gets cars
from all over, including Oregon, Washington, and California to sell on
eBay.. But the local Idaho vehicles don't have much rust on 'em and they are
definitely better preserved even than S. California vehicles. Jan B
