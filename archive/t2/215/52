I drove 3k miles from Canada to where I live now.  It was a 7 day trip
taking the scenic route along the Pacific coast down to LA and we loved it.

Back then I had the rusty gastank problem but we only had to stop once to
clean the fuel filter.  I kept the highway speeds below 60 and only passed
two other vehicles the whole way.  Still, with the horsehair seats
disintegrated these vehicles are remarkable comfortable for long trips.

With the 3/4 seat in the back, I wouldn't want to share it with another
adult for too long but kids must love it.
