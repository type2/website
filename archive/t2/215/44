I hope that you are right. I have so far been on two 1500 mile journeys in
my 1977 bus, but on Wednesday I am taking my bus from Calgary, Alberta to
East Troy,WI for the Other Ones concert. This will be in the area of 3500
miles. My fingers are crossed and I will have the A.I.R.S list in hand. wish
me luck
