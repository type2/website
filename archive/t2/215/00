Subject: EGR  again.....

I've read alot about removing the EGR valve in the archives.  I was just 
wondering about what the majority have done, Spend the 120.00, or block off 
the valve totaly???  I've replaced my speedo w/ a one piece speedo, so my 
light won't work anyway, and my bus runns rough when at idle, (I've adjusted 
the screw under the gas peddle to adjust my idle, so it won't die)  Anyway, I 
was just curious about what is the best thing to do, or does it really matter
