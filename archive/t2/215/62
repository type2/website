Make sure they get what they need at their first opportunity, becuase VW
parts places is few and far between out there. Jan B
There is also a HUGE junkyard west of Couer d'Alene, near Walla Walla,
Washington. It's plainly visible for a long stretch along the main Hwy 90.
If they need something arranged ahead of time in the way of a used part,
they can email Jim at vegjam(-at-)aol.com. He deals mainly in used cars, but
sometimes he does parts. He could probably get it set up for them. Jan B
