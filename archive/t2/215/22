Subject: friday.. need oil pressure expert

O great and wise list....



I have a buddy with a problem.  He has a 1/2(2 cylinder) vw
airplane.  I have seen it, seen the inside as he was rebuilding it.

I heard it run yesterday and it sounds good!

1/2 1600 t1 engine
92.5mm pistons
1/2 cylinder heads...well done with 1/2 size valve covers

His problem is this....

He loses pressure on throttle down.  I watched it happen while
sitting on the ground yesterday afternoon.

His oil pressure runs very cool(120-140 degrees F)
He normally has about 20-40 psi of oil pressure.

He can have it sitting flat on the ground and run about cruise 
speed(2800-3000 rpm)for a few minutes  and then close the throttle back to 
idle and go to *zero* pressure for about 5 seconds.

He has an extra sump and a total of about 3 qts in the 1/2 size engine.
He has a oil filter plumbed in where the cooler would be.  It doesn't leak
oil anywhere that I could see and it only has about 18 inches of rubber
tubing between the oil cooler location and the filter.

So, he is not apparently losing pressure because of bad bearings(brand new 
ones) or because the oil is so hot.

Any suggestions???

Cheers, dave
