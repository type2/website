Subject: slider sun roof stuck

Anyone  know how to break a poptop loose without
killing it. Can you get to the mechanics of the beast
if you get the inside cover off?
  My cables are kinked and it doesnt want to move.
If you get the cover off can you unhook the cables
and will it slide by hand etc etc.

Thanks! Dan
