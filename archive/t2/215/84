Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil

Well, I might as well weigh in on this one, too.
I had this happen to me once big time with an upright engine and a
mechanical fuel pump with a ruptured diaphragm. The fuel was just going on
down the push rod into the crankcase. Don't run your engine like that and DO
change the oil when you've fixed the problem, because it can ruin your
bearings. Gasoline doesn't make a good lubricant. Jan B
