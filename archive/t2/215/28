Also the source of many mysterious oil leaks that you cant seem to 
find.  This same pressure sender was used all the way up into the 90's 
waterboxers.  same problems when they age and you get oil where it 
shouldnt be.  On my type 4 even a dye test made it look like i was 
leaking from the oil cooler base. until i happened to get the light to 
the top of the engine while i was looking at something else.
