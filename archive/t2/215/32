Subject: Dashtop Guage Console needed for 3 VDOs

A few weeks back there was a discussion of 3-hole dashtop guage consoles
to replace the VDO console, which is no longer available. I searched but
couldn't find that thread. Would anyone who knows where I can get a
console/pod for the 2 1/6" VDO guages please post the contact info?
Thanks,
