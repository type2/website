Even if the breather system has recently been inspected it's not worthwhile
to overfill the tank.  Carry a 2 gal spare instead.  Once you look behind
the firewall it's obvious that overfilling the tank won't really get you
much further down the road.

Is it possible that fuel could be forced through the breather lines, through
the charcoal canister and onto cylinder #2?  I wonder.

Do people still put petroleum jelly onto battery terminals?
