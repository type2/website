Could be poor ignition switch contacts as well. This can be verified by 
monitoring coil voltage with a VOM while wiggling the switch and watching 
for volts glitches. Just put the key in the run position and wiggle the key 
and turn it very slightly both directions. This problem is augmented by 
having a large weight of keys on your key ring.
