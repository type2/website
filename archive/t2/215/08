With as many VW enthusiasts in Arizona, you would
think it would be easy to find this bus. For heavens
sakes, if you know some shady characters in the area
who are bad for the hobby, roll over on them. I think
everyone should do that, there should be some sort of
way that we as a group of enthusiasts can combat this.
It pisses me off that so many VW's have been stolen
lately. Maybe we should start pooling our money for
some sort of a reward fund for legit stolen buses. How
long can we watch?
