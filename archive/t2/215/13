I'm just starting to get a little more into this '79 Westfalia.. Put the =
top up for the first time. This was a first for me. I've never seen this =
before from the inside. I sure would like it better with windows on both =
sides. I have never yet slept up in one of these things and I can hardly =
wait.. give me a night or two.. the driveway will do! The tent looks =
real good! No tears or rot, but the screen needs replacing. It almost =
seems like a real coarse screen.. like wire or nylon window screen. I =
would think they would use a nylon fabric mesh. Does anyone know what is =
supposed to be used on that front screen in the pop-top?=20
Another question.. How are the pop-tops in a rain? Do they repel water? =
Do they leak around the bottom if they are raised in a rain? Do you =
waterproof them with Scotchguard or something?=20
I was really amazed with the sheer practicality of the pop-top.. It's so =
easy to raise up, and in just a minute and the slightest of effort, you =
have a safe, snug sleeping area! Absolute genius!   Jan B
