ok, i know you guys were talking about this last week, but i finally had
something of my own to add. i went to see my grandparents sunday,
following your discussion. i believe it was said that they dont have it
running yet??? well, my grandmother has been saving the DAILY funnies for
the last month because she knows i love VWs and she saw that the boys in
zits are working on a VW bus! HOW SWEET IS MY GRANDMA??? anyway, in the
black and white daily paper, they have it running... poorly, but
running... and it is HILARIOUS!!!

i will be scanning them some time soon... probably after i mail out the
newsletter for our local VW club. havent even started on it yet and i
like to have it out 2 weeks before our meeting... that would be
TOMORROW!!! i better get busy. i'll scan the strips in a few days, then i
will post them somewhere... any ideas? do we have a place already where
we have been putting these things? i have one color one from a long time
ago, saved to my harddrive on 6-19-01, according to my pc... odd.

anyway, they are so funny... stole, uh, i mean BORROWED the wheels off
mom's car and the transmission, too... then they were driving it and
there was a line of cars behind them, blinded by the thick smoke pouring
from the back of the bus. i think they were only going about 10mph,
too... and i get the impression neither of them has ever driven before...
they seemed pretty excited.

OH~! at one point, they were looking in the manual for advice on how to
fix the transmission... here is a quote... 

"Before we go and yank the transmission, maybe we should look at the
owner's manual for some tips"
"trans, trans, trans... transmission tips!... '1) Like, don't mess with
the transmission, man. It's bad karma'... Deep"
"It's a wonder that anything got accomplished in the sixties!"

wavin to all and lovin my grandma!!!
