Ok, I've devoloped this annoying squeek in the front. It doesn't
squeek when I jump up and down on the bumper or rock it back and
forth, only when it's driving. It sounds like a rubber squeek. It's
rather irregular. It USUALLY squeeks most the time I'm driving at
slower speeds, but sometimes it doesn't. I was thinking steering
stabilizer bushing, but then it dawned on me that I've never seen one,
so I'm thinking our busses don't have 'em. Shocks maybe? What else is
likely to make a rubbery squeek in the front?
