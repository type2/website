Subject: Re: [T2] Why use inverters for DC devices?

	Mike is right, most (if not all) consumer LCD's are 12v and powering 
them directly is only a matter of acquiring the correct 12v connection 
which has the correct amps/miliamps of output (which isnt always easy 
to find), however many newer laptops are 24v so a direct 12v adaptor 
will not work if thats the case, you will either need the specific 
"auto/air power adaptor" or an inverter. Check your power block.
