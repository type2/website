Subject: [T2] Scale for balancing?

I am sorry but I am pretty sure you would have to balance a piston closer to 
the "X" amount of grams that a dime weighs. If you were off that amount of 
grams on any given piston it surely would not be balanced very well. I think 
that all pistons should be balanced to within 1 gram of each other. You 
would need a scale that would be accurate to within 1 gram. I am not an 
expert on this. Maybe someone could say what gram tolerance a VW piston with 
the pin and clips and rings installed would be. I would like to know myself. 
Maybe I am all wet when it comes to balancing. I don't know. Just asking for 
an answer myself. Cree (2) 79 Bays and a 71 Bay, Love em all.
