Robert,

Thanks, I'm sure the one that Richard is working on looks as well!
Practically Everything on there that could be, is powder coated!

Yes, all the way to the drivers side.  Mine really is supposed to be like 
a tube, but is was little mangled.

Make sure the tape seals well!  You can lose a whole heck-of-alot
of cooling air out that hole!

Cheers, dave

 rectangular, with a cylinder shaped bit coming off the end. I've got
