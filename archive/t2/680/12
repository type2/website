Subject: Choice of power inverters

I use a 750 watt (1,500 peak) inverter made by Vector Manufacturing Ltd, 
Ft. Lauderdale, FL.

It delivers a (PWM) filtered modified sine wave (several rectangular 
segments in each half of the wave.) That is a mid-level cleaned up sort of 
AC power suitable for all but the most sensitive power users.

Provides up to 6.5 continuous AC amperes and works with computers and small 
electric motors. Automatic shutdown at high (15.5vdc) or low input (10vdc).

Available at Walmart in automotive, for $70 plus tax. China.

I chose the 750 watt because I can probably recharge my battery at that 
rate with a 60 amp alternator making 13 volts.....  60 x 13 = 780 
watts.   AND I only need a maximum of about that many watts to operate what 
I  want to use. I'll heat things with propane.

Bonus: In emergencies I can keep my home furnace blower motor running 
during a power outage.

Or in the summer it will maybe run the freezer compressor....not sure about 
that yet, still investigating.
