Chris,

No disrespect, but .1 oz. = 2.8g.  There is no doubt in my mind that the
chip in these is capable of 1g accuracy, but you would need to buy it in
any other country on earth to get it wired to display.  If you are close
to Canada and can slip across the border then I would advise the trip,
else I would look on the net and gladly pay shipping from a .uk source.

OOK!
