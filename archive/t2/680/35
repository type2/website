Subject: Why use inverters for DC devices?

A laptop is a DC device- best to use a 12v adaptor as your laptop likely
is 12 v already.  Any computer store will have them-usually doubled with
airplane plugs.  In our Westy bus we use a $400 Samsung 15" TV/computer
monitor flatscreen to view TV or movies played on a small Apple laptop. 
That too is 12 volts. The sound is fed to the aux inputs on the radio.
When buying devices using a transformer, I usually check the input and
chose 12v devices, including the satellite speakers.  I even wire my own
plugs, noting polarity carefully.  Until she got a fancy radio, my
daughter used a nice subwoofer/small speakers Altec Lansing system
purchased for $15 at a charity Nurse's sale.  She used her cd/mp3
portable fed right into this.  All I had to do was tap into the contacts
supplied by the transformer and wire in the car 12 volts.
