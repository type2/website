Subject: Scale for balancing?

Does anyone have a recommendation for a scale to balance rods and 
pistons, something widely available (at like Office Depot or Linens and 
Things or something of the sort)? Something where the pointer comes to 
a rest quickly, and really points to something (like a line)?
