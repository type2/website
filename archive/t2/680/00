Subject: Re: [T2] Choice of Power Inverters?

I have an added inverter and love it.  
     
Started with 1250 watts, but have since upgraded to
2500 watts.  Used to use a 1250 watt 2000 Peak
Modified Sine Wave Inverter.  It would not run a 1650
Watt Toaster Oven.  Have since upgraded to a 2500 watt
4000 Peak Modified Sine Wave Inverter, and it runs
both a tiny Microwave and the toaster oven.  Haven't
tried watching TV on the newer 120V inverted power,
but presume it would work as the Panasonic TV/VCR/DVD
(16"? 17"?) combo unit worked with the smaller 1250
watt inverter unit.  Laptop works A-ok with both 1250
& 2500.
    
Inverter Install Location?  Due to dust considerations
in the electronics, I chose to install the inverter
under the back seat of my Riviera Plan 1.  Have big
cables which go back to the Aux battery in Engine
Compartment left / port / Drivers side.  I would
recommend against trying to install the inverter
within the engine compartment.
    
There are true sine wave inverters of the 2000 watt
ilk for $1700.  Yes, almost two thousand dollars.
     
Recommendation:  Do what I did.  Buy the el-cheapo
2500 watt inverter from Heartland America.  This was
was only $200 plus shipping.  Their part number
ww22-66055 for $199.  Chinese made, sufficient to the
task.  View it at

Or, for a more local and name brand item, try the
Tripp-lite 3000 watt for about $400 available through
(amoung others) at
