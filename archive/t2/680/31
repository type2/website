Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for Baltic Birch in DC area

Jamie,

I just bought 3 sheets of 1/8"x 5'x5' (equivalent metric size) baltic birch
from the Hardwood Store of NC.  they are between Greensboro and Burlington
NC near Elon College.  It is around $25 per sheet or about $60 for 3 sheets,
so I bought 3, I will probably have one extra.

They didn't have a lot of the 5'x5' so it would be worth calling to make
sure they have it in stock.  also some that they had was "airplane grade",
earmarked for some special order.

I don't know where else to get it, but for the headliner in a regular westy
it has to be bigger than the standard 48" width in order to bend with the
grain.

I know it's not that close to DC but is IS close to the Everybus venue.
