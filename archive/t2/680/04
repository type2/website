Subject: Re: [T2] battery

  I'm with Bob on this one. I prefer the option of switching to just 
one, the other, or using both to start on cold days after camping in 
the middle of nowhere. The switch also is a plus should your starter 
battery die and you need to use the house battery for starting. You 
don't have to switch over cables etc...

  I've got a deep cell 120 AH for the house electronics, and a standard 
diehard or some such for the starter circuit (I don't really remember 
what it is as it's been in there since I've owned the bus, some 12 
years now, and it just won't die, knock wood).
