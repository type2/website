Subject: No. LA county Busavan to BBBIX! CHANGE OF MEETING PLACE

The new meeing place is at Crazy Otto's which is off of the 14 freeway at
the Santiago Road exit.  The restaurant is in the mini-mall north of the
freeway.

Meeting time is 7:15AM!

We will then head out to Lake Havasu via CA 14 to CA 58 to I-15 to I-40,
etc. to avoid the flooded 138

We're using FRS radios on channel 2.
