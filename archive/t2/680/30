But this pseudo-sine wave can cause overheating and
other problems, in your apppliance or motor,  that are
not immediately noticeable.

Remember, though that this inverter may be only 70% to
80% efficient, so that it could be drawing over
900watts from you  battery when putting out 750watts.
Something to keep in mind if running heavy loads for
many hours.
