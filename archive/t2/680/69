Hi Bob,

Liquid Propane Fuel Injection strikes me as an excellent idea: the fuel 
itself would help cool the heads!

How you pump the fuel is a whole other question. I doubt if the stock 
fuel pump will work at the temperature of LPG. And you would have to 
have a pump if you were going to be able to operate the vehicle at low 
temps.

Darn shame that LPG is so bulky; that makes it impractical for 
long-distance travel.

Happy trails,
