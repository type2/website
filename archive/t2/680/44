Subject: RE: [T2] What about diesel conversions?

Someday I would love to do this. The biggest problem isn't only getting a 
TDI engine to fit and set it all up correctly but the tranny has to be 
totally geared differently. Diesel engines have much much lower RPMS than 
gas engines - you'll have to have different gears put in your tranny.

I think it would be awesome to be running off french fry grease, many people 
are doing it now. Using this you have to have a preheat system as the fuel 
turns solid.


It would be a huge huge project.
