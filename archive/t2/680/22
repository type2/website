I agree. The biggest problem I am having though is catching up with the 
last 30 years of lack of proper maintenance! There seems to be no end of 
items that have not been maintained or poorly/incorrectly maintained by the 
dreaded POs. The latest has been the leaky rear wheel cylinder that took 
hacking off 2 wheel nuts to get to.
