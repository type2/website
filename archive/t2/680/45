Subject: [T2] Why use inverters for DC devices?

I agree, why use a converter especially when auto/air power adapters are on

You have another choice you can get an auto/air power supply for your
laptop and use it in any vehicle with a cigarette lighter type socket. 
CompUSA has a couple on sale this well (if you dont mind dealing with
rebates) you should check to make sure they will work with your laptop. 
Heres a link to the one I purchased the other day for my laptop.
