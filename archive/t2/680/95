Subject: charging/no turnover diagnosis ?

'80 Vanagon air cooled here.

Recently replaced the alternator belt.  Battery is a bit more than a 
year old.  Terminals are clean.  ...but it has sat idle for much of the 
last year with only intermittent use prior to my alt. belt replacement.

Drove my beast to motor vehicles admin and back yesterday....about 40 
minutes each way.  Stopped for gas on way back.  No problems.

Temp. dipped to freezing last night and today.

Loaded some stuff to haul to my sisters this afternoon.  Started fine. 
Got to my sister's and unloaded.

Go to return.  Turn key..I got dash lights, headlights but no attempt 
from the starter to turn.  No click.  Nothing.

Drift started easy.

Got home.  Shut off.  Try again. Started right up.

So I'm thinking solenoid?  Starter and solenoid were replace about 5 
years back and it has been driven intermittently since then but not 
regularly.  I guess its reasonable that solenoid contacts or ground 
strap corrosion have set in somewhere.

Any other thoughts?  First time this has happened and I'd like to 
correct before it becomes a habit.
