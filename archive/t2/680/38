Subject: Re: [T2] Why use inverters for DC devices?

I recently picked up a 14" Mag Innovision LCD monitor for $40. It
takes 12v DC and is perfect for the bus.

I have a 2000w MSW inverter that I have only used for my drill and
buffer so far. No problems there that I've seen. I'm going to see how
well it works for a GameCube and a PC. I figure a top of the line PC
power supply should be able to clean up the power without too much
trouble, but a cheap one will definitely overheat. I've seen cheap
ones lose the magic smoke when plugged into a cheap inverter, but I've
seen good ones have no problems.
