Subject: Alternative Heater Tubes?

Ok, I'm FINALLY ready to install my heater tubes (The onese from the
heat exchanger to the long tube going up front). I've got the
accordian pipes, but the asbestos heat blocker/seals are gone, and one
of my tubes is pretty well melted around the end.

Has anyone used any other sort of tubing to replace these? Maybe Drier
Vent tubing (metal of course)? Maybe something made for HVAC purposes?
