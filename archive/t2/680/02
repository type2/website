Subject: extra hole in shroud

Beautiful (if that's the right word for a bus engine) engine, Dave.

Are you and Richard referring to that little item shown in your photo 
that's all the way on the left of the shroud? Its a small, silver and 
rectangular, with a cylinder shaped bit coming off the end. I've got 
one too, and there's tape all over mine. Always wondered about it.

Thanks.
