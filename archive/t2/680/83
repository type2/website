1976 Kombi 2.0 FI, totally stock except for Pertronix in the Dizzy.
Manual Tranny of course.

First off, yay, I finally got a computer back up and running. So if
anyones missed me, witch I doubt, I'm back. :D

Ok, it started by cranking VERY slowly when I hadn't driven it for a
while. Like a day or two. I'm talking like cranking like the battery
is close to dead. Otherwise it would crank and start fine.

Then it evolved into doing that the first time I start it in the day.
Now it's doing it whenever it's sat for more than an hour or two.

Now on top of that, it won't start at ALL unless I give it a couple
cranks, then turn the key off, then back on, wait 5-8 seconds, turn it
off, and repeat about 10 times. Then it cranks once and instantly
fires.

Heres what I'm thinking it is, but it's COLD out their, and I don't
wanna work on the car in this weather unless I know I'm doing the
right thing, so I'm looking for second and third opinions. :D

Ok, I'm thinking that the fuel filter is clogged (or maybe the
injectors even) and by turning the key over like that I'm priming the
system up to high enough pressure.  Thinking also that my pressure
relief valve may be bleeding off pressure.

For the slow cranking, I'm thinking I have a bad contact somewhere.
Probably a ground. Any common places that I should start my
inspections at?
