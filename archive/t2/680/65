Subject: Re: [T2] Scale for balancing?

Mark,

This is the one item that you probably do *not* go to harbor freight
to buy.

Ohaus triple beam balance.  Not cheap, and you may have trouble actually 
buying one(drug dealers love them).  

They do *not* settle fast, they settle ***correctly***...but, you aren't 
in a hurry to balance something that is supposed to last 100,000+ miles 
then again, are you?

Do a google search of them...about $116.00 or so.

--------------------------------------------------------
A weighing capacity of 610g, readability of 0.1g, and a 6" 
diameter platform. 
------------------------------------------------------------

??Notice the readability??

Overall weight on rods, perfect for doing pistons....just don't forget to 
set your rings first and to mix and match wrist pins and keepers to get 
closer the the ideal balance.

Doing big/little end on rods in more of a challenge.

Up to the student to do research on this part....<grin>.

Buy the good stuff on this one and never look back.

Cheers, dave
