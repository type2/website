Subject: Re: [T2] Paint color?

Yes, but it has to be an exact color. I'll essentially be painting the 
whole bus three times: once to change the color, once (per section) 
each time I do some work, and once at the end. The final color could be 
slightly different from the first two "coats," but they have to match. 
I'll probably buy all of that all at once, blend it, and re-can half. 
(Since I have everything I need to paint with a good paint gun, I 
probably won't rattle-can it.)
