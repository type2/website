Indeed! My buddy has a greasel TDI.  He gets fuel free from a Chinese
restaurant.  His system is a conversion kit with a tank for the grease in
the back of the wagon.  So he starts on diesel, the grease warms up and he
switches the tank over.  Heard there are some emissions issues with this
system though.  But you could use same system with biodiesel, which I
believe can solidify but not as bad as grease.

So you think a TDI would fit? Maybe a diesel Vanagon tranny with a TDI
engine would work on the bus or AC Vanagon.
