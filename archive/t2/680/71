Subject: Re: [T2] Fixing Pop Top Canvas

I've used urethane glue/calk (check boat stores) which is clear and
dries flexible- it is stiffer than silicone calk when it is squeezed
out; you can use it to bridge tears or small holes.  For large zones
(like the major mouse chews I had), I used oval cutouts of similar
canvas with the calk underneath to act as a glue.
