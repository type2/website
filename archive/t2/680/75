Holy cow - what do you use to power it??  I can't imagine you getting more 
than 15 minutes of toaster oven use on a typical aux battery.

Has anyone actually bought a Tripp-lite lately that can attest to their 
reliability?  I bought one back in the eighties and another in 1999 and 
both were complete junk, failing within days.  I would not recommend 
anything by Tripp-Lite.  I have a 200-watt Coleman inverter I got at Pep 
Boys for $20 that works great, and also a Power-To-Go 600-watt that is 
permanently mounted in my bus, which I've had for ten years and still works 
great.
