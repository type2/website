Subject: What about diesel conversions?

LPG impractical?  What about diesel conversions?  Do Jetta diesel engines
fit in a bus?  Then one could go greasel or biodeiesel.  The 1.6 vanagon
diesel I have been warned about, but what of some of the other german
diesels out there? Fit in a bus or AC Vanagon?  You can make your own gas
fairly cheap, maybe start a gas co-op with buddies.

See you on the road, Nik
