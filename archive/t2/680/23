Subject: Re: [T2] Choice of Power Inverters?

Hi David,

My westfakia has a 400Watt digital inverter from Canadian Tire. We use 
it to power the interior lights, and can be used to power a Sony 
Playstation 2 and a 13" TV. Last winter I installed it in the westfakia 
with a changeover switch that allows me to quickly change from inverter 
power to shore power. The receptacles for power input and output are 
located at the back of the bus, more like the split-window westies than 
the side-mounted input used on bay westies. There is also a 110V power 
bar inside the bus attached to the rear-facing seat.

Here's some pics:

Happy trails,
