Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Baltic Birch in DC area

... or any area.

Baltic birch is not rare.  (It used to be.) It's common anywhere that 
there is a housing boom. It's the preferred material (along with MDF) 
for building custom kitchen cabinets and whatnot. Here in San Diego, 
there are at least three places within 20 minutes of my house that have 
it in stock. Lots of it.

To find it, you just need to sit down with the yellow pages and make 
calls until you find a supplier. Start with the listings under 
hardwoods. I've never known a hardwood supplier who wasn't willing to 
point me in the right direction, and most of them carry it (unless all 
they do is flooring).

Don't even bother with Home Depot or Lowe's.
