Subject: RE: [T2] What about diesel conversions?

The issues with a diesel, water-cooled, engine in a bus are obvious.
RADIATOR.  Which would likely be addressed similar to the "road cow" bay
with a Toyota gas engine.  There are numerous sites on the web for
putting a TDI in a vanagon.  The problem is that you have to alter the
deck above the engine compartment and end up with a bubble back there.
However, this is only cosmetic.
