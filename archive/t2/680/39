Subject: Interesting garage door option for Westy owners

My garage has a swing-up door with an automated garage opener.  The 
door opening is high enough for my poptop to clear, but the door gets 
in the way and scrapes. I've been thinking about what to do about this, 
short of parking on the street (not something I want to do). One option 
I've explored is installing a roll-up overhead in place of the 
swing-up, with a high track.

I'm much more interested in doing some kind of horizontally sliding 
door. Haven't found a U.S. source yet, but this page:

http://www.amourelle.co.uk/sliding.htm

shows a British company's solution to the problem. Looks good, and it 
may be possible to home engineer.
