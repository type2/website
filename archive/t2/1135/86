The old school way is to spray carb cleaner at all the rubber boots,
hose connections, and gaskets. RPM will go up if it hits a leak.

Today's practices are more safety oriented and say RPM will be
similarly affected if you use something non-flammable like soapy
water, or even just water.

I never had trouble with carb cleaner, but you have to use common
sense about using it prudently and being aware of sources of ignition.
