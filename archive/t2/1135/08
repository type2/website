hmmm might be different I looked at the website and it says rebuild while 
the one I have is a troubleshooting manual, which is weree I got most of 
the info I've sent you

it also says "as aviable" so hopefully they have one, although I would 
recommend switching to the 010 if you can get a core anyway it is a much 
more solid tranny and was used in a lot of different VW's and Audi's which 
means it is better supported.  the only thing you would need to change is 
the cable from the shift rod to the tranny everything else is the same as 
far as installing. you just block off the vacuum port on the engine..

good luck let me know how it goes, I have two dead cores and have been 
debating pulling em apart and trying to makee one good tranny since 
different things are wrong with each.
