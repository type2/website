It doesn't surprise me that is where the leak is as the problems with
the boots were one of the reasons I gave up on the weber progressive. I
have subsequently read that movement of the carb and the plenum chamber
it is bolted to can exacerbate the failure of the boots. Mine was bolted
on with one bolt underneath which did not provide much resistance to
vibration. If you look at what Wildthings has done on The Samba he has a
much more substantial mount (as well as many other mods!)
