Subject: rekeyimg 69 bus

Kevin, If you're sure that the ignition you have is an R profile, be aware
that it can't be changed to an L profile which is what the rest of your bus
is.  The pre-71 ignitions really aren't made to be rekeyed, though the rest of
the locks are.  Beginning with the '71 model year, the ignition is different
and is designed to be serviced and rekeyed.
