Has diagrams of all stock systems. (find the year/model on the left.)
 
Should have flange on one side, slip joint on other side, presuming I'm
getting which exhaust you have, as federal and CA don't go together to me.  CA
exhaust has double flanged on the cat, it sits up beside valve cover, odd
convoluted piping, federal has flange to slip joint cat is back in the back
inline with muffler.
 
I'd say your cat isn't right, or has lost something.

I own an 81 vanagon, and recently bought a used, exhaust system, from
crossover
to tail pipe. It is in excellent condition, and is a federal California setup
with a catalytic converter.

My problem is, I don't understand how the muffler attaches to the  Cat.
Neither
end has a flange, and there is no obvious place  for a clamp.
