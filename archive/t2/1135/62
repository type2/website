I've put a lot of dead buses back on the road with Weber progressives.
I used to be able to pick them up at Bug-o-Rama for $20 each and the
manifold assembly for $20 each, but since I don't live near any of
these bargain basement VW events anymore, I've been buying off that
auction site.

They usually go for about $80 if you search under VW Weber, but since
they were used as stock carbs on a lot of production cars, if you just
search weber progressive or even a specific model, you can pick up a
lot of cheap ones that the VW guys don't find. Last one I got was $3
and shipping was $15.

Manifolds are getting pricey, though, but if you already have it, you
don't have to worry about it. Otherwise, you can sometimes catch a
decent price on The Samba, but they are getting high too.

You might consider a rebuild kit instead of a spare carb. About $25
last time I got one.
