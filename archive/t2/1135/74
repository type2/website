Subject: carb problems

Well, thanks for all of the comments regarding my Weber carb problems.  
We had some nice weather today so I took it off and went through it 
again.  It will still need to be replaced as a part of the molded piece 
that holds the float pin on is broken.  But it is staying in place and 
the float is working properly.  I did get a little more junk out of one 
of the tubes.  And the jets were clear.  I finally got it to idle for a 
while by messing with the mixture.  But it is still not right.  I'm not 
able to get any suction on the back barrel at all even at full 
throttle.  But I'm going to play with it some more tomorow.

I did have at least one cylinder that wasn't firing and I pulled and 
cleaned all of the plugs.  Two looked like they hadn't fired at all.  
They are fairly new but it has been sitting for a long time.  I did a 
basic compression check and got got numbers (barely) in spec from 112 to 
122.5.  Good enough that it should run.  And it did when I put 
everything back together.  I do have a hole in the muffler and will have 
to get that replaced.  That happened the last time I tried to get it 
running.  Scared my neighbors to death.  :)  Kaboom...

I tried to find a Weber carb locally but didn't have any luck.  One guy 
said he hadn't sold one of those in years.  I figured I could just use 
the jets that I have.  Just a good body would work.  The rest of my 
parts seem to be OK.  Fuel pressure is good and It's hitting on all four 
but I haven't yet gotten it to idle consistently.  I'll just get back on 
it tomorrow and see what I can figure out.  It is nice to have the time 
and the weather to work on it again.  Thanks...KR
