Subject: Paris France

Hi to any list member in Paris, France, or close by.  I'm heading there next
week for 10 days.  Would be fun to have glass of wine, or a beer and talk VW
Bus with anyone in Paris.  "Close by" is a relative term looking from Alaska. 
No, we cant see Russia from here (Alaska joke).  Pmail off list if you are
interested. Thanks.  jon
