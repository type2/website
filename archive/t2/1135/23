also  have dual solex 40s on my 74 transporter. (solex = kadron, right?)
Anyway,  I am hoping to get performance gains in simpler ways first, ie
pertronix  ign, bosch blue coil?,
any other more simple performance  suggestions?

hello Guys  kadrons are brazil  made solexs , not stock, not very  good 
carbs as the crosshafts wear badly and the linkage sucks . the  pertronix and 
blue coil will not add any horsepower.  A true CDI ignition  will. Crane use 
to make a good one.  dual 2 barrel carbs (webers or  Dells)will add more 
horsepower also  later  mark  d
