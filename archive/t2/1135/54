Subject: Travelling to Arizona/New Mexico in March.

I am thinking of driving from Vancouver Island to Arizona/New Mexico at Spring Break (mid March) and don't know what the roads will be like, as I've never driven it except in summer. What are the roads like at this time of year through the mountains, and what is the best route to take to avoid snow as much as possible??
Thanks,
Courtney
