Subject: RE: Travelling to Arizona/New Mexico in March

I drove from Tillamook OR to Belen, NM. in a 76 westy About a week or so ago. I took I-5 to bakerfield when I-40. The weather right now in NM is nice but cold at night. My bus made it up the pass ok mainly low (2-3) up. But I was also tow my bug. The pass siskiyou pass just before California on I-5 was the hardes one. Funny thing, California has a Port of Entree, The woman there ask me here I came from I look at her and said Oregon duh!! My father told later that she want know what state I live in. My laptop batter is going dead. I post more when I find some power.
