Forwarding to the type2.com mailing list.

We are in the midst or preparing for a transmission drop as well, to repair
leaks. You can see the replies to that thread at http://bit.ly/bdFo81

> We have a type 2 tin top registered 1973, rhd, as we are based in UK, which
we have been renovating for about 3 years now. Bodywork is now in good
condition and basic running gear/engine is great. She is as sweet as a nut
except..

> The issue is that the bus is an auto, which is rare in Europe, more common
in the States. Getting parts is nigh on impossible because nobody has them,
let alone breaks them and new bits cannot be sourced in UK.

> The bit I need is as shown on attached Bentley Publishers Official Service
Manual, under section 20 [Automatic Transmission] as number 13  connecting
piece with O  ring.

Attachments can't go to the list. For those with the Bentley, please refer to
the aforementioned section.

>  The translation maybe wrong but it is a plug that is on top of the box
which stops the transmission oil coming out and maybe linked to the reversing
lights, but I am guessing, as when we got to get the engine running there was
just a hole and all we had was a big pool of red oil on the garage floor!

> First thing I would like to know is what it is and the second is where I can
get one? Any help would be very gratefully received. We have plugged it for
the time being with a breather valve, but that cant be long term answer.
