Hi volks,

Next week my employer is sending me on a mini-tour of the maritimes. I 
start off in St John, New Brunswick on Monday, then I am in Moncton NB 
on Tuesday and in Halifax, Nova Scotia  on Wed-Friday. My time in 
Moncton might extend a day depending on the workload, right now that's 
not entirely clear.

If there's any listmembers down that way who want to gather for a pint 
one night please email me and we'll figure out where to meet up. I've 
found this a great way to meet bus owners in Vancouver, Abbottsford, 
Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Hartford CT... I've done quite a few trips 
in the Maritimes this past year but this is really the first time I've 
had enough flexibility in my schedule to possibly make this happen.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
