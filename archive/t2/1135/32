Chris, do you need the stock FI set up to convert to Megasquirt?  I'm 
assuming it is not a complete replacement system.  I found out that I 
may not have a carb problem after all.  I think the Condenser was 
crapping out and not giving me enough spark. I thought I checked that 
before I got into it the last time and I may still have a carb problem. 
  But the condenser seems to be completely gone now so I ordered a 
Petronix SVDA distributor/Electronic Ignition setup from Busdepot.  I've 
been meaning to do that anyway so we'll see if that's the problem.  But 
pretty soon I'll need to replace the carb too as I broke a piece of it 
off and it's on its last leg.  I'm still considering the dual carbs you 
suggested.  Ciao...KR
