Subject: Re: [T2] carb problem

Thanks for the info, Chris.  I'll get into that tomorrow.  I know I have 
a 12v light somewhere in my garage but I couldn't lay my hands on it 
today.  Give me a call Sunday if it's not too out of the way to stop by 
East Ridge.  I'd love to meet you anyway.  Unfortunately, I can't do 
much else with my bus (except chase the drain) until I get the 
carburetor.  I rebuilt this one and it didn't help.  Of course, if I get 
the used one, I may have to rebuild it if its been setting up for a 
while.  Hope not.  Hey, what the heck is a Brenderup 1205S??  Ciao...KR
