this and does it help or would it be better to go with injectors
instead?

My sage words of advice would be whichever way you go, get new stuff.
Used carbs or FI can lead you to swap one set of probs for another! For
example, I got rid of my weber progressive because there always seemed
to be vacuum leaks from somewhere - generally the fault of the ill
fitting manifolds. I put on some used weber icts a couple of years ago
and have only just got them running right. I have replaced most of the
jets, cleaned them through, added phenolic spacers after they dumped
fuel in the oil and played with the linkage trying to get them
synchronised. Even then with the worn linkage it is still a compromise
rather than perfect.
