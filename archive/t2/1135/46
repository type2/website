For fuel starvation I would look at the fuel filter and fuel pump.
There's a spec on measuring pump output, which should be a little
higher for a Weber since it flows more air.

Gosh, home already?!?! I don't think I saw a Pic-of-the-Day
chronicling your last days on the ship, packing up, getting off, and
travelling home!
