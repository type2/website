Hi Kevin,

I will be traveling by Boeing 737 followed by whatever Budget classes as 
an "INTERMEDIATE CAR AUTO AIR"

It'd be a 20-hr drive to get out there by road from Toronto. With 
airfare costing only about $100 more than the cost of gasoline for the 
trip and saving 18 hours driving, it's a no-brainer.

Happy Trails,
