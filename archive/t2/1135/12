Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 drivers side rocker panel area metal

hmmm,, what you are saying is the repair panel has more metal than you
want..??  Take out your shears and trim the top edge to fit .. if you are
going to put the seam back.. then make sure you leave allowance to bend that
lip over ... weld, prime, sand, paint , drive for more fun and games!

> How are people repairing this area? There does not seem to be a left hand
side rocker panel available or am I missing it? All I see is the big 6 or 8"
wide complete side that goes from the front edge of the back wheelwell to
the front seam just behind the door. Using this means you lose the bottom
rocker panel seam, and the rear vertical seam just in front of the rear
tire.
