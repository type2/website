Merry Friday, Mike


"I've been getting a lot of emails lately wondering what I've been doing.
Well, I'm proud to announce that I've created a new upper body fitness
program
using the genuine VW scissor jack:

Witness the results:

- For just pennies a day you
can enjoy unparalleled upper body strength.
- Be the life of the party.
-
Impress your friends.
- Lift up the car without using the jack!"
