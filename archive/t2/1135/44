Hook up the battery and a charger (or jumper cables to another car).

Feel around on the fuse box for a warm wire.

Connect and disconnect the battery cable from the battery to look for a 
spark. The spark indicates a drain. If no spark, no drain and your 
battery might be bad rather than the bus.

You can also pull individual fuses until you find one that sparks 
indicating a load on it or hook up a light bulb between the red cable 
and the battery. Disconnect the red battery cable. Connect a 12V 
lightbulb to the positive post and the red cable. Don't let the bare 
ends touch anything else. If the light comes on then there is a load 
somewhere. You can then roam around the bus removing fuses until the 
light goes off or unplugging stuff like the ignition switch. When the 
light goes off you've found the drain and you can work further to 
isolate the cause within that circuit.

Dome light work? Is it on? Stereo unplugged? Stereo amp? Brake lights 
on? Headlight switch be turned off and on a few times vigorously? Door 
switch shorted out? Wipers trying to park despite being parked? Any 
foglights or heater fan or extras added that is driaing the battery?

Unhook the alternator regulator for a minute and see if the load goes 
away. Crispy wires in the engine bay shorting together?

I'll be in 'nooga Sunday if you need a second set of eyes for a little 
while after a family gathering up on Signal Mtn.
