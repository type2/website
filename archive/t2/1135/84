Problem with the Mexican variety is that when they fail, the flaps
default to a closed position, not open like their German counterpart.
A real stupid redesign.  I avoid them like the plague.  Id'd rather
prop the flaps open.

Yes, they are an important piece to have, but finding original
Behr/Wahler thermostats is the same as trying to find a needle in the
haystack.  And when you do find a NOS one, the price is in the
stratosphere, hunnert bucks or more.
