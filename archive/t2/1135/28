Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Replacement Value

State Farm didn't like the replacement value determined through online ads
so they had it appraised by a company called Big Block in Oregon City.  If
there are two things that really get under my skin it is guys who like big
blocks and anything related to Oregon City.

The appraisal was $4650 so after deductible we would get $4400.  Initially
they told me that my estimate of $6400 to replace it sounded accurate.

I called Auto Ideas and he is going to take a look at some pictures and
decide if it is worth paying him to appraise it.

My claim person at State Farm didn't know what a Westfalia was and asked me
to spell it.

Now get this, my bus, worth only $4650 is still worth $1077 after having a
logtruck try to drive through it if I want to buy it back.  It seems that a
wrecked car worth $1100 should have been worth a lot more than $4650 before
the accident.

I am not trying to make money on this, the Samba lists '75 to '79 Westies
from $7500 to $13000, but on top of that I feel like they are telling me
that a member of my family, a character in many of my very greatest
memories, isn't worth the money it would take to buy a replacement that I
haven't even met.
