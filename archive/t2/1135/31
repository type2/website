that sounds about right.  unfortunately memories are not insurable...

any one who has seen my 78 HPBus conversion van knows it is rough body 
wise
but it is mechanically sound
the appraisal and my assigned value and insurance policy

(drum roll)

is $12,500


find an appraiser who knows what he is looking at.

that bus looks like it was taken care of and was in good shape
