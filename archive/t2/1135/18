the place that I found that my "assigned value" policy really paid for 
itself was when someone hit me,, (I have full coverage too) that the other 
persons insurance company just wanted to total my van and because it was 
more expensive to meet the declared (and appraised) value than it would be 
to fix it they paid me to have it fixed.

since I do have full coverage my insurance company in theory cannot 
declare it totalled for less than the assigned value
