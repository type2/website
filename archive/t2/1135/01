Subject: Re: [T2] Steering wheel

Hi John and others who replied

Thanks for the help.   Yes I did check the coupler 'down under' and  
it was flat.  Started reading one of my workshop manuals (don't have  
a Bentleys but have an Australian one by
Haynes which is not too bad and obviously more applicable to us who  
drive on the right (correct!! ) side of the road -- I'm waiting for  
the repercussions!!)

Seriously, it discussed the removal and refitting of the steering  
column.  In one part where it talks about refitting the steering lock  
etc. it mentions fitting a new shear bolt but not tightening it fully.

After discussing reassembling everything including putting the  
steering wheel back on it says "lift the ignition housing up to  
within 2-3 mm (just under 1/8th) of the wheel and tighten shear bolt
until it breaks off"

As I have already replaced my shear bolt with a standard Allen head  
bolt I simply loosened the bolt off, lifted the housing up too the  
wheel and retightened.
Miracle!!  Suddenly I have a horn again and indicators that self cancel.

Grand total of time:	about 3 minutes.

Hope this helps someone else as well
