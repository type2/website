It's about condition. You can get a Westy that's not an eyesore, but
not great for $3500. But when you start talking about great condition,
it is going to cost you a pretty penny. You might have to print out
some ads to show them what you will have to spend to replace it with
one in comparable condition. Wouldn't hurt to print out some in the
$4000 range, too, to show them what you get for that kind of money.
