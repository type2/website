  I'm not sure why all three baywindows I have owned have had their 
thermostats removed (including bracket and wire, of course).  I have 
been convinced that this is an important engine component.

 From my online research I gather that thermostats from early bugs can 
be modified to work on a type 2.  Has anyone installed one of those 
newer, Mexican made thermostats designed for the non-German FI Bug?
