Subject: Re: [T2] Gas heater dismount from, 1800cc '74 Westy

Syd.. it all unbolts... off the top of my head.. there is 4 rubber mounts
... unplug the wires ..

the fuel line has to be dealt with,, depending on how it is presently, you
have to cap, or plug the line.

and the hole thru the floor at the rear suspension will need to be capped...

and then you need to install a Tube that connects the engine heater system Y
to the front ... I think the suggestion there is to get a muffler pipe from
a large truck depot.. then insulate and wrap it..

What is wrong with your heater?
