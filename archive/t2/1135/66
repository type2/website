Subject: Vanagon factory exhaust. Help?

I own an 81 vanagon, and recently bought a used, exhaust system, from crossover
to tail pipe. It is in excellent condition, and is a federal California setup
with a catalytic converter.

My problem is, I don't understand how the muffler attaches to the  Cat. Neither
end has a flange, and there is no obvious place  for a clamp.

I see that I need to attach/clamp the muffler to the bracket on the crossover
pipe,  to hang it correctly but the muffler to cat connection bafffles me. It
came to me with a donut gasket on the pipe exiting the muffler, but there is no
obvious way to secure the connection and make a tight seal....

I guess that may not be much to go on, but maybe someone knows the secret, or
perhaps a link to some pics that I can view to figure out how to mate  the
muffler and cat together?

Much obliged for any help.

John
