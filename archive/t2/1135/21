I got a top speed increase of 10 or 15 mph just by going to the Weber
progressive, but it is popular for so many applications, that you need
to check it with an AFR meter like the LM-1 to be sure you have a safe
mixture.

I was lucky. The used one I got from The Bus Co was dialed in
perfectly and required no jet changes. You will deal with this issue
with any carb you put on that is not stock.

Most people reject the Weber progressive because heating the manifold
runners is problematic if you live in cold climate. Bus Boys
recommended to me some electric manifold wraps like they use in
Canada, but I read an easier solution with an exhaust tube (like EGR)
nipple drilled into the bottom of the plenum. Where I am now, it is
always hot, so these steps are not necessary for me. Even when I lived
in Red Bluff, we got a little ice and frost in the winter, but the
electric choke was sufficient to get me on my way to work.

Coil and ignition upgrades are really just improvements in
reliability, not performance upgrades. Once you've done the intake and
exhaust, all that's left are engine improvements. I still have the
original 1700 on my 74. How about you?
