Well, it doesn't have to be much.  I'm sure I've got plenty based on 
what's flowing out of the pump.  The Weber doesn't want but three or 
four pounds of pressure if I remember correctly.  I do have a new 
pressure guage that I never got around to putting in and I may do that 
this weekend.  This is the best electric fuel pump I've ever had on it.  
And I've gone through several.  Especially before I got the tank cleaned 
and lined.  This one's quiet and reliable.  But I'll let you know if I 
find out anything different.  Thanks...KR
