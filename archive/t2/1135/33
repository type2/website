I like the "in theory"!  I have full coverage too, and the underwriters I
talked with all said document as much as possible because its up to me to
prove the value in the event of disaster. (I know policies vary state to
state). Sounds like you got a good appraisal!  I'm still hunting for someone
here.
 
James: I know how you feel - the bus I lost years ago was hit by a woman too
busy eating french fries and rolled me.  It was a paint job away from show
worthy!  I got 3k for it after months of fighting (back then 3k was a solid
price for it).
Good luck
