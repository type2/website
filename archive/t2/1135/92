Snow? What's that? We were moving leaves and wearing shorts today.

Very good questions. I'm anxious to hear the list answers.

I suspect that the air entering the engine fan was assumed to be clean 
b/c it is supposedly all coming through the big air vents near the top 
of the body corners. It is then sent through the alternator and then 
exhausted back into the engine compartment and mixed with the new air. 
Some of it would recirculate through the alternator. This air would 
presumably cool the alternator which is in close proximity to the 
exhaust and help dry the interior of the alternator if case there was 
any moisture from driving on wet roads (or fording creeks in rural 
countries). Of course it all depends on all that 35 year old rubber.
