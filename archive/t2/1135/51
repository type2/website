Subject: Handy well built folding shovel

I have one of these (mine is not Swiss but a Canadian Military Surplus) and they are extremely handy to have while taking up very little space. Because they are the real deal and not a cheap replica, they are virtually indestructable. Thought I'd pass along this one.
