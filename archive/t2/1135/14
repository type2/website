some regular insurance companies do the same, I have Met Life auto 
insurance and it has allowed me to have a declared value policy on my van 
the cost is quite reasonable.   because my bus is a daily driver I can't 
get vintage car insurance on it because in my state at least they limit 
the amount of driving you can do with their insurance.
