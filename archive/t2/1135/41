The time has come for me to move on.  I have had this van for almost 20 years, and gained a lot from the experience.  About three years ago, I began a muffler replacement.  In the removal process, I snapped a manifold stud on the head, I removed the head, had the stud replaced, but never got the motor reassembled.  It was in ok running shape three years ago, but now the motor is disassembled.  I have concluded that I will never get around to reassembling the motor, so it is time to move on.
