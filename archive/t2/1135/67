Subject: WTB: Collapsible/adjustable rods for the front childs cot

I'm on the hunt for a set of the front collapsible/sliding style cot rods that were on the later Westies. My PO gave them away because he didn't know what they were for!!! If anyone has some at a reasonable price I'd be happy to take them off your hands. If you want to sell the canvas as well, that would be fine, I'll just have a spare. :-)
