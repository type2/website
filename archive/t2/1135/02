Subject: Re: [T2] '74 with automatic transmission leaks

Thanks for the replies. Below is what we have found so far to help prepare.

1. The repair manual from ATSG for the 003 and 010 automatic transmissions. I
was unable to find physical copies, though FedEx Office quoted ~ $55 to print
it (80 pages.)

2. Gasket rebuild kits from Makco. These are not very descriptive as far as
what they come with. We have taken delivery of them though and will be making
an itemized post of all the contents, their part number, and an image, to the
best of our ability.
