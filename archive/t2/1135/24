Subject: timing a 68 bus

Hey Everyone,
I just wanted to find out if there's anything special about timing a 68 
bus.  My friend has one and he's gonna switch out the points for a 
Pertronix and needs a hand timing it.  I briefly looked at the engine 
and I don't remember seeing a timing scale so I was wondering if there's 
some other technique I don't know about for timing those.

thanks,
Mike
