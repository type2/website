Aren't you opening up a can of worms!

This has been brought up frequently. The FI enthusiasts will be here
shortly. They swear by it, and it is the most popular solution here.

But before they get here, I'll just share a story from my mechanic
friend who used to work for VoA, and now has his own shop.

He said that when he used to work in SoCal, they could always tell
when an air-cooled VW had a marginal clutch when they switched to
carbs because the additional power would make the clutch slip.

I used to do FI, but got tired of it. I've run dual Dellortos and
Weber ICTs, but I decided the Weber progressive is my favorite and
just installed one on my current bus.

John
