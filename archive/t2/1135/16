Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Replacement Value

Having just gone thru this with my "new" bus, you need to be careful with the
fine print on your policy.  While most companies will insure a bus for a
declared value, it does not necessarily mean that is the amount you will
received if your bus is totaled.  I talked with many companies and they all
said the same.  As stated previously, vintage insurance limits the milage
and requires a garage, but they also won't allow camping (which is why I own a
Westy to begin with!).  Basic recommendation from various forums (archives) is
to document everything you possibly can, in terms of condition and money
invested, i.e. lots of pictures and receipts.  Appraisals would be very
useful.  Also remember, that if someone runs into your bus, you'll need to
prove to their insurance company how much it was worth - they won't care about
your declared value policy!  I just found my 4" thick folder from just such a
fight years ago.  If anyone has found a company
 that truely insures for an "agreed value", in which you are remimbursed the
value on the policy, let us know!
