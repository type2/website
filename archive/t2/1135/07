It's possible that it's the same, since it covers both the 003 and 010, and is
80 pages. While it's published by ATSG, it thanks VW directly for the
content.

Looking at the URL's I provided, they specifically call for the 003 with year
model's between 1969 and 1975. On paper, this sounds correct. Fingers
crossed.
