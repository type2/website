Subject: The scissor jack workout

I've been getting a lot of emails lately wondering what I've been doing.
Well, I'm proud to announce that I've created a new upper body fitness program
using the genuine VW scissor jack:

Witness the results:

- For just pennies a day you
can enjoy unparalleled upper body strength.
- Be the life of the party.
-
Impress your friends.
- Lift up the car without using the jack!

Seriously
though, I'm absolutely shocked the cast end nut where the upper and lower arms
meet has completely stripped.

Please look at your own jack for galling of the
screw threads.

In my case, the jack seized at the top of its normal travel
which at least have left me stuck at the side of the road.

I keep this jack
in a box at all times and I've only used it about a dozen times.
