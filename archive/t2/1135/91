Subject: Alternator 'air flow' rubber elbow

Hi, Just wondering, if the air flow goes from air intake fan, through the
engine, does that rubber elbow out of airflow front shroud, pass air from air
shroud to alternator?  If so, where does same air ..exit the alternator?
Reason for asking, my rear alternator 'cap', has a gasket,so assume to seal,
and there was sludge and gunk in that housing, so I wondered, would the
alternator be 'cleaner' without that 'air elbow', and seal exit hole from air
housing, as well as inlet for alternator?  What was the 'thinking' when that
was built that way, since whatever comes into the front air intake
orifice,(like water, dirt, 'stuff'), would seem to take a path to alternator,
and if so, why did 'they'not put a filter on it?  Sorry, have just finished
shovelling my drive way with that 'foreign' substance called snow, and perhaps
way tooo much blood flow to brain!
Cheers
Scoggy
