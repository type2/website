Subject: Re: [T2] carb problem

I have a fuel pressure regulator between my pump and my progressive carb, 
without which my engine ran so rich that I calculated about 12 miles/gallon. 
Sheesh!!

Well, it doesn't have to be much.  I'm sure I've got plenty based on
what's flowing out of the pump.  The Weber doesn't want but three or
four pounds of pressure if I remember correctly.  I do have a new
pressure guage that I never got around to putting in and I may do that
this weekend.  This is the best electric fuel pump I've ever had on it.
And I've gone through several.  Especially before I got the tank cleaned
and lined.  This one's quiet and reliable.  But I'll let you know if I
find out anything different.  Thanks...KR
