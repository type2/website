You can secure that pin with fuel-resistant epoxy. At FLAPS looks for
the stuff that repairs holes in gas tanks.

If you are still getting junk out of the carb, you need to get a
gallon dip can of Berryman Chemtool carb dip. It comes with a basket
to hold the small parts and will properly dissolve the junk in the
carb. Still, you have to use compressed air to blow out the passages
after rinsing.

It's not possible to have no suction at the secondary barrel unless
the linkage arm is disconnected and the rear throttle valve is not
opening at all.
