Anybody have a working Weber progressive they could part with at a 
decent price?  My source fell through as he thinks that it has been 
stolen.  Possibly by a family member!  I need it a) as a quick 
replacement for what I have and b) as a back-up to dual carbs or stock 
FI or maybe even Megasquirt that I install later when I have more free 
cash.  But I need something quick and as I'm working on buying a 
business, I need to conserve my cash right now.  I do have a good 2.0 
block if anybody needs it.  Might be willing to work some kind of 
trade.  But it's probably expensive to ship very far.  Ciao...
