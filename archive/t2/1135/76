Subject: Gas heater dismount from, 1800cc '74 Westy

I cannot find any info as to how to remove the complete package of the under
floor gas heater in my '74 Westy 1.8L.  Can anyone send me to a site where I
can get help with this, or have you done it before?  Nothing in either my
Bently or other manuals I have.  I want to remove the whole thing, not just
parts of, and wanted to find out before I start, whether there are some things
involved that could make the exercise problematic.  Thanks
Syd
