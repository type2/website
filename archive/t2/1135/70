Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a 1970 fuse panel

As Scott Lyons said, make sure its the Greyish looking one and part
number 411 937 505 A is the one cast into the plastic.  The 505 B is
for 1971 models ONLY.  Very hard to find, I've only seen 2 real good
used ones for sale in the past 7 years.

I do have a couple of NOS 1971 Fuseboxes for sale if and when
anybody's interested - $80 each including shipping via Priority Mail.
Inquiring minds pmail me for payment details.
