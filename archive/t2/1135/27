Subject: Re: [T2] Carb upgrade

Jeff,

I just went through this with a '73 motor in a '75 bus. You are doing  
the right thing ditching the Solex carbs. They are, ahem, crap.

For simplicity, run a set of small 40mm Webers or 36mm Dellortos. Be  
sure to run a SVDA dizzy for best drivability.

Avoid the center mounted progressive unless you are broke and don't  
mind their freezing issues and lack of top-end power.

I am a huge fan and advocate of Fuel Injection. But in this case, I  
wouldn't recommend FI because you don't have the mounting provisions  
for the computer, fuel pump and air cleaner stand and a couple of  
other brackets that escape me right now. It would turn into a bigger  
project than what you most likely are ready for. Plus, it would be  
hugely expensive if you don't have a perfectly running parts bus to  
pull all the EFI stuff off of. Even more expensive if you pay someone  
to do it.

Good luck! If you need a line and some FAQ's on Dellortos (my favorite  
carburetors on earth) contact Jim Hayden at the Aircooled Ranch.
