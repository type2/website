Subject: ignition key code

I forgot to give details to get the code.  The ignition lock must be removed
from the housing to see the code.  It is necessary to drill an small hole
directly in line with the top of the keyway, and back 1/2" from the edge of
the lock housing.  You're just drilling through the pot metal, so go easy.
With the hole drilled, you can depress the retainer and pry the lock cylinder
from the housing.  The code is on the lock cylinder.
