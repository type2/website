Subject: Re: [T2] timing a 68 bus

Yeah, the Type 1 engine is intended to be static timed, so it just has
a mark for TDC for valve adjusts and 7.5 BTDC for static timing
(reference mark at the case split line). Of course, you could use a
timing light for 7.5 at idle. For dynamic timing at full advance, you
can guesstimate the required 27 degrees as approximately the point
where the fan belt intersects the engine pulley, or you can print out
a degree wheel from the internet.
