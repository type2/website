Have you tried to replace the broken part with some epoxy? Yesterday in 
my shop at TTU I helped a kid fix a stripped hole in a KTM motorcycle 
casting with an epoxy he bought at the flaps. Comes in a roll (tube), 
you cut off a bit and roll it between your fingers until mixed, apply 
and then in 5 mins it is setting up. Seems to be hard as a rock when it 
sets up with good adhesion. My idea is that you could replace what broke 
off and then shape it once cured with a Dremel tool.

I don't remember the brand but it is usually up next to the FLAPS 
computers where they look up parts.
