Subject: Type 2 drivers side rocker panel area metal

How are people repairing this area? There does not seem to be a left hand side rocker panel available or am I missing it? All I see is the big 6 or 8" wide complete side that goes from the front edge of the back wheelwell to the front seam just behind the door. Using this means you lose the bottom rocker panel seam, and the rear vertical seam just in front of the rear tire.
