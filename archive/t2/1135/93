Subject: Intake Manifold

Hey, guys.  Vacuum leak is at least one of the rubber boots on the 
intake manifold.   I can feel it with my finger.  I'm wondering if I 
have to pull the manifolds loose from the block to get those things off. 
  It doesn't appear that there's very much room and a guy who walked by 
while I was working on it has a bus and he says it's easier just to drop 
the engine to do it.  I should do that anyway as it would give me a 
chance to do a lot of other little things but I'm worried about the 
weather turning cold and I don't have a place to work on it inside. 
Suggestions?
