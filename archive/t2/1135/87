Kevin,

To find a vacuum leak you need to spray something flammable (eg. WD40) around
the joints of the manifolds leading to the cylinders that aren't running until
you hear the revs rise. I had problems with the manifold sealing to the head
and with the rubber boots. It can be tricky to find them sometimes!
