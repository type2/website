Sure--

There are 3 mfgs. that I know of--

(1) Vosschemie zinc spray--made in Deutshland--a real heavy solids weld
through primer--

(2) Auto tech Rust Sheild-
Made in the USA--and a good heavy zinc rich weld through primer.

(3) 3-M Weld Through Primer--pretty runny--the spray nozzle always plugs
up in these cans--low solids, is not as good as the others.

Vosschemie, and Auto Tech aslo make a fine waxoyl type undercoating that
can be used after the welding and painting is done--on the bottom /
back side.

Avaliable at any of your better automotive body shop / painting supply
houses.

Care give any details of this product? Name, manufacturer, where to get
it? 

Yep--Chris is correct on this one-- 
There is a weld through seam sealer that comes in an aerosol can-- Spray
it on all the butt welded joints and weld-- It'll keep the welded area
from rusting at the seams. It's zinc rich and prevents corrosion.
