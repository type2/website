Ah... well, yes... but I was actually thinking of looking it over (the web
diagrams aren't very detailed) to see if I could add it to the number of
VW-related masters sitting on the work table next to me at this moment.

I'm currently doing a long mirror mount which should fit both the
bayonet-style and the screw-style mounts, and a set of the red/blue heater
lever handles.  I'd look into doing the older-style heater levers, but I
don't have access to them at present, just a picture in a manual.

I test fitted one of my repro heater levers last night, and it fit
perfectly.  I just need to finish the masters and create new molds.

So, if anyone has a clip they'd let slip, I'm hip.  And that ain't no lip.
