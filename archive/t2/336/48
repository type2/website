Check the Bentley. Use what it shows for your engine, nothing else.

Negatory. At 0.2mm wear over spec, replace them. Never regap worn plugs. 
Rounded electrodes do not offer nearly as good a spark as new plugs with 
sharp edges. You can expect 2 or 3 or more miles per gallon better with new 
plugs.
