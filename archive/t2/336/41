Subject: Engine rebuild help?

hi,

the engine on my '76 westy (actually a '74 engine) recently blew it's 
main and pushrod seals. i'm going to rebuild it soon and would like to 
know if there's any parts i need outside of the engine gasket kit they 
have at bus depot.

also is there anything else i should be doing to the patient while it's 
on the table? i plan on replacing the fuel sender while everything is 
out... but anything else i should consider?

many thanks,
pete
