I will admit I don't know. My guess is that the shiny side goes down. I 
just note a few occasions in the past when I have seen original installs 
that was the way they were. Even that is not proof positive because the 
seal could have been removed/replaced. I can't think of any reason why one 
way might be better than another. There has to be a reason. Otherwise, why 
would they add the cost of the extra treatment on one side????
