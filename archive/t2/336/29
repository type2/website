I had the same problems with the local Honda dealer (we drive a '99 CR-V as 
the family hauler).

I got on line and looked around and saw that there were a few wholesalers 
that could sell me stuff at exactly 50% of the dealer. I'm sure there is a 
markup built in or they couldn't stay in business but the roof rack was 
$150 vs. just over $300, cassette player was $125 vs. $225, etc.

I tried to approach the local dealers to see if they would price match and 
they were no go.

A couple of friends worked/works the parts counters in dealers and there 
was usually a markup over the supplier's price, and sometimes a markup on 
the parts when they were "sold" to the repair department. That varied from 
50% to 100% with a total markup approaching 200% in some cases.

Another source would be the Bus Depot. Ron can get VW parts (real ones) 
sometimes at reasonable prices.
