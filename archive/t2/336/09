The key to long engine life is making sure. Verify all measures. The 
primary question is, is it spec?? It takes better than a carpenters rule. 
Verify deck heights and combustion chamber volumes for both sides. This 
insures compression ratio and balance, both very important for long engine 
life. Better to spend the money for a skilled VW machinist. NW Con Rod in 
Seattle is one. Berg is another. It takes very little EXTRA 
time/money/skill to enhance specs, and is worth every EXTRA penny/minute to 
be sure. This is particularly true of German designs, and more especially 
true of VW air cooled design. There are certainly more than 100 things that 
must be right in assembly of these motors, meaning if you are 99% right, 
you will have failure. It is not just less compromise, it's no compromise 
at all that is required to insure success.
