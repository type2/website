I have on a few occasions gone right to the local distributor of a part
and bought it direct, I also discovered that some parts of German vehicles
are also used in the big commercial truck industry.  I once needed an A/C
relay for my M*** B*** and to get it from the local dealer was $79 what a
little relay?  so called Bosch New York and found out my local distributor
was a Large Truck dealer, called them and got the same part, less blue box
for $3.79  bought two.  plugged it in and work for several years until I
got rid of that thing in favor of my bus...still have the second relay
around here someplace.

  HOWEVER for our older vehicles this is more often than not the exception
rather than the rule...most of my business goes to the various sellers who
are also on this list
