Not the fanciest nor the best, but entirely adequate for my needs. I can remove it from the bus in less than a minute and thieves don't give it a second glance.

If I had it to do over again, I would use a smaller woofer (10" instead of 12") and probably made it a bit taller and shorter (front to rear).  As another listmember mentioned, a port would probably improve the sound somewhat.
