Subject: AIRS (sorta) in New Mexico

Hi Folks;
   My daughter is in college in Socorro New Mexico, called today and it
seems her '77 Baja has developed a (probably) fatal engine problem.
Massive oil leak, coming from the seam in the case forward of the oil
strainer. We rebuilt this engine (1600 DP) in 1998 using quality parts
and it has been a strong runner for five years, carrying her zillions of
miles up and down mountains, on 75 mph interstates etc.

   She graduates in May.

   Does anybody in New Mexico or nearby have a decent used 1500-1600
engine that you could part with for a reasonable amount of money? She
can handle the install herself (bribing a couple large friends with food
and beer), she knows her car.

P'mail me if you can help.

Thanks,
Art Lynch
Pearson, Texas
('bout a thousand miles away from my daughter's ailing VW.)
