Subject: Info about free hat with purchase of Bus

Does anyone have information and a picture of the free hat that came with an
60s? bus?

One sentence in a VW advertising book was dedicated to this hat. Apparently
the free hats provided a logistics problem since they came in a variety of
sizes.


Cheers,
