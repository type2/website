All you've got to do is find a matching pump that makes the same pressure 
and volume. I too have heard there is a Ford truck with the same needs.

Most better (pro) auto parts stores (not supermarket FLAPS manned by 17 
year olds) have catalogs that show the specs on their parts and should have 
a page or two of pressure / volume specs on their pumps.

You can cross reference this over to a Ford vehicle and buy from them or a 
junkyard. Of course be sure to buy SOMETHING from the FLAPS to justify 
their time with you.... I use the same store (NAPA) and an Advance Auto 
(used to work there, have friend there, and yes I see it as a supermarket 
FLAPS) and they don't mind me flipping through their catalogs. Requires 
none of their time until they have to pull a part for me.

If you do some junkyard shopping be sure to get a bit of the wiring so you 
can slice that into your VW.
