As I recall back in the mid 70's when there were a lot of these engines
and buses around (and I worked at a VW dealership one summer) the seal
was of a slightly different design than it is today.  As I remember it,
rather than two "squared off" sides as they seem to be today, one side
was more rounded, kinda like a half circle (but not quite).  That
slightly rounded side was on the top and the squared off side (which was
shiny) faced the bottom.
