Subject: Re: [T2] Mystery Wire on 72

THis could be for the Vacuum Advance Cutoff.  This is connected to a switch 
on the transmission that looks like the reverse lights switch and is supposed 
to be connected in the engine compartment to a temperature switch.    This 
switch is supposed to, and I'm quoting from Bently here, do this:  "Except in 
fourth gear, the vacuum advance is cutoff whenerver the air temperature is 
above 12 C (54 F).  This means that the vacuum advance is only effective in 
fourth gear and in all other gears at temperatures below 12C (54F)."

I can't tell you what the color of this wire is since it was missing from 
mine when I bought it.

Hope this helps!
