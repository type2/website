The value of time to replace the plug is worth more than the cost of the 
plug. If you're going to pull them anyway for inspection, then the time to 
replace with new is nada. I pull my plugs once per year, less than 2000 
miles, and normally replace then every two years. I like perfect ignition 
at all times, never ever an issue. Last time I turned a key on a vehicle of 
mine and it didn't start RIGHT NOW, it was due to a corroded battery cable 
(lack of maintenance). That was over 20 years ago. Note that is ZERO lost 
time/money due to failure in over 20 years. DM dangded it, it works if you do.
