Subject: Trip to Calif.

Well, there's good news and bad news...the good news is that we're planning 
a trip from Woodland Park, CO to Palo Alto, CA for my father-in-laws 80th 
birthday party. The bad news is that unless the bus is back from the shop 
(transmission issues) we will have to travel in the Nissan Pick-up.  Can I 
still take advantage of the AIRS list? Our planned route is 25 south to 
Albuquerque..40 to Flagstaff, 17 to Phoenix, 17 to 8 to San Diego and then 
up the coast to Palo Alto.  Return trip will be through Calaveras County, to 
50 and onward to Colorado.  It will be my husband, myself and our 2 
well-behaved and beautiful dogs.  Anyone have a 
front-yard/back-yard/driveway we can aprk in along the way?  Departure date 
is April 7th, party on April 13th and return trip beginning April 14th.
Thanks!

Mary and Matthew
