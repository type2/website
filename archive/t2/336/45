Subject: Re: [T2] yet another FART...Glossy Side Up or Down?

Ummm...

My engineering instinct<grin> said that it is a lot easier to install
shiny side up...and looks better to me....since I look at it mostly from 
the engine compartment rather than the underside.

Guys, I swear that the ones I worked on back in the mid 70's were
shiny side up from the factory.

Cheers, dave
