Subject: Westy cabinet use

I have an '80 Westy.  I started out with a 66 Kombi and have had all
sorts of things over the years including an 87 Syncro.  My use of the
standard Westy cabinets is pretty haphazard.  Things go where they go
because I happened to put something there once.  
1)The metal tray at head level over the sink gets medical supplies: Like
toothpaste, sunblock, asprin, bandaids, keys, pocket knives, candles,
matches.
2) The cabinet to the left of the open rear hatch gets all my spare
autoparts: spark plugs, timing light, oil filters, air filters,wd-40
etc.  Mainly because they are handy there when I'm working on the motor
3)The cabinet over the rear seat gets my service manuals...Bently etc as
well as plastic boxes full of spare parts and also curtains and swim
fins.
4) The hanging cabinet gets tables, tennis rackets, rollerblades, and
sometimes a hanging shirt or two..
5)  the two storage areas to the left of the stove and over the water
tank, get food and pots and pans.  
6)  The lower storage area to the left of the refrigerator gets my pee
storage bottle and battery charger.  The area under the sink, gets food
and kitchen junk, like napkins, cups and such
7)  Under the rear bench I get a tent, beach chairs, hoses, rope tent
stakes, umbrella, jack, extra camp stove.
8) I have a self made console between the seats for cd's sunglasses and
beverage.
9)  I keep a moderate sized tool box on the floor behind the passenger
seat and when camping it goes out under the van.
10)  I have a couple of extra ice chests for food storage and normal ice
chest purposes.
  I could really use some good input on how other people organize their
westies for camping/living.
