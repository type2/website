Mike (TGIF):  the casting fool....

How about a repro'd  HORN BUTTON with an embossed/or/engraved . . .

1) Wolfsburg Crest

2) Funny Type 2 bus logo/picture ('tear bus' for the splittie crowd that are 
over on the other side of the  fence)

3)  Script saying   EJECT  or  PULL  or  LOJAK    or   TYPE2(-at-)TYPE2.COM

4)  an inverted VW logo that would only show correctly when viewed thru the 
windshield, or when the wheel is turned 180 degrees  (OK, also viewed 
correctly when the wheel is turned 540 degrees, or 180 + (360*X) degrees.)

5)  the stick shift pattern so the valets at the Hilton or Ritz can find 
reverse...

6)  Road Kill count . . .

7)  'Get out of jail free' dude from Monopoly

8)  Anything scribed in braille

9)  A note saying   'The key is under the mat'

10)   {{  Anyone else ? ? ?  }}
