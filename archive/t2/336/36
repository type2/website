Subject: Re: [T2] Westy cabinet use

I have a 72 Camper that I've removed the jump seat and the sink/fridge combo 
from.

Under the back seat: Sleeping bags, blankets, pillows, awning/poles, paper 
towels (full rolls also server to hold seat up when rooting around), 
electrical cord, electric heater.

Behind the back seat: Two tubs that hold almost all of the rest of my 
camping gear, a grill2go, my side tent/poles.

Stuffed behind spare tire in the back: Jumper cables, oil, brake fluid 
etc...

Bin over the rear seat: paper goods, diapers, magazines.

Closet: Rain suits, boots, sandals, smaller spare parts, a few flannel 
shirts, radio, and anything I find rolling on the floor.

Rear cabinet hatch: Clothes, curtains, bug nets.

I removed the spice rack from my fridge and mounted it behind the passenger 
seat: Keep soap, sun tan lotion, bottle koozies, cards and such there.

Center console: Same as most - CDs, maps, flashlights, fire extinguisher, 
fig newtons.

I store my indoor/outdoor carpter up over the front seats, where the top 
folds down.

Behind the front seats: dog food/bowls, bag of ropes.

I also carry a step stool/tool box that rides behind the driver seat.

All of this stays in the bus at all times. The only thing I add for a trip 
is the family, one cooler, and dogs.
