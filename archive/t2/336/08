CC both sets of heads after fly cutting them to the
same depth so they will be close. Make sure that you
have clearnce so that the cyl's will make a air tight
fit without the sholders hitting. check your
compression to make sure it's not to high, try for 7
to 7.3 to 1. Use cyl' base shims to set the deck
hight. Good luck with it, Phil
