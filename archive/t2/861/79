Subject: Re: [T2] stereo

I had a Kenwood that fit perfectly. well, almost. I was able to feed
it up to the opening from behind and was held in place by a couple
brackets I made. I had to fit it just right because it was one of
those flip face stereos. The cool part was that I was still able to
put the old block off face in the hole as a theft deterent, after I
cut off the post that holds the clip. worked great. unfortunately that
bus is no longer on the road and that stereo is no longer in my
possession. someday that bus will drive again, and tunes will flow.
good luck with the hunt.
