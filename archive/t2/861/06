Subject: Wiring Question

Hello all
I have a 68 sunroof bus that i am restoring and it was
missing most of its wiring harness. I had a parts bus
that is a 71 and so i took out the wiring harness out
of it and put in my 68. My question is how to hook up
the brakes?? Where the 71 had two - three post sensors
the 68 has three - two post sensors.....
can the wiring from the 71 be configured to work on
the 68?? What is throwing me is on the 68 schematics
there is a green wire going to the brake sensors to
the emergency flasher relay where as on the 71
schematics there is a green wire but it goes from the
fuse box to the Emergency flasher switch.....wiring is
not my deal. 
thanks for the help
