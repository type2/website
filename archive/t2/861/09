Rus -

Actually, it's easier than it looks (yeah, I know, all those wires, where do
I put them all?).  Keep in mind that the 71 harness is tailored to a 12 fuse
style Fuse Box, rather than the 10 fuse style Fuse Box of the 68.  So some
creative engineering is needed to set the wires in appropriate spots.

On a 68-69, there is a Black wire running from Terminal 81a on the Warning
Light.  On a 71, this wire is Red.  Take the Red wire and connect it to one
of the terminals on the warning switch.

On a 68-69, there is a Black wire that is jumpered from the Warning Switch
to one of each terminal on the 2 Stoplight Switches.  On a 71, this does not
exist, so you need to duplicate this using a portion of your old harness.
Using the 68-69 diagram, be sure to duplicate this and be sure that a jumper
wire runs from the last terminal that is connected (use a 2 male to 1
female, also called a "piggyback" terminal) to Fuse #1 where in turn it
jumps from that fuse to Terminal 15 on the Flasher Box (this is a Black
w/Green & White Stripe Wire).  NOTE:  This applies to Early 68s with the 9
terminal Flasher Box (to Vin 2x8 098 285).  If you have a late 68 with the 4
terminal flasher, then just run from the Stoplight Switch terminal I
mentioned above to Fuse #1.  The idea here is to provide power to the
Warning Light Switch (as well as the Stoplight Switches) then to the Warning
Light, when the Ignition is turned on (Fuse #1 is hot when Ignition Switch
is ON).

In addition, on the Warning Light, be sure Terminal 15 is connected to Fuse
#1  (on the 68-69, this is also a Black wire, on the 71 this is also Black),
so that power is provided to the light so that it turns on when you test the
light by pressing on it's lens.  There is also a Brown wire that runs from
the Warning Light to a Grounding Tree on the Instrument Pod - be sure to
have this installed as before, other wise the light won't work at all.

Now I'm gonna ask a question.  Does your 68 have the 9 terminal flasher or
the 4 terminal flasher?  With a early 68, you may find it easier to convert
to the later 4 terminal flasher and the appropriate emergency switch (211
953 235 A).  If you look closely at the 68-69 Bentley diagram and compare it
with the 71 diagram, you will see that many of the terminal numbers are the
same (example, terminal 54 on the early flasher is the same as terminal 54
on the later switch and so on.  The difference will be terminal S on the
early flasher to terminal + on the later switch.

For additional references, which make for good reading on early 68 flasher
circuits of this vintage I heartily recommend Matt Roberd's write up in the
Type Library at:
