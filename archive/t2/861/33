the gas set up...$459 at HD...Sadly, the local welder's supply house wants
$650 for the same set up, but in two boxes...I asked 'em if they'd take $500
but they declined my offer...;-(
I put up a flier at the supply house but all I got were offers for very used
220v
units and a "really good deal" on a welder and trailer (in case I wanted to
go
into bridge repair... ;-(
Yeah, I know about the ones at Harbor Freight...But even if everything "will"
be Chinese made, I'd like to give us locals a chance at keeping their jobs...
BTW, keep an eye on Milwaukee Tools...Good chance they may be moving to
the East, since they've been bought by the same big conglomerate that runs
the Ridgid woodworking tools... ;-(
