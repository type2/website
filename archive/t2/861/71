Subject: Re: [T2] front curtain

Hi Howard,

I will second that motion. Sewing experience is not required to  
create a workable front curtain for your bus. Mine was made using  
fabric I bought at Walmart and the seams were put in using iron-on  
fabric adhesives. I bought some 3/4" round magnets and glued them to  
the corners and now I have three separate curtains... one for the  
windshield and one each for the windows in the front doors. Total  
cost was under $20 and much less than two hours labour.

Happy trails,
