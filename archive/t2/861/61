I totally agree with James. After extensive reading and shopping I have
settled (and not bought) a Lincoln SP175+ 

It is the smallest 230v machine. I own a 120 volt import wire feed
welder and frankly it is not up to much work. The duty cycle is too
small and it's thermal overload kicks in right when I have a good weld
going. It has very limited adjustments. The pinch roller bracket for the
wire is made of plastic and flexes.

Buy at least a 230v machine and short of welding shops and cranes you'll
do just fine. A friend built a tube chassis for a custom car with his
with good results. He did overheat it once so beware of it's duty cycle.
I think it is about 20%. 

Like James said though go talk to the professional welding suppliers.
Yes Lowe's and some of the other retailers have this welder but unless
the price is hugely higher at the local pro welder shop, I'll be buying
it from them for the support after the sale (which I generally don't
need but might with this tool). Time on a MIG with small wire is what is
holding my projects up right now. May rent one, may buy one in a few
months if I can get my budget to support it- I dunno.
