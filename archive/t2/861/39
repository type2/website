Subject: Another welding question..

     I never thought to ask the list about this until I read Tony's post.  I 
have a Lincoln Handy Mig.  I have been pretty happy with it but I wish I had 
saved up for a  lincoln 100 or something slightly better.  My only real 
complaint is that that wire speed is not infinately adjustable, it uses 
toggle switches for the wire speed and a knob for heat.  It makes it hard to 
dial things in just right.  I got it used, with the gas regulator for $150 
so I can't complain too much.
     Anyway, the wire feed motor pooped out on me just the other day.  I 
asked Lincoln and they only offer the whole assembly, not just the motor.  
That's around $150 (MSRP) depending on how much their local distributor 
jacks up the price, Lincoln doesn't sell direct.  Is there a source for 24V 
DC motors that I could use to just replace the motor?  Anybody know of a 
cheaper way to fix this?  Should I just save up a couple hundred more than 
the $150 for the new wire feeder and buy a new lincoln 100?

   Any opinions appreciated!
