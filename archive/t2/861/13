And therein lies the problem.  In all of the reference materials I've
collected over the past 30+ years and sifting thru all of Thom's wonderful
diagrams on his site, I have yet to find a correct USA Late 68-69 Wiring
Diagram.  I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it must be buried in some
musty, dusty Factory Workshop Manual of the era that never saw the light of
day in a subsequent Bentley Publication, much less Clymer or Chilton.  But
the hunt goes on......
