Thanks for everyone's help negotiating that tranny problem. I called every junkyard in the rust belt and no one had the gearbox I need. I tried the hitting the gas with the brake on in gear and it didn't pop the clutch out. I was going to try changing the fluids today, but a really tall hippy guy saw me working on it and offered me $300 cash for the broken ride. 

He said that he was going to try and rebuild the tranny himself. I gave him the type2.com address, not if he needs assistance, but when he does. Hopefully he is literate.

In the meantime, I am VW-less.... again.

80 Vanagon Snocone Hoopty R.I.P
80 Vanagon Surfer Cabana R.I.P
74 Westfalia Stock Beauty R.I.P (this one is a big regret)

Until next van- Be well.
