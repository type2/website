Subject: front curtain

OK guys and gals, I'm getting desperate.  Several offered to sell  me a front wrap-around but nobobdy ever actually delivered.  One  guy did respond that he knew he had one but couldn't lay a hand on  it.  I need one before Everybus later this month.  Can anyone  help me?  I don't own a sewing machine and wouldn't know how to  use it if I did.  Somebody, please send me a curtain!   Thanks...KR
