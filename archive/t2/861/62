Subject: Re: [T2] Welders, - techniques for using

Get the gas bottle. I have a flux core machine and it requires too much
heat to get the weld going. By that point my welder is poking holes int
he sheetmetal and warping everything. 

Small wire, gas and lots of test welds... <grin!> 

Have not verified this myself but a friend who ought to know commented
that something in the flux (acid?) creates a problem where paint won't
stick to the welds. Check that one yourself (don't take this as fact).
It does seem to be true on some welds I did on my trailer.
