i only saw one response and I feel your frustration.

Gex has a poor track record. So the quality of their work should not be
taken for granted. It could be fine, but its something to be aware of.
A new carb is fine.

The 009 should work but is not the best choice.

Kooky, and not very good, is my opinion.
The compression on its face shows he doesnt actually know about vw
engines. 115 is good compression. 150 would be way too high. These are
low compression engines by design.

I hope you can get it going before your wife runs out of patience.
My suggestion is to ask if anyone from the list can come have a look.
Beer and the prospect of bus cameraderie is usually enough to entice one
of us.
You might also look at the airs list
http://www.type2.com/~airswork/rescue/index.html
and see if you can make friends with some locals who could help.

There are a lot of things I can think of and probably even more I wouldnt
in post.

I would-
-check valve adjustment.
-check the compression, again, with a good gauge. 115 all round is fine.
-spark, seems to be ok because its starting.
-timing. with the 009 time it static with a lamp to around 7degrees btdc.
if you can get it to run, get a timing light on there and make sure the
advance goes from around that 7 at idle to around 32-35 max advance.
are the wires installed in the right order and to the right cylinders?
are the points set right?
-fuel. flow is unrestricted, ie nothing blocking the outlet of the tank,
filter is ok, fuel pump works. then the carb and manifold. is the carb
adjusted close enough? is the manifold correct, installed right, and has
no vacuum leaks.
-are unused vacuum ports blocked off? since you have a 71 what has been
done about the vacuum for the brake booster?

good luck
i hope we can help you keep the bus in your family.
