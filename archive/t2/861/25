Subject: Re: [T2] Auto Transmission Dilemma

<<I hauled an extremely heavy load of lumber last month and I felt the
transmission slip a little while I was driving. This little slip turned
into a pretty annoying high rev between gears. Starting out was slow,
but once the gear caught everything was fine. >>

Do this prior to getting nervous.
drop the trans pan and look how much metalic shavings are in the bottom
of the pan.

If there is a pile of metalic particles--you've smoked the clutches.

If it's not too bad, take out the filter and clean out the filter
screen, clean out the bottom of the pan --put it all back together and
filthe trans up with Ford Type F.
More grabber's for the clutches, and she might be good to go.

I run type F in allmy GM and VW transmissions.

Crisp, forever shifts, and bullet proof boxes.

How much does this trans guy want to rebuild the whole gear
box--$700.00???

If the trans is cooked --pay the piper and be done with it---

If the Van is a rolling scow--part it out and make some money for your
new ride--: )

Good Luck,
