Hi,

My '78 westy is acting up.  First the stereo power came and went, then one 
afternoon she wouldn't start. Finally got it running and made it home.  I heard 
a clicking like a circuit breaker under the dash. Turn signals were erratic.  
Now I've got nothing.  No lights, no start, no joy.

I took the battery out and had it checked and charged.  No difference.  The 
headlights won't even work.

Help!

Jacques
