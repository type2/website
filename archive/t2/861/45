Subject: Re: [T2] Welders, - techniques for using

So very happy to hear about welders etc, I purchased a used Century mig 
welder with gas attachment, but don't have a bottle. It did come with a huge 
roll of flux core wire however, so I'm contemplating using that. Is there 
anyone who has come across a website that is useful for showing how to weld 
automotive metal using one of these little 110v units? It has variable speed 
wire feed and a high/low voltage setting. Any info/direction would be great!
Thanks,
Courtney Hook
