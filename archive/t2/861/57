If I were you, I would forget Home Depot and mail order and get a welding
machine from a local weldor supply.  Go with a Lincoln or Miller (it's a
Ford/Chevy thing).  Get something bigger than you would need for welding on a
VW bus.  A local supply house will answer your questions, teach you stuff and
get you the right parts.  I find the weldor supply house usually carries a
more industrial version of the same product line than Home Depot, etc.  Harbor
Frieght is great for cheap, disposable tools.  Sometimes they surprise you and
last a long time.  Cheap tools are great.  I love 'em.  I have many.  But a
welding machine is one of those tools you'll want to get the best you can
afford.  You will find a gazillion uses for it you never thought of.  Best of
all, with an old bus is the satisfaction of knowing that you can weld your way
out of any rusty problem. Spend a little more, once and be happy.  Just my
opinion.
