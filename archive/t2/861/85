Some Bosch distributors have electrical connectors on them: early D-jet distributors and the CA electronc ignition distributors.

Aftermarket electronic ignition solutions are designed to fit inside any distributor that has points. The modules mount on the advance plate where the points would normally go.

If you are thinking about putting that Bosch "SVDA" distributor inside your 83 Vanagon, it will work as is but you won't be able to use any of the components from the factory electronic ignition with it. If you drop in a Pertronix then you'll be electronic again.
