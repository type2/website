Now I've got nothing.  No lights, no start, no joy.

Sounds like a loose connection or a faulty fuse. Check that your 
earth lead has a clean and secure connection to the body and if it 
has check where the connection from the +ve side of the battery joins 
to the starter solenoid. The next thing I'd look for is a 
loose/corroded/damaged fuse. I checked mine and found one making an 
intermittent connection (explaining a minor electrical fault) and 
another on the verge of failure. Ended up replacing them all as cheap 
insurance.

Good luck!

Martin.
