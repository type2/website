Subject: Re: [T2] front curtain-DIY

For the SIMPLEST front curtain tie sashcord between the bases of the 
poptop support.  Over this flip fabric wide enough to pull across and 
low enough to reach behind the seats.  Slides nicely behind driver when 
not in user.  For a fancier less in the way of your head curtain, get 
3/4" by 1/8" aluminum from a hardware store. Curve it to match your roof 
and bend about 2" at each end that will allow it to be screwed along the 
top of the door post.  Then sling fabric over it.  My daughter did this 
for her 75, as she has no poptop.
    Me, I can sew and made one for the fron of the 78, triple layered 
for opaquicity  http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin  I also made a 
variation of the behind the seat curtain, adding velcro along the curved 
body under the poptop just to close off light coming over the sashcord, 
which is sewn into a groove in the curtain.  Handy for rest areas or 
using the potti.
