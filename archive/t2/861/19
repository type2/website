That really sounds like a classic vacuum leak to me. It will run when 
cold because the choke richens the mixture but when it goes off the 
mixture is too lean. Some suggestions. As you have a 009 distributor 
you are not using the vacuum port on the carb. Have you blocked it 
off? Is the carb jetted correctly for you application? Idle jet may 
be too small. I'm not familiar with your model bus but does it have 
the rubber boots joining the carb base to the manifold? I had these 
boots with a single progressive weber and found you could get vacuum 
leaks on the engine side of the boots that were inaccessible to 
starter fluid spraying!

HTH
