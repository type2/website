Mark -

What you need is 211 611 741 K, 2180mm, 85.5".  On 71 to Early 73 Type 2s
(To vin 2x3 2044 832), this runs from the Brake Pressure Regulator (211 612
501 A) to the Rear "T".  From the Master Cylinder to the Brake Pressure
Regulator is 211 611 761, 855mm, 33.66".  That's probably where you're
getting confused.  Bus Depot has them (or should).
