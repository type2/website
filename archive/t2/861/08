Subject: brake line length question

I recently got my '71 Camper home (my first ever VW), and am working
on replacing a brake line that burst open while bleeding the brakes.
The line that burst goes from the master cylinder to the rear T
connecter, and as I measured it, it is 86" long.

Now on the busdepot.com site, it says the center brake line is 33.66"
in length, and on the autozone website the longest line they list for
the bus is 60" in length.

Basicaly my question is this:  I know that I need and 86" 3/16" metal
brake line with metric threads, but where do I get it from?  Do I just
go to an auto parts store and tell them what I need?

I'm new to VWs and replacing brake lines, so I'm sorry for the n00b question.

Thanks!
