Subject: Air Flow Meters

First, Thanks to all who have answered my posts with useful knowledge.

Second, let me apologize if this is a stupid question.

Is there a difference between Air Flow Meters for a 1979 California
Bus and a Non-California Bus?

I could only find AFM's at Busdepot, had both new and rebuilt for
hefty amounts of money.  Can used AFM's be swapped out?

Any info truly appreciated.
