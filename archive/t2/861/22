    Prices are going to vary depending on your location. But it should not
cost over "one hours" labor rate, plus parts.
    Say the shop labor rate is - $50.00 per hour, spark plug, spark plug
insert, Heli-Coil, etc $5.00, plus tax, etc. Maybe a total of $50.00 to
$75.00 per.
    If properly installed it should last for years. Be sure and use
Anti-size on the threads of new plugs.
