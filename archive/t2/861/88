Subject: In Dash AM/FM/CD

I have a Pioneer installed in my '72 Bus.  It did take a little cutting and straightening of the opening so it would accept the cage.  You need to get a single DIN opening unit.  I also use a set of metal cased Radio Shack small speaker units under the dash and a set of bookshelf speakers mounted to head rest brackets on the fold down rear seat.  I will "never" cut a door panel to install speakers.

(I know, '72 did not come with fold down rear seats.  After some conversion, mine now does.)
