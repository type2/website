they are dual barrel carbs; one barrel for each cylinder. :-)

Well, I find the stock carbs to be more of a headache than the
available upgrades.

As for mileage, the amount of fuel required to move the vehicle does
not change. What changes is the fact that more power is available, so
if you use it, it will cost more gas.
