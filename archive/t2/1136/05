Subject: Re: [T2] New VW MicroBus in the Works?

When I was in Berlin five years ago there was a VW dealer on Unter den
Linden and I stopped in and took a tour of the new California. It's a fairly
modern version of the Microbus and the cost was something like $80,000 (at
that year's exchange rate) if I remember correctly. They had no plans back
then of exporting them, even though I said they would do well in the real
California :)
