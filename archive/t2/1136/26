Subject: re:AC

Hi Greg,
         The late Mr Hoover mentions in his Sermons something to the effect
of  "do not forget that Berlin is north of Calgary, Canada".  If you really
need ac in a minivan sized vehicle, an air-cooled bus is probably not the
right rig for you.  Sure you can do it, but the engine is already stressed
very hard in a South West US environment just moving the bus. jon

You only really own those things you can carry under both arms at a dead
run... (Robert A. Heinlein)
