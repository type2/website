A few years ago I did a lot of research about insulation, etc.  A very 
effective solution is to bond 1x2" furring strips to the underside of 
the roof and attach foil-backed (aka NASA) insulation underneath.  
Whatever you do, don't glue the insulation directly to the ceiling--you 
need a 3/4" gap for the radiant barrier to be effective.  RV 
elastometric or aluminum-based roof coatings can also lower interior 
temperatures.     Before you go A/C, I would suggest looking into 12v 
exhaust fan systems, running off a second battery with a solar recharger.
