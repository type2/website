 for the radiant barrier to be effective.  RV elastometric or aluminum-based
 roof coatings can also lower interior temperatures.     Before you go A/C, I
 would suggest looking into 12v exhaust fan systems, running off a second
 battery with a solar recharger.

Thanks for the tips Adrian. I've been pondering the foil backed
insulation myself, but didn't want to tar it on (like Dynamat) or glue
it on for rust-prevention purposes.

I presume you want the foil on the side facing the body metal - is that
right?

What do you recommend to set the 3/4" gap consistently - just the
strips themselves, or a spacer?

What's the deal on exhaust fans? I've seen buildings use them. I
thought it was stupid to pull the cool air out of a room running A/C.
Is there a necessary function to exhaust interior air out? How do you
recommend this? Where to put the exhaust fans?

Thanks,

John
