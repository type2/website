Subject: alternator

I posted before, but there must be an 'answer' out there, eh?  If I am running
tubular exhaust headers and no heater'airboxes', there should not be as much
heat generated in area next to alternator as stock setup, so do I really need
that rubber elbow from engine casing to back of alternator for..'cooling'?  I
think not, and can seal up casing, and alternator air intake, without
problems,..no?
Cheers
Syd
