I don't live in the desert but I've found that the bus stays much cooler 
in the summer than a car because of the way it's built.  Sunlight 
doesn't come in directly like in a car with a slanted windshield.  I've 
driven mine up in the 90's and as long as it is not real humid, which it 
shouldn't be out where you live, it isn't too bad as long as you're 
moving.  But stop and go traffic in a city is murder!  You might try it 
a while before you invest in an expensive, horse-power consuming AC 
unit.  Ciao....
