Subject: FS Type IV Baby Dellortos FRD

All this talk of carbs brings to mind, Christmas is coming and they're  
not doing me any good....

I have a pair of baby Dells on type IV/914/912E manifolds. Manifolds,  
carbs, linkage and K&N (type?) air cleaners. Claude's Buggies IIRC.  
Reasonably clean, but they've been sitting for a while and probably  
ought to be gone through. Special to a list member, $200+shipping for  
the pile. TheSamba prices seem to be $250-400 for the same carb setup.

Drop me a line if you're interested and I'll take some pics.

Jim
