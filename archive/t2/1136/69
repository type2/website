I think you're gonna have to do some testing... Get one of those
infrared thermometers (they're cheap at Harbor Freight nowadays) and
take the temp off the alternator casing after a hard run on a bus with
the boxes. Then do it with your tube headers.

I'd put a dollar on the headers actually being hotter, but with
increased flow maybe not. You're gonna have to figger it out I think.

But let us know!
