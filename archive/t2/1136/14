Right. That's the plenum. The carb is attached to it with 4 nuts. Your
brake booster should be attached to it too. There should be a bracket
between it and the engine secured by one of the engine case half
bolts, so you will have to at least loosen the nut if the bracket has
a "U" connector, or release it from the bolt if it has an eye
connector.

It's always best to do the job right with new head gaskets, carb base
gasket, and all 4 boots. If you find any of them are not shot, you can
keep them for a spare.

I've sometimes found that the right and left manifold runners are not
interchangeable, so keep them separate, otherwise you will find
yourself cursing when you try to put it back together!
