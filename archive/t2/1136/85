I know it's a long shot, but have you got anyone near you with a similar van that you could at least try the new AFM in before you ship it back? 

Another thought, is the tranny working fine? I'm wondering if these style of auto trannies can slip like some of my US cars used to do when the tranny was tired? Just throwing out ideas, brake drag, tranny woes, etc.
