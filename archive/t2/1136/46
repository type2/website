Absolutely you can use the 44's. They are completely tuneable for everything; venturii size, jetsize, etc. The most tuneable carbs ever made as far as I'm concerned, with the possible exception of the Dellortos. I guess my question would be why though? The stock carbs in good shape will give you great gas mileage. The webers are more finicky, and you'll be tempted to put your foot into it all the time, which will NOT help your mileage as they are dual barrel carbs; one barrel for each cylinder. :-) Get ahold of Syd Clarke the next time he posts on this list; he is currently set up with 44 Dells on an 1800, but with a big cam and heads and header. I have owned and used Webers on Type 1 engines and they are da bomb. :-)
