Subject: Question regarding an oil leak

I've been reading up on oil leaks for 2 days but was hoping to get some advice
before I dig into this.  I have a '78 bus, pretty much stock, and she just
started to pour oil.  Volume wise I'm talking about 5 or 6 ounces at least
after shut down.  I was hoping it was the oil filter since that's where it
looked like the leak was coming from, but swapping that out didn't help.  My
next step will be to clean up the engine and try to find the source.

My question is, does the fact that my idiot light came on just prior to the
leak starting point to one point of failure over another?

TIA,
chandler
