That site has a lot of good pictures for their systems. They also
illustrate the components I was talking about.

I don't see any prices, though. How much did it cost for the full system, Mike?

The core of the system is all commodity components, so if it is priced
much above that, I see no reason why a quality local shop that
operates at commodity pricing levels can't do as good of a job.

It is a relief, though, to see that they are quoting only 1.25 to 1.5
horsepower to operate the compressor. That must be a benefit of
today's modern, energy efficient compressors. A similar benefit is
seen in housing A/C units where it's much less of a drain on the
electric bill to operate than it used to be.

The key to cooling a large area is a compressor rated at sufficient
BTUs. Of course, if you don't care about the rear area, front blowers
are all you need to make the cab area comfortable.
