When it's truly hot outside, the futility of both window film and 
ventilation fans will become apparent since these devices cannot create 
cooler air where there was previously none.  Those who doubt this should 
come down/up from their extreme Northern/Southern latitudes and spend a 
summer in a place that does actually get hot.  If you have never felt 
the need to turn on your A/C on after dark, then you don't live in such 
a place.  I feel the need to point this out since the original question 
was asked in the context of the South-Western U.S. which does actually 
get hot.
