The most common issue I have seen is need for adjusting the striker
plate to compensate for wear and sag.

Just loosen the two bolts leaving the plate free to move with effort.
The idea is for it not to be so loose that after adjustment it just
falls back.

Then close the door so that the door will reposition the striker plate.

Then reopen the door and tighten the bolts.

Check for correct operation and fine tune your adjustment as needed.
