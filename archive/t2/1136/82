Also, I know this might seem stupid, but did you test to make sure the 
flapper door is actually moving - maybe it got jammed during shipping? 
I would also do a quick test of propping open the flapper door with the 
ignition on to make sure that it's kicking the fuel pump on.  Odd thing 
is that the pump should be running during cranking, so the car should 
run, albeit crappily, even without the AFM connected.  I had my AFM 
stolen once and I was wondering why the car was running so horribly. 
Went to the back to find the whole thing was gone...
