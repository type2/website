Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Manifold

Wow, that's some great information, Andy!  I never would have thought 
that it might have to do with the braking system.  In my plugging 
everything that could be plugged, I plugged the vent hose.  Didn't even 
notice the other one.  It is cold and rainy here today so I can't get 
back on it but I'll try plugging the incoming hose next.  Or just rip it 
all apart and re-do the whole intake system if it comes to that. 
Thanks...KR
