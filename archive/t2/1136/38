Subject: body sheet metal 

I have a 71 Bus Westafilia and have a body shop who is going to repair and
repaint my bus.

The plan is to replace some sheet metal and repaint the entire bus to a
quality job.

This will be a $5000 deal so I want to get the project started off right.


My question is, who is the best source for quality sheet metal.

There are several sites that list the availability for the parts I need.

I just want to get the best and most solid sheet metal I can.


Specifically I have nose damage.

I dont see a full 71 nose available so I plan to get the lower half inner and
outer panels.

I also have rust starting under the windshield so I want to replace that panel
as well.

I know some people us the 73 nose to get the complete panel and either deal
with the new placement of the lights or patch those holes and relocate.

Also needed is the lower rocker panel under the front passenger door on the
right and possibly the left side.

I assume I need the inner and an outer rocker panel.

The rest of the bus is in great shape.

Any advice is much appreciated.

And for the List Members in the US have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Neal
