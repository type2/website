	Watch those period docos on the N. Africa
desert war and you'll add the huge drag from
running in soft sand.

	Being as what day of the week it is, let
me add that the reason the Morris Minor had such
a bulbous nose was the original instruction to
ace designer Issigonis to slap that motor, which
the allies had duly noticed in the Kubelwagen and
then captured the factory of, up the front of a
conventional layout driving thru clutch & gearbox
to prop shaft to rear wheels.  That big fan
housing (which I still have in my '73; check that
Bus Content :-/ ) was to be therefore in the very
front of the vehicle and so the bonnet (yes,
that's what it's properly called <:-|) had to be
unusually bulbous.
	The Poms were then overtaken by childish
chauvinism, feeling unable to admit that die
Krdute  had created a better engine than theirs.
They stupidly reverted to pre-war undersquare
cast-iron, with side-valves which needed grinding
every 5,000 mi or so.  The original Minor would
wear rapidly if cruised around 55 mph i.e near
its max.  What a lemon!  (In fairness, this
unpromising start did lead to a half-way
reasonable car once it got a 1000 cc OHV motor.)
