Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Manifold

Isn't that thing under the carb called the plenum (that the intakes go 
into)?  How does that come off?  I'd like to take it all apart and clean 
everything, put new boots and gaskets on, etc.  I can put my hand over 
the carb and it'll run good.  So I know I'm getting too much air in the 
intake.  I tried taping it today but couldn't tape one of them good 
because I didn't have enough room under the throttle lever on the carb.  
But I'm sure they're leaking around the boots.  I have a hose that comes 
off the back of the plenum and goes back to the tank.  It originally had 
FI.  Tomorrow I'm going to disconnect and plug that to see if I'm 
getting air there.  The hose is in pretty bad shape.  I'll let you know 
what happens.  And yes, I have a fire extinguisher close by.  :)  Sorry 
to be such a mechanical neophyte but I'm a jazz musician trying to 
become a VW mechanic.  And not doing a very good job of it at this 
point.   Thanks....KR
