Was not intimating that you don't need a/c.  Only that if a/c is not  
realistic for financial/other reasons, then good film will
alleviate some of the UV heat inside a bus.

Yes it does get hot in Australia.  Central Queensland regularly sits  
on 40+C (104F) day after day, Western Australia will often see 45C  
(113F) and Central
Australia even higher.   Even Tasmania sees 30 - 35C in summer.
The biggest problem in Tasmania is not the temp but the UV.  15  
minutes in summer will burn your skin red as there is
little ozone over the state.  For this, the film helps.

And yes I would love to put a/c on our bus but as the cost is  
prohibitive down here
