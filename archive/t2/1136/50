You could probably make them work, but they are seriously oversized for 
an 1800cc.  Find out what the smallest venturi size you can get is, if 
it's more than 32mm I would recommend finding smaller carbs.

Other considerations - open element air cleaners are LOUD.  Are you 
prepared to deal with the extra noise? 

I installed Dellorto DRLA 40's with 32mm venturis a few years ago and 
saw an instant 2mpg decrease.  I had a 2-liter and researched venturi 
sizes before installing the carbs.  I wanted 28mm venturis but they were 
not available, in fact I could only find the 32's.  I only noticed a 
very slight power increase but due to laziness I think I ran them for at 
least 10K miles.  Went back to stock and was much happier.  They are 
still in a box in the attic (anyone interested?  Didn't think so).

So in summary:  Loud, bad MPG, oversized.  Not recommended, at least not 
by me.

There are really not any carbs for the type4 engine that I would 
consider "great".  Have you considered FI?
