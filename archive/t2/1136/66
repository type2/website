Subject: Friday, Happy Birthday to Me...

I've got to share a bit of frivolity as it is Friday and this is VW related. 
Today is my 40th, and my wife and parents surprised me by shipping their (mine
by default eventually but unexpected at this point) '77 Westy to me here in AK
from WV for my birthday.  I am awestruck by my wife doing it, and incredibly
happy.  Some on the list have seen this camper, which I bought and gave to
them for their 25th anniversary in the very early 90s with 65k miles, and
essentially one owner in mint condition.  It now has about 90k on it, and is
still basically as new, and will be touring AK next summer of course.  For the
moment it is tucked happily in unfortunately unheated storage, but it is dry
as hell up here so I'm not too worried.  This may have to bump the TR4A from
the garage of course, so we'll see.
 
Dad has the '95 EVC I gave him to replace it, so don't feel too bad for him.
 
John
