Hi, I bought mine "unused used" for $1000 (still in boxes, install never
attempted, from Samba member who sold Bus) apx. 1.5yr ago. A quick call to
Gilmore tells me that new it is $1569.36 with a one year warranty - $695 for
them to install.

On a slight tangent - I've heard some complaints about the condenser w/ fans
decreasing ground clearance, but since I have a propane tank (guessing the
74 Westy does too), it's never been a concern for me.

Some of the shots on the Gilmore site of the late model Bus version aren't
real clear - if anyone wants pics of any of the kit parts, let me know and I
can post some over the next couple days. mike
