Subject: Dual Carbs

  While we're on the subject of dual carbs...

Does anybody have a set of single-port aluminum manifolds for Weber ITC's they
don't need anymore?  I have a set that I have the dual-port mani's for, but I
have switched to a S/P setup now and I'm not satisfied with the performance of
the 30/31 in my bus.
