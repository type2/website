Because something might be funky with the new AFM fuel pump switch *and* 
possibly something with your double relay.

I would unplug the AFM and see if your fuel pump is getting power when 
the engine is cranking (using the key, not a remote starter switch). 
That way you'll know that the fuel pump is running when the key is 
turned to the start position.  If you're using a remote starter switch 
to try and start the car with the AFM disconnected, the engine might not 
start because I don't think the double relay will be getting power to 
run the pump.  Granted, I'm not quite sure how it managed to run with 
the AFM disconnected (like mine did), but I'd have to look at the wiring 
diagram to see what's flowing where...

I would also check to see if the fuel pump switch is working in your new 
AFM.  I can't remember if you said you tested the fuel pump by 
deflecting the flap on the new AFM.
