Hi John,
        Yeah, but a kubel is a lot different to a loaded bus in engine load,
and pretty much ALL military equipment is disposable. What they don't show in
"movies" is the logistics tail needed to keep the point of the spear sharp.  I
bet there wasn't one kubel that went 10,000km without a new engine. 
Especially in the desert.  Most of us would like somewhat longer engine life.
  I doubt the original poster is going to maintain to  Wehrmacht standard, nor
desire the rebuild/replacement schedule that will be needed at those temps. 
YMMV. jon

On the other hand, the Kubelwagen performed very well in Rommel's
Afrika Korps. Get a CHT and pay attention to what Raby says about how
to read it:
