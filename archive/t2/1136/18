Hi Greg,

I purchased a full Gilmore system, but have yet to install it. Jim (I
think?) at Gilmore has been most helpful in answering preliminary questions
- it might be worth at least giving him a holler to see what's available, or
to throw any other questions you might have at him. As with Chandler,
everything I've read said his kits were excellent... The new compressors use
only a few horses (not that we have many to sacrifice), and while I wouldn't
say the kit offers "seamless" integration of the interior parts, I think it
will  be well worth having the cool air.

The reviews of the coolers I've read suggest they aren't great for the SE,
where they add to the humidity of the cabin, but aren't a bad option for the
arid SW.

John mentioned the difficulty of cooling the whole vehicle - I suspect this
will happen with any aftemarket option, but have a few ideas drawn out for
piping/fanning the cooler air aft of the front buckets. Regardless, I expect
it will be a solid improvement over open windows in the FL heat and
humidity.  Good luck! mike
