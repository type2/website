I think you are right, David, if you use your bus as a daily driver.  
It's just not a reasonable proposition to live without AC in the  
southwest.

But, if all you do is cross the desert from time to time, going from  
one more temperate place to another, then some combination of the  
following are worth trying out:

- Fan (combined with drinking lots of water). The fan works, not  
because it blows cold air from some source, but because it  
turbocharges your own cooling system (AKA sweat)

- Personal misters. Try one, see if it does it for you. If so, you can  
make a big one cheaply with a garden sprayer from Lowe's and misting  
nozzle and parts http://www.mistymate.com/misty-mate-repair-kit.html

In any case, as David said, film on the windows really doesn't do much  
unless you already have an air conditioner.
