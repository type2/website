Subject: AFM insanity

anyone who has been following the fuel consumption issue with my 78 auto 
tranny bus knows that I can barely get 7-8mpg have checked, verified or 
replaced everything in the fuel injection checklist.

finally couldn't get a decent reading from the AFM and not having a 
working spare I broke down and bought a rebuilt one from one of the list 
supporters. it arrived and having today off I went out and installed it.
nada., nothing , won't start, so put old one back on and it fired right 
up, switched back to new one, starts (probably on left over fuel from old 
one) and immediately stops. can get it to start with starter fluid but 
won't run. switch back to old one, starts and  runs. new one won't start 
or run.  switched back and forth 4-5 times same results so obviously 
something is amiss with the new one.

have done all the standard stuff checked all the hoses and wires etc.

am I missing maybe something or did I just get a dud and need to return 
it??????


thanks
Bob
