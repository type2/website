Subject: Re: [T2] Question regarding an oil leak

Start at the oil pressure switch.  Mounted just above the filter/cooler,
accessed from the TOP
of the engine just in front of the ignition distributor.  There should be
a rubber "sealing sleeve"
around the switch, with a single wire attached with a spade connector. 
Should be obvious if
that is leaking.  Fairly simple replacement with the proper socket.  Just
make sure that you get
the correct switch (tapered tread or gasket type) and DO NOT use sealer
on the threads as it 
needs a proper ground to work.
