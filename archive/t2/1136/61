We had the front windows tinted to the darkest legally available in  
Tasmania
and the rest including the back window tinted very dark.  It means  
that to see
in on a sunny day is not easy (seeing out is fine) but the heat  
difference is very
significant.

Even the front windows which don't appear that dark make a large  
difference.
Driving with the window down can cause sunburn on the right arm but  
wind the
window up and the burning ceases.

Best money we have spent to keep van cool.
