I bought a 74 Westy (my first) recently and live and travel in the
southwestern part of the US, where summers can be pretty unpleasant. Anyone
have any experience with air conditioning in a Type II ? My internet
searches have shown two companies that offer some form of potential relief -
swampy.net provides evaporative coolers with some dehumidification
modifications and gilmore enterprises that sells ac kits. Any experience
with either of these company's products or otherwise thoughts on air
conditioning a 74 Westy?
