I always felt that the poor air-cooled engine is overworked in hot
weather anyway, so it would be torture to ask it to drive an air
conditioner too.

But if you live in the Southwest, I guess you need it if you want to
use the bus in the summer. I would consider a CHT to be mandatory and
oil temp and pressure gauges to be highly recommended.

You have to consider the large size of the bus and the A/C system
capacity. Drafty seals have to be brought up to snuff, or incoming hot
air will overcome the A/C.

Go to a professional auto A/C installer for a proper system install.
Don't fool around with evaporative coolers or non-professional A/C
setups.

They will mount a condenser with fans under the bus and an evaporator
at under the dash, and hang a second head above the sleeping area
behind the back seat, if you have a pop-top camper. If you have a hard
top, then twin banks of aircraft-style nozzles along the roof are an
option.

The Type 4 engine is made to have the A/C compressor mounted on the
left side of the fan shroud, and the pulley goes behind the fan
pulley, or I should say, in "front" since "front is front". The
compressor belt then goes in "front" of the fan shroud, or behind it
as you look at the fan shroud from the back of the bus.
