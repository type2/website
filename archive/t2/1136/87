Ok.. so we know that the fuel pump is working (as in running, not 
necessarily working in respect to the rest of the system).

And that is controlled by the double relay.  The double relay provides 
fuel while the engine is cranking (assuming the flap hasn't opened 
enough to trigger the AFM fuel switch) and then the AFM takes over in 
regards to powering the pump.

Now, it might be starting with your (original) AFM just because the flap 
is being deflected and that is triggering the pump to run - the double 
relay circuit (or wiring) might still be problematic.

Then that leads me to believe that somethings funky around the double 
relay.  Does that explain the rich mixture, not really, but at least it 
might send us in the right direction.  I would do some testing around 
the double relay with a test probe to see that you have the correct 
voltages on the correct terminals.  If you need help, let me know.
