Subject: 911 conversion parts and free bus stuff in Mississippi

Hi,

I still have some VW parts in storage in Mississippi.

Free for the taking, but must be picked up from 39401 Hattiesburg:
- 1800 cc type 4 engine short block. Needs to be rebuilt.
- 4 bus wheels with bad tires and matching hubcaps
- rear brake drums for bug (I upgraded to disk brakes)

Not free, but can be shipped:
If you're interested in a 911 to bus engine conversion, I still have
most of the conversion kit
For early Porsche 911 (with 6-bolt crankshaft) to VW bus (with
post-'76 bell housing) engine conversion...
KEP flywheel (was $290 back in '96): $200
KEP 2000 lbs, 9" pressure plate (was $140 back in '96): $70
Porsche 911 oil tank and oil lines: $ 100
rubber motor mounts, crossbar and spacers: $100
custom exhaust system: $100

Please p-mail me for any questions, photos, etc.

Thanks,
Sami
