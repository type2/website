I just had an engine kill itself because it lost an oil galley plug that 
is just above and to the left of the oil filter holder mounting.  is very 
difficult to see and about a half inch in diameter but it can completely 
empty the engine of oil in just a few minutes.

no one I have talked to has ever seen this happen on a manual transmission 
bus but once or twice on automatics. that makes little sense but that 
appears to be the record.

a leak of that size must be found before you drive anywhere.

good luck
