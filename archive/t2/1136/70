I'm with Don, my gut reaction is that headers will actually be hotter with no
heater box "insulating" them, but that is a guess.  Cool air is always flowing
through them and dumping heated up at the flapper valves so heater boxes are
likely a lot cooler on the surface than a bare pipe I'm sure.  Get the
infrared thermometer and do some experiments.  For headers wrapping them with
some "header wrap" would be a good idea for efficiency of the engine and
underhood temps whether giving up the cooling duct or not.  Frankly though,
I'd lay more than a buck that getting rid of the duct isn't a great idea.  If
you still have an engine compartment seal/gasket, the cooling air in that fan
shroud blowing into the alternator is loads cooler than underneath air,
particularly in motion with ram air into the engine compartment, and the
stocker low amp alternator of course has no fan to blow more in with, now if
you had a high amp alternator with the fan, maybe...

But let us know!
