Subject: Can I run Weber IDF 44s on a 74 1800cc bus?

I found somebody selling dual Weber IDF 44s, and I am wondering if I
can run those on my 1974 1800cc bus. Its a dual carb, type4 engine.

I'm pretty sure you can run those 44s on a bigger engine, like a 2k -
but am not sure if they would be too big for an 1800.

Thanks,
