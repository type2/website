Subject: Re: [T2] New VW MicroBus in the Works?

VW does have an economical and straightforward avenue that they could
pursue:  modify buses still being built in Brazil and import them into the
US.  These buses are being imported in Great Britain and modified by
Davenport into campers.  See link below.

Anyone know what it would take to make the Brazil buses importable into the
US?  Emissions?
