I just stripped a dpd overhead air conditioning unit out of my 74 bus.
This was an official VW Dealer option in the U.S. You can have it for
cost of shipping. You would need to find a compressor (saw one
yesterday on theSamba), and two 10 ft refrigerant hoses.

As stated above. You should be aware that the compressor will rob you
of around 10 horsepower.
