Have you verified all of the correct resistance test values for the AFM? 
  Have you done that through the harness as well.  I know it's a new 
harness, but that doesn't mean that there could be a bad connection.

Did you also verify (through the harness) that the temp sensor two is 
giving you valid numbers?

As far as electronically, the two things that are going to fumble up 
your fuel is your AFM and your temp sensors.  If you have a full 
throttle switch on your throttle body, that could mess things up too... 
so if you have that switch, verify *through the harness* that it's 
functioning properly.

If I were you, I would go through the harness, pin-by-pin and make sure 
that every connection has continuity from plug to ECU and wiggle each 
connector while you check it.  It will take you half an hour or so, but 
at least you can verify that your harness is in proper working order. 
Then I would test all of the electrical components that influence the 
ECU's mixture control (temp sensors, switches, etc).  What year and 
model is your bus?  I will take a look at the wiring diagram to see if I 
can see what might be messing with you.
