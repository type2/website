Subject: New Bus Front Doors

These have been offered to me by Just Kampers in the U.K. Due to cost I am
uninclined to bring them in just to keep in stock (I don't want to invest
thousands of dollars in doors right now). But I'dl be happy to import them
specifically for anyone who wants them. A nonrefundable deposit would be
required.

Both lefts and rights are available. The cost is $550 per door, plus freight
from PA (ranging from roughly $60 to $140 each depending on where you are).
Shipping beyond the lower 48 states would be cost prohibitive. My current
shipment leaves very soon and will reach me around the end of December. My
next shipment after that is not until spring/summer 2011 and there is no way
to know if they will still be available by then. Therefore, anyone
interested should let me know ASAP.
