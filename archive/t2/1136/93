Johnny Canuck here. (i.e. I live in Canada)
If you are running the vehicle through the winter don't use anything 
except maybe some gas line antifreeze if you live in a humid AND frosty 
location. It's dryer than Arizona in Calgary in the winter (despite all 
the snow) and it is generally not needed here.  If you are storing the 
vehicle for a long time (longer than the winter) perhaps you need the 
stabilizer. My Vanagon is parked in the back yard with a full tank of 
gas (less opportunity for condensation), no stabilizer, with the 
batteries indoors in my basement sitting on wood (not concrete) and 
being float charged.  It takes off every spring from this condition on 
the first try.
