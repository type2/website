Subject: Re: [T2] AC

Reminds me of going to business in Yuma, AZ in the summer back as an engineer
where the local boys on the gun ranges would tell me it wasn't hot cause it
was only 108F or so and it was a "dry heat", they didn't consider it hot till
about 115F.  You could sit a damn can of beer you were drinking down for 30
seconds pick it back up and burn your lip on the can.  But it wasn't hot,
probably didn't need AC unless you were a little pansy like me.  I agree with
David fully, if you think you can cool yourself in some other way in the SW or
don't even need AC, you either grew up in south america where you had 100F and
100% humidity, or are a much tougher person than I.

previously none.  Those who doubt this should come down/up from their extreme
Northern/Southern latitudes and spend a summer in a place that does actually
get hot.  If you have never felt the need to turn on your A/C on after dark,
then you don't live in such a place.  I feel the need to point this out since
the original
