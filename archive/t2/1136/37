Yeah - good list. Kevin if you break into the rear brakes, check your 
rear wheel bearings. I found mine allow the stub axle on the driver's 
side to slide in and out about 1/8". I believe the axle nut to be tight 
though I have not checked that yet. Am going to replace all the rear 
bearings and seals b/c they may have the whole 198K miles since the 
factory on them.
