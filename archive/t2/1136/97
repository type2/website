no I don't have AFR readings but I have seriously carboned plugs, cyl and 
exhaust system.

I am pretty alert to slippage, if there is any it is not much.  I've had 
auto tranny buses now for 20 years and am pretty tuned to the tranny, I've 
blew a couple and know what slippage feels like.  solid shifting is the 
rule. also steeep hill near me a test on, slippage would show up 
immediately on that, and no burned smell in fluid.  pretty much can 
discount slipppage, certainly not enough to cut fuel mileage in half.
