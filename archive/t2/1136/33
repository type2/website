bet there wasn't one kubel that went 10,000km without a new engine. 
Especially in the desert.  Most of us would like somewhat longer engine life.
  I doubt the original poster is going to maintain to  Wehrmacht standard, nor

YMMV. jon

Hi Jon,

I see your point. A fully loaded Kubel with jerry cans and 4 troops
with their combat packs, weapons, and ammo was not a trivial load
either. Plus the displacement on those early engines was less too,
about 990 cc wasn't it?

But your point is valid. I don't know of a source with maintenance
intervals in hot climates. It might be in my US Army Kubel manual.

In our application, we are really only speculating until we see some
CHT reading.

Take care,

John
