Subject: Dual Carbs, another little question (chokes)?

Another unrelated carb question, as I have an NOS set of Dell 40's that I may
get around to finding a use for some day here in AK.  Anyone got a set of
Weber/Dellorto electric choke plates hanging around???  They definitely used
to make these, but I haven't seen a set in 15-20 years and would like to pick
a set up.  I'd even consider a mechanical choke set if anyone has one of
those.
 
Thanks
John
