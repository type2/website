Subject: Re: [T2] Winter Gas Treatment

That's a good question. Restoration supply shops sell gas stabilizer
for off-season storage, but I don't know the range of benefits.

You would also have to run it long enough to burn off the regular gas
in the carbs. Normally I would expect that stuff to evaporate over the
winter, but if your area is cold enough, it may not.

I would also normally want to start the engine every week, but again,
if it's cold enough, maybe the stress to frozen seals would be worse
than not starting regularly.

We need someone who lives in Canada to chime in!
