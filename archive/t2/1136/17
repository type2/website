Greg,
I've done a fair amount of research on the A/C system, but my '78 already has
one installed and I just wanted the newer type compressor.  Gilmore
Enterprises (http://www.gilmore-enterprises.net) sells a kit w/ everything you
need to install that, without modifying your original engine tin, for around
$430 + shipping.  So I would imagine if you're going for a whole setup you
better be prepared to spend some dough.

Assuming you are starting from scratch, if you want to spend the big bucks and
get it done right I'd take a road trip to Gilmore.  Everything I have read
says it's worth the trip.  If you want to stay cool on the cheap, I'd try
something like
