Subject: Sliding Door Track Groove?

Hey Folks,

Been having some trouble with the sliding door, looks like it is riding too low to latch right. I've lubed it religiously, but haven't really cleaned the hardware.

I'm going to remove each attachment, one at a time, dis-assemble and clean them. I bought some parts from DB (rollers, bushing) in case I need 'em.

Question I have...the bottom track has a slight rounded groove that the roller rides in (the one that carries the weight). Is this normal? 

It looks like the bottom bracket is riding very low...might be due to a worn bottom roller? The bracket is not rubbing anywhere that I can see but it must be a close fit. Maybe a new (larger) roller will solve this?

I know tracks can rust out but this is a zero-rust cali bus, so I really doubt the track is rusting from the bottom.
