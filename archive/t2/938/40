Subject: BN6 Heater - Voltage Metering (-at-) the Fuel Pump?

I have skimmed the Library, and read the tech articles, but am still  
having trouble with my BN6 heater.  I worked before I put it away for  
last winter ('05), and hasn't worked since.  All parts, relays and  
motors appear to be working, but the voltage at the fuel pump is  
showing up at very low levels...maybe one or two volts.  This is not  
enough to trigger the pump, and as a result, I am having no luck with  
the heater.  The motor is fine, the relay is fine, and maybe the  
voltage spike sent to 'pulse' the pump is too fast to get registered  
on the meter properly.  Or maybe it should be getting the full 12 V.   
Ideas?

thanks.
