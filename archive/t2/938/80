Subject: RE: [T2] Battery Troubles

Well..  I think I've found it.

First I went and bought a multi meter that would allow me to test amp
draw, and proceeded to learn how to use it.. lol

Next I started at the battery, and then all of the cables.

Then went to the fuse box and thru every fuse.

Nothing.  From the battery there was a draw but not in the fuse box.
I removed the radio from the picture bypulling the inline fuses out
and still had a draw.

Turns out that the culpret was the fog lights.  I pulled that inline
fuse last and low and behold, no draw at the battery.

So some testing on the fog light circuit showed me that the $2.50
relay is sticking.  Jeesh!(-at-)&^%$$$&!!

So..  I'll put a new relay in and see if it stops.

Best part was that the whole procedure took about 35 mins and cost
$15 bucks.  Try that with any other manufacturers car.

ON ANOTHER NOTE:

My turn signal relay was FULL of water?

Now i have to find the leak.. ROFL
