Hi Andy,

Those owning a westy that already carries a propane tank should  
consider a propex furnace.

Frank Condelli sells them in Canada, Karl Mullendore sells them in  
the US.

Even if you have to add a NEW propane tank to your bus, I think you  
would still come up cheaper than a new espar heater.

Happy Trails,
