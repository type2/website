Subject: hard start issues in 75-cold start valve qu

Daughter's 75 bus starts "OK" in Savannah, butup here I thought it took 
way too much cranking, (one must crank 5 sec, turn off, wait, try again- 
this may happen 3 times. So I checked fuel pressure (OK), temp sensor 
(OK), spark (OK) and cold start valve- no power to connector- which as I 
recall could mean bad theromotime sw or double relay output.  I bypassed 
the cold start valve and it gave a good click and sparked a fair amount 
when touching the jumper to the + on the coil. It did start, but still 
not instantly- I don't want to pull the valve (would have to remove 
hoses)- does the method of energizing and watching fuel pressure work? 
The thermotime sw is in such an impossible spot that I'd rather put in a 
"manual" choke button to energize it it.  Extra wiring is already in 
place in cab from running the temp gauge.
