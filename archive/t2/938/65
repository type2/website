I love my kids and wife, and friends...

But since we rarely get that cold down here in Charleston for  
extended periods of time, I do things a little old fashioned:

Blankets. Nice, thick, warm, insulating blankets.

Cost = $0 (Already had too many)

Since our primary travel bus (right now) is a High Top, I just  
stashed 4 sets of blankets up top, and one polar fleece one next to  
the child seat our 3-year old rides in (anchored and latched of course).

Now then, talking about spending a grand on an A/C unit for the bus  
is another story.

That is something I might seriously consider.
