Subject: Gas Heater Group Buy

Ban News. My contact tried both Espar and Webasto (both have similar
gas heaters) and they flatly refuse to export gas heaters to the US
citing liability.

They seem to work in other countries just fine, though.

Thanks a lot you friggin' US litigators. Sue happpy S. O. B. s.

At this point the only way it's gonna happen is if someone outside the
US buys them and ships them to us.

Alternately, the diesel versions ARE available. They run just fine on
kerosene, too. Have to add a tank, though. This really sucks.

Merry Christmas, everybody! No, I really mean it.
