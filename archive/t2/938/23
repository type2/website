Hello Andy,
   Just a line to say that I have been living in France for the past
thirty years ; so, if I can be of any help to list members needing
European found articles (such as the gas heaters...). Just let me know.
                                                                Yours
truly,
 
Edward Ashley LAMB (formerly of Savannah, GA)
