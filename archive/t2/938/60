Subject: RE: [T2] Gas Heater Group Buy

Andy,

Here is an idea, why don't we talk to Scott Lyons from German Supply? He
runs out of Canada. They aren't snubbing Canadians are they? A lot of
vehicles run supplemental heat up there and in Alaska. 

Because everybody knows that as soon as you cross the border there is
nothing but sled-dogs, hockey sticks and snow as far as the eye can see. (my
roommate in college was from Quebec and that was his favorite line).

Whadda you think?

"Bad News. My contact tried both Espar and Webasto (both have similar
gas heaters) and they flatly refuse to export gas heaters to the US

At this point the only way it's gonna happen is if someone outside the
US buys them and ships them to us."
