Subject: Bay with a Subaru engine?

There is a site where a guy has put a Subaru engine into his 
aircooled bus, I really liked the site and can't find it. He did a 
really good job.
He put the radiator on the front bumper and made it look like a spare tire.
Can someone point me towards it?
Thanks,
