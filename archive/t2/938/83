Subject: Re: [T2] Endplay and Main Bearing

Who assembled the case ? If too much sealer is used in the area, it
could plug the oil gallery that brings food to the main bearing. There
is a hoover sermon on that.

I guess if there is a spec on end play, there are things that happen
when end-play is out of spec. Not sure if too tight means it will eat
the bearing though.
