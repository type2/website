Subject: Re: [T2] '70 only master cylinder

Pretty sure you can buy the one with the two senders if you pay the price. I 
paid about $100 quite a few years ago. It is still in my seldom driven 70 
and it replaced the original. I have one of the single sender units, new, on 
the shelf. About $35 from Bus Depot or Bus Boys a couple of years ago. I 
figured I would just wire the two wires together if I ever have to install 
it.

Only 70 original owner on Type2?

 The replacement M/C for a '70 has only one brake light sender. All the
 original ones I have seen have two brake light senders and the wiring
 harness has two plugs. What gives? Does it matter that aftermarket 
companies
 only use one?

 Can a '68-'69 be used instead by blocking off the 3rd sender and using the
 '70's senders with the correct prongs?

 Also, are there rebuild kits available? I used to hone and rebuild my M/C
 and brake cylinders as a kid and it worked great.

 I should have held onto my NOS in-box '70 M/C. Hindsight is 20/20.
