Subject: Buses By the Beach Movies

Hello Fellow Volks Folks,

Now that the weather is getting colder and it is getting darker earlier, I
thought everyone might enjoy looking at some Bus videos. Buses By the Beach
has just added a really cool video section and improved our picture section.
Take a minute and check them out. A new feature to this section is you can
view pictures in a full screen slide show. I know you are going to love it!

 

You can get there by either going to www.busesbythebeach.com
<http://www.busesbythebeach.com/>  and then clicking on "Multimedia" or
clicking on the following link to go right to the pictures and movies.

If you have any pictures from a Buses By the Beach event and would like them
on the website just upload them in the "user upload" section. Be sure and
tell us what year and event they are from and we will add them to the photo
album. 

 

Wishing you many miles of smiles!

The Volks at Buses By the Beach
