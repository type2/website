Subject: Hot Start Relay

I've had my hot start relay installed on my 78 since 2003. No problems at all until yesterday. 
  I've blown 3 of those 15a fuses in a day and a half. Any clues would be a great help. My battery has also been dead for sitting so long in the cold. Not sure if this is linked to the
  same problem or not. TIA
