"GREAT NEWS! I will be selling used Espar / Eberspacher diesel and
gasoline furnaces:

These are the newer units and very compact, only 12-14 inches long and
4.5 inches in diameter.

Current stock: one D1LC (diesel) $575, one new B1LCC (gas) $850, two
Airtronic D2 (diesel) $750 each"

$575 for a diesel one might be worth doing...
