Subject: vandalism

Well, I had a little vandalism last night.  Came out this morning to warm up the bus (don't think my thermostat works so I try to get it good and warm b/4 I drive) and in big red letters I have 'K K K' spray painted across the back window.  My neighbor came over later and said that they painted the same thing across the back of her Tahoe.  At least it wasn't on my paint.  A gasoline soaked rag took it right off but if I find out who did it, there's gonna be a lynching.  Black or white.  Probably white in my neighborhood.  Delinquent bastards.  Grrr....KR
