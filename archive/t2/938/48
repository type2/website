Don, keep in mind that the power supplied to the pump is not a constant 12
volts - it's actually 12 volt pulses.  There's a set of points in the
combustion air blower that pulse the power to the fuel pump.  According to
the BA6 manual:

"Fuel is injected by pump every 33rd revolution of blower shaft.  Each
injection stroke can be detected by a ticking noise from pump.

Number of pump strokes x 33 = speed

speed: 6400 - 7000 rpm"

So, the pulses go by a little more than 3 every second.  I imagine the
pulses are quite short, and you can hear the pump "tick, tick, tick, tick".

No, you can't have my gas heater.  :)
