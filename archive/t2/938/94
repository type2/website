It turned fine when we rebuilt the engine...but seized up last Wednesday 
morning. We pulled the engine and still couldn't turn the crank, so we split 
the case and discovered the front-most main bearing seized solid (which is 
why I asked this question...trying to determine why it would seize after only 
6,000 miles or so).
