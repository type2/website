OK, the plan is to meet at 1PM. Here is a map, we
expect to be in picnic area 10, but if necessary we
could be in 7, 8, or 9: just keep your eyes peeled.

(Leashed) Dogs fine, liquor is not. We will bring a
bunch of charcoal for grilling (presuming we can find
it at this time of year). Just bring something to
share.

My cell phone is 202 593 1314, though coverage is
often spotty in the park since it is down in a valley.

In the unlikely chance we have to move, we will go to
my house, 7001 Westmoreland Ave Takoma Park. 

Directions from Military Rd and 16th St., just east of
the Park: North on 16th, make a right on Aspen, follow
it (jogging a bit at Georgia) until it ends and make a
left at the angled "T" intersection with Laurel. Head
north on Laurel about three blocksand make the first
right after the light onto Westmoreland. 

If someone has access to the type2 and vintagebus
lists please pass it on to them.

Hope to see you there,

Tom F.
