My dad encountered another service member at the end of WWII in Europe
who was attempting to take apart a Kubelwagen and ship it home.  The
Kubel had apparently been strafed and rolled over on its side; it
appeared it was crossing a bridge over a small creek/gully when strafed,
made it to the other side before rolling.

Know anyone stationed in Baghdad? Might be cheaper to pick up an "only
blown up by a little old terrorist on weekends" bus and have it shipped
home as personal transportation... ;-)
