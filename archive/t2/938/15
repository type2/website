Anybody have access to a parts list to see what parts are different on the
diesel versus gas heaters?  I'm willing to bet that the difference is just
a jet or nozzle.  Buy the diesel heater, retrofit the gasoline part(s) and
you get the heater we need.  The manufacturer is off the liability hook
since the customer altered the heater.

Danged lawyers.  Getting rich by discouraging innovation.  A pox on them
all.
