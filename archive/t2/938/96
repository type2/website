or maybe you didn't set your endplay correctly the first time :p

sorry, just messin'.  But I wouldn't know why it would seize up so 
quick.  May poor oil delivery?  When you rebuilt the engine, did you use 
assembly lube when you put it together?  did you put in new bearings? 
Did you have the crank ground and/or checked before reassembly w/ 
properly sized oversized bearings?  Did the original rebuild have 
anything to do with the front-end bearing which would relate to my 
previous question?
