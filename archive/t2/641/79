Replace the tranny. The fact that you had to grind out the bellhousing to
get the flywheel to fit indicates that they PROBABLY installed an earlier
tranny at the same time as the Type1 engine went in. I don't know if the
'72 tranny would fit a 228 flywheel though so it may have the original '72
tranny in there.

I *do* know that one of the steps involved in upgrading an early bay tranny
to a 091 while leaving the type1 engine is to cut about 1/2" off of the
tranny input shaft. Differences in bellhousing depth make the later tranny
input shaft too long to fit into the type1 pilot bearing (or maybe it's
just the fact that the pilot bearing on the type1 sticks out further
because it's in the gland nut rather than the end of the crank).

This may be true for ALL upgrades from a tranny intended for a type1 to a
tranny intended for a type4. You may have the '72 tranny but with it's
input shaft trimmed shorter for the type1 engine install -- or you may
actually have a tranny designed for a '69 - '71 Bay.

Either way, you need to replace the tranny (or the input shaft if it's a
type4 tranny that's been trimmed) before you'll be able to reliably use a
type4 engine.
