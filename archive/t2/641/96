Good reason not to read the VW rags :-)

Either: (a) He didn't know what he was doing.  (b) He had it lying 
around and didn't want to expend the effort to acquire the correct 
part.

In either case, it's a good reason to find a different mechanic (or 
start doing more of the work yourself).

Actually, see (a) above :-)

Yes.  You can replace it with either the correct stock distributor, or 
a suitable replacement.  I installed an SVDA from aircooled.net in my 
'76 and I love it (my original distributor needs a rebuild).

In any case, you should not run a 009 in a Bus.  Actually, I'm of the 
opinion that the 009 should not be used in *any* VW.  It was not a 
stock distributor on any VW engine.

Not really normal.

If I were you, I'd get a proper distributor for your engine, plus a set 
of tune-up parts, and perform a tune-up / valve adjustment as the first 
step in trying to clear up this condition.  Eliminate those variables 
before hunting any further.
