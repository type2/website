Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

Right. My first exposure to VW FI was when I bought a dead 82 Jetta. When I 
bought it I was told the problem was in the fuel distributor, so I went to 
pick n pull and bought one. Didn't fix it, so I bought another. Didn't fix 
it, so I bought every FI component and replaced all of them. Luckily, as you 
said, it wasn't expensive to do this at junkyard prices.

That is, I replaced everything except the fuel pump because that was on the 
list of brand new parts the PO said he bought. Well, I finally broke down 
and spent the money for the pressure guages and found the brand new fuel 
pump was under spec for pressure, and another $9 for a pick n pull pump got 
me running.
