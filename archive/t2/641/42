yep don these are the new ones with the electronic chokes



Those are the new ones right? Not the PDSIT ones that came stock on
the busses... I got the impression he wanted the stock ones.

Of course, I'd much rather have new ones if I have the $$. Then again,
if I had money for new ones I'd probably build a Megasquirt. But my
stock carbs are running awesome (though the thing started dieseling
today).
