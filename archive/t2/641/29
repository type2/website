I don't know what you're trying to accomplish with the Porsche engine.
I've run the Type IV Vanagon engines for ten years and they produce more HP
at the required 3000 / 3300 RPMS than a Porsche 914 2000cc or the 912e
2000cc Type IV.
Lugging a Porsche at 3000 running 70 mph is just going to overheat it.
My 912e runs 3300 at 75+ MPH only pushing 2300 pounds. 
I seem to think with the 5 speed it's closer to 85 mph.
If you try pushing 3700 to 5200 pounds you're in for bad overheating of the
oil and heads.
