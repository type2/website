Once again the leaves change and the air is crisp.
Once again working on the fuel system on the 74.:-)
I started to notice hesitation when accelerating so I started
poking around back there.. One morning I notice that the intake
stacks are wet.. sigh.. so I pull the air cleaner off and clean out the
intake and lube up the flap that opens to allow hot air to be drawn
from
below. Not much difference.. hmmm... so I stick a mirror back there and
rev the engine a bit and see that the flap isnt moving. As it turned
out
the thermostaticly controlled vacuum switch in the right carbs intake
is not opening up.. So I remove it and clean it.. no luck there. My
solution is to leave it out and insert the vac hose to the flap direct
into the air channel.. plugging the other hole... no more iceing.
My bus likes that hot air input when it's cold. did some tune up stuff
as it wants to stall when coming to a stop.. timing was a bit off. etc.
Much improved but it still likes to stall out now and then in the
morning
when coming to a stop.. brakes feel fine but I am suspecting perhaps
a vac leak in the assist line or that the one way valve is not doing
it's job of being one way. But adjusting the timeing made for a large
improvement.
  The in line bilge blower fan after 4 years is starting to sound
sketchy sometimes so I guess I had better go get a replacement.. Wish
I could find one that was designed to take some heat... oh well $20 
every 4 years for real heat is not bad I guess.
  Interesting how when the weather starts changing the carb/intake sys
demands a little attention every year.. ran great all summer. :-)
  Today we ( my son and I) take the project rabbit down to try and
pass the smog nazi's standards of excellence.. It will be interesting
as in place of the bunny's original 8 valve is a 92 Passat 2L 16V.
Of course we wont mention that.;-) If it passes and becomes road legal
we can start pulling the autotranny out of the Jetta and replace it...

The never ending story... vee dubs.. ya gotta love em.
