I don't know how long it can last. My local VW shop told me not to worry 
about the pilot bearing and just drive until it fails with the idea that 
VW's seem to go forever, but it was only another 2 weeks before my bus was 
completely undrivable.

 going completely bad.  It already has a bad input shaft bearing.  The
 input shaft bearing has been making noise for the last 6 years, well
 before I installed the 2L.  How long can these input shaft bearings
 last????????
 Thanks for the info.  This list is great.
