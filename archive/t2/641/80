Subject: Can anyone recommend a good mechanic in NJ

Hello all - 
 
I've reached my limit and am ready to pay someone to fix my intractable electrical problem.  Can anyone recommend a good mechanic in or around Ocean County, New Jersey?  Someone with a lot of air-cooled VW experience would be great.
 
Thanks!
