Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny interchangeability? Bearing replacement?

I think I am correct when I state that the 200mm,
210mm, 215mm will all fit the transmission and the
starter will also work, when you go to the 228mm
flywheel then the starter and transmission must be the
same, unless you change the bell housing to fit the
200-215mm flywheel. Phil
