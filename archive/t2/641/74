 Don't think for a minute that smog check isn't as much about $$$ as clean air. All those smog check stations spent all that money on equipment, so they want as many vehicles as possible forced to be "smogged". Wouldn't surprise me a bit to learn that the auto repair industry lobbied for expanding the smog check program
When tighter standards take those "dirty" cars off the road, car makers and dealers will be happy to sell us new(er) ones. Even if you buy used from a private party, you still pay tax and title fees. 
It's a double bonus for the auto repair industry because people will be less likely to attempt to work on newer more complex cars.
