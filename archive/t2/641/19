Subject: replying to messages

This may be really stupid question and is totally un vw-related, but i 
have tried to reply to several post and list keeps bouncing message 
back to me saying can't deliver because it contains excessive quoted 
material?  How do i reply to posts?  I'm new to the list and would like 
to provide some responses.  Thanks.
