hey all,

i have a 72 westy which my mechanic replaced my 050 vacuum advance dizzy w/ 
009 centrifugal advance dizzy.  i read the archives about how 009 are bad 
for busses but most of the vw's magz, most are running 009's including 
busses.  so, i have a couple questions: 1. why would my mechanic put a 009 
in?  2.  why are they so popular? 3. is there anything i cant do to correct 
the inherent problems w/ 009's?  all in all, my bus runs better than it did 
but i do notice its power is weak until rpms are real high(when i should be 
shifting).  the 050 vac adv dizzy gave me more power it seems through all 
rpm ranges but couldnt hold idle(plate was bad).  im confused as to why 
009's are so often used.

one last thing,  since ive owned the bus, after being driven a little and i 
stop at the store or something, when i come back out, the bus is reluctant 
to start.  it always starts though with some effort.  is this normal?  even 
with brand new dizzy?

thanks,
patrick
