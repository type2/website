Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solexes and 2L engine

richard i have a brand new set that i am selling on the samba ..
i ran them on my bus and liked them all except i wasnt worth a crap at adjusting them...
gave me a fit....
i guess i am lazy and prefer my weber carb so thats what i have back on my bus is a weber...
i was running the 34mm dual solex carbs form cb performance on my type 2/// 76  engine..
peace and love
