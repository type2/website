Subject: Rear shock replacment (Update)

After determining the knocking noise from the back of our newly acquired bus
was due to the bushings in the rear shocks being out of shape, we went ahead
and ordered some new ones.  I just got them installed but have a question
about the alignment.  My Bentley still has not shown itself so I will start
with a question.  How tight should the bolts that attach the shocks be?
Other than that, my concern is over the alignment of the shock.  Looking at
the following picture (this is from the rear of the bus facing forward,) the
bottom attachment area is not completely aligned.  It is visible in the
picture how the upper portion of the shock is leaning to the outside of the
bus causing a gap at the bottom mount.  Since I am not sure how tight these
bolts should be, I am not sure if that is the issue.  I can say that I got
them pretty darn snug though.  Any thoughts?
