Right. It's a W case, so it's a 70 to 71 914 or a 71 411.

I notice there is no torque spec on any of the Porsche engines at all. So 
from other posts I'm hearing, I am thinking maybe this motor I am thinking 
about buying is not really suitable for a bus at all. And in the past I've 
heard people talk in such glowing terms when they are able to score a 
porsche motor to put in a VW.

I feel really bad because I've got my friend's hopes up that he has made a 
sale :-(
