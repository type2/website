Subject: Re: [T2] Dual solexes and 2L engine

I run dual Solex 35mm from SCAT on a 2L w/ 1.8 heads w/ 009 dizzy.  
Manifolds are OE.  Driveability is excellent except for some lack of 
top end power which may be due to 009 dizzy.  Dual setup definitely 
much better than my former weber progressive.  Westy now idles 
flawlessly below 60F temps!
