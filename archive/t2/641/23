Yeah, that is true.. guess it depends on how long you can wait.

Well, you're still going to run into a problem - nobody knows what AFR 
numbers yield the good smog results -- and you also need to simulate the 
same conditions as the dyno.  Seems like what you'd really want to do is 
go to a service station, have them hook up your bus to the dyno and ask 
them to tune the AFM so the bus will pass (I spent 100 bux on this last 
time).  If your bus is in descent working condition, you should have no 
problem getting it to pass.  I had a *crappy* engine on mine with a 
badly tuned AFM and they still got it to pass.  Then, while the bus is 
still on the dyno, hook up the WB02 sensor and see what values it reads.

I'm *praying* that it's going to be around 14.7:1.  If so, I'm in luck 
if I want my bus to pass with the MS ;)

> I could rent one but I have my wife's car to worry about also.

you can use testers on multiple cars.  There are testers that attach to 
the pipe if I remember correctly.  My friends had one and they were 
hooking it up to their cars and driving around with it.
