I don't understand the logic in Muir.

John Hilgerdt recounts the story of a 75 tranny that chewed up the pilot
bearing of a 78 bus. There is no good reason for this because the 228mm
flywheel won't fit a 002 bellhousing so a compatible flywheel must have been
used.

I can only speculate as to what parts they actually used because the input
shaft is the same length and the pilot bearing is the same distance from tip
of the input shaft among Type 4 flywheels.

What seems more probable is that they used a 68-71 tranny but since the
68-71 flywheel won't bolt onto any Type 4 engine, they used a 72-75
incompatible flywheel so the parts mismatch to make it "work" was
horrendous!
