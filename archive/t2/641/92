The bottom line here folks is that Gov't = Big Business, like Mike is saying
 Let's face it, the gas monopolies, car companies, and any other private
enterprise that feeds the political system via lobby money and donations
from coporations is going to control some aspects of the Gov't. If they can
pass "bills" in their own interest by donating money in exchange for 
concessions" that make them rich don't you think it's gonna happen?? Good
God, this isn't rocket science.

Excuse my jaded comments, hell I'm not even American, I'm part of the 51st
State.

Don't think for a minute that smog check isn't as much about $$$ as clean
air. All those smog check stations spent all that money on equipment, so
they want as many vehicles as possible forced to be "smogged". Wouldn't
surprise me a bit to learn that the auto repair industry lobbied for
expanding the smog check program

When tighter standards take those "dirty" cars off the road, car makers and
dealers will be happy to sell us new(er) ones. Even if you buy used from a
private party, you still pay tax and title fees.

It's a double bonus for the auto repair industry because people will be less
likely to attempt to work on newer more complex cars.
