Subject: Stupid question - Dieseling

Ok, as I mentioned earlier, my brain cells are on vacation. For the
life of me I can't recall the reasons an engine would rattle on after
the ignition is cut. Mine started doing this today.

I'm thinking overrich mixture and/or fuel somehow getting in after the
ignition is cut. It's not a temperature thing.

I'll get a chance to dig in tomorrow and do all the normal things. I
was planning on an oil change and valve adjustment anyway. So a
once-over with the carbs will be no problem.

I do still have my exhaust leak, however. Stupid studs. Grrr....
