There are two issues with what you're saying. I agree with the fact
that it's part of the process, and things often work themselves out.
However...

#1: The people who can afford to challenge the current legislation are
the least likely to do so. After all, I have no doubt that Jay Leno
has no problem making his cars absolutely correct including smog
equipment. And his classics are exempt. Besides VW's how many 75-86
cars are out there that people actually WANT to own? Particularly
collectors like Mr. Leno?

#2: Even if someone coughs up the dough to challenge this law, how
long will this process take? Certainly long enough for the buyback
programs and junkyards to end up with the lion's share of rust free
California busses. Just like the period before the rolling exemption
kicked in. I saw beautiful 69 Camaros in the junkyard when 69's had to
be smogged. I sold a 65 Olds f85 with a Rocket 350 for $100 with a
perfect body but smoky engine because I couldn't smog it after buying
it. (That one still makes me wanna cry... At least that one went to
another f85 owner so it lives on, I'm sure.)

The fact that this law was passed and signed in the first place shows
a horrible lack of vision and compassion among our politicians.
California's first job should have been the state's economy. Not
messing with vehicle regulations.

I saw an awesome bumper sticker the other day: "Will the last American
in California please take the flag?" Sometimes that's just how I feel.
