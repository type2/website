The cam and piston stroke and diameter combination determine whether
it's going to have more HP and lower torque or the other way around.

A cam swap may be enough to get the torque peak lower in the powerband. 

But, yeah, a lightweight Porsche almost certainly won't be setup to
put out the torque needed to move a bus. But then again it may not
matter. There was another list member that had a Porsche 2.0 in his
bus that SCREAMED (was it a 2.0 or a 3 something flat 6? Now I can't
remember... bah. Stupid brain cells must be hanging out in my desk
drawer again...)
