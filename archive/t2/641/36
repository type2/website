As for tools the ease of the job increases with your investment in ownership of these items. From harder to easier:

- metric socket set
- 8mm triple square for cv joints (removing engine w/ trans)
- torque wrench
- various screwdrivers
- fuel line clamps
- corbin clamp pliers

- small floor jack
- dual jack stands
- dual 3 ton floor jacks
- motorcycle/atv jack
- engine stand and means to hoist the engine onto it
- engine holding fixture

There are substitutes for all of these items including but not limited to heavy lifting.

Sears or HF can cover you for everything you need except for the last item. I own a few snapon specialty tools and I feel well equipped for the bus considering the amount of use the tools get. If I was doing this work day in day out I would definately invest in their equipment more.
