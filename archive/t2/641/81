Subject: Re: Replying to messages

I am in digest mode.  I have a Mac running OS 10.3.

In order to reply to the Type 2 List (digest), I have to click on 
"Reply All", then delete the address to "digest-help."

I had my preferences set up to quote the original message in the reply 
(i.e., the entire digest).  Even though I would select and delete the 
entire message when replying, the mail would bounce for quoting too 
much.  When I set the preferences to NOT quote the original message, 
all was OK.
