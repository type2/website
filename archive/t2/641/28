A friend already has his 84 Softtail for sale for just that reason.
The Harley folks are hearing the war drums... This is an entire
culture even larger than the VW one ever was that will be affected.
AND some of THESE guys have lots of time and $$ to burn fighting. So
they may have a happier ending.

And my Fiero just failed smog because the slipping clutch wouldn't let
it hold a rpm/speed combo on the dyno. Color me VERY angry. Steam
coming out of my ears and everything. Dropping a Fiero transaxle is
NOT in my bag of tricks and it's $600-800 to have the clutch done at a
shop.

Anybody wanna buy a cheap Fiero with 85k on the clock?
