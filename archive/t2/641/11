Subject: Rebuilt Rngines  was Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned

Hi Volks:

2 Questions after reading this.

One, would  some of the engineers and real mechanics (unlike me) out 
there be willing to pool our ideas on a website (R-atwell's or I could 
mount one) on how we can get these 76-79 busses through the new smog 
regs?  This could also include pooling and swapping/selling EGR's and 
Cat's from junked busses.

What it would entail is an A-B-C type of checklist like soem of the 
great stuff I got yesterday off list.  Maybe some diagrams and looks at 
different CA mods.  I was lucky, my bus left Germany bound for CA so it 
had everything.  Not everyone is that lucky.

Our busses are more servicable and sompler than camaros and we might be 
able to dodge this bullet.

Second unrelated question:  Engine rebuilds and R&R's (remove and 
replace).  Ot erh than Muir, is there something in the archives of a 
list of what I could buy today at my local FLAPS (ie Kragen/Checker/Pep 
BOys) to be ready for this job?

THanks again for the great off list support I got yesterday!  Between 
the SMOG thread and our 19-year old taking my F*rd Truck, I guess I 
panicked.

Best,

BEN
