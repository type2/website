Right. One of the guys on the list sent me the reference from the Muir book 
in chapter 20, pp 434 to 435. Do you have Muir?

This probably depends too on whether your 2L is a genuine stock 2L which was 
only 78-79. If so, Muir says only transmissions from 76-79 will work with 
it. He says the pilot shaft is too short on earlier transmissions, and 
barely fits into the pilot bearing. He says when the pilot bearing goes, it 
can trash the front tranny seal, and even ruin the bell housing if let go 
too long, so I won't know if my tranny is okay until I remove the engine. 
You could be okay if you have an older engine that was opened up to 2L.

Yeah, you've got reason to be spooked. Mine lasted two years before going 
out.
