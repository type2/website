Although I am not in digest mode, I also run 10.3. I assume you use 
"Mail" to read mail. Rather than "reply to all," I simply hit reply, 
then add "type2(-at-)type2.com" on the "to" line (I actually type "ty" and 
the program fills in the rest automatically.) In some cases, I delete 
the individual's address (for instance, Erik Meltzer asks not to get 
two replies to his posts -- one direct, the other through the list).

Before doing this, though, in "Mail" you can highlight the part of a 
message that you want to quote before hitting "reply." Only the 
selected text will appear as a quotation.
