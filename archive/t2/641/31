I know what numbers will yield good %CO numbers but I won't know the HC and NOx levels so I'll have to watch the head temps as well and see if there is any predictability. I've got the 75-78 EGR setup so it's going to dump in a lot of exhaust mid-throttle and richen up the mixture to cool things down.

I'll need to run a few setups to see how the numbers are effected.

I'm going to drive around with the meter hooked up and then dump the logs to the computer. I'll take the same route at the same time of day, same temp etc. I'm hoping this cold weather will favor good test results.

The mercedes shop down the road offered me some time on their smog tester but I never took them up on the offer. I'll see them again and would like to verify my numbers to see if they result in low HC and NOx levels as well.

I've been looking for information to determine sensor accuracy when at the tailpipe vs. the header. Do you have any information? I'm planning to have a bung welded on where it's about 500F.
