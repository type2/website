Thanks,
I been reading this list for a month and have found it very 
entertaining, interesting, and informative.  I have owned a 1965 Austin 
Healey Sprite (RH), 1972 240Z, and currently for the past 12 years, 
1974 Westy, orange.  Last year blow #3 connecting rod thru the case 60 
miles from home and still made it (barely).  will try to provide help 
when i can.  thanks again.

David.
