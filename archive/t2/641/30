Subject: Ooops!   Engine Rebuild List

Dear Richard and Volks:

Right now I swear by Bus Depot and Busted bus.  When I was mentioning 
FLAPS in my original post about an engine pulling forum, I was 
referring to TOOLS only.  If Harbor supports the list, I'd be happy 
to go with them, bit for this project, people like me can't afford 
SNAP-ON's, Wiha;s and other high end tools when it comes to jacks, 
workstands  and hoists, for instance.

SO Richard, sorry for not being clear.

BEN
