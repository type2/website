Do mean besides Triumphs, MGs, Jaguars, the cute old Beemers, etc. etc. 
etc.? Tens of thousands, I'd guess.

I'm more than willing to bet that there is out there more than one 
person who:

1. Has a law degree and expertise in state constitutional law;

2. Collects old cars, including (let's say) a '75 Triumph TR6;

3. Is conservative or libertarian, and opposed to regulation in 
principle; even a progressive (like me) can see that this law 
overreaches;

4. Wouldn't mind kickstarting a political career by bringing a 
well-publicized "populist" challenge against an unjustice.

As for the timeframe, I suspect that those of us with '76s are going to 
have to get our buses smogged at least one more time.
