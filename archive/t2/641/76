Okay Richard. Now you are getting closer to the issues that might explain my 
pilot bearing failure.

A little history on my bus might illuminate things. When I picked up my 72 
bus, there was no Type 4 motor to be found anywhere. At the time I didn't 
know about the change from type 1 to type 4 engines in bay buses. The PO had 
installed a rebuilt type 1 DP motor in the bus. The motor developed a rattle 
shortly afterwards and was pulled. At the same time they pulled a single 
port type 1 motor from an earlier bay window bus and intended to install it.

At this point the project was abandoned, and when I picked it up, I was 
given the DP motor with the rattle and the SP motor they intended to 
install. I was told the DP motor went bad because it was the wrong motor for 
the bus, the cooling tin wasn't right, and it overheated.

I gave the SP motor to a coworker so he could get his sister-in-laws Beetle 
back on the road, and on further investigation I learned the DP motor was 
good, it just had no compression washer at the gland nut on the flywheel, 
and the flywheel had ovaled the crankshaft. Took it to machine shop, had it 
fixed, but by then I was learning what was involved in getting the upright 
motor to work in a bus made for Type IV, so I decided to just get the right 
motor for it. I was so excited to pick up the 78 motor at the junkyard for 
$250. It had everything on it, so I didn't have to spend for missing 
components.

At this time, I didn't know about flywheel sizing issues, so when I 
installed it, of course, the flywheel wouldn't turn. Well, another coworker 
was a 30 year retired engine man in the navy and a vw mechanic, and he told 
me just to back off the mounting bolts, and turn the crankshaft by hand to 
grind off the nodes that were hitting the flywheel. So that's where we stand 
today, after 2 years of successful operation of this setup.

Because of the fact that the a type one motor was introduced to the bus, I 
am not sure whether I have the original transmission that belongs in this 
bus, or if the engine also came with its original transmission.

Somehow I feel in my gut that this has something to do with something you 
have explained below, but I am not quite sure what it is or what I have, and 
what are the implications for me getting my bus running again, and whether 
or not I can use the 78 engine again.

Thanks for listening!

John
