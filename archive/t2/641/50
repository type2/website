Hi Stan,

Thanks for your valuable information. I'm not very sophisticated with my 
knowledge of the various engine possiblities. I was just trying to get my 
bus back on the road as quickly as possible without waiting to rebuild one 
of my bad engines, and this porsche engine was offered to me. I thought it 
would be nice to have a porsche engine just because I thought it would give 
me more power than a stock engine, but judging from responses to my post, it 
looks like that is not really the case, and even possible that it would be 
worse than stock due to lack of torque, which has not yet been confirmed.

I was also curious about the Vanagon engines. I've owned some a/c vanagons 
in my day, and I was wondering what the cross compatibility of the engines 
were, and the difference in performance from the late bay a/c engines. Right 
now I'm also facing a little known incompatibility in the late engine/early 
transmission that causes pilot bearing failure which another list member 
brought to my attention in a Ch 20 reference in Muir. I bought the 78 engine 
about 2 years ago for my 72 bus, and the pilot bearing is now making the bus 
undrivable. I imagine a Vanagon engine would have the same problem. From 
what I've read, it also looks like the pilot situation may have also 
destoyed my transmission, so I won't know what I have going on here until I 
break it down.

>I don't know what you're trying to accomplish with the Porsche engine.
 I've run the Type IV Vanagon engines for ten years and they produce more HP
 at the required 3000 / 3300 RPMS than a Porsche 914 2000cc or the 912e
 2000cc Type IV.
 Lugging a Porsche at 3000 running 70 mph is just going to overheat it.
 My 912e runs 3300 at 75+ MPH only pushing 2300 pounds.
 I seem to think with the 5 speed it's closer to 85 mph.
 If you try pushing 3700 to 5200 pounds you're in for bad overheating of the
 oil and heads.
