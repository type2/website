Yes. Any good locksmith can make a key from a lock. I watched on do it 
with the lock in place by twisting the blank key back and forth HARD and 
letting the tumblers mark the key. He then cut a key with a hand file. 
Couldn't be good for the long-life of the lock though. Ought to be cheap 
too ($20 or so). Housecalls cost more of course.
