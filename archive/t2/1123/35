Just bought another bus, a really solid '78 Deluxe campmobile, been in a dry
garage a while.
Elderly owner cannot locate the keys.
If I pull a door lock cylinder and take it to a locksmith, can they duplicate
the key for both it and the ignition?
Thought I read somewhere that you can make a key to fit everything from an
ignition cylinder, but you can't make an ignition key from a door lock
cylinder.
Don't know squat about locksmithing, but I know I'll need keys!
Would I have any luck with the dealer?  Is there a code somewhere on a
cylinder that would help a locksmith?
Any other options I haven't thought about? (besides tearing the column
apart?)
Thanks,
Greg
