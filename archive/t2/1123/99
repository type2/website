Subject: Need help in Livermore ca

Hi Everyone



I need someone to come and help me get my van started .(1980 aircooled
Westfalia fuel injection)  I have no cash or credit so cannot use a shop.  Its
a long story which started with posts to this site back it Nov 2007.



I had a bad engine at minimum worn rings. So I got a backup engine thanks to
the effort of Dave W. After a long financial personal struggle in the last 2
years, I finally got past my mental block and got down to business.  I tore
down both engines used my accessories on the replacement engine cleaned up the
tranny (oil was everywhere finally bought a steamer wish I had done that from
the start),new clutch and remounted engine tranny and replacement axles and I
am quite proud of that feat.  But I'm stuck at getting the engine to start.
working on getting a new battery (thats how poor I am)



I could, as I say, finally "see" how to do the teardown reinstall.  What I
dont "see" is the diagnostics on startup. Plus I am without equipment
voltmeter tachmeter. I do have compression tester. (There is a chance the
replacement will have poor compression but I chose to take the gamble.)



But what I need is a helper with knowledge to work through all these things so
if anyone is in the Livermore CA area  can stop by I would greatly appreciate
it.



Cheers

Janyce
