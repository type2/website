Eric -

Well, outside of enlarging the engine compartment opening, changing to a 091
Tranny to accept the 228mm flywheel & clutch, changing out the shift rod
assembly to match the tranny, changing to a 76-79 gas tank and filler
assembly (gotta re-work the filler opening on the body), getting all,
swapping out the engine wiring, making sure you've got all the correct
exhaust stuff, swapping out the engine cradle and modifying the mountings
for that on the frame, plus a lot of other stuff I've failed to remember,
that's gonna be a helluva project.  Forget the Oil Bath Air Cleaner, you
need the stock 78 setup with the AFM attached for the darn thing to run.  Be
cheaper and less hassle to buy a 76-78 Bus to begin with.  Personally, I'd
stick with the original stock 1600 setup, less $$ to repair and maintain in
the long run.  Stock 71s are becoming more collectible as original vehicles
anyway.

Just my nickel's worth. YMMV
