Hmmm... 72 should be stock with 1700 unless it was changed out or overbored.

But you would think 1600 and 1700 would be close in power. But 1700 /
1800 is Type 4 with dual carbs, and 1600 is Type 1 with single carb.

The bus is pretty underpowered with a 1600. Load it up with gear and
people, and what you got is pretty typical I'd say.
