Mandy,

Welcome to the club! I have a '71, also.

What everyone has said about the brakes is true, particularly about the hoses.
My Bus came from Texas originally, & had ancient hoses that looked perfect on
the outside, but were clogged on the inside, & caused all sorts of funky
braking behavior until I replaced them. Also, the boots on the wheel cylinders
may be deteriorated if the Bus has been sitting for a long time. Anything made
of rubber is suspect.

Change the fuel lines, because they're likely brittle, & ready to crumble.
Even if they look & feel good, change them anyway, so you'll know how old they
are.

I see in the pictures from eBay that you have a rubber fuel line that does not
look to be German cloth-covered line running from the carb, through a filter,
to another filter, then disappearing at the back of the engine.

I'm willing to bet that this hose is 1/4" Gates-type hose that will not fit
properly, and WILL leak eventually. You'll need to replace it with the proper
German hose: http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=N203551

Also, be sure to use the proper German-style clamps, which won't cut into the
hose: http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=111127537A10
Two meters ought to do it.

After you install the proper hose with the proper clamps, you should safety
wire the connections. The Type2 Library at type2.com  has a technical article
all about it, titled "Safety-Wiring Your Fuel Lines" posted in Jan 2000.
You'll find it under Fuel/General.

I see two filters in your engine compartment, in the supply line to the pump.
You'll want to make sure that no one puts a filter in between the pump and the
carb, as this overstresses the press-in fuel fittings on both the pump and the
carb, and can make them fall out.

Once you get your rust issues resolved, you'll want to get those (meltable)
plastic filters out of your engine compartment, & put in a metal filter in the
supply line, forward of the engine breast tin. I have mine installed over the
accordion heater tube.

The most important thing to do, right away, before you drive the Bus again, is
to follow that fuel line with your hand, & maybe a mirror, to where it goes
through the engine breast tin, headed for the tank. The stock setup here is a
metal line that runs from just next to the fuel pump, where it connects with a
short length of hose, through a rubber grommet in the tin, to the tank, where
it connects with another short length of hose.

If the hose is just stuffed through that hole in the tin, the tin will
eventually cut through it, & you'll have a huge & dangerous leak.

If there is a metal line floating around in the hole with no grommet, that's
just as bad, since the tin will cut through the metal line, too.

What you want is a metal line going through a grommet that is pliable & in
good condition, not stiff, crumbling, or missing.

There are also other solutions to getting the line through the tin safely.

Bob Hoover (a VW community guru) has a good write-up here:

This all may sound scary, but it's really just about attention to detail. Once
the fuel system is set up properly, your Bus is no more likely to catch fire
than any other vehicle.

Congratulations, & hope this helps,
