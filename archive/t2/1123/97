Subject: RE: [T2] Expecting too much?

Humm I cant seem to get to the Bosch number on the distributor :-( but it is
a Bosch at least its not some wacky brand. I will look over service records
and see if its listed somewhere.

My wife and I did check the linkage. It seemed fine. I sent an email to the
PO who rebuilt it..

Thanks for the heads up on the part number.. the engine code seems to be
gone (the serial number :-( All that is left on the gen stand is Z|ndfolge
1.4.3.2 4C

On the incline
Time traveled 4 minutes
We went from 328ft to 917ft that is a 589ft climb.
We traveled 1.4 miles 7392ft actually

589 / 7392 = 0.0796807

Making it about a 8% grade...

Thank you for the equation ! :-)

This was the hill on Beavercreek road and hwy 211

So
I dont know we toped out at 42mph towards the top in 3rd I presume because
I would NOT push it that hard.. but our average was 28mph...

I think I may be being paranoid.. Right after we bought our 72 I had to
rebuild the engine.. I think im just being nuts.. I dont want to have to
rebuild an engine a month into having the bus LOL thats a winter project
not a summer project..
