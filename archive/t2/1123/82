I would expect you to be able to pull it in third, although 4th might be a stretch.

Are you sure your timing, ignition, and valves are all dialed in?

Is your accelerator cable adjusted such that when the pedal is on the floor,
the carb is at full throttle?  (You can use a brick on the pedal to check)

Have you tried a "poor man's compression test"?  I.e. removing each spark
plug wire while the engine is running, listening if the engine RPMs drop,
then putting it back on.  This will tell you if all cylinders are firing
normally (or about equally).  If the RPMs don't drop for a particular
cylinder, you know you have a problem, be it fouled plugs, poorly adjusted
valve, bad spark plug wire, or something more expensive...

The next step on this list would be a real compression test...

Oh, and what carb/dizzy combination are you running?

Cheers,
   Tom
