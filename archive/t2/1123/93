It's on the body below the cap. You might be able to see it without removal.

That's a part number, not a code. Serial number will be below the
alternator stand. If it's the right one for the year, it should be a
"B" series, but it could be anything by now.

If you want to go that far with it, you can get an average by dividing
altitude gained by distance between the two points.
