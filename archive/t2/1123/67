On the point about RPM vs temp, when running tractors
under load, the surest way to overheat them is to use
too low a gear.  You want the RPM up to keep the fan
roaring.  The difficulty comes in if that means over-
revving whatever is attached to the PTO.

My 1993 Saab 900 has a then-mandated idiot light that
tells you to shift up whenever the RPM is over 2000
on the grounds of fuel efficiency.  Frankly, if it 
didn't require pulling the dash I'd cut the wire...
