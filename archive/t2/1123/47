but be careful the codes on an old bus may not be accurate. I have 
retumbled almost all my door locks to match my ignition switch so I only 
need one key.

the retumbling is not that hard and is in the library. so I suspect(know) 
that the codes on most of my locks are inaccurate. and I don't know how 
one could know if a lock has been retumbled,
