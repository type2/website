Subject: top rear shock bolt

Hello Tony, there are two possibilities; one, the welds that hold the
captured nut to the back of the shock tower have broken. Get a box end
wrench on it and remove as usual. Or two, the bolt has broken and it's
end is still very stuck in the nut (happened to me on my '77) take a 4"
angle grinder and grind a notch on the bottom of the nut next to the
shock tower to remove the bottom weld. Then, using a long chisel or
similar knock the nut off the tower. Replace with loose nut and you're
good to go. Hope this helps, Timo P.S. where are you in N.J.? I'm a Fair
Lawn in Bergen County refugee from way back.
