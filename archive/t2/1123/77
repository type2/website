	That should be 'too high a gear'.

	I didn't know Saab had ever done anything so stupid.

	This inveighing against lugging is especially valuable for 
engines during the running-in (USA: break-in) period.  It is far more 
harmful, with far higher risk of seizure, to lug an engine at high 
load, high throttle opening, and low revs, than to let it spin up 
merrily with plenty cooling air.
