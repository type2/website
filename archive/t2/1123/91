Subject: Re: [T2] seat belts

My grandparents used to get a catalog with all sorts of cheap lifestyle 
gadgets that made life "easier". There was a gadget to tell you when the 
mailman came. A gadget for reaching the oatmeal container on the top 
shelf. Something to help you clip toenails easier. Something for the 
family dog or cat.

Anyhow - they sold "seatbelt extenders". It was a short length of 
seatbelt material with the right clips on both ends that clipped into 
the seatbelt belt lock and onto the end of the seatbelt clasp. I don't 
know how to explain it exactly.

Dunno if it was one kind fits all or if you had to tell the retailer 
what brand your vehicle was. Might only be available for Toyota Camry's, 
Buicks, and Mercury Marquis. GRIN!
