go hunting for a broken fixed nut...

the captive nut at the top of the shock mount has come adrift. it's a  
difficult thing to repair, the access in there is very limited. i  
fixed one on a '78 the other week and it took me at least 30 minutes  
to get the nut started on the big screw. if you have a helper with  
small hands it would be easier.
