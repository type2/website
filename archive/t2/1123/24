Welcome Mandy.

Others have answered the fuel question. Clean and repair (seal with
POR-15) rather than replace.

I read the eBay pitch and I'm more concerned about these sections when
they are combined:

"i have been restoring for almost 3 years."
"i bought it from the original owner in 2007, who had not driven in
years"

*** "then went to brake system and all brakes and calipers were still
good and working properly" ***

The "soft parts" of brakes that have not been used in 3 to 15+ years
need to be replaced --- NOW! Replace the rear shoes and front pads.
After sitting that long they may separate from their backing plates and
cause all kinds of havoc before you can stop.

And, most important, replace *ALL* of the rubber brake lines that
connect to the wheels. They may look great on the outside but inside
they will have deteriorated and may blow out and cause you to
suddenly lose braking. Or they may clog and prevent your brakes from
properly releasing. I had that happen on a rescue I was towing many
years ago. It wasn't tight enough for me to feel the drag on the tow
vehicle but seeing the flames in the mirror when the front tire caught
on fire was really neat (NOT!).
