I agree with the list concensus. Your engine should be more powerful than
that. My guess is the accelerator linkage is not adjusted all the way. I had
that problem on a few occasions. I took my 68 bus with 1600 cc engine to high
country last year. There were 4 adults, 1 teenager, a dog and too much camping
equipment. we made it. Occasionally we had to drop it into second on the
steepest inclines but other than that, no problem.

I would expect you to be able to pull it in third, although 4th might be a
stretch.

Are you sure your timing, ignition, and valves are all dialed in?

Is your accelerator cable adjusted such that when the pedal is on the floor,
the carb is at full throttle?  (You can use a brick on the pedal to check)
