drain all the fuel and replace it and the gas lines and the filter.

any gas more than a few months old should be considered suspect
your bus may have 39 year old gas lines, they should be replaced
and of course change the oil and the gas and air filter.

oh and don't forget your first purchase should be the Bentley manual for 
your model bus.

yes pulling gas tanks is difficult and getting decent spares next to 
impossible.    hopefully you do not need a new fuel tank. there are things 
like POR15 that have gas tank restoration kits that work reasonably well.
