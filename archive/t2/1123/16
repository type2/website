Subject: Carb Question????

Hello Ben, did you check if the electronic cutoff jet is functioning?
It's the barrel shaped thing with the wire going to it on the left side
of the carb. Have someone turn the ignition on and off or with ignition
on, engine not running, pull the wire to it off and you should hear it
click open / closed. Hope this helps, Timo
