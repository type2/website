Subject: Re: [T2] FAST idle  -  the (partial) answer to broken throttle

One should be able to rig a string/wire to the throttle and run it up to 
the driver to tug on for some throttle control?  If no string, maybe 
duct tape and shoestring and a stick from a nearby bush?  Even a yanked 
heater cable could be used. An engine access lid would make this easier, 
but you could prop open the rear hatch and run it in through there. For 
enhanced leverage I'd wire/tie a stick, nail, screwdriver, across the 
throttle so pulling on the end can turn the throttle.  I'd also see if 
the cable tube is accessible so one could bypass it from under the bus-
