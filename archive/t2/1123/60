I rekeyed several of my locks to match my ignition so I only need one key. 
turned out to be a fairly simple prochedure

I am pretty sure the way to do it is in the library.
don't think the ignition can be retumbled, haven't tried but the others 
are fairly straight forward, especially if you have a couple extra locks 
for the spare tumblers.
