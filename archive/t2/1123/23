Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus

Welcome Mandy,

John Muir's Idiot book for starters and the Bentley manual for technical
stuff.

Drain that tank and swap fuel filters often for awhile.

Replace your fuel lines immediately, as most of us do with a new bus.

Listen to the chatter on the list and read the dictionary on type2.com.
You'll do fine with the great knowledge on the list.

I'm near Nashville, so hit me up for a local connect if you get stuck on
anything.

Good luck!

Billy
