Subject: Expecting too much?

The last bus I had was a 1972 with a 1800 yeah I don't know why.. But it
seemed to have a LOT of get up and go no matter what my load was.. Yesterday
with camping gear 3 adults and two children I was having toubble getting up
some steep hills in the country with my 1970 1600 like 15 mph in second gear
at I would say a 3-5% grade going to 200ft to 900ft.. IS there an effective
way to get more power out of my 1600? Or am I just expecting too much..
