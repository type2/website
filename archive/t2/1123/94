Hey,

I think the heat this past couple weeks have killed my 69 Westy.  I has been
over 90 for past couple weeks in MD and is so suppose to 105 tomorrow.

I have noticed in the mornings reverse works as normal, but after the day
heats up shifting in reverse I can actually squeal wheels! Everything else
runs fine but reverse feels like it going the through the tranny into the yard
next door.

Any one have any ideas what this is?!


Clear skies,

Brian
69 Westy with original engine
