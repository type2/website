Subject: RE: [T2] Expecting too much?

Thanks guys for all the advice.. Im headed out there to take a look at the
linkage now.. 

I updated Maye's website http://www.joshuapatterson.info/?page_id=451 with
her engine facts.. where do I find an identifying mark on the distributor
without removing it..  

1600cc Engine, Engine Code 113 129 701 AA
Single Carb Solex H30/31PICT
Single Vacuum Advance Distributor

Thanks for the compliment on the compression.. she really does run like a
top... that's why I was a little irritated but hey im a fat guy (300lbs) my
wife is 120lbs her mother is 200-250 who knows our three kids totally about
180lbs and I guess I could download the data from my gps to find the
altitude data on the incline but I have no idea how to find a degree result
from raw numerical data if anyone is a math wiz and knows how to find that
equation please let me know..
