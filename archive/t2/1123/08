Subject: throttle cable fix?

	The inner having broken last Sat (evoking my minor adventure 
plodding home), I now request wisdom from those who've replaced the 
throttle cable.
	'73 but with T1 motor.  Break in inner is very near front 
(<1' of inner pulled out to front).
	On the face of it, never having done it before, I suppose I 
could firmly attach to the rear end of the inner a replacement inner, 
and then push that fw.
	On the other hand, I guess the outer could after all these 
years be now defective, e.g  damaged so that abrasion at that damage 
wore thru the inner.
	Is it false economy to bother with a new inner?  Am I right 
in supposing a whole new cable is much more expensive than a mere new 
inner?  Is the whole cable much harder to install (by, I guess, 
attaching the new whole cable to the old and then pulling it thru?)

cheers
