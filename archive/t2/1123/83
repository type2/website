Subject: RE: [T2] Expecting too much?

Compression & plugs done a about a month ago 145 area all the way around,
valves done last week. I know I need to find a carb expert as it seems I do
need a little tuning I have not checked the cable yet... and I will look at
what model carb is on there when Im down there as well.. Timing might be of
issue to however I don't have a strobe gun to check it..  :-( 

If anyone who knows timing in the Portland area would like a free beer or
two to help me with the timing that would be cool :-)
