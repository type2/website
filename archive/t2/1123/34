Hi Doug,
 
I would only bend them back until I could find a good used one. They cannot be
expenisve. They are made from spring metal. If they are already bent, then the
metal is fategued and will probably bend again. They are probably pretty hard
to bend in the first place. They should be so tight that it takes quite a bit
of pressure to pry them off with a screw driver. You don't want it poping
loose and loose your valve cover while going down the street. I don;t think
that I have any in my parts stash, but I will take a look.

For those of you with upright engines, do you re bend the valve cover bails,
or buy new ones when they become too lose?
