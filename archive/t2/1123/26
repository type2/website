Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus

Hi Mandy,

 

Welcome to the list.

 

It seems like most folks are leaning towards clogged fuel line.

 

I checked the eb*y link to your new bus. The PO claimed he flushed the fuel
tank and replaced all the fuel lines. This means different things to
different people, and can sometimes cause some short term harm. 

 

I'm not sure how he flushed the tank, with it inside the bus. When I read
that someone flushed their fuel tank-I think that means remove, and actually
put a bunch of cleaning fluid into it-letting it drain out.doing it again,
until it runs clear.or something like that.

 

He may have just put some fuel line cleaner into the gas. This is good for
small deposits, but I think if you had bigger deposits, then these could get
loosened up into chunks and then cause some clogging. (Side note about
seller-his claims that putting sheepskin slip covers over front seats is
more expensive than actually re-upholstering seats sounds bogus, and
indicates perhaps not entirely upfront about what he did and did not do)

 

I think the suggestion to get under the bus, and remove the nut that holds
the fuel line to the tank, and let the tank drain makes sense. I recommend a
filter between the tank and the fuel pump, and another between the pump and
the carb. If you are not sure where these things are-wait until you get your
Bentley and Muir guide. 

 

Be very careful when working around fuel! Have extinguisher nearby, no
sparks, disconnect battery. I'm not sure about the '71, but usually the
starter is right near the fuel line connection to the tank, a little slip of
your hand, could give the spark that ends your VW career.

 

Good luck, and let us know when you get the fuel line cleared, and you can
get an idle.
