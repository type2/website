The fact that it ran but did not idle suggests to me that the idle 
curcuit in your carb may be blocked- It should be cleaned (remove any 
jets and blow out the carb with air; if it it looks "gummy", then it and 
jets must be soaked in carb cleaner also.  Running but not idling could 
also be due to poor distributor functioning, such as it sticking and not 
timing right at idle, or the points are too closed if it has points. 
I'd purchase a strobe timing light and a tach/dwell meter to check on 
both latter problems.
    I'd also buy a locking hose clamp at a parts place, or make one from 
a needlenose vicegrip with the edges rounded on a grinder. Lock it to 
the hose from tank to filter just enough to crush it to close; if it 
cracks the hose it was a bad hose and replace the fuel lines. Disconnect 
the hose from the filter and have a bucket handy to release the clamp 
and LOOK AT WHAT RUNS OUT- does it flow freely, slowly, maybe brown, 
maybe silty (rust and gum)? Fully drain the tank anyway as gas may be 
old, add a gallon more and watch what runs out.  If it clears you can 
wait on engine/tank pull.
    Re brakes, I agree parts may be old- I'd jack it up one axle at a 
time and spin the wheels as someone appliers the brakes- they should 
return to spinning freely.  Look for signs of fluid leaking from the 
cylinders. Check the brake fluid in the reservoir by driver seat- is it 
brownish or clear?  Look up flushing the brake lines and do that if the 
above seems ok.  The bleeders on the cylinders should be sprayed with 
Kreul or other thread loosener before trying to turn them.  Us a six 
sided box wrench on them, not a 2 sided open wrench!  If they don't want 
to turn, tap the wrench with a hammer.
