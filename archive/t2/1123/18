Subject: Re: [T2] top rear shock bolt... ;-(

I have never done this,, but i wonder if you could zip off the head of the
bolt.. and punch the shaft and the captive nut out thru the hole...
you could use a hack saw. or a sawsall.. or a 4" grinder ... ewww..
if the nut is loose.. then the bolt should go out that way...

maybe not
