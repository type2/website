That's what he said. The question is "how steep". We only have his
"guesstimate". Without being there to see how steep, we can't really
judge whether his bus is running up to par or not. But is certainly is
a good idea to make the checks recommended to see if more power is to
be had. Note the Type 1 engine is to be statically timed, so a timing
light is not needed.
