Subject: Carb question????

Hi Folks
         I have a question regarding my 73 Bus 1600 eng 34 pict carb. After
either pumping or pouring gas into the carb it starts and runs OK. I can keep
it running for about a minute constantly playing with the throttle but
eventually it dies. I have rebuilt the carb and have check for air leaks etc
but no difference. I removed the carb and re-checked it, I have removed the
servo air line no difference. All the carb parts are new,  it has a mechanical
dist. I checked the fuel pump and it appears to be pumping the gas fine. I
haven't check plugs points etc because I'm convinced its either gas or
air-vacuum problem. Any ideas suggestions would be appreciated.
                           Cheers Ben (irishrover)
