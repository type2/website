Subject: Electrical short in a '70

Hi folks,

A couple of months ago I posted a question about an electrical problem I was
having with my '70, but before I could attempt a fix I had to leave the
country for awhile.  I'm back now and want to deal with this, but before I
start pulling out wires I thought I'd pose a single question for the
electrical experts among you.

The question is this -- What would cause thes specific symptoms: Turn the key
to "on", and there are no instrument lights (gen/oil) but there's power
because the engine starts.  Once the engine is running, the gen light comes on
(dimmer at idle, brighter at higher revs).

I'm looking for a clue about which circuit I should focus on.  Thanks!

Best,
Jerry
