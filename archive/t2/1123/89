Subject: Pict 3 carb rebuild kits?

Hello Volks,
I've been lurking a while, although I've been a member/subscriber since the late '90s. Had to take a VW break while the kids were born. 
Now I've got a neighbor in high school who I'm helping get his $600 special back on the road. It's a '76 with a '74 motor and dual carbs. The carbs leak like crazy and need a rebuild. Last night he carefully took them apart in my garage. He doesn't have the $70 for the rebuild kits and asked me if I had any. I searched my stuff and didn't have anything hanging around that would do, so I thought I would see if anyone out there had some old rebuild kits lying around that they never used. The carbs are the PICT 3 carbs. He can pay for shipping. 
Thanks,
Joel in Philly
