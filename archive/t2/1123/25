Thanks to everyone for the responses!

I'll go by the bookstore today and pick
up the idiot's guide to aircooled vw.  
That should give me a better idea of
what I'm dealing with.  


This weekend I will go thru the brakes (per
Gerald's suggestion)  and try to fix 
any gremlins hiding there.

To airic,
the spare says Gulf Viking 78.  It's old and about to explode.  It 
even has
the old Gulf oil logo on it.

Thanks again,
More questions to come in the
future!
