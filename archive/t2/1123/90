Okay - I'll agree with you. I had a friend who lost his key and called a 
"locksmith" (cheap) to make him a new key so my friend could drive his 
car home. Fellow owned a car with one key. No copies. I thought it was 
interesting that it could be done but there is NO WAY outside of an 
emergency I would let anyone do that to my vehicle.

Thanks for your information to the list! Good solid information worth 
keeping (and I am b/c I want to rekey everything to the same key. My bus 
uses two keys).
