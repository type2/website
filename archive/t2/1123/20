For everyone on the list may I saw welcome to the club!  :D

You are going to have many hours of pleasure from your new baby, people will wave, smile and give you the thumbs up, talk with you in the parking lot and you will appreciate what it is to be a Bus owner.  Before you know it you're going to try to figure out how to pull those seats, put in a pop-up top, stove, sink, bed, 52" wide screen and hit the open road!

Enjoy

PS:  Can't help you with the tank, there are more skillful individuals on the list that can help you with that.
