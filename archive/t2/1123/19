Subject: my new bus

Hello everyone,

I'm new here.  I just got my first VW!  It's a 1971
Transporter.  I'm in love 
with it!

The shipper just dropped it off on
Sunday and I took it for a short drive.  It 
didn't want to idle.  Anytime I
take it out of gear, it would stall.

So, I looked at the clear fuel filter,
and what I saw shocked me.  It is the 
rustiest gas i have ever seen.  i can't
believe the poor bus even drove with 
that fuel.  


I've done a little
research and found out that the fuel tank is rather hard to 
reach, you have
to pull the engine, right?  And if I do manage to get the tank 
out, where
could I find a new one?   I'm ready and willing to learn, but my 
mechanical
experience is limited.  


Thanks is advance,
I can't wait to get my bus fixed
so i can actually drive it.
