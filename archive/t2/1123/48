Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical short in a '70  SOLVED

I wanted to update the list on the resolution of an electrical problem.  The 
symptoms were that the ignition lights didn't come on when I turned the key, 
and after the bus started, the gen light came on.

A member of the list said that he solved an identical problem by replacing 
the fuses.  My fuse box was a jumbled combination of white, red, and blue 
fuses and one fuse out of an old radio.  I'd alway meant to get them all 
back in order but never did.  I took this opportunity to replace every fuse 
with one of the right amperage.  And my problem went away.

I've had my bus 21 years and wouldn't have survived without the support of 
people on this list.  Thanks.

Best,
Jerry
