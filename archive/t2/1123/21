Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus

what kind of tire is that spare?  Got to amazon.com and buy the idiots guide 
to the air cooled VW.  read the whole book.  I have the fealing you might 
need to get into fixing your car mode.  drain fuel, remove nut on botton of 
tank, remove nut and filter assembly, replace as required, every 3000 miles 
or so, until you don;t get nasty fuel coming out of there.  plus removing 
the engine, is only about 20 minutes, your second time. YMMV

if you don't get it, there are tons of articles on this lists webpage, that 
will tell you most anything you need.
