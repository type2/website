Subject: seat belts

I am having seat belt problems ever since I owned the van.

I am a 49 year old "stick". I get to use 1/2 of the belt.

My father-in-law won't fit no matter what I do. 6 inches too short.

So, what do I do?

Just buy a seat belt and use the lower have to solve my problem, or is
there another consensus solution?

Alan
