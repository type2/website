Yes the guages do overlap, but each gives some info the others don't.
When you start up the cold engine, the oil temp is lower.  as the oil warms
up, the oil pressure will drop.  This is normal, you want the engine to warm
up.
Everything warms up much quicker with the thermostat installed.
I generally would start with oil pressure and temp, but head temp is good too.

 I haven't worried about volts, I figure the idiot light is good enough.

 I had a tach in my 61, but the thing is I got to know what rpms it does at
what speeds, so I ended up removing it to have a cleaner looking dash.

I like an oil temp guage that goes up to 250 F (or to 120 C).   Then I can
watch it warm up.
 I don't want my oil temp to reach 250, and if it is above 250F it is way too
hot anyway.    I don't like the ones up to 300F, as the useful part of the
guage is smaller.
