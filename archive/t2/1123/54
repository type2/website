Catering to those who don't look in the archives  -  at the price of 
putting more bytes into them O:-)  -  let me repeat:-

	The gauges don't look too flash as I compressed the pic to a 
truly skinny 36K.

	This position on top of the dash in front of the steering 
wheel minimises deviation of sight from normal driving line-of-sight. 
You're more likely to spot any anomaly in the position of a gauge 
needle this way.
	That's the only disagreement I have with John Kolak's excellent advice.

	Tilts (yaw & pitch) should be carefully adjusted wrt 
reflections in windscreen, before you finally lash down the panel 
with a scrap of bicycle innertube going down thru the screen heater 
vents (which are not seriously obstructed thereby).
	The 'sunshade' on top is worthwhile (a scrap of Corflute) to 
minimise stray light to & from the gauges.
