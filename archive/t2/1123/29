be careful at tire shops, they will try to sell you what they have in 
stock not necessarily what the bus needs.   unfortunately the buses are 
VERY heavy for their size and have small wheels only a couple tire will 
have the appropriate weight rating.  the type 2 library has a lot of 
information on tires.  but the tire MUST have a "C" or "D" weight rating 
and be light truck tires NEVER NEVER NEVER a P rated tire.
  check the tires that are on the van they may be too light duty to be 
safe.   don't know what you paid for the van but sounds like you will need 
to put $750-1,000 extra to make it a safe reliable ride...unfortunately 
unless you buy from a known bus pilot you are likely to get a ride that 
has been cleaned up to sell rather than quality replacement parts.

BTW Bus Depot (no I don't work for them) sells correct tires, I got my 
tires from NTB but they had to order them.  they are Aglis 81 (now 61) 
tires, made by michelin so not cheap but have never had one fail.

might try to find a local from this list that can take a look at your van 
and maybe sit nearby while you do your first engine drop, fortunately the 
71 must have the easiest engine drop of any bus, I used to have one and 
could pull the engine without even jacking the bus up.

don't need a lot of tools but buy quality they will repay you by working 
correctly for many years.
