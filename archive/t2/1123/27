Mandy, after draining the bad fuel and before deciding to pull the engine 
and replace the fuel tank, you could consider using a Por-15 product called 
FUEL PRESERVATIVE & STABILIZER that is advertised to clean fuel lines and 
stop rust formation & prevent gun and varnish buildup. If that doesn't 
clean up your system, there are other levels of intervention between the 
present condition and total tank replacement.
