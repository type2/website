Subject: Marietta Ohio Campsite recommendations wanted

Hi Volks,

On Monday I will be leaving Toronto heading to High Country Bus
Festival. Our first stop along the way will be a visit to the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. To get there by noon I will have to
leave the house around 6AM, which is fine since that will also help
avoid the brutal Toronto rush hour.

After spending the afternoon at the RaRHoF the plan is to get back on
the road heading south on I-77 for a few more hours in order to cut down
on the distance we will need to cover on Tuesday.

If anyone can recommend a campground somewhere around Marietta OH that
would be great. From there it will only be another 5 hours drive to HCBF
on Tuesday, which will be a fairly easy haul.

Happy Trails,
