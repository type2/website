Subject: throttle cable replacement

	I'm trying to save money by buying the inner from not a VW or 
other vehicle dealer but by the yard from a marine chandler.  This 
could lead to a useful entry in our archives.


	Before I plunge in to a purchase, I'd be grateful for any experience:-

1.  I measure the old one at 1.4mm ;  given my instrumentation, about 
which no-one should ask, that could be 1.3 mm.
	Has anyone tried a larger dia, e.g  1.5mm?  If the tube 
continues rearward with the ID visible at the front, there would 
appear to be some scope for a fatter cable if that's the smallest I 
can find.

2.  Am I right in thinking it need not be stainless (provided the 
corrugated rubber boot is re-installed on the front to exclude water)?

3.  One listee advised me to ease grease in with the new inner.  But 
an experienced mechanic says that will ultimately harden, and prefers 
spray-on PTFE (teflon).
	I have yet to be convinced of the 'hardening' theory, and I 
have plenty grease on hand, a sunk cost  ...   Most of it is not 
lithium grease; does that matter?
