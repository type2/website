Subject: Compression question

After doing my last compression test, all 4 cylinders came in right at  
125 which of course I was pleased with. My question is this... If just  
out of sheer curiosity I did a top end job on my bus (hone job and new  
rings) and in the process found that my heads were in good enough  
shape to be left alone, what kind of change should I expect to see in  
performance? Would I see a significant jump in compression, and what  
benefit would that provide on a 36 year old bus?

I'm always curious to know what kind of effect simple upgrades can  
have on older engines.

Thanks!
