Tom,

I've used Dynamat Extreme as well as Damplifier Pro in my bus. I like the 
Damplifier Pro a little better.
Both are a bit $$$.

On top of the Damp and Dynamat I have 2 layers of the old JC Whitney NASA 
insulation. Second Skin sells it as Heat Wave. I found the manufacturer and 
thru my company purchased a 50' roll. Used most of it. Found the Dynamat on 
Ebay for a steal some years ago.
Have this stuff in all 4 back doors, the hatch, the ceiling, the walls, even 
under the ceiling panels in the cab ( I have a delivery type bus). The nose, 
as best I could. In the front doors, only the Dynamat due to water 
incursion.  All wheel wells have 2 layers of Dynamat. The floor over engine 
compartment has 2 layers of dynamat and a layer of Heat Wave. This is a 
heavily insulated bus. Front floor has a layer of Heat Wave under the 
standard rubber mat. Not much has not been covered. Oh yeah, the roof of the 
engine compartment has a layer of Heat Wave.

I can hear the radio fairly well while doing 65 on the freeway. Previously, 
no way. While dbA readings are in the mid to high 70's on the freeway, dbC 
readings are at around 94-98 due to a low frequency rumble from my engine. 
Needs something balanced. I have a Radio Shack noise meter.

Chris,

Did you use it in a bus?

If so, what did you cover/coat?

Cheers,
