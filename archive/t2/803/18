Subject: How to tell if a Tranny is Good??

Years ago I got a 'free' trans that seemed difficult to shift.  Dewey Alter, a  
senior Volksbuddy (whom I relied on for advice at the time) told me he always 
would soak transmissions, diffs, etc in solvent for several days before 
installing.  I've done that since he gave me the advice, and would recommend it 
to you.  Clean the exterior pretty well; then find a vessel/container.  I used 
builder's polyethylene sheet as a liner... you can block-off unused volume with 
wood blocks between the poly and container. I had luck with kerosene or diesel 
fuel.  Leave the plugs out and then blow everything clean.  If this doesn't 
clear up your shifting issues, maybe some others on this list can advise 
further.  The Vanagon list guys liked a trans rebuilding shop in the Pacific NW 
area, A&A IIRC.  

Hope this helps, 
Glenn

I need some help before I install a bad tranny... 
have another tranny, 6 rib to that I can install but I know nothing about the 
tranny.  Its caked with grime but doesn't seem to be leaking.  If I spin the 
shaft both CV axles spin.  the shift rod is a little tough to shift without 
adding a helper.  The previous tranny shifted very easily when out of the bus.  
How can i check the tranny???  Oh yea I plan to drain the tranny to look for 
chucks of steel and stuff...
