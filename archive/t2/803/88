It's not just this list; I'm also on the Type 3 mailing list (y'know, 
Squarebacks 'n stuff) and the overall feel and maturity level over there 
is much the same as it is here.  I even try and cross-pollenate some 
of the technical info from there into the T2 world when it's potentially 
useful .. such as that Goodyear 5/16inch "not for fuel injection" hose 
passes a 250psi burst test and is just fine to use on our FI systems 
(info from a T3 listee who works at Mahle-Parr's filtering & testing 
facility in Iowa)   :-)

I think a lot of it simply has to do with "us" being owners & enthusiasts
of "vintage" aircooled VW's who aren't building racecars.  That and 
good moderators.
