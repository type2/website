Actually it's <insert appropriate eff word of your choice> local auto 
parts store. Could be 'friendly... Could be a different eff word. 
Depends on the situation. My local NAPA has been my FRIENDLY local auto 
parts store for years.  Last Saturday I went in to find new "help." I'd 
use a different eff word to describe the place now.  New "help" won't 
last....
