Subject: Timing and lifters-2 questions

Howdy,   I've got 2 buses...a '72 and a '77, both with stock engines.  I 
static time my buses at 7 1/2degrees BTDC.   They've both been timed by 
local shops recently and when I got home anc checked the timing they both 
are timed at 10degrees BTDC.  Why the difference between their strobe timing 
efforts and my static timing efforts?  Should I be static timing them to 10 
degrees BTDC or are they doing it "right" and achieving maximum performance 
results?  Should I be investing in a strobe light??  I've never adjusted 
dwell.
                    2nd question:  I'm told that there is a visible way to 
look underneath my engine (with valve covers off?) to verify that my engine 
has solid lifters vs. hydraulic lifters.  ('77 stock)  Can someone enlighten 
me as to how to do this and what exactly to look for.   Thanks in advance, 
Kevin  Snow
