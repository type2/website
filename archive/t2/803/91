Max,

It all sounds very inexpensive to me. Cheap even. Rebuilding the rods, as
long as it is done right - are the rods all the same length when they are
done, is the resizing done accurately - is a ideal. Like anything else in an
engine, the rods wear, which means the dimensions change. Rebuilding
corrects this.

Yeas also to polishing the crank. It is just good practice.
