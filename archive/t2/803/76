He said he would put new exhaust valves in, check the other valves and guides.
He said he would clean them up and would check that all the springs were
within spec. The guy said he has been in business for 40 years and he loves
working on VW heads. A general reconditioning is what he defined his work with
the heads as.

Rods sound right, but $60 for heads sound really really cheap.

What are they doing to them for $60?

Not to screw up a good deal on the heads if it is good, but what *are*
they doing to them?

Cheers, dave
