Subject: South Carolina -to- Maryland

I will be relocating from Md. to S.C. over the next few months.  Regarding my 
1969 Bay, one of the options I'm considering is an offer (at a reasonable 
price) by my neighbor Dave, who owns a 2-axle trailer and a new Diesel pickup.

If I take Dave up on this, he and I would be coming back from South Carolina to 
Maryland with an empty trailer.  Anyone see this as an opportunity?
