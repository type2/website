Without buying a tool, I am sure the physics guys (George?) will jump in 
on this-
  Barry, you should be able to figure out a way to at least compare the 
eveness or relative strength of springs or the force needed to compress 
a spring to some depth:-
1. Find a pipe that fits inside spring and place upright in bench. 
Slide spring over it. Find another pipe that slides over the first and 
use a washer between the spring and the upper pipe- you can make one 
from a piece of thin plywood or plexiglass.  Load the upper pipes with 
weights  (try creating a platform on the upper pipe that will hold 
bricks. I'd drill a big hole in a piece of 4x4 post at least 3" and 
slide it over the upper pipe).  The weight required to compress a spring 
to half its height would be a good starting point.
2. Simpler to try to unload the spring and make it a crude spring 
balance- hang it by a wire loop and then at the bottom put another loop 
so the same number of turns are between the loops.  Add (hang) weight to 
the lower and see how much you need to lengthen it by 1 cm?.
3. There might be a way one can rig up a torque wrench to a socket 
extension slide through a small pipe kept in a vise, with a lever of 
some sort that will push on the spring?
