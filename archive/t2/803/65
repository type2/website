Karl,

From my very own copy of...wups...

"Pocket Mechanic" by Peter Russek

Had a sticky on the cover so I didn't realize it wasn't the "real" 
"Without Guesswork".

This is the equivalent that Busdepot used sell(still does?).

Printed in England....durn it..probably European specs?  But it 
specifically lists 1.7 and then 1.8-2.0

Guess the Cousins never got hydraulic lifters....


Hmmm....would look for my real copy of "without", but my house is 
destroyed 
right now waiting for the carpet layers to show up and install new 
carpet...might be able to find my "real" copy a little later.

Cheers, dave
