<<I tried to heat the studs and remove them with an 8mm stud puller, but
no joy. My auto mechanic said to NOT heat the stud.>>

Your wrench is right Barry.
Don't heat the stud, heat the area around it.

Get yourself a decent stud puller that will fit on the end of your 3/8's
drive rachet, and they will back right out.

Simple.


Good Luck,
