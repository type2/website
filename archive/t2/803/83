<<Just get them new for $140 a piece and you still come below the price

That's $280.00 for some garbage Bus Depot third world aftermarket heads.

( But they are actually $190.00 $360 a pair for my 74 )

I'm was talking about using stainless valves amd hardened seats in the
exhaust ports so they won't burn up as easy,and a little shaving to the
heads will gave me a little boost in the compression area--plus all new
guides, a valve job.

The head gasket set includes, the valve cover gaskets as well as the
o-rings for the push rod tubes.
