<I too belong to a list of the Mazda 3 variety, and it does NOT
pass along sensible advice or support, mostly an age thing I think.> 

Same for the late model watercooled VW scenes I have peeked at. Anyone want to start a flame war just for the fun of it? We could debate paint, then switch to tires, then oils, and so on... Maybe get our librarians (Karl and Richard and others) going looking for tiny details and then throw in some politics and religion... 

Nah. Not worth it... 

In the 8 years I've been on the net Type2.com is the one list I have stayed subscribed to most of the time. The Corvair lists, the Tatra lists, the watercooled VW lists have come and gone with me but I have kept Type2 close b/c you great folks have educated me, given me new ideas to consider, and all through it like Mark and Courtney said - kept cool heads and a polite demeanor about it... 

Thank you too...

FWIW As I continue to move to Linux 100% of the time, I have worked on keeping my Eudora e-mail program b/c my Type2 e-mail archive is that important to me. CrossOver Office (aka Wine) has been the key software. Runs Windows software in Linux.
