Subject: valve springs on hydraulic lifters

My question is on the springs in the heads that close the valves.

With hydraulic lifters, I believe that the exhaust valves need a special, 
stronger spring than with the solid lifters.  Do the intake valves ALSO need 
the same, stronger spring or can I use the solid lifters springs??

There must be some way to measure the strength of the springs.  Any ideas 
out there??  My engine rebuilder, who mostly does type 1 engines, says he 
can feel the difference when he is putting the springs on the heads.  But 
this is a type 1 head(s), and he uses a basic valve spring compressor 
attaches tot he top od the head.  I use a huge C-Clamp styled valve spring 
compressor, and I don't believe I can tell any difference.

Thanks  - Barry  Springfield VA
