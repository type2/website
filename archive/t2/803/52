I was critical a while back during a thread on digital gauges and thought I'd offer an update. 

We had put a set of them in a hot rod about 10 years ago. Couldn't remember the name so I asked my father. Cyberdyne was the brand. Surely they are better now but Dad mentioned we needed to pull his Speedo AGAIN as it recently died AGAIN... <grin!> 3rd time? 4th? Hot Rod truck ('49 Chevy) has less than 10K miles on it...

'78 Westy 2,7L - combination of VW VDO stock and VDO Cockpit gauges - all still working...
