Subject: Re: [T2] what the kids are doing these days

I think there's a lot of good bus progeny waiting to fill our shoes on this
list.

My boys love the bus.  My oldest drew hydraulic diagrams while I swapped
transmissions on my old '65.
They open my busdepot shipments and analyze part quality for me.

It's a good match, buses/kids.
