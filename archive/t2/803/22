I believe all 8 springs are heavier. Not sure how you will get those
springs, unless they are good used. The dealer might still have them

Valve spring tester. Not to cast any aspersions on your engine builder, but
this is a pretty standard tool for a builder to have in the shop.

Do a google search for "valve spring tester" and you will see what I am
speaking about.
