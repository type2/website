Thanks for the comment.

Now bugger off!

(just kidding)

Yes, the bus list is the most helpful one I've come across.  Most lists
for more modern cars tend to be occupied by folks who don't know which end
of the soldering iron to hold and with no interest in learning.  All they
want to know is things like "will these kewl wheels look good on my rice
rocket?"
