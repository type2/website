Subject: '79 bus for $50 in Massachusetts

Have 79 Bus. Just trying to save it from the wrecking yard. . It was in 
good shape and ran well as my regular vehicle until parked outside in 1991. 
Has since gotten rusted spots on it. It could probably be restored, but it 
is certainly at least good for parts. All original parts. Its just been 
sitting here all this time. All tires still inflated. Just want $50 that the 
junk guy will give me for it. I would Much rather see someone make use of 
it.

This bus is in southeastern Massachusetts.
