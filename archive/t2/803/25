Subject: R & R Exhaust Studs - Northern Virginia

Thanks for all the responses regarding valve springs on hydraulic lifters.

This site explained a lot for me::

http://www.hastingsmfg.com/Service%20Tips/valve_spring_inserts.htm

I have a pair of 2 liter heads from a hydraulic lifter '78 GE engine, and 
onle ONE of the heads had 'valve spring inserts / spacers / seats' .  Now I 
know why.

Now I need to replace EIGHT exhaust studs.  The heads are out and stripped 
and cleaned, but the exhaust studs a eaten up by salt.  I have already 
ordered a supply of 8 x 9 x 56mm exhaust studs, and I need to pull the 
existing studs,.

Or, can someone recommend a machine shop in northern Virginia (Fairfax) that 
can do the job reasonably...  PERFORMANCE in Newington VA is too overwhelmed 
for this kind of work.

I tried to heat the studs and remove them with an 8mm stud puller, but no 
joy.  My auto mechanic said to NOT heat the stud.

And I am afraid to try the double nut trick 'cause of breaking off a stud.

So I need a real machine shop.

Thanks.
