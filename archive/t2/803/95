I "did" the Brit car scene a little when I was a kid. Can't afford some of the clubs' "attitudes". From what I hear it mirrors a portion of the Brit society... <griN!> Nope, like the cars, can't do the "scene". 

Never will forget Road Atlanta Brit car show Dad told me me about. They drove their Austin Healey down (1980's show). Skies opened up and everyone got soaked - except the Morgan club who had a "circus" tent with chandeliers and catered food. Invited nobody into the tent and turned away quite a few. Mom and Dad were parked right next to the tent. Do you think they were invited in? Not hardly. Dad remembers sitting there in their little car with some fellow standing there under the edge of the tent drinking wine, eating something and watching my parents. Last Brit car show they ever went to.

FWIW I don't blame the cars, but some of the clubs... <grin!> I'd like to own a Porsche but it doesn't mean I am anything like the stereotype. Stereotypes have to start somewhere... <grin!>

TOTALLY different with the VW folks, hot rod folks, and most of the domestic antique car folks we've met over the years.
