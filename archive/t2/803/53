Subject: 1975 "shifter snout", holder bracket, bolt size and length

Hello all, I , in the recourse of putting the Westy back together, have lost 
the "tail snout" shifter hold up plate bolts. Other than crawling under the 
bus with a can of different size bolts inna rain, is there someone who can 
give me wrench head size, and length, so I can go to the local fasteners 
shop, and get the two I need?  Muchly appreciated!  It is a '75 Westy!  TIA
