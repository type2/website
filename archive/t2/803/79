The heads were completely rebuilt right before I bought the bus. About 13,000
miles ago. They are in really good condition. I pulled the engine to correct
the end thrust so that is getting taken care of. I agree the heads should be
done right but I don't think there is much to do on these. This is Idaho so
money is a bit different here. I got a quote for $120 from another shop to do
everything you mentioned. They were jerks though so I am going to go with the
other guy. Thank you for the input though. It is always appreciated.

<<He said he would put new exhaust valves in,>>

What about the valve seats?

<< check the other valves and guides.>>

What if it need new guides?

I'd forget the checking portion of the guides and as long as the heads
are on his bench just put new guides in.

<< He said he would clean them up and would check that all the springs
were within spec. The guy said he has been in business for 40 years and
he loves working on VW heads. A general reconditioning is what he
defined his work with the heads as.>>

The price is really cheap for what he's doing, but he isn't doing it
all.

I would have the heads totally rebuilt just because it's the kind of job
you only want to do once.

Have all the valves replaced, reground, replace all the guides and
grind/ replace the seats.

You'll be time and money ahead in the long run.

It cost me $350.00 for the heads done right, using hardened seats and
stainless valves on the exhaust ports, valve job on the intake side, all
new phosphorus bronze guides and seals, resurfacing the heads, and the
head gasket set.

$60.00 isn't going to get the job done right--not in the long run
anyway.
