Mark(and others),

Thanks!...it's a great list!

I think the key is "moderated"...and the rules.

I am on a particular Subaru list and it is pretty good.  Just like here, 
every one sort moderates themselves fairly well, and the moderators work 
well to keep the topic "on topic".

Yep, some "younger" posters who get their knuckles whacked every once in 
awhile, but otherwise fine.

Lots of folks as knowledgeable as on this list, but dealing with new 
cars....we hear that the "suits" as Subaru actually read the stuff on that 
list....not that it seems to help much, nice to know that *someone* is 
listening(maybe).

You should hear them talk about watercooled vw owners tho!...and VWOA
Their opinion(those that have had VW's) about VWOA is even worse than our 
opinion!...imagine that!

Lots of "mod" talk and performance talk...and best of all

Who is having warranty complaints and about what....Of course *we* don't 
have to worry about that stuff!

Cheers, dave

 It was such a contrast to this list that I feel the need to pat 
 everyone on this list on the back for being reasonably rational, 
 supportive, encouraging; for having a healthy respect for logic; and 
 most of all for having a sense of humor about our buses and for 
 generally being pretty good eggs.
