From Richard Atwell:

 >There must be some way to measure the strength of the springs.  Any ideas out there??

 Use a shop press and a bathroom scale:

Well, this is all well and good, but where have you found the specs for the hydraulic valve springs??

68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 36, bottom right corner:

Springs for a dual carb or FI engine should require a load of 76.5 to 84.5 kg (168 to 186 lb.) to compress
them to a loaded length of 29.0mm ( 1 9/64 in).

But no specs for the hydraulic springs. If the specs are the same then the part number would be the same.

Looked in the 80 - 85 Vanagon Bentley..... zero spring specs.

Anyone got a LATE bay Without Guesswork?

Up to the end of 72 Without Guesswork shows the same specs as Bentley
