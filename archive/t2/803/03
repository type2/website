Subject: How to tell if a Tranny is Good??

I need some help before I install a bad tranny.  I just bought a bus and 
pulled the bell housing planning to install a '78 2.0L into a 74 westy with an 002 
tranny.  When I did I found the differential gear all chewed up??  YUK!  I 
have another tranny, 6 rib to that I can install but I know nothing about the 
tranny.  Its caked with grime but doesn't seem to be leaking.  If I spin the 
shaft both CV axles spin.  the shift rod is a little tough to shift without 
adding a helper.  The previous tranny shifted very easilty when out of the bus.  
How can i check the tranny???  Oh yea I plann to drain the tranny to look for 
chucks of steel and stuff.  Any thing will help.

One more bonus question, I can supply a pic if required.  on the passengers 
side of the engine case, just before the mating flange to the bell housing 
there is small sensor??  What is this?? its on a FI 78 cali engine.
Thanks in advance
