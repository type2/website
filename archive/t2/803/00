Hello Dan  Be careful using these  I just had a BMW come in the shop that had 
the remains of one of these hanging by not much,  some quick oil change place 
put it in there  funny thing was there wasnt anything wrong with the threads  
I replaced it with a bolt and sealing washer   I am not too sure that that 
rubber will hold up too long soaking in oil . Personally I would just fix it 
right and be done but then I do this stuff for a living and own my own shop Later
