Subject: Re: [T2] tail light wiring covers?

Karl,

Yep, that's them!   But in better shape or preferably new.

The ones on the samba have a tear in one of the ears....will take them if 
I can't find new....and then fiberglass them before I use them.

New ones anyone?

Thanks Karl, dave

  I can't seem to find anyone that sells just the "wiring covers"
 for late bay taillight assemblies.
  
  The ones that go on the assemblies inside the engine compartment to seal
 them from the wiring side.
  
  Have I just missed them on one of the sites?
