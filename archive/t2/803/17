You also have a '65 Bus.  I should have twigged to the fact that you
posted to type2 instead of vintagebus, but since you've got both of them
in your .sig, I assumed you were talking about the '65.

>there is no blinkgeber ANYthing with just two black/Xcolor wires.

Unplug the blue (49a) and white (+49) wires from the blinkgeber and
connect them together.  This will do the same thing as what I said
before would do for a splitty.

Just black/white, I think - the wire for the left front.

They might have been run to the R and L terminals at the hazard flasher
- that's where the other fork of the black/white and black/green wires
from the T4 connector go.

>pps - wire 54f to 54 st SEEMS to be power to t/s switch;

That's actually the brake light wire, coming from the switches on the
master cylinder via the emergency light switch.  When the hazards aren't
on, the hazard switch passes this line straight through.  When the
hazards are on, the hazard switch uses this to help flash the rear
lamps.

Right.  Electrically, this wire "starts" at 49a on the flasher relay.
It is the pulsing output from the relay - if you hooked a tail light
bulb between 49a on the flasher relay and ground, it would flash as
long as it was hooked up.  The blue wire brings the juice from the
flasher relay to the three-way connector near the turn signal switch.
Here, it splits into two pieces: one black-white-green wire goes to
54 on the turn signal switch to provide pulsing voltage to run the
turn signals in normal driving, and another black-white-green wire
goes to 49a on the emergency flasher switch to provide pulsing voltage
to run the emergency flashers in an emergency.

Sounds like a bad contact inside the turn signal switch.

This sounds like the black-white-green wire at the turn signal switch
(54) is being kinda-sorta shorted to ground.  If it was a dead short,
the arrows in the speedo would light up once and then the fuse would
probably blow.  If the short has a few ohms of resistance, it will draw
enough current to start the flasher relay working and clicking, but not
enough current to light up the arrows on the dash.

The turn signals and brake lights aren't separate; they live in sin.
The brake lights go THROUGH the turn signal switch, so it can do the
trick of having the left brake light on steady and the right brake
light blinking when you're stopping and signaling for a right turn.
Trouble in the turn signal switch could conceivably result in the
turn signal flasher going 'tink' when you hit the brakes.

Looking at three handy catalogs (BFY, Wolfgang, Bus Depot), they all
list the 211 953 513 basic part number.  The suffix letter applications
are reasonably consistent.  Basically, it looks like a "G" switch should
work.  Here's what they show:

           BFY  W   BD
55-65      A   -   -
55-67      -   D   -
66-67      E   -   -
68-71      G   G   -
68-72      -   -   G
72         J   J   -
73         -   H   -
73-74      H   -   H
74-79      K   -   K
75-79      -   K   -

These catalogs are a bit old, but BFY wants $170, Wolfgang $137, and Bus
Depot $120.

This sounds like a reasonable plan.  Are there riveted terminals inside
the switch?  Did you replace any of the rivets, or did you just pick a
terminal board with good rivets to start with?

I'd guess it starts wherever the parts book starts - assuming the parts
book has a start date on it.  Or, maybe when that parts book was
printed, that was the only switch still available for everything from
early '71 models back.

Like you said, late 1971 models.  Interestingly, this turns up in the
catalogs as fitting 73-ish models.

Starting with the first 1972 models.  This also agrees with the catalogs
above.

To the end of the 1969 models.

>                          from 219 000 001 without emergency light system

Starting with the first 1969 models.  If it fits mechanically, there's
nothing weird about using this switch on a Bus with no hazard flashers.
On such a Bus, the wire from the brake light switch(es) would go
straight to terminal 54St (black/purple) on the switch.  On a Bus with
hazard flashers, the brake light switch wire goes through the hazard
flasher switch.

Starting with the first 1970 models.  But the turn signal switch doesn't
have any contacts in it for the key buzzer - that's all in the ignition
switch.  Odd.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think I agree that you want the G switch.

BTW, is this bay-window parts manual online somewhere?

On the "Original VW Ersatzteile" box, probably.  :)  The J switch is
most likely for Buses with orange rear turn signals.  The brake light
wire doesn't go through the turn signal switch on it, and there are
fewer wires - the J switch has 5 wires, where the G switch has 8.

Those just operate the headlight dimmer.  If you want, you can run the
wires from the body that connect to those wires to a separate momentary-
contact pushbutton on the dash somewhere.

Either check the parts manual or guess at a standard size.  Sort of like
if an older US car called for a 1/4" bolt, you'd try a 1/4-20 first.  For
M4 it's 0.7 mm and for M5 it's 0.8 mm.
