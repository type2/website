In the end I had to go with what was easy for me.  I've got the rubber
plug in, and it isn't leaking at all.  Tomorrow morning on my way in I'm
dropping her off at the shop for the timesert fix.  That is as close to
fixing it right as I can get for now.  So as long as it holds lasts
another 13 hours and 5 miles she should be golden.

Thanks for all the help.
