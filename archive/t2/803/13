Subject: Re: [T2] oil change gone bad

>>Just ask at any quickie oil change place. That's what they use after
they strip out the customer's original plug. They're hoping that the
customer will be deniably far away in either time or space before they
find out.>> 


Amen to that George.

Had a friend of mine stop by the shop 4-5 years ago,  he did himself a
big favor and went into the Jiffy Lube that was across the street from
the shop in his new Cougar. 

He wanted to know what I thought about the oil dripping from his oil
pan.( first oil change the car ever had )

The fools broke the spot welds, inside the pan where the threded plate
was spot welded.

How in the hell could they possibly crnk theat plug down that tight to
snap all 6 spots welds?

They stuffed one of them plugs in the hole hoping that it would stop
leaking.
It didn't.
I almost hated to tell the guy he had been duped.
Jiffy Lube took the pipe on a new oil pan, & labor on this caper.

Boy, would I be awfully cranky if they performed this type of stupidity
on my vehicle ( which will never happen )     

How can people go to these places with all the bad ink on them???

Nuts----
