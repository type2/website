Just get them new for $140 a piece and you still come below the price in your
area.

When you talk about gaskets are you talking about the Valve cover gaskets?

Max

If you really want the number I can send it to you.

Max,

Give me the "Jerks" phone number----

If they will do all that I mentioned, plus included the gasket set for
$120.00 I'm going to send all my head work there !!
