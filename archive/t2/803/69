Thanks Mark!! I too belong to a list of the Mazda 3 variety, and it does NOT
pass along sensible advice or support, mostly an age thing I think. The
younger kids are into the "rice rocket" game, and us more laid back Van
people have a different agenda. :-)

Hey folks,

 

I just had an "experience" with another automotive interest list. I

won't say what kind of car, but it wasn't German and it wasn't air

cooled.

 

It was such a contrast to this list that I feel the need to pat

everyone on this list on the back for being reasonably rational,

supportive, encouraging; for having a healthy respect for logic; and

most of all for having a sense of humor about our buses and for

generally being pretty good eggs.

 

Mark
