Used mine last night to help me clean up the garage - 1/2 done now. He had a HOOT! Was all smiles and we had a good time. He worked as well as a 5 year old can, he played, he rediscovered toys or gadgets forgotten. He asked last night when we quit - can we do this again tomorrow? Yeah I said - of course! He knows that this all leads up to two things: restarting work on our Westy and relocating our mothballed Beetle from a barn in Dunlap to inside our shed... 

Everyone says "aw what a cute baby..." but this is what I've been waiting for: old enough and big enough to mess around with me in the shop!
