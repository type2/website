This is just what should have happened. Don't forget that the switch trips
at the threshold or below. The old (OEM) switch comes on at under 6.4 psi.
The new one comes on at under 11 psi. Your oil pressure at idle was 10 psi.
With the old switch, you never got the light because it trips at below 6.4
psi. When you switched to the VDO dual sender, you get the light on at ~10
psi, because the VDO sender trips the switch at 11 psi or below.  I don't
think anything is broken or malfunctioning in this scenario.

I'm a fan of mechanical gauges. Stewart-Warner make bulletproof ones.
