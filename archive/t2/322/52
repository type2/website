Subject: Captain seats & fixin' time

Giacamo came with a driver's seat that wasn't even attached to the pedestal,
and a passenger seat that is shot (won't even slide forward/backward).

So, when I had the chance, I got a really nice set of captain seats from a
neighbor who's remodeling his RV.  Paid almost nothing for them... which is
what I got out of them.  I forgot to figure for the seat pedestals!

So, I've got a great set of good-looking seats, but the only place that
they'll fit is in the back where I'm not putting any seats at all.

Anyone want to trade for a couple of captain seats?

I spoke with Daryl Robertson, a local VW mech here in Augusta recommended by
a listee, and will be taking G to him next week.  If all goes well,
hopefully G will be in running condition very soon.  I'm afraid I'm too out
of practice to get him running on my own.

Daryll's also looking for a couple of front seats for me, though all we'll
probably find locally are ones that need recovering.
