Subject: No spark

I have a 1600 dual carb engine from a 67 squareback
that I have put in a bus. I had it started the other
day, but I lost the spark.  I have pulled the wire
from the coil out of the center of the distributor cap
to test for spark, and I get no spark at that point. I
DO have power to the coil, it IS a good coil (new and
good used tried).  So, other than bad coil, why would
I have power to the coil, but no spark coming out of
it. Is the coil supposed to be grounded somwhere?
Would a bad condensor or points cause no spark at this point?
