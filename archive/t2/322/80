Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Cover

i bought one from the BusDepot and one from Rocky Mountain and both dont fit as
well as they should. They both only come down to just above the front bumpers,
leaving alot of paint exposed....(one is a westfalia, one is a passenger van)

FWIW, the westy looks right silly with half a cover...LOL

I have two vans in storage right now with these covers.

I dont recall the manufacture of either, but i will find out in March.

Terry, where does the bottom of your cover come too?
