Subject: Re: [T2] 71 fuel filler

Joe at Busted Bus made me a replacement hose for my 70 bus filler hose. Here
are the details. I already emailed you the pictures.
Written on hose-  042001  GAS  EBP7(may be incomplete)
OD    2.650"
ID      2.25-2.3"
OAL- LONG SIDE    4.6"
OAL-SHORT SIDE    3.75"

Joe cut the hose so it is cut straight on one end, and at about a 20-30
degree angle on the other end. I think this is NAPA hose. Good luck and
please let me know if it works! Tom

Hi Folks,
    I'm may remove my fuel tank for cleaning in the next couple of
days.  Has anyone found a good product to use in place of the "No
Longer Available" rubber coupling that connects the fuel tank to the
filler tube?  I hesitate to disturb what I have if I can't replace it,
as it looks to be over 30 years old.
    Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.
