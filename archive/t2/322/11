Subject: Re: [T2] 68 rear drum - what will interchange

64-67 is a 615E......not interchangeable at all with the 615G.

I did a little more research on the 211 609 439D and 440D part numbers:
They are the backing plate part numbers.

Looking up the backing plate number, it says 'to Ch. no. 210 2300 000' which is the end of 70. But it also
says ( to chassis number 218 109 823, see Workshop Bulletin B - 14/68)
So this means the 68's from 218 000 001 to 218 109 823 uses a different backing plate/drum?  This is 5100
buses later than Bus Boys footnote.

Anyone have Workshop Bulletin B - 14/68??
