Have you checked the vacuum at idle?

If I understand correctly, fuel pressure never exceeds ~35psi with a working
pressure regulator.  At idle with the vacuum hose attached, fuel pressure
should be ~28psi if you don't have any vacuum leaks.

When you step on the gas, vacuum drops and fuel pressure should rise to near
35 psi.  As you increase rpms, vacuum will increase beyond the idle level
and the fuel pressure will reduce so I don't think seeing 17 psi is
unreasonable to witness when you are flooring it.  When you let off the gas,
the vacuum momentarily spikes and fuel pressure is reduced for a second.  It
makes sense to me that as the manifold vacuum increases the fuel pressure is
reduced because the injectors require a constant pressure at the tip.

I think it's incorrectly stated that the pressure is always constant. It
will be different, but still constant at any given rpm.

Where did I read about the precautions for jump starting a FI bus? I can't
find any in the owner's manual but I know I read it somewhere.

I wish Bentley had some info about this however the VW/Bosch L-Jet workshop
manual says:

Deflect the flap in the AFM and you should get 1.5-2L of fuel per minute.

Sounds like the Bentley advice in the pressure regulator section.  I hope
you find the cause soon.
