Subject: Window regulators

A couple of years ago when I was restoring Goldie I bought "door rebuild
kits" from the Bus Depot.  After exchanging these kits because they were
defective from the manf. I got the new channels etc. in; however, my
windows would not close properly. It seems like they would tilt in the
channels and jam so the windows would not rise properly. Any advice on
how to adjust them would be greatly appreciated. Could it be a problem
with the window channels or should I try a better quality "kit" to
rebuild the door hardware again. Thanks for any help or information you
can give me as I want my windows to roll up. Thanks TBear.

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
