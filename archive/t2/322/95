Mike,

I probably would not do it this way.  

Disconnect both the inlet side of the ring(after the fuel pump) and the 
outlet side of the ring(before the regulator).

Be aware that you are going to end up with gasoline vapors under pressure
spewing all over  the engine compartment!!!!

If you actually have garbage in there, you may end up forcing some of
it further into the intakes lines for the injectors.

Why not bite the bullet, take it all apart, clean it, put new lines on it 
everywhere and new seals on your injectors.  It is takes a little time and
patience, but then you *know* that there is nothing nasty still hiding in 
there.  If you are really worried, then take your injectors to get cleaned
and tested, or buy rebuilt/new ones at the local vwflaps.

I cleaned all my metal ring lines by letting them soak a couple of days in 
paint thinner...also *extremely* flamable.


have your fire extinguisher near....you can either do it once or you can
do it over and over and over again.

Cheers, dave
