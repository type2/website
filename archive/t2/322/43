Oops, one more...

The slot where the levers slide onto the metal tang is an odd shape, more of
a "()" than a "[]"  with the obvious slot where the raised dimple on the
metal tang slides in, centered on the one side (if you set the lever on it's
side and look at the slot end of it in it's vertical orientation).

Was the original slot square, and the curved appearance due to long use; or,
was the slot curved like that on purpose to lessen the stress on the part?

Has anyone who has replaced a lever with a "new" one, noticed what the slot
looked like before installation (or, should that read "everyone",
considering how easy it is to break them off!)?
