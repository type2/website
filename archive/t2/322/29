Subject: 71 fuel filler

Hi Folks,
    I'm may remove my fuel tank for cleaning in the next couple of
days.  Has anyone found a good product to use in place of the "No
Longer Available" rubber coupling that connects the fuel tank to the
filler tube?  I hesitate to disturb what I have if I can't replace it,
as it looks to be over 30 years old.
    Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.
