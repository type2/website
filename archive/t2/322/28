Subject: RE: Carb Identification

I figured the carb was a progressive....but how can I tell for sure?  Identification numbers, part numbers, etc?  The name Weber is no where on the carb, only Holley (even though Holley makes the Weber, right?)  I just want to be sure that I can properly "market" it when I put it up for sale.

 

Thanks,

Charles
