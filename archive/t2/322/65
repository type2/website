Same tool for the bolt as your CV's, called a triple square. On my 72, you 
must remove the air duct on the front motor tin, the pre-heater duct for 
the intake, to get to it. It is quite the troublesome until you find the 
right length of tool and extension, but can be done. When putting the duct 
back on, you will need a third hand in the motor compartment to hold the 
duct on that side to get the screws started.

Note that just a few months ago, BusDepot had genuine Pierburg stock pumps 
available for this 3 year only application. This is a perfect example of 
the difference between stock and junk. The junk pumps cost $30 or so and 
will last 3 to 7 years. The stock pump cost $100 and will last 30 years, a 
much much lower cost per mile.

Note also that a rebuild kit from Porsche for the 356/912 will have a 
diaphram that fits. This kit was $65 from the dealer 10 years ago. Consider 
replacing the pump rod while your there, or at least verify the original is 
not worn badly or too much. Good procedure to pack the mechanism in the 
back of the pump with heavy grease. Know also that you will need 2 gaskets, 
one for each side of the spacer block. My new pump came with only one.
