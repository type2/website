The single groove goes on the outside (near the stub axle, transmission

I don't think it functionally matters which way the CV itself faces-
I've flipped cv's 180 degrees in place so they wear their groove onto
new metal when torqued in the forward direction.  Lesee, that was around
180,000 mi and went to over 220,000 mi when I decided to replace them
all when I pulled the engine to replace a clutch!
