Subject: Mechanical fuel pump question

Hi list,

Would anyone know if you have to pull the engine to replace the mechanical
fuel pump on a type IV pancake engine in a bus?  Mine is weeping gas and
probably needs to be replaced.  It is located in the lower right front of
the engine (tranny side) attached to the case by what looks to be a torx or
star bolt.

Thanks,
Ed
