Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank

This just came up on the list just a few days ago.  This part, new, is
becoming extinct:
 211-919-051  Tank Gauge Sender, 1968 to Early 1973 (To Chassis #213 2138
900)  $77.65

Thanks for the "heads up", Richard. I own three '71 T2s, and so far as I
know, all fuel guage senders are OK.. One was just replaced. But I am trying
to set aside a little cache of parts for the future for those few oddball
parts that are in short supply now (two or three year model issue only).
I just snagged two more at a local parts store and cleaned them out at $60
apiece. It's called, "insurance". With three '71s, it's almost inevitable
that I will need at least one more in the next few years, and I'd like to
keep an extra on the shelf.
Is there no way to service these column senders, or to retrofit with one of
the float type? I don't think that the float type would be matched to the
guage. I have noticed a small brass nut or retainer at the base of the
column type senders. I bought an apparently bad sender on eBay and I've
thought about taking it apart to check it out.
