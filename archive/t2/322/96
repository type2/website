Yes, a bad condenser will inhibit spark. Check all the connections first.
Wire from the front of bus to + side of the coil.
Wire from condenser to - side of the coil.
Wire from from points to the condenser (this can break off or come 
loose inside the distributor.

Check your rotor and rotor button while you in the dizzy.

If everything looks cool but still no spark than replace the dizzy 
and points together.
