Subject: More 1968 Minutia

Never seen in captivity but the word is that very early 1968 factory 
high top buses had metal roofs instead of the fiberglass that 
replaced it to the end of the run in 1979.

BTW, if anybody has a good pair of 1968 only wiper shafts I could 
really use a set. Let me know.

Thanks
