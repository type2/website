Subject: master cyl leaking?

List,

76 bus

I have the drums off and my rear wheel cylinders do nothing when I push the brake pedal.

My brake booster looks like it's been taking a bath
lately and it seems to be coming from a tiny "hole"
at the very bottom of the flange on the m.c. that bolts
to the booster.

replace master cylinder?

I am going to replace the rear wheel cylinders, shoes and 
hopefully all the hoses including the fronts this week.

Any parts I should make sure not to forget?

Is it impossible to do the rears without the hubs off?

Many brake questions forthcoming,
Smog on hold,

Billy
