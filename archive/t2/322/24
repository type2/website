Subject: Re: [T2] Mig Tig or Arc Wire Feed?

Time to chime in with my .02 worth. I'm not going into the differences in
mig tig and arc thats been covered. But Tig is NOT what used in the best
body shops, thats bullchit. (dons flame suit) Charley Hamil is one of the
few that i know of that is predominately tig, there may be others. I can use
a tig, and have done so professionally a few years back building furniture,
(ie brass tables. cast iron tables , stainless steel tables ) anyhow, I just
flat don't have the patience to use it all the time here restoring buses,
also do you wanna pay the  going shop rate/ hr. for a slower process? It
boils down to money and time. Most of the morons around here in the body
shops have no clue what a tig is. A properly set mig with gas and ideal
conditions,(ie, clean metal, no rust, good steady hand ) can produce a weld
that looks damn close to a tig. And holds just as good.  Very seldom on
rusty buses do you get ideal conditions, well not the buses i get anyway. I
have a 220v 250 amp welder(miller) Seldom used ,,,, 2/ 120 v 130 millers,,
used alot,,,,, and a weld pak 100, lincoln, used alot ,,,, All these are
running 75/25 gas bottles (75%co2 / 25% argon)of these the lincoln produces
the best welds on thin stuff, but on thicker stuff the millers are better,
for stuff 1/4 inch  to 3/8 thick the 120 millers are ok,  Then i use d the
220 250 amp miller up to say 5/8 or so depending on what it is used for,,
after that i have dads old 220v craftsman buzz box , reverse polarity, stick
welder. Last time i used this it was on a backhoe bucket last summer for a
friend. To put it simply stick welders are not for sheet metal. I do some
brazing, and gas welding, mostly just for fun and to keep in practice.
I agree with George this is a slowly disappearing trade, My daughter is
going to college for commercial advertising and compter graphics,,,but she
pays her bills  fabbing parts and cutting apart VW's. At 19 she knows more
than most folks will about this type work at 25 or 30. She's no profesional
welder by no means , but she can tack parts and weld some thicker stuff ,
thats a start for her gender and age. Worse case she can do the webpages and
keep working here. Ok nuff rambing, glad it was friday. I haven't  typed
this much since last months web page update.
