Hello,
May be you can help me. I am writing you from Quibec i hope my english
will be OK.

1) Do you know if i can remove my 2 old heaters box and replace them by 2
catalyser. My 77 bus do not give me any heat anymore maybe if y install 2
catalyser instead i could reduce pollution?  Does any type of catalyser
could work ok?  All my pipe and muffler are ok only the heater box are rust.

2) I have replace my 55 amps alternator by a 70 amps should i replace the
voltage regulator also ?

Thanks you

Guy Coderre
