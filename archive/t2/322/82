Collie--

The cover I have goes all the way down to cover 3/4er's of the tires--so
lets say about 6"--8" from the gound--

Covercraft custom builds the covers--
You have to tell them--Westy--non--Westy
Front spare mount etc.

It's a heavy duty, excellent cover for the money---


( Also Freezing Chicago, but not as bad as you )----:>)

i bought one from the BusDepot and one from Rocky Mountain and both dont
fit as well as they should. They both only come down to just above the
front bumpers, leaving alot of paint exposed....(one is a westfalia, one
is a passenger van)
FWIW, the westy looks right silly with half a cover...LOL
I have two vans in storage right now with these covers.
I dont recall the manufacture of either, but i will find out in March.

Terry, where does the bottom of your cover come too?

Collie (freezing in Canada)
   
 It's the 3 ply weatherguard--nice cover --good fit--
