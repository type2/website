I've got a similar top on my bus, although it didn't come that way. I
scavanged it from another bus to make mine a camper. I believe that
there were more than one top style that Sportsmobile made for the
bays.

My canvas was in good shape but you can get one from plf, look here
for more info:

I cannot say how well/not well these are, just happen to know of it as
a supplier.

It should stay up with no problems. The tension to hold the top is
held up by 2 VERY strong springs. These are similar to garage door
springs. I have some pictures of the top during work here for you to
look at if that helps:

When released from it's hold downs, it really likes to lift up. I sure
are not worried about it falling down, due to this.
