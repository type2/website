Subject: BN4 thermostat adjust?

   Hey All.

The Contraption has a stock BN4 gas heater that puts out good heat but
cycles off too quickly.
I removed the duct with the coiled spring (next to the fuel tank) and heated
it up with a heat gun to see how it worked.
Just like a chock coil it tightens up with heat and then makes contact
closing a circuit.This shuts off the heat(but not the fan)
I adjusted mine for max control but it's not enough. Anyone ever rebend or
alter the coil to provide a longer heat run?
What if I remove this entirely? I did run the heater with the thermostat
wires joined together and it runs.

Phil
