   Hey All.

The Contraption has a stock BN4 gas heater that puts out good heat but
cycles off too quickly.
I removed the duct with the coiled spring (next to the fuel tank) and heated
it up with a heat gun to see how it worked.
Just like a chock coil it tightens up with heat and then makes contact
closing a circuit.This shuts off the heat(but not the fan)
I adjusted mine for max control but it's not enough. Anyone ever rebend or
alter the coil to provide a longer heat run?
What if I remove this entirely? I did run the heater with the thermostat
wires joined together and it runs.

Phil,
From what I've learned about mine so far, the unit has a relay that will run
the fan for 3 minutes after the heat shuts off. The clears the combustion
gases out of the chamber and continues to blow the warm air into the vehicle
until it cools. The thermostat in the duct with the coiled spring is supposed
to be adjusted with the "bowden" cable that is set within the cab (beneath the
drivers legs on the pedestal) Please do not remove the thermostat. It is part
of the safety system. It is there to prevent the air from going above about
200 degrees F. If you find you do need to adjust the upper and lower extent of
the cable travel there are set screws at either side of the lever travel for
this.
