Subject: CV joint time!!

Just a couple of quick questions regarding installing new CV's ('77 2L bus).
Firstly I have removed and cleaned the old CV's on the bus and my beetle a
number of times so I know what's involved, but I have never installed new
ones. I have gone for the GKN-Lobro's. I have also read the procedure in the
tech pages again.
So my questions, installation direction? The outer part of the CV has one
groove on one side, and three on the other, also the inner part has a ridge
on one side (looks almost like a washer) and is flat on the other. So which
side faces the boot? (the inner part with the ridge is on the same side as
the single groove on the outer part)
Also, so I only have to go under the bus once I am setting up the new CV's
on the axles off my spare parts bus ('74 1.8L model). I am assuming they are
the same, and the length left to right is the same??? (It's a manual trans).
Thanks for your help.
