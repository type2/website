Of Course! In fact it has been made easy for you IF you have a european 
connection.
Heres why: In many places (not sure of which) in Europe some fees for your 
car
are or were (during the 70's at least) based upon engine size. So many 
people
would rather have had a 1600 or even less in their bus. I have seen newer 
busses
that came with 1500 cc engines. Now for volkswagen to make a type 4 like 
engine
smaller would be a waste of money given that they had they already had 
smaller cc
type 2 engines. SO what they did was make adapters for those busses.

Now all you have to do is track one down. I have personally seen one in the 
states
used on a 73 bus to mount a 1641 type 2 engine. And yes the tranny bolts
right on.

And then there is that Vanagon that is driving around town here that has a 
type 2
engine in it thanks to Clara's handiwork.
