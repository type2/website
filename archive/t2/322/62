I got some Hellas for my bus a while back. Some of them come with new
retainer rings that hold them in tightly. Mine didn't so I got a couple
rubber seals made for bug headlights and stretched them over the
Hellas, and they fit nice and tight now. I'm afraid I don't have the
part number anymore for the seals, but they should be easy to find.
