Subject: Will air pressure hurt injectors in ring main?

I wish to blow compressed air into my ring main through the pressure
measuring port, first releasing the connection to the fuel pump....(to
check if any sludge is there)-anyone know if this would hurt the
injectors or the, as I assume the Fuel pressure regulator will not allow
any excess beyond 35 psi??  I will also do this to the line reaching the
fuel filter, to clear any blockage at the tank outlet.
