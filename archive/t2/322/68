Subject: BeetleMex retractable seat belts

Could anyone who has ordered the retractable seat belts from Beetle-Mex
please confirm these are valid parts for a 74 campmobile? They don't
match up with the part numbers listed on the "Retractable Seat Belts"
article at http://www.type2.com/library/interior/retabelt.htm

They are about half the price of the JC Whitney versions. How do they
compare in materials and installation? Has anyone figured out that
installation issue with the "ball bearing dohickeys" listed in the
archives?

Is Beetle-Mex a reliable importer? Are there others? I can't find these
on eurocampers.com anymore.

cheers,
Victor
