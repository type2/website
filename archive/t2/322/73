I have to question that statement. The stock oil pressure switch opens at
2.1-6.4 psi. how much lower can you get? Most non-stock switches come on at
higher pressures, for example a VDO dual sender (idiot light and electric
pressure gauge) lights the light at 11 psi.

First off, I would swap the pressure switch for another known good one, and
hope it is just the switch itself.

If a new switch still lights the light under the same conditions, then there
might be a problem. Maybe the Paul can provide more details about the
rebuild itself, like who did the work and what exactly was done. 6 psi
(max!) at idle is not too good on a rebuilt motor with 30 wt. oil.
