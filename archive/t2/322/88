A box of disposable latex gloves (small, medium, large, extra large) costs
about $7  .... won't break the bank and you'll be glad you have a box
whenever you wanna check your oil or adjust valves or otherwise play with
the mechanicals and don't have time or facilities to scrub up with hand
cleaner afterwards . Buy a box, you won't regret it. :-)
