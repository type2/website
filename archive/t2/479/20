The calibre of the silver bullet you seek is "WR-1."  The WR-1 kit is a
low voltage relay manufactured by the Robt. Bosch Corp.  If you do not
have one installed, then you need one.  In all probablity, neither
solenoid was bad.  The problem is low amperage from the battery through
the switch and back to the solenoid.  There are just too many connections
in that line and minor corrosion on each drops the current below operating
levels over the course of the ten meter round trip through nine different
connections.

                             OOK!
