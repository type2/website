I believe Canadian bearings are also of acceptable quality.

As the the price of German bearings goes up I'd like to know what 
alternatives are more desireable than others.
 
I've heard that bearings produced in these countries are of poorer quality: 
Korea, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Poland and Russia. Problems range from 
finish to lack of roundness.
 
And in general bearings from these countries are ok: Germany, Japan, Spain, 
Italy, England, France and USA.
 
What's I'd like to know beside any corrections, is which groups do Malaysia 
and Taiwan fall into?
