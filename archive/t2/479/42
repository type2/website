Subject: woldwide bearing manufacture

As the the price of German bearings goes up I'd like to know what alternatives are more desireable than others.

I've heard that bearings produced in these countries are of poorer quality: Korea, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Poland and Russia. Problems range from finish to lack of roundness.

And in general  bearings from these countries are ok: Germany, Japan, Spain, Italy, England, France and USA.

What's I'd like to know beside any corrections, is which groups do Malaysia and Taiwan fall into?
