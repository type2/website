I am sorry to say it is probably not.  I pulled a sender from an old bug
today and the system uses a very thin nichrome (nickel-chromium alloy)
wire.  Soldering nichrome is notoriously difficult.  Obtaining the correct
diameter wire may also be difficult.  It may be possible but would not be
easy.  I do not have a 68-72 sender to measure against the bug sender but
a previous poster reports that the interchange is possible.  Worth a shot.

Google "Terry Pratchett", read the books.

                             OOK!

On the internet, no one knows you're an ourang outang.
