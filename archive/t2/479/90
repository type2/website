Subject: fuel tank patch?

Folks -
found out my gas tank has a small leak. Now, short of replacing it, is there 
any material good enough to use as a patch? I am going to put the bus up for 
sale in the immediate future, so my primary concern is keeping it from 
leaking in my driveway. Obviously - if/when I sell it I would make it 
abundently clear that the fuel tank is an issue....I say that to  prevent 
any backlash and unnecessary tangents from this....

Let me know

Thanks
Mat
