Speaking of world manufacturing Ron, where are these wheel cylinders I
bought from you coming from? They are marked Bietrix , and you sell them as
your cheapest "econo" wheel cylinder, yet in comparing them to this German
one I have, I can't see any difference in quality. Is it just labor costs
making the difference in price then?
