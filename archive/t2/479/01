I almost found one at a VW dealer in Abbostford during my last trip to Canada. Their inventory lied but if I had found one, it would have been $135 CDN. I'm glad I didn't find it.

When I fixed my tank in March 2002 I went to NAPA for hose also.  I bought:

1055 NBH GAS HOSE $16.49
705-1019 BK HOS CLMP $1.19 (each x 3)

I simply cut the ends at an angle to approximate the bend. 1 ft  is enough for one cutting mistake of 2 1/4" fuel hose. 

I wrote down the info printed on the hose for reference:

080401 GAS EBP 78CN25
