Subject: aftermarket starter?

Hey all-

I have a stock 77 bus that is starting to develop a worn out starter. Anyone have any practical experience with after market starters that claim to be much more robust ("high troque")- than the original? Are there still original Bosch starter out there or are they reman?

The aftermarket one I am *considereing* is IMI or Tilton- they ain't cheep though! My understanding is that the Bosch starters are kinda weak design- please p-mail practical opinions or suggestions.

thanks

m.
