There are supports for the rear exhaust at both the left and right sides.
These supports bolt on to the cooling fan shroud and then attach to the
exhaust.  I believe you can see the right-side piece in the diagrams for the
cooling system.  The left-side piece varies depending on whether the exhaust
is Federal or California; didn't see this piece in my quick look at the
usual sources.
