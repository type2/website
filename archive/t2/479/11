Subject: Starter solenoid problem

Lights on, no clickety-click.  Checked the solenoid, diagnosed it as bad (power direct to starter works) and replaced it.  Started up like a beautiful thing!  Drove it about the neighborhood for a couple of days and was back in heaven.

The bad news?  Yesterday..... lights came on, no clickety-click.  Assuming it's solenoid again - have not had a chance to look at it yet.

Anyone know why I would go through two solenoids out of nowhere?  I'm not a big electrical person, will be looking through Muir tomorrow morning.  Shooting this email off in a hurry already.

Looking for help on the Silver Bullet!

Thanks to all,
Tom
