Greetings Listies!

I know some of you are Metal Bumpin' types, and I have a question for you.

I'd like to buy a set of hammers and dollies to bang out a big crumple on 
my bus.  I've read the metal bumping book, and i think i'm ready to give 
it a go.

So: what do I buy?  I don't want to spend *too* much on body tools, as I'm 
hoping my use for them will be limited.  But I guess my question comes 
down to "are the el'cheapo tools usable at all?"

And what's the difference between this:

and this:

(other than $140?)
