90% of starter, switch and wiring problems have to do with poor battery 
maintenance. If reliable amps are available from the battery, you get no 
excess heat stresses sucking the life out of everything else.

Improve the life of all the electrical components by keeping the battery 
clean at all times. Waste no money on overcoming this foundation weakness 
by using components designed to draw MORE amps than stock. The least 
complication is stock or approved alternate per the Bosch ReMan/NewMan 
listings.
