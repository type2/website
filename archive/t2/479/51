Subject: Re: [T2] hesitation upon acceleration

I wasn't going to mention this to the list till I was certain it wasn't just 
in my head
but My 78' MicroBus is doing the same or similar thing.

Seems to rev ok but when power is needed it's almost like it doesn't have it
at times. Speed limit? May make it, it seems.

I've been driving it in the cold for a while now so I don't think it's 
immediately
related. Recent oil change and everything else seems the same. Good gas.
I might check the air filter and see what that looks like.

Ideas?
