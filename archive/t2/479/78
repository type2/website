I use a pint of Marvel to every tank of gas--a quart durring the summer
when I'm on the road, and I've got somewhere to be in a hurry----

This stuff is not a new found product--It's been around for at least 60
--70 years.

I also use as hair tonic--it make hair grow like crazy--:>)

Yo Tony--!!

what's the ratio of Marvel Mystery oil to Gas? How often do you use it?
Thanks
Mat
