Phil,

Reference pointers on the net?  Publications authorized by the Navy?

Advertisements from sellers touting that *their* additive is
used by the mighty U.S. Navy because it was proved that they worked?

I would think that the additive makers would have been milking that one 
for all that it was worth, but have never heard of it....

Found these...re marvel
http://www.chiefaircraft.com/cgi-bin/frame-aircraft.cgi?URL=/Aircraft/OilSystem/OilAndAdditives.html

and this one repeats that they are all fluff and lies

No flames, just interest!

Cheers, dave
