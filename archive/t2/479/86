Subject: dash top pods

i wanted to thank everybody for the quick responses to my pod 
query... found a few as a result:
http://www.egauges.com/vdo_acce.asp?Subgroup=Wedgee&Cart=
they also have some vdo -style 3 holers, like i was looking for. 
oddly, the same info is on bugsandbuggies.com (sister site?) but the 
pics wouldn't load.
also, collie at www.germansupply.ca had some, and had a great deal, 
so i snagged one from him. support those list vendors :)

i had googled for quite some time, but had no luck, so the leads were 
greatly appreciated...................
