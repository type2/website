Subject: oil stabilizers, Slick 50, etc.???

Hi,

Just wondering about experiences using engine oil stabilizers to 
keep oil in the system where it belongs.  When my engine has sat for
long period it sound loud on startup until the oil gets into the
lifters after a few seconds.

Also, does anyone have any positive stories to tell about additives
like Slick 50 or other additives designed to reduce friction?
.....engine run cooler? engines last longer between rebuild?


Sincerely,
