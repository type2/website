Wil,

Used to use slick50 and tried to convince myself that it really 
helped...concluded that it was the synth mobile one that did the trick.

Lots of consumer groups have tested them and found them all to be
lacking in reality.

The only thing that I know of along that line that really works is
the 2 oz bottle of transmission/differential stabilizer that
Ford sells.  The last time I bought some, I asked the counter man
if he sold a lot of it.....he just laughed and said he could hardly
keep it in stock.  Mostly sold it to street and drag racers.

My opinions on reality may not match those of anyone else<grin>.


Cheers, dave
