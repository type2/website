a few things come to mind for me. One is a intermittent clog in the
fuel line. Perhaps a piece of trash that keeps getting in the way at
the tank? Another possibility if a bad ground w/ the Temp Sensor II.
Yet another is a pump that isn't working all the time. One last thing
to check is the friction path on the AFM. Mine was having trouble
making contact at one time an causing a bad surging. I was able to
find this out by measuring the resistance across two of the terminals
on the AFM. At a few spots the resistance just dropped off to open, so
I knew that is was in bad shape. HTH
