It's kind of a long-shot and, at a *guess*, it's not relevant to your
problem, but I'd still check the fuel pressure.  Go down to your local Ace
Hardware and get a water pressure gauge that reads up to 45 lbs.  Get a
brass hose barb that screws on to the gauge with a 1/4" barb.  Get a length
of FI hose and a couple of hose clamps.  For $15 - $20 you're in business
and can ensure that fuel pressure *isn't* the problem.  It's one of those
"tools" you use once every year or two and the price is right.

The dwell shouldn't be affected since dwell is just the measure of the
time - expressed in degrees - that the points are open (or closed - I don't
remember 'cause I've run pointless distributors for so long) and shouldn't
be affected by anything except the gap of the points.  The timings shouldn't
have changed either, unless the "idle" is now so high that the advance
mechanism on the distributor is affecting things.
