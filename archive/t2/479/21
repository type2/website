OK *MAYBE* and only for a very few miles.  The missing two-bolt washer is
not the problem.  The main problem is the three 8.8 bolts you have no
doubt inserted as replacements.  The other problem is the missing serrated
washers.  The CV bolts operate in a high-shear environment and the 8.8
bolts just will not take it.  They are going to stretch or shear.  If they
stretch the regular lock washers you probably used will allow them to back
right out.  If they shear then the subs will be difficult to remove.  I
would give you a week if you drive very gently.  I admit this give you
enough time to order in a new CV boot kit which will come with new bolts
and new washers.  Use all of them and use a torque wrench to install them.
Mostly, use the time wisely and order that kit today!

                             OOK!
