Subject: alternator / generator???

Hey everyone!

My bus has broken down again...:-(  the generator is
in bad trouble.  I am most likely going to need to
replace it.  I was checking out the bus depot to see
what a replacement would cost, when i noticed a kit to
convert from a generator to an alternator. Can anyone
tell me the difference, between an alternator and a
generator, and any benefits one would receive from
switching from a generator to alternator.  Would it be
worth my time and money?

Thanks for your help in advance.
