Folks,

I drove my 78  Champagne Edition to work today!

The only "quietness" issue I have now is either the 
speedometer cable or speedometer.

Has anyone had any good luck with the speedo restorers?
I have done some myself, but was never very happy with the results.

Anyone ever install one of those "new" electronic  vdo speedometers
or know of anyone selling a "new" regular speedometer?
Do the electronic ones actually fit a bus?...anyone?

Cheers, dave
