Subject: installing rebuilt trans 69 bus

Well I've decided to go for it.  I'm having a transmission built by Rons Transaxle in Richmond CA for $775.  I'm only a half good mechanic but too broke to pay shop rates right now so I'm doing the install on my own. I have no problem with the engine in and out trick aside from the fact that my back always hurts afterwards.  I have never messed with the tranny before.  I read the john Muir blurb on it but I though that I would ask the list for advice too. I plan to replace the clutch pilot bearing and redo the rear main seal while I'm at it. I will consult the archives too. 
 
Thanks in advance for any advice.
 
Mick
