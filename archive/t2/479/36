Subject: '72 pop top questions

Hello Volks-

    Just a couple of quick questions:  I saw someone
selling a upper cot from a 1970 Westy -  would this be
the same style that came in my '72 originally?  Any
issues with it fitting properly?  Also, can anyone
point me in the direction of a photo/diagram of how
the hold-down clamp for the top in my '72 attaches?  I
bought a replacment since it was missing when I bought
my bus, but I'm just not seeing how it connects...

-Paul
