I myself use Rustcheck. http://www.rustcheck.com/  I live in Nova Scotia,
Canada, they salt the roads here heavily. If there is an old car around here
that is still in good condition, you'll find the Rustcheck stickers in one
of the rear window that shows it was treated every year from day one. Its
thick, won't drip, and actually smells like cherries. A friend of mine has a
91 Toyota truck that has been treated with Rustcheck since new and there is
no rust yet. The only bad thing about this stuff is it messy when you have
to fix something,,, but I'd rather be greasy than to have flakes of rust
fall down on me!
