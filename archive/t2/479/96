Subject: 70 bus is stripped, whats left is free!

I've been working  for two days stripping parts out of a 70 bus that was 
given to me. The previous owner bought it to pull the engine and put it 
in a sand rail. Couldnt bear to see it go to the crusher without 
donating the rest of its organs.

I have removed much of the interior, lights, sliding door hardware, 
louvered windows, and dash electricals.

Now I cant bear to see this nearly rust free body get squashed when it 
may be just what someone needs to beautify their bus. Does your bus have 
rust holes, nasty dents whining tranny, or crippled running gear? Wish 
you could find the parts at the salvage yard? SAVE your money! Let me 
know you want it and it's yours. I have the title and will be glad to 
give it to you as long as you come get it by this week end. Located in 
Northern Arizona.

This bus qould be towed a short distance on a strap or chain but you 
will have to remove the tranny or somehow support it. Without the engine 
there is nothing presently supporting the rear of the tranny.

Any one interested please Email me at turtlebus(-at-)netzero.net or 
tsdsisbsms(-at-)aol.com .
