It sounds to me like you were testing the thermo/time switch that powers the
cold start valve with the test light taking the place of the cold start
valve.  If that's the case, then I'd say you can mark that test as "passed."
The cold start valve should squirt just on startup and just when the engine
is pretty cold.  It has nothing to do with keeping a cold engine running.
The thermo/time switch doesn't play a role in the aux air regulator.  The
aux air regulator closes in response to heat generated by its own heater and
engine heat.  I don't know "how long" or "how hot" things have to be for the
aux air regulator to shut down, but it's fairly quick after startup,
probably less than a minute, I'd guess.
