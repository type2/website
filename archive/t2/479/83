Subject: ADMIN: KILL THIS THREAD Re: [T2] Was: Slick 50 - now Marvel

This topic is:

a) Not related to type2s
b) A religious debate, and therefore
c) Not likely to change anyone's mind

... so let's keep it off of this list.  If you want to discuss 
Slick50/MMO/Additive-of-the-week take it to a more appropriate 
forum (such as a newsgroup, or p-mail).

Thanks.
