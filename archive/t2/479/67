Subject: turn signal housing

My 78 campmobile is missing the plastic housing that encases the turn 
signal and ignition switch. I have agreed to purchase one from a guy 
who is parting out his 78 (advertised on The Samba)..

He can't figure out how to get it off, and sounds ready to give up. Can 
anyone provide instructions that I can pass on to him?

Thanks.
