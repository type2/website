Subject: heater cable stuck in tube

Is there anything I'm missing?
Both ends of the cable are clear to pull through the tube, it's just stuck!!  Is there something I'm not seeing or is it possible the cable has rusted in there somehow- I don't see how it could with the plastic sheeth over it?  Anyone insight!?
