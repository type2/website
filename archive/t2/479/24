The serrated washers are special and can be obtained from Volkswagen and
should be as the instructions say not to reuse them.  I do not know if the
double plate can be obtained from Volkswagen but would bet it is
available.  Most CV boot kits contain both bolts and serrated washers.
I cannot remember off-hand if any contain the double plate. I vaguely
remember at least one that did but would not bet on it.
