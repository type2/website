Subject: scratching head after several repairs???

Hi,

After properly setting timing and dwell (after replacing cap, rotor,
plugs and wires, entire exhaust system...it was all rusted off)...

My '80 Vanagon would start but die....would not idle until I had
started it several times and warmed it up by keeping my foot on the
accelerator.

I then repair some leaks in the 's' hose without improvement.
I then replaced a temp. sensor that was reading about half the spec
for its resistance but still no improvement.

I then checked the entire wireharness and AFM as per the Bentley
manual with no faults found...the only exception was I didn't check
the fuel regulator because the van runs fine once warm and has no
problem starting.

I had previously suspected a faulty aux. air valve and the Bentley
manual says its supposed to be all the way open on start and slowly
close.  Mine was open but seemed like it could be open more so I
tested by simply bridging it and connecting the the hose from the 's'
hose directly to the air chamber and it worked!!!!  So I figured the 
aux. air valve was at fault.

$70 later it seems like it may be trying a little harder to idle but
still quits.  Thinking the short hose between the aux air valve and
the air chamber looked old, loose and a possible air leak I put a
piece of fresh new heater hose in its place but no improvement.

What I'm wondering is that now that I may have fixed a few problems
that were real problems could the timing or dwell be off again?
I'm checking tomorrow but wanted some opinions on where to look
next....ugh!


Sincerely,
