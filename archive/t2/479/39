Subject: re new TRW bus steering box for sale for 73-79 bus

I bought a new TRW 73-79 steering gearbox for my 70 bus, hoping to retrofit it
into my bus. It wouldn't fit. The new box had too many fitment issues to work
as easily as I had hoped. In the process of trying to get it into my frame, I
was forced to grind the raised casting ring down where the box goes through
the frame. I am not sure if that raised portion is important to the function
of the box, it was just like excess casting metal. It may support or pilot the
box in the frame, I'm not sure. The box is held into the frame with 4 bolts.
I ground this approximately 1/2" wide circle down to a smaller diameter all
around. It does not affect the mechanical function in any way Otherwise, the
box is brand new, never used or installed. I had to source a Pitman Arm from
Busted VW and a Pitman arm nut from Bus Boys. These are included with the box.
I will sell it to any listee that can use it for $230, including shipping via
surface mail. tom.loan(-at-)rogers.com
