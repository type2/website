Mike ,
I know I mentioned this before--
But I just thought I would bring the correct process up again--

Use the Vari Prime to seal down all the bare metal, and unknown type of
paint first--THEN--apply a quality ( Ultra Fill, or Uro Prime ) high
fill primer over that---then sand and paint--
It's the correct way to do this job--don't short cut it--you'll be
crying the blues down the road if you do---

I believe it was Va resident Jeff Stewart who used this product in
painting his 76 camper? I'd like feedback on using this over a variety
of meeting surfaces likeold paint, and etching primer before topcoating.
The etching
Variprime works fine over surfaces other than metal, but is a lot more
expensive.
