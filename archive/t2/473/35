Subject: CV Boots - Rockford

If you are ordering type 2 Rockford CV boots by mail, you should order  
339-4, not 814-21.

You should order -5- boots, because they are so solid and suitable, you will 
want an extra one in hand to show to all your type 2 friends!!

The 339-4 have four ridges, and the narrow end fits comfortably between the 
two 'bumps' on the rear axle shaft.  They are remarkably similar in design 
to the boots usually available, but are stronger than original, and MUCH 
more solid than the current 'German' made.
