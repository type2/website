I originally had my second battery installed with an isolator in the setup.
I got a little disallusioned when my alternator blew and I didn't know if
if was possible that it got over worked.

So, I changed the setup. I have the deep cycle charged externally and
whenever I can, home, on the road at a site, I plug it in and charge it.
The huge deepcycle I have seems to take a lot before it's drained. It's also
kinda cool to be able to Boost yourself in the event of a dead starter 
battery.
