Grrr....snipped a lot of the original, but the mail program at type 2
zapped it to the list again...here it is with more snipped out...


Terry,

Ok!

I guess that both are *supposed* to do what I want done on my parts(not 
necessarily body parts).

I am not permanently hooked on por-15, so will drop by the local auto-body
store at lunch tomorrow and check this stuff out.

I remember you talking about the frame rails before and was 
impressed...just didn't remember when I needed to!

I see on the net that it is available in an aerosol also!

Terry, I heard about it by asking a fellow vw'er about what to paint
my new pans with....he pointed out a guy with a baja who had used it on 
the insides of his fenders 5 years ago....they still looked new and did
*not* have any rock chips...so I tried it...

Cheers, dave
