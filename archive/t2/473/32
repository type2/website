Like I mentioned to you in a prior message Mike--
Velvaseal is a laquer based product--and will cause lifting at the
feathered edges.
If you are bound and determined to use a laquer based filer/primer, find
a Sherwin Willams dealer and buy a gallon of Utra Fill--a far superior
product than any Dupont primer--and the guys at the Dupont store will
tell you that--

Vari Prime is expensive--??

Yep--and as a acid etch zinc laden sealer it works well too--ON ANY Bare
Steel, Aluminium, stainless--as well as pre painted surfaces.
You can't paint aluminum without it--
It is inteded as a locker base primer--and it won't fall off--

Ya only get what ya pay for nowadays--and Velvaseal on bare metal ain't
the answer--

Later,

TK

I believe it was Va resident Jeff Stewart who used this product in
painting his 76 camper? I'd like feedback on using this over a variety
of meeting surfaces likeold paint, and etching primer before topcoating.
The etching
Variprime works fine over surfaces other than metal, but is a lot more
expensive.
