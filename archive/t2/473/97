Subject: Fuel pump trouble?

I am experienced a reoccurring problem with my bus since it's recent
powertrain overhaul.  1977 2.0 Fuel injected.  Rebuilt engine with all new
rubbers and gaskets, all new fuel lines and fuel filter.  Timing, dwell etc
all good and the cylinder head temp has been a consistent 250 -275 Degrees
F.  Two or three times over the past two weeks I had a momentary loss of
power on the highway, after an hour's driving, but the problem couldn't be
repeated at home.  It doesn't appear to be speed sensitive/related.  On the
weekend it stalling out hard after acting up on the highway (I had just
exited to a side road) but we got it started after a few minutes.  The only
thing I did was wiggle a few wires and my passenger open the fuel cap (cheap
aftermarket one) which he heard a "whoosh".  It ran fine the rest of the way
home and for the following day.  Today it wouldn't start (turned over ok) so
I put on the fuel gauge.  No fuel pressure so I jumpered the fuel pump
direct to the battery and it ran right up.  I checked the fuel pump "hot"
wire connector and I may have had the fuel pump's positive "spade" not
properly connected to the wire connector (instead pressed between the
connector and its rubber boot).  It runs fine again now.  The filter looks
clear, and I have been running fuel injector treatment every 2 or three
tanks of fuel since I bought the bus a few months ago.  I'm new to electric
fuel pumps, can they start working intermittently as the wear or should I
concentrate on wiring connections?  Has anyone installed fuel pressure
gauges?  This is an excellent trouble shooting tool (helped me diagnose and
fix the fuel injection system last year).  Is there an economical electric
pressure gauge (no pressure line to the cab) out there?  I was even thinking
of an idiot light pressure gauge to confirm that the pump is putting out a
minimum pressure like the oil pressure idiot light.  Has anyone tried this?

Thanks in advance,
