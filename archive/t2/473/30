Subject: Velvaseal (DuPont) as sealer/primer under topcoat

I believe it was Va resident Jeff Stewart who used this product in
painting his 76 camper?  I'd like feedback on using this over a variety
of meeting surfaces likeold paint, and etching primer before
topcoating.  The etching 
Variprime works fine over surfaces other than metal, but is a lot more
expensive.
