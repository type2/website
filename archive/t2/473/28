Subject: Bus brand soda?

I know it's not Friday, but I couldn't help it. A friend was at the local 7 11 store and ran into this interesting product: http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/blake_haralson/vwp?.dir=/My+Photos&.dnm=MVC-009S.jpg&.view=t
I wonder how long it will take for VWoA to take care of this.
