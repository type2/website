   If you think this is phooey, extremely rare, or a
nearly non-exist phenomenon that only happens in labs
etc. YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN. My  brother had a battery
blow up in his face when he was about 17 and was lucky

enough to run blind to the bathroom sink and flush the
hell out of his face/eyes and, lucky suffered no
permanent damage.

It is rare, it does happen, so do yourself a big favor
and always turn your face away, or better yet use the
hood of a normal car to shield your face when
connecting jumper cables or otherwise initially
messing with any unsealed lead acid battery terminals.
**********************************************

The way to protect yourself from igniting the fumes of
a battery while attaching cables is to always attach
the positive cable to the battery first and then
attach the negative cable to a ground source away from
the battery so if a spark does happen when you
complete the circuit, it will be away from the
battery. Simple and safe!
