Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15

Dave,

From what I read, and have seen on this POR product--it is a no more
than a plastic cover to starve the rust from air.
This is where the polyisocyanate's that is in it kicks in. 
This is no more than a paint hardener--
Take some paint hardener--put a drop of it on your work bench and it'll
dry as hard as a rock--
To me this is just masking off an area that should really be repaired--

What I use for frame rails on Semi's--and oh boy do they get beat
up--especially in excavating units --is SEM--Rust Shield.

The stuff comes out of my primer gun like glue-( I can't spray it using
any of my finishing guns--it's way too thick and won't pass through the
nozzle ), and I'll tell ya what--I have 12 Macks in the dirt or in the
stone everyday--parked outside 24 /7/ 365--and I painted the frames
black with the SEM--8 years ago-----and the stuff is still shining !!--
IT hasen't worn off the half fenders where the rubber flaps on the dump
trailer's lay on them--I am amazed--
  
Now--this isn't a repair situation---it's a paint--rust inhibitive /
look good deal on the frames---

Folks out there are using the POR stuff to attempt to stop something
that should be repaired on the sheet metal of their vehicles----

A Vanagon owner came over to the shop last week--and saw that I had the
area around the electrical outlet, and water inlets on my 87 Westy in
prime--and said to me--
" Oh yea--I have some spots I'm going to apply POR 15 on to stop the
rust--"

I think--Oh Boy--
Here I am--removing all the hardware--sand blasting--acid treating the
metal--Zinc chromating the area,  urethane priming, and urethane
refinishing it so it'll never rust again--and here I have Mr. Vananut
with one wave of his hand with a touch up brush--thinking he's going to
get the same kinda results.

Won't happen.

OK--you have my answer Dave--
So now it's my turn---

Why is it--that any prominent body repair / paint shop anywhere, not
only doesn't use any POR products--but never even heard of the stuff??

I never heard of it either--until I got involved with the VW's--
And I am truly amazed--

There is no miracle in a can---:>)


See ya-- 

Terry
