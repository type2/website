Do you mean the sticker is missing or is the M-plate
missing?

If you have the M-plate still in your car then there
is no problem. the 1st six numbers on the 3rd line
indicate the paintcolour that was used. The code
problably starts with "523..."

Perhaps the code is on my homepage, but there's a
great chance it isn't. The reason is because I haven't
updated the pages for a long time (sorry). Below is
the URL, if you have any questions about it let me
know!
