Bradford,

Call around to the local glass shops and check prices....let them put in a 
new seal for you....they like that a lot better than using yours....and 
they will then guarantee "no leaks".

How is the area under your windshield...rusty????  Cut the windshield
out before you get it fixed and fix the rust first.

take the old windshield with you when replacing as they will dispose of it 
properly for you.

Prices can vary a *lot*.....check around.

Cheers, dave
