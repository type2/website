Subject: Re: [T2] Pertonix Ignitor and 78 Bus

on my old stock (205) dizzy it went on hard but i got it on.  on my svda i
had to hit it with the back of my screwdriver to get it on.  i honestly
thought it would break before it went on but it made it all the way down
but it finally made it all the way.

Hi Paul,

On the 1974 engine in my westfakia I had to trim the rotor to fit.
There was no way on God's green earth it would have fit otherwise, it
was already pressed all the way to the bottom of the shaft.

Perhaps David has a different distributor than what's in your bus. Or
maybe just a different rotor.

Anyway, once that was taken care of the thing worked great.
