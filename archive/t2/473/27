I think maybe your problem is not electrical.  From 1885, when cars
first existed, to about 1985-1990, when it became economical for
people to have a TV and VCR in their cars, kids took long trips in
cars without the benefit of video.  They took part in now-obscure
pastimes such as looking out the windows, playing "I Spy", reading
road maps, coloring in coloring books, and even reading.  Now, I
see minivans with local tags, that appear to be carrying kids on
short trips in town, with the LCD deployed in the back seat.  WTF?
Just because you _can_ have the kids in front of the TV whenever
they're not sleeping or in school doesn't mean you _should_.

There are two that I know of; did you check both?
