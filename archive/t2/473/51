i have used this SEM on my bay to 'bandaid' up some
small rust holes under the windsheild..

i used the rust seal, and kitty hair, i know this
isn't the correct way to repair it, but i did it right
enough to eliminate any moisture to get under it, and
without moisture you have no rust.. time will test
this stuff on my bus, up against the por15 on my
notch..

peace,
