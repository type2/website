Subject: RE: [T2] Voltmeter and wiring and sticky readings.

A voltmeter would not need a particularly large wire, but maybe that's what
the installer (or PO) happened to use. If the needle sticks, that's almost
certainly due to mechanical reasons in the gauge. The postion of the needle
will not have any real effect on the actual bus voltage (pun intended) or
current. No current should flow through a normal voltmeter. I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

An ammeter measures current and would have the current flowing through or
near it, but your gauge is a voltmeter if it has a 9 volt mark.

My voltmeter often sticks at 9volts (it's lowest setting which it rests at
when key is turned off) and won't jump up unless I give it a tap on the
glass. That isn't what is bothering me though. What I'm worried about is
that the voltmeter has the current going through it to my battery and is in
effect stopping it from being charged when it sticks like this. Anyone care
