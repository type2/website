Subject: GLOW PLUG

Thanks for trying to sort this one out.
I am going to take the heater out and give it a good cleaning.
I have a spare one from my last 72 van, weird thing is that the glow
plugs are slightly different
the point of contact for the spark is configured different. I am going
to call Espar tommorrow
to see if they have a manual or troubleshooting guide they can send me.
I noticed that the links to
Ron Vanness articles are missing. Is there anyone out there with
troubleshooting guides
for the BN4 Espar for a 72?
this is the one with the pump that is not mounted on the heater.
Thanks again,
Darren
