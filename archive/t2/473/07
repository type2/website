You can, in theory, remove the cold start valve from the air distribution
box - with gas lines still in place - and then pressurize the system (I
jumper terminals 36 and 39 on the AFM plug) and watch the cold start valve
to see if it's leaking.  Kind of a PITA since the distributor gets in the
way.  You could also ground out the wire from the coil to the distributor
and then have someone crank the engine for a couple of seconds - thereby
engaging the thermo-time switch - and see that it's spraying at "startup"
and not leaking after the engine is no longer being cranked over.

Shouldn't.  Remember, although the CSV gets its power from the double relay
that power is "stopped" if the thermo-time switch isn't grounded.  The heat
from the engine opens the thermo-time switch, giving the current no ground
to flow to.

You might be suffering from a too-rich mixture, causing you to stall when
the engine is warm, but lots of things can cause this so I wouldn't focus
just on the CSV.
