Your inverter must be connected to a battery.... so really, you connected
your inverter battery to your buses aux battery,,,, correct?

I am trying to picture this ..you said: "wire in an inverter to isolate
the alternator output"

Do you mean,, and isolator?  Like a relay? or the diode kind??

I would think you should just connect your inverter battery to your aux
battery,, that would charge your inverter battery and your aux battery
while engine is running, and give you more time while running solely off
the aux and inverter battery

Do you have the relay between your aux battery and your main battery??
