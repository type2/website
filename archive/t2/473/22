Subject: Need a Windshield

Hi all...

I have been putting off fixing the cracked windshield
in my 71 bay. My wife got pulled over the day, ( doing
80 in the fast lane on the freeway??? she came right
up on the back a highway patrol... don't think I'm
going to let her drive my bus anymore ), and now I
have to fix my windshield. 

Does anyone know the cheapest place to get a
windshield? I'm in the Sacramento area.

Thanks... Bradford Larson
