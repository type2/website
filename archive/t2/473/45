Subject: RE: [T2] POR 15

It is used here by a local restorer on sand blasted, clean metal. They use it
before they apply any primer. Then they apply the tie coat primer. I never
really asked about the return on the investment, but since they only do a few
cars a year, I assume it works well for them.

Maybe I will take some time to sand blast my wheelbarrow and repaint it with
POR 15 and see what happens. That thing just sits out in the weather and rusts
fast.

Dave, how well is that master cylinder holding up? Anything under the front
end of the bus would be a good test.
