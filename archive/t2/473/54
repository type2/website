Subject: External Oil Cooler

Have completed a re-build on my 82 Westy, Air Cooled motor. Would like to use
an external oil cooler
on this motor. Do List members have experience with placing a cooler on the 2
liter Air Cooled engine?
What is the best method to connect the oil lines to the motor? Where should
the output/input be connected. Would braided line be best. Whats the best
location for the cooler?
Would appreciate some List experience on this one.   Thanks
