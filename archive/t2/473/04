Subject: GLOW PLUG QUESTION

I just saw a question about a glow plug for a BA6 which made me think to ask a
question
about my BN4 glow plug. I noticed that the insulator that is at the base of
the glow plug
is slightly broken and the spark is jumping across. Question is.. would this
cause the
fuel to burn too quickly and therefore cause poor combustion resulting in the
heater
shutting off after about 2-3 minutes?
I recently cleaned the glow plug and it seemed to be sending out good heat but
it doesn't
stay on long enough to make a difference.
Please help, I'm freezing over here.

Thanks people,
Darren in Canada
