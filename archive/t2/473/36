  Back when I got mine you had to insure also that you
got the one for either a vac advance or mech advance.
The VAC advance was "half moon" shaped to allow for
the
vac advance mechanism where the Mech. advance was a
full
circle arrangement.. this is the "platform" that the
sensor rides on that installs where the point set is
mounted. I found that when I first put mine on that I
didnt have it seated all the way down.. I also ground
down a perfectly good rotor.;-) Then I did some work
on 
DAS BUS and fried the unit (stupid error) and bought a
new one.. this time the sleeve slipped on and I found
my modified rotor was to short (sigh). Bought a new
one
and its been good ever since... 5 or 6 years now I
guess. They say to be sure you hook it to the coil
correctly.. take it from me.. they arent kidding! 8-O
Uff Da! (scandihovien for OH SH*T)
