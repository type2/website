Subject: Anyone need AC parts?

Hi all,

I've been able to sell off the BA6 heater system and the head/blower unit
for the A/C system out of my Westy.

So that means I have some other AC parts left over if anyone is interested.

I have the condensers for up front and under the floor, they appear to be in
pretty good shape.

I have a compressor for the AC system, probably needs to be overhauled, but
it does turn.

I also have the mounting bracket for the AC compressor. I understand these
things can be kinda hard to find, but I got the whole mounting thing.

I DO NOT have the pulley. Sorry, I know that's something that people are
looking for. If I did have it, I would have sold all of this stuff a long
time ago!

Anyway, I'm not looking to rip anyone off on this stuff, I would rather see
it go to use than have it sit in my garage, so best offer (first offer
probably!) on everything.

Thanks!
