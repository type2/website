long did it take you to get bored with "I Spy" and
looking out the window? I remember being bored about
30 minutes into the trip."

Check out our Westy on http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin
It went on a 6 week trip (often over 8 hrs driving a day) around the
country....The VCR, TV/Sega got lots of use when daughter was bored.
We (the non-driver too) would watch movies......
