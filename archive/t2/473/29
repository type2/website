Darren,
Here's my thoughts on the POR stuff--

It's a band aide,condom, fast way to no  correct end result.

Yes--it'll mask the surface rusted area--but it won't repair it---it
won't cause it to be factory new,nor look that way.

It's a stop gap measure till you either can afford the correct
refinishing proceedures, or until the next guy down the road get's it--

And in my professional opinion, not the right path to take--
I's much rather do the job once and be done with it--and the proper
way--

Later,

TK

 
So am I picking up the idea the POR 15 products are not good? 
Is their rust prevention stuff ok? 
What's the general consensus? I've seen 1 negative about their paint
products.
