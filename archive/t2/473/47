Corbett,

I haven't really had the bus out enough yet to form an opinion on it yet, 
but will look under my 68 bug again.

Sorry Terry, but I did paint the top of my son's Karman Ghia with por-15
and it has been sitting out for the last 18 months...."looks" ugly, but 
there is sure not any rust on it(it was really bad from the evil P.O. who 
covered it with vinyl...and then let it leak under it).

Master cylinders always seem to get it the worst since they also seem 
to get brake fluid on them somewhere along the way also.

After looking at the SEm Rust Shield stuff, it also comes in colors and
from Terry, sounds like it is UV  safe as well!  found it here 

http://www.semproducts.com/sempages/semrust.html

I *did* paint the back of my sandblast cabinet with POR-15.  You can
imagine how much I have used it when restoring the 78 Champagne 
Edition...yes, it is gone, but took about 3 months of sand blasting abuse.

Will try the SEM rust shield on the back of the sand blaster as well.



Cheers, dave
