    Just a note to those in the dark, charging lead acid batteries generates
hydrogen, hydrogen DOES build up to explosive levels within the battery. The
danger comes about when you start fiddling with what looks like a perfectly
good battery post  to install or remove the cable (or just clamping a jumper
cable to the post).

    It turns out that "perfectly good" battery post is actually damaged and
loose in the case, as you notice the post wiggle/move and you begin to think
"oh s**t, I need a new battery" a spark jumps INSIDE the case from the loose
post to the rest of the battery and BOOM! You've just eaten a face full of
plastic and battery acid!  Well, whether the battery explodes with enough
force to shred plastic, or just enough to blow the caps off and send 6 jets
of battery acid into your face isn't really important, if you loose an eye
do you care if it was the plastic or the acid...

    If you think this is phooey, extremely rare, or a nearly non-exist
phenomenon that only happens in labs etc. YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN. My brother
had a battery blow up in his face when he was about 17 and was lucky enough
to run blind to the bathroom sink and flush the hell out of his face/eyes
and, lucky suffered no permanent damage.

It is rare, it does happen, so do yourself a big favor and always turn your
face away, or better yet use the hood of a normal car to shield your face
when connecting jumper cables or otherwise initially messing with any
unsealed lead acid battery terminals.
