Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15

I painted my rusty wheelbarrow 3 years ago.  I converted the rust first
(didn't even sand) and then painted on the POR15.. I never top coated to see
what would happen.  It sits outside all the time in the sun.  You can see
how the sun has shortened it's life..  But the rust has not come back thru
yet.  I am sure it will soon but this project was a test to see how well it
worked.

YMMV (just my personal experience)
