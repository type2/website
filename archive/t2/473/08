I've used POR-15 on my notch's floor pans, and like
said, if used properly (its all in the prep w/ all
paint jobs) it should last, and  last.. 
I've also used their two part epoxy, WOW, that stuff
works great.. 

Of course only time will tell how well it holds up,
but i will say it is a very hard product to beat.. 

the key again is PREPARATION !!!!!

peace,
