Oh Matt, you have obviously never driven 10 hours to a
bus campout in North Carolina (from Ohio) with a 10,
4, and 2 year old!!  Remember when you were a kid, how
long did it take you to get bored with "I Spy" and
looking out the window? I remember being bored about
30 minutes into the trip.  That's about the time I
started poking my little brother and holding my finger
about 1\8 inch from his face saying "I'm not touching
you!!" Then he'd do that trick where he farted in his
hand and threw it at me. These are the games I
remember!!
I just can't yell as well as my Dad could, so I see
this as a peaceful solution for those long trips,
don't worry the TV\VCR will not turn on unless it is
at least a 2 hour trip ;^)
