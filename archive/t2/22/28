Subject: Re: [T2] Removing and Replacing Windows

Having just done this myself in order to paint my '77, here is my =
experience; if the seals are old and hard, just use a carpet knife with =
a new blade to cut the old seal from the outside and carefully pop out =
the glass. You should be able to do this part by yourself. Order, and =
have in hand, all the new seals BEFORE you destroy any old seals. Three =
years ago I cut out a seal and removed the glass on my old '76 Westy, =
only to find the seal was not available at that time from any vendor-not =
good! It takes two people to reinstall the glass using the cord in the =
groove method, although I've heard one person can do it, but I don't =
know how. I laid the glass with the new seals installed in the sun so =
the seals would get warm, then covered the seals with talcum powder-they =
all went back in very easily-except for those damn jalousie windows. I =
had one hell of a time getting those back in, and ended up scratching my =
new paint as well.   Good luck,   Jeff
