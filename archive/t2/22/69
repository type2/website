Pro glass people use suction cups as well.  I've used suction cups on
raised floors (back in the days when the _terminals_ as well as the
mainframe were cooled by under-floor air!) and note that they had a bad
habit of losing their suction right when you were holding the 10-pound
floor panel over your big toe.  I wouldn't use them on glass unless I
tested them under tension for several minutes, and even then I'd put
Vaseline on the lip of the cup.

I wish I had those floors in my house.  It makes plumbing and electrical
work a snap!  :)
