Ouch!  All-caps is considered to be SHOUTING.  Please don't do it!

On to your problem.  I suppose that it would be theoretially possible to
have the cam 180 degrees out, but it is much more likely that the
distributor drive is 180 degrees out.  You can get a distributor drive
puller, or use the "jam the stick" method and pull the drive out and turn
it 180 degrees before reinserting.  That would put TDC on #1 on the mark
on the distrbutor housing.
