Subject: Charging Voltage

A short question for the list: I have replaced the voltage regulator on my
74 (with alternator). I tested the current at the battery and at
2000rpm I'm reading 15.4 volts. Is this too high? I think the new regulator
has cured the flickering dash lights problem; I'll know more after dark! ;~)

Thanks, Dave
