With an air conditioner v-belt pulley behind the engine fan on a type 4
it would be easy enough to just use a VW Vanagon  (83.5 to 91) power
steering pump to circulate the oil through a cooler on an air cooled
engine, probably just a task of eliminating the actuator valve action on
the pump so it would run constant.
This could be an avenue I take as a last resort.
