Subject: 30 amp or 38 amp

Hello,
	Got a question on my 71 dormobile. Battery has not been charging, pulled
negative cable off battery and engine dies. Generator checks fine so I
would assume from postings and new found friends at work the voltage
regulator would be at fault.
	Ok I bought a reg for a bus 38 amps on the old boss, so 38 amps it is.
Neighbor said hey wait your generator is stamped 30 amps and engine is from
a bug, you need a 30 amp regulator! I was just curious if anyone also
thinks that this may have been the cause of my no charging condition
because of the mismatch???
