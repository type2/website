Subject: RE: [T2] Child's cot

My canvas "seems" to be in pretty good shape. Thanks for the tips about the 
ends though, we were more concerned about him rolling off than them coming 
out - now that you mention it - that seems VERY possible. Gonna look into so 
methods of locking them in...

Speaking of the quality of the material - has anyone had any luck anything 
other than the factory type stuff? I was thinking about going to an 
upholstery shop and having some pieces custom made out of stronger canvas.
