I will get this bus inspected!!!

read brake archives--helpful--but may I vent?
gotta frozen star on left rear front shoe. argggh.
 
**do I have to pull drum and disassemble or should I
get a "bigger hammer" and give it a whack or two
first? WD-40 in the brake drum??
BTW, to make me more insane, my bus's brakes are some
late-67-early-68 hybrid that don't match the fotos in
Bentley or muir's drawings and descriptions. (both
stars are at 6 o'clock)..

 still fighting the high/low beam battle. both the
relay AND the switch in the turnsignal bad. Got two
replacement relays--both defective from the
manufacturer (one brazil and one ireland). Third one
on order. 
so frustrated, I got a NAPA Jeep foot button hi-beam
switch that will work with a Goldberg application.

 i'll MAKE this #&%(-at-)$% thing work!!!
