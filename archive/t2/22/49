Subject: re: Window Replacement

Volks,

I've not yet replaced the glass in my 78 Westy (will be doing so when I get a paint job this Spring), but... someone indicated that it was 'possible' for one person to do the job alone.

With the thinking cap on: I work in a heavily computerized office, where the floor is actually a platform of 24"x24" tile raised perhaps a foot from the real floor (allows for fantastic air conditioning). We have these little sucker-thingy's, basically a handle with two giant suckers on them (pulling the trigger releases the tile). I imagine that using one of these puppies might make things a bit easier for the sole window-popper.
