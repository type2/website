Subject: RE: Child Cot

[...] I would suggest that maybe your daughter was too light for the design.
Our daughter was about 5 when we got our '71 Westy and, until she outgrew
the cot, we never had any problems.  Her weight kept the canvas tight
preventing the poles from coming out.  We always kept our luggage on the
front seats which reduced the drop in case of an accident.
