George, Stan:
I'd second George's reasoning on this.
I believe the 911's cooler is on the scavenge side, so would not effect the
pressure on the supply side.
(Actually, I have one of these setups in one of my vast piles of GOOD STUFF,
waiting for the day I put a killer type 4 engine in my 67 912! I could look at
it  for someone's information if it would be helpful.)
Understand that the DM way that Porsche did this entailed about $1500 worth of
nice German hardware. Only 2 of the 20 or so type 2's I have owned cost more IN
TOTAL  than this oil cooler setup. I really have to question (along with Dr.
Tim) whether any of this is even necessary unless you are running 103mm big
bores!
