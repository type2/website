Hey there Heidi,

Check out the link here:

http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/20010702022731.97840.qmail(-at-)web13504.mail.yahoo.com.html

I posted a message to someone a couple of months ago who had a
similar question. Just in case the link above doesn't work here's the
text below. Also make sure that all the connections on the starter
are clean (and the metal contacts are shiny - use sandpaper). It's
alot easier to clean the starter connections then it is to replace
the switch 8^)

Hey there,

The basics are covered in Bentley and Haynes. You do have a manual,
right ?? 

I would also make sure that the problem is definitely the switch, and
not another part of the starting system. Replacing a battery or
starter is alot easier then replacing the switch. (You probably have
already checked the easy stuff, but I figured I'd mention it).

You didn't say what year bus you have but check out:

Hope this helps,
