According to the law of intermediate metals for thermocouples, your two 
junctions with the copper extension wires, should be at the same 
temperature, in order not to contribute their own nett voltage signal.

Instead of using ordinary copper wire, I have used foil & copper braided, 
low-low, screened, twisted-pairs cable (as used in computer networks and 
telecommunications) to minimise capacitive and inductive signal noise. This 
is coonected at either end using 5-pin audio DIN plugs.
