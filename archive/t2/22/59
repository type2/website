Subject: Yakima Show Anyone Convoying this year?

Well I was planning on heading out today from Tacoma to the Apple Valley
show. I was wondering if anyone else was heading over today that wanted to
travel in a group. I was planning on leaving at 12:30 in order to make it to
the burger meet and take part in the activities.
If anyone wants to Caravan with me and my son Jared, just drop me a line
prior to 11:30. I was planning on taking Chinook pass over.
Thanks Shawn
