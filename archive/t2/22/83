Subject: Found a bus (Newbie again) is Dallas!  & one more Q

Evening, folks -- I just got back from Dallas where I
found a bus.  I looked at Joe Mac's, but it was a
little far gone for my current abilities (keep in mind
I am in the military, away from home and all my
tools), but I did talk to a friend who mentioned
seeing a bus at a local dealership.  We went and had a
look, and there were two buses: I wound up with a
pretty darned nice 71 bus with Westy interior (incl
sink) but no pop-top for $600 cash (it even has a
clean, open title).  It needs head work, as the timing
belt snapped on the highway, but the engine spins
freely.  I'm checking on rebuild options in Dallas
this week.

My friend wound up with the other bus (a 73 or so
transporter with nice interior and excellent body, but
also bad head(s)) for $250.  

I do have one question, though...  the 71 I got had
apparently been parked too near a tall curb, as the
rear right side has a cleanm rip in the sheet metal
and a big piece of the battery tray is missing,
leaving a hole in the engine compartment underneath. 
Will this negatively affect the air pressure/temp in
the engine compartment to the point that I ought to
worry about elding or somehoe covering it up before
driving it a couple hours back to the base?  The
battery has been relocated to the other side of the
engine compartment, so that's not an issue at current.

More to follow when more time permits it...

Thanks again for all the kind advice; you're all a
swell bunch!  8^)

Chris
