Go for it. That's just how I did it on my '78 bus. It's probably about 4.5
feet one way to the aux cooler, 9 foot round trip. I still have 60psi+
pressure when running, as measured by the sensor immediately after this
loop. It's been in place for 7 years with no real problems and much cooler
engine operating temps as a result.

Have fun,
