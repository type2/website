Subject: bus suddenly goes out of gear

Hi folks,

i was driving home last night, and the woman in front of me decided to slam 
on her brakes, no signal, to turn in her driveway.  I followed suit, so as 
not to bump her into next week, and my bus seemed to 'pop' out of gear, it 
wouldn't go back in, i have little to no mechanical ability (but i am a 
hell of a cook...) any clue as to what it could be, and potential $$$ to 
fix it?

Thanks

Rich

71 with 'no go' :(
