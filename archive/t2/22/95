Subject: bus rescue ambulance donations

To our community,

          On September 8, 2001 we found a toy rescue ambulance bus on an
*b*y.
          With several days left on the auction we left proxy bidding to do
the
          work for us. Needless to say that with the tragic events that
unfolded
          on September 11, 2001 we had completely forgot about trivial
matters
          such as this. Not until September 14, 2001 when the auction ended
did
          remember and did we realize the symbolism of it. We cannot help
but
          believe that this toy bus has a message to give. As we struggle
with
          these tragic times we often question the significance of our
earthly
          possessions and trivial habits. We as bus owners feel a since of
community
          through our buses. As many know and as this toy reminds us, allot
of
          these buses were used as emergency vehicles in the past. We would
like
          to us this toy bus as an avenue for our community to support the
men
          and women of our nations emergency response teams. With this, 10 %
of
          all used parts sales will be donated to the families of those who
lost
          there lives in Tuesdays tragedies. As we restore, fix, and drive
our
          buses we can hold our heads high knowing that once these buses
gave,
          and we too can know give.

Here at BUStedBUS we are starting to get things back on track in our hearts
and in our lives.
