Subject: Removing and Replacing Windows

Hi all,

While I'm repairing some rust on my '75 bus, I was wondering whether I
should replace some of the window seals at the sme time. I was not planning
to remove any windows, however I would be able to do a better job if I did
remove the central off side window. How hard is it to remove, and more
importantly, put back windows. Is it something I can do by myself, or will I
need a mate or two? Do I need any special tools? Is it too big a job for
someone without any experience working on car bodywork?

Thanks,

Paul.
