Actually, if the cam is 180 degrees out, by turning the crank 360 degrees,
the cam will be in the right place.
I would agree that the problem is the distributor drive.
I would agree completely with your remedy.
the engine would NEVER have run if the cam and crank were off by more than a
tooth and then, it would not run well.
