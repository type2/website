Subject: Re: [T2] brake flexline bracket

The ends of the rubber brake line hoses go through the holes in the metal
brackets and are secured by spring clips that slide into a groove in the
metal end fitting of the rubber brake line.  One side of the clip bears
against the inside of the groove and the other bears against the bracket.
The clips are made of springy sheet metal and are shaped like a
flat-bottomed "U".  The bottom edge is bent up 90 degrees to form a tab by
which they can be pushed in and pried out.  The sides of the "U" are bowed
out to provide the spring action.
