Subject: towing my bus

I need to tow my bus 18 miles.  What is the best way to go about doing 
this?  My friend's dad has a shop in anaheim where we'll be able to drop 
my engine and swap it out into my other bus and then tow it back.

Is there anyone in the long beach, CA area that has a tow bar or tow 
dolly which I could borrow or rent?  I have a 78 westy and my friend has 
a 2000 ford ranger...

I am debating doing it in my garage, but I'll only be able to jack up 
the car about 15 inches.  Is this enough?

thanks,
Mike
