HELLO EVERYONE,
I HAVE A 78 T2 WITH A WIERD PROBLEM, THE ENGINE WAS REBUILD WHEN I GOT IT. 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT IN THE CAM 180 DEGREES OUT? 
I'VE LOOKED AT SIX DIFFERENT ENGINES OF THE SAME YEAR AS MY AND SAME FI 2L 
AND THE WIRING IS THE SAME ON ALL BUT MINE, IN ORDER FOR MY 78 TO RUN ON ALL 
FOUR I HAVE TO START NUMBER ONE PLUG WIRE 180 OUT FROM THE MARK ON THE DIST. 
THAT IS ALSO WHERE WHEN AT TDC AND NUMBER ONE IS ON COMPRESSION STROKE THE 
ROTOR POINTS AND I NOW CALL THAT NUMBER ONE (WHERE NUMBER THREE SHOULD BE). I 
KNOW THAT THE DIST IS IN RIGHT BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY GO IN ONE WAY. AND IF THIS 
IS SO HOW WILL IT AFFECT THE PREFORMANCE OF THE ENGINE OR SHOULD I BE 
CONCERNED? AT THE PRESENT TIME IT RUNS GREAT. INFORMATION NEEDED OR I MAY GO 
INSANE?
