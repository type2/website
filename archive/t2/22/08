You can drill out the jet.  I have done this many times with good luck.  A
good tool supply store can get you the American equivalent of the size drill
you need.

You can also change the jet without removing the carb.  With practice the
entire process only takes a few minutes.  Here it is:

1.  remove the coil as it is in the way.

2.  remove the 13mm plug in the side of the carb.  Gas will pour out when
you do this

3.  stick a medium flat screw driver in and loosen the jet but do not remove
completely.

4.  stick something sharp into the carb and into the center of the jet.  I
have used a straight dental pick in the past.  Tap it in as to cause an
interference fit into the jet it self.

5.  turn the sharp object to finish removing the jet.  Carefully pull the
sharp object out with the jet stuck on the end.

6.  go ahead and drill out the jet to the desired amount.  I usually would
hold the drill bit with a pair of pliers and twist the jet over it.

7.  Tap the jet back onto the sharp object and stick it back into the carb

The only tricky part of this process is keeping the jet on the end of the
sharp object.
