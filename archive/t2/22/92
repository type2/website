Well, that makes mine different than either of them. It has the  BA-6 but no
fresh air  fans! and just the moulded parcel shelf instead of the glove box.
Where I'm headed with all this is that I'd like to install a  fresh air fan,
especially since an upcoming job is replacing one of the wiper transmissions,
which means taking out the dash and air distributor box anyway. I have access
to an 82 parts car.
I hope the whole air distributor box will just interchange.
BTW, what's up with this metal 80-only air intake you mentioned?
