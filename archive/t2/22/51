Subject: Oil cooler lines

I'm about to mount an additional oil cooler on my 1983 Air Cooled 2000cc.
I'm using a sandwich type filter adapter and a stock (standard cooler for
the 2000cc) additional VW cooler.
I'd like to put it forward of the rear axles under the van for plenty of
air flow and was just wondering about the distance that I can run the
cooler lines, I've noted that Porsche runs a cooler on the front about 9
feet from the engine.
Are there general guidelines as to how far you can run oil cooler lines?
