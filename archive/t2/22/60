Subject: Need strange part

It would be 85014 in the Rocky Mountain Motorworks catalog.

The part is a front wheelhouse skin for the right side of a 1972 Bus.

85014 is a "generated" number; 85012 is the skin I need but for a 73-up and
85013 is the skin on the left side of the 72. They don=B9t have the skin for
the 72.

Two questions: will 85013 work on a 72 (it would probably look different,
and I can deal with that; this is no 10-point resto I'm doing here)? Does
anyone know where I can get the correct wheelhouse skin?

Thanks in advance.
