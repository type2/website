Subject: Re: [T2] have to keep push starting/ignition switch prob???

If your starter motor doesn't even turn over (ie, nothing happens when you
turn the ignition) after travelling for a good amount of time (so the engine
is nice and hot), it could be the same problem I had driving back from
France in August. On long and hot journeys, the starter motor expands in
it's case, so when you come to start your engine after a quick stop, the
starter motor is jammed and won't turn. The only solution I know of is to
wait for it to cool or bump start it down a hill (as you said). Of course if
this doesn't help, this probably isn't the problem.
