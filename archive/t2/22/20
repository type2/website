*********************************************
With the child's cot over the drivers seat, age is 
more important than weight.  The attachments to the
pillars are not that secure.  As soon as the child
awakes, he or she should be removed from the cot. 
If the child starts to move around, one of the poles
will slip out and "down will come baby, cradle and
all."  
**********************************************

My son has been sleeping in the front child cot for
many years in my 67 Sundial camper. His weight now is
appx 65 pounds and even has on occasion had a friend
up there with him for a total of 100lbs or more
without any sign of stress or problem.
Just my 2cents....
