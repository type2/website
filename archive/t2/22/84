Damn I was wondering why my engine would not run thought I was missing a part 
 I guess I figured it out. Had to be the timing belt that no one has in 
stock. Had to be a pretty crappy dealership if they told you it broke a 
timing belt. Figuring aircooleds dont have timing belts. They must have seen 
a sucker coming. Sounds like you need to get doing some reserch on VW's.
