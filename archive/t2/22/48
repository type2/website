List:
I've just started driving my 80 Vanagon Westy after giving it a rest for
6 years.
I put in a junkyard core engine (nearly new GEX, actually) that I had to
do some fixing on.
It seemed that the esteemed rebuilders at GEX knocked the key out of
place for the cooling fan hub. Instead of fishing out the key, they just
put in another. When I took it out of the fella's car the fan hub had
come loose from the crank and the engine had been running without a fan
till the valve guides melted and the valve springs got black and a
little short! The extra fan hub key was stuck between the cheek of the
crank and the hub, thus keeping the hub from seating on the taper.
I figured this thing to be junk, but in spite of all the overheating,
the pistons/ cylinders looked just like new, so I put on a different set
of heads, locktited the key and hub and thought I'd give it a try.
It seems to run pretty good, actually. It's been years since I drove an
air-cooled Vanagon and it's kind of fun. This thing is quite a bit
faster than my diesel Vanagon and quite a bit lighter (dare I say
nimbler?) than the 87 Vanagons that I usually drive, even though it is a
Westy deluxe.
There are a lot of things wrong with this vehicle, kinda rusty, and the
trans crunches in 2nd gear, but I'm planning on using it to travel
pretty soon!
I've got a couple of questions:
1. Do all 81 Vanagons have fresh air blowers and 80's not?
2. My 80 has only a bin instead of a glove box. Is this an 80 only Westy
thing?
