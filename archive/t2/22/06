Subject: Re: [T2] Removing and Replacing Windows

<snip>

I was wondering whether I should replace some of the window seals at the 
same time. I was not planning to remove any windows...

<unsnip>


Very simple to remove and very simple to replace. Take all of them out and 
look for rust.

I had rust in the front and back windows with some starting under the rear 
vent window.

Well worth your time.
