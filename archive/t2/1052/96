Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable streaching

Thanks for all of the suggestions.  The way I tightened the cable is by 
holding the hex end of the cable with some vicegrips and spun the 
wingnut by hand.  the last couple of times, i have greased it with multi 
purpose grease in hopes of eliminating the problem.  What happens is I 
can replace the cable and it drives fine but after about 2 days, the 
clutch starts to stay in even when I push the pedal down.  After about 4 
days, she starts to clunk every time I put her in gear (in all gears).

I will try replacing the bowden tube and the holder on the 
transmission.  How should I know what parts to purchase?  I know '74 was 
a split year for transmissions the transmission is a rebuild from a 
later bay but my van is an early '74.  So should i buy parts that work 
for the trans or the bus?  Also, should I be buying a cable for an early 
or later bay (i have been buying later bay cables)?

thanks for the advice.
Andrew
