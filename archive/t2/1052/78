Subject: popping ou of 1st

I have read in the archives that the transmission needs to be replaced
if the bus starts to pop out of gear.

1978 CDN 2L 166000 KM

1st feels like 2 stages of "clicks" going in.

What makes the positive lock of the movement of the shifter to feed back
to you that are in gear?

Every gear has a fair amount of "wiggle".

It has always popped out on me, just not this easily.
