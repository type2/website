So no grinding, growling or clunking?? And it doesn't pop out of gear once you find it??  Sounds more like a linkage issue than a  tranny issue.  Adjust shift plate under the rubber boot at the base of the shifter?  Crawl under and look at the shift shaft coupling while a buddy sits in the driver seat and shifts through the gears, is the shaft on both sides of the coupling moving the same??
PEACE!
