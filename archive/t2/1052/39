Subject: Distributor ground strap source?

That's the problem with my distributors. The itty bitty braided wires
have dark spots... Shorts that burned up at least some of the wires.
This includes the "new" one that the Guac is rolling right now. I had
a breakdown last week that was "fixed" by pinching the ground strap
inside the distributor.

So I need to find a source of new braided wire similar to what was in there.

Thanks.
