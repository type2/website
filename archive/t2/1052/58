Subject: Engine Advice - San Diego

Hey Volks!

Some advice please.

A while back while driving down the road my
engine seized.  Last week I pulled the engine (my first time, I might add.)
Here are my preliminary findings. 

b74, 1800 Porsche case in my b72 Westy
- I can not manually rotate the engine more than about half a turn in either
direction.
- Pull the spark plugs to find shavings on the #1 plug (front
right)
- Shavings also in the oil sump screen. 
- Pull the right side exhaust
manifold. I can see that both the exhaust valve and the valve seat are broken.
Pieces of the seat fell out but no sign of the valve itself.

I have not yet
pulled the Head (my likely next step) but my assumption is that the broken
Valve is stuck/lodged in the Cylinder and preventing the Piston from its full
range of motion. 

Sob& my basic line of questioning isb& As a novice to
engine work, is this going to be more work than itbs worth?  I feel fairly
confidant that I can pull/replace the heads and probably the pistons and
cylinders. But I also realize that metal shavings in the sump means shavings
within the case; I am not confidant in splitting the case and/or rebuilding
it. Maybe a local place can do a rebuild. Could I get away with somehow
flushing the case?

Advice from you Volkswageneers on the seriousness of the
issue and what to do is greatly appreciated. 

A big part of me wants to go
straight to new (or new to me) engine. Advice on where to get a new long block
would be nice as well. ImportMotor.com, BostonEngine, JCS, GEX (yes, Ibve
heard the stories) etc. Please suggest other sites.  Maybe I can get lucky and
find a San Diego local who is upgrading.

Thanks to everyone and type2.com
