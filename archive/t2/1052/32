Hi Paul,

For a couple of weeks in the summer of 2006 there was a guy named John 
Wallace on the Vanagon list who went on vacation with an auto-responder 
attached to his email. And at the same time, the list administrator was 
away from the internet. This meant that every single post generated a 
response to the originator. Attempts to resolve the situation from both 
ends failed to stop the messages until Mr Wallace went back to work.

After a while, those responses were so common that the situation is 
still referred to by some as "being Wallaced".

Mr. Wallace is not impressed.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
