Jon,

I found a two different sets on theSamba for about 120 bones out of  
Australia where they seem to be the most common.

I have one set in my '68 Double Cab and they work very well. I used  
them today in fact giving my mother a tour of the turning Aspen trees.  
She said, "Oh, it is so hot, can we get some ventilation in here"?  
Click, whirrrrrrrr...
