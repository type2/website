Subject: source(s) needed for polygraphite/polyurethane parts

Hey fellow enthustiasts,

I am looking for ALL sources to supply polygraphite/polyurethane parts for our
BAY WINDOWS. In return I will put together a database, and forward it to
RATWELL for his sight.

I also know a source that will manufacture parts, but we need a large call to
begin with... and I know I can rely on everyone here for that input and
sales.

Please describe the PART, LOCATION, YEARS, STOCK NUMBER, and SOURCE.
