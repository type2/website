I had one of these come adrift and I soldered it back on.  Originally this
wire is spot welded.  I used flux and cleaned everything very well.  And
when the soldering was done I cleaned up the flux also.  Too much solder
will make the wire stiff and it will break again after so many movements
of the advance plate.  To solve this problem once and for all I had the
distributor rebuilt.  Best of luck,
