Yeah, I know all about it.  Since we are talking about it, I have been
working on and off all summer trying to get my steering wheel off, to
replace the ignition switch.  I get the nut off no problem, but then that
thing (the steering wheel) is stuck on the splined area.  I have tried a
puller, no luck.  Not sure where to go from here.  I thought I remembered
someone mentioning drilling and tapping the steering wheel, but I can't find
anything about it in the archives.  Any ideas would be appreciated.

 

Best regards,
