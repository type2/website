i'm sorry i didn't mention it to hold the drive down while turning the
engine.  I stuck my finger in the drive hole holding it down and noticed that
it was trying to rise up at one certain spot while i was holding it down. I
thought it was intuitive.  I'm sorry if i caused any confusion. Greg

screwing up your timing wonderfully. Don't ask me how I know.
