Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line grommet

I tend to keep the grommet and slit a 4" bit of german braided fuel hose, slip
it over the through area, and cable tie on both sides in place myself.  I put
the slit to one side.
 
Have a look at your engine mounts as well folks, although the tin is attached
at least semi-rigidly to the engine, it also abuts the vehicle which is sort
of another stationary point, if the mounts are shot it makes vibration,
relative movement, and cutting effect worse.  A real barbed bulkhead fitting
in brass is another alternative, proffered over the years on the list by Bob
Hoover and others,  (Mc-Master-Carr or maybe Grainger? would be likely
sources.)
 
The take home on this should however be that frequent inspection is MANDATORY
of all the lines, particularly the through tin areas.  The ones I usually see
worse than any other are the lines on the injectors, which can be replaced
(see the archives) but seldom are.
 
The waterboxer solution for the grommet was a true through bulkead, but now
unfortunately in 20+ year old plastic in most of them which makes me even more
nervous, as who knows how long they will last...  The last time I looked I
couldnt get one, but I wasn't looking too hard.

I haven't used a grommet in years, and you don't need to disconnect
anything to properly protect your fuel line, better than that cheap
grommet will ever be.
