I'm not familiar with that, but I just use black moly grease for my
throttle and clutch cables. The "crunchy" feeling you're talking about
is probably from the mechanism behind the pedal. Get down there and
grease that up first.
 
   I replaced that rust-prone hinge about ten years ago with a large solid
   brass T-hinge bolted thru the floor and thru the pedal...It was from a
   hundred year old house when I got it... ;-)
