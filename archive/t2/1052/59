Subject: rear suspension...

Lookin' about under my '79 Bus, I scraped a ton of undercoat off the area 
where the 
torsion tubes go thu' the frame...I used a chipping hammer to remove most of 
the
rust...Not so bad, but obviously I'd prefer to stop it now from rusting 
further...I'm 
familiar with the rust-converters (phosphoric acid in its many guises), but 
open to
any other suggestions...?-)
I'm also thinking of welding in supplemental plates to maintain its 
structural integrity...
Any hints or warnings on that...?
