I really like the throttle cable explanation.

It is obviously the right thing to lube it up.

If anyone cares to mention a different, easy to purchase in Canada
lubricant, kindly let me know either privately or on list.

It is wonderful how many responses I received concerning my problem.

I pedal play is a bit "crunchy".

My intent is to use Rust Check as my lube of choice.
