Subject: RE: [T2] Genrator or Alternator?

Everyone, thanks for the help with my generator issue.

I am guessing it is some add on or second source generator.  The small
square item at the top was a built in Volt Reg.  The large wire would
normally be the red wire to the + battery power (is now), and the small
wire would normally be the blue wire going to the front dashboard system
(is now).

I think I have all that fixed now.

I think it is pretty funny that this original question, while it
produced lots of info I found useful and critical to figuring this out,
has also spun off into a discussion about using alternators for 120VAC
power and all the different things that can be done to the original
design.  You have to admit that's pretty funny.

Thanks again to everyone, especially VW Tech Bob, Brad, Robert, and
Greg.

Everyone have a great weekend.

Paul

So I think I have a generator, but there are only two wires coming off
of it
and there is no VR on the back wall.  The generator body is round, and
on the
top of it is a > ' thick, 2 x 2" box that the wires attach to.  Does
this
sound familiar to anyone?
