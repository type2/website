Subject: Re: [T2] EGR Valve Diaphragm Replacement?

Here's an update in case anyone searches for this topic in the archives. I originally asked if anyone knew how I could fix the diaphragm inside my EGR valve:

>> the rubber (?) diaphragm inside the mechanical EGR valve on my '78
>> Westy is full of holes and leaking. I understand new valves are NLA...

>> My question is - has anyone found a creative way to re-manufacture 
>> a replacement for this diaphragm? 

I bought a cheap oven glove which was fabric, with a thin layer of neoprene on one side. I cut a diaphragm out of the neoprene and it worked fine to get me past smog. It will probably fail long-term, since the original is molded to shape, whereas this one is flat, so is stretched when in the closed position (and will therefore probably tear eventually). 

I was hoping to find something that was already molded to shape and just the right size (maybe part of a silicone jello mold??), but I guess the stars weren't aligned in my favor...

cheers
