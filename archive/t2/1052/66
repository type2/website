ok so I get word from a friend that there is a woman who needs some help 
on a vanagon, getting ready for a road trip.  so I head over there after 
securing some wood gathering permits for the fall.

first thing I see is a gutted early vanagon on ramps with parts laying 
all over the road, fuel tank also, engine in the bus, total basket 
case.  then, I notice in the driveway is another Assuan Brown aircooled 
'gon, with lots of bondo in progress but looks a little more complete. phew!

the Birgitta comes out and introduces herself. sure 'nuff the one in the 
driveway is the transplant recipient. had a small engine fire, put out 
immediately. wiring harness was burned. so there's another wiring 
harness from the donor. she's been cleaning up and sorting out parts but 
feeling a little over her head. (e.g. no metric tools etc.)

so she's all stoked about pulling wiring harnesses (yup allofum) from 
the donor bus to go into the, uh, well the other one.

upon closer inspection the donor is a 1980 federal, the recipient is a 
1981 california electronic hall sender ignition.

can anyone help with some 80-83 california parts? need ignition module 
211 905 351. cold start valve. DISTRIBUTOR 039 905 205C.  is it 
difficult to replace the hall module in this dizzy? it was toasted.

not sure if the federal harness will work at all. need to spend some 
time tracing connections.  Do we need the whole california computer or 
will the federal version work?

assuan brown paint code and a cheap brand?

TIA,
Will A.
