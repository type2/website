I think someone has a "Reply All"  "Out of Office" type message set up on
their computer.  I did this once to a technical chat group and got kicked off!
Kind of funny.

Can somebody tell me why everytime I post to the type2 list, I get this
message?  It translates to:

"Dear Sr/a: Welcome to the service of electronic mail of the Vestibule of the
Government of Aragon, we communicated to him that we have received its
message
correctly. Him respoderemos shortly. Kindly. Vestibule of the Government of
Aragon"
