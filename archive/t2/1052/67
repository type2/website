I would be VERY careful about turning the engine with the dizzy out, as the gear can climb high enough in some cases to actually change a tooth on the camshaft, screwing up your timing wonderfully. Don't ask me how I know.

 while the
distributor is out making sure that the distrubutor drive is not 
 jumping up
