I was thinking the same thing. Short term fix for lubing it up is to
remove the points and pour mineral oil into the distributor. Let it
set overnight, then pour out what comes out easily and put it back
together and into the bus.

It's not ideal, a full teardown would be better. But it works.

Do an oil change soon after so the mineral oil doesn't cause any
problems in the crankcase. I don't know what it can do, and I'd rather
not find out.

(I did that on the dist that I just picked up from the junkyard that
fixed the Guac. Time for the oil change now too.)
