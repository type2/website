Subject: Wiper Switch

Hi,

Three of the wires to the wiper motor on my '71 have come off the switch
(probably from when I was under the dash last time). I have wiring diagrams
and have spent the past 90 minutes trying to see the terminal numbers on the
switch using various mirrors and lights. I just can't get in close enough. Can
anybody tell me, using the positions of the terminals as a reference which
wire goes where?

There are 6 terminals. With the switch mounted in the dashboard there are:
1. 2 terminals on the left (LEFT is left side of bus facing forward)
vertically oriented one above the other,
2. 2 terminals on the right vertically oriented one above the other;
3. one at the top horizontally oriented in the center
4. the 6th is vertically oriented, on the left, but to the right of the 2 left
side terminals.

The 3 terminals that are disconnected are the horizontally oriented one at the
top center, the top left side terminal and the "6th" terminal mentioned in #4
above.

The three wires that are disconnected are: Black, Black/Violet?, Brown (the
Black and Yellow from the wiper motor is connected to the switch already).

Many thanks,
Bruce
