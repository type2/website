I was under the impression that a distributor which was off by a tooth 
or so has nothing to do with the timing being "wrong" but just that the 
position for TDC for #1 cylinder would no longer correspond with the 
mark on the distributor where the rotor "should" point.  I've not had 
this problem but was led to believe that  the solution would  to 
determine TDC for #1 by getting the notch/mark on the crankshaft pulley 
and the movements of the valves for #1 cylinder to be in correct TDC 
position and then rotate the distributor body enough to have the rotor 
pointing to the #1 plug wire on the distributor cap.  An alternate 
solution would be to move the plug wires be moved 1 or more positions 
clockwise or counter clockwise on the distributor cap to get "going"  
Granted, selling a car with this type of "fix" would certainly result in 
your being referred to (rightly so) as the DFPO.
