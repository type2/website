the Porsche case is a deal changer from my point of view, not as
forgiving as the VW case.

I would agree with your first guess.

I have done this (a VW 2 liter) and being broke at the time, just
stuffed one piston and Cyl on the engine, old matching head, and drove
it for another 50,000 miles.

but this is a crap shot, it might go 50,000 or it might go 5 ??

think you have got your ducks lined up fine.

if it were me,  I would make the modes and put a 2 liter engine in it.
I have gotten engines from GEX and Boston Engine plus one I did
with help.

I've had this same 78 as my daily driver for over 250,000+ miles and
18 years.


the one I did was maybe the most expensive but well over 150,000 with
nary a burp.

the GEX went 3,700 miles,

I have a Boston Engine in there now but only about 5,000 miles or so,
the jury is still out but it seems to be a solid engine. (I've also
heard good things about NorthWest Connecting Rod, in Seattle.)

so my advice.

cheap and fast - replace head and piston/cyl

risky, - GEX

mid level,- find a good used engine.

maybe/maybe not - but if you have the time and money, rebuild it
yourself (helps to have help from someone who has done it)

best - Get a 2liter Boston or Seattle rebuild.

My opinion only.

Bob
