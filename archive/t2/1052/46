Alan,

I think that checking your distributor was the best advice as my money
goes on some sort of timing pathology. Does the vacuum advance plate
move easily? An easy test is to suck on the vacuum canister port and
see if the plate moves. (Sorry if this sounds a bit, uh, "clinical".)

But if the accelerator sticks as you say, I would pull the cable and
check it for fraying.

Also see if you can replicate the problem when actuating the throttle
valve from the engine bay.

Otherwise, have a look at the type.com/dakhlia AFC troubleshooter.
(upper left corner, click on "Fuel Injection (HTML)").
