Tony,

I like Picklex. Does an excellent job of converting the rust and leaving a 
phosphate coating. Treated steel can be left outside for months without 
rusting. I used it under POR15.

Do a web search for Picklex. Don't be too shocked at the price. The quart I 
purchased 5 years ago is still going strong. It goes a long ways.

Chris
