Subject: 75 Bay window for sale in SW Ohio

Due to lingering physical problems from a broken hand and ligaments, I am
selling my 75 bay window.  It is nice, white over medium blue, all original
in and out with an excellent white interior and less rust than usual for the
area.  Rolls, stops, turns, shifts just fine.  
 
It has lots of new parts on the original 1.8 engine, 136k miles, runs but
needs finishing in the exhaust area and pushrod tube seals, it will be a
long while till I can wrench again so it will just sit and degrade.  It's
too nice for that and too nice to part out, I have it priced at less than
$1k, I believe the tranny and interior would bring that.  
 
Please email me off list for details and photos.  
 
Bus will need to be trailered or towed.  Zip is 45309.
 
thanks
 
Joe
