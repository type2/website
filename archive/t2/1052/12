Subject: Y connector from Intake air box to brake booster difference

The original Y tube from the airbox to brake booster (just before the 
one way valve) and to the decel valve was all cracked and I got a 
BusDepot replacement- I noticed it has no "valve" inside where the 
original one does- anyone notice this and can explain if it is needed?
