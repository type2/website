Ok,,, guessing a LOT here... I think it is a 1978 Volkswagen Bus type 2...
with a 2 liter efi engine...

I think your looking at the throttle body air valve cable post.... it has a
connection for the accelerator cable,, and for the EGR linkage... and most
EGR are blocked off. and the linkage removed..

usually I say ... that isn't required and you don't need to worry about
it.... but there are a lot of folks on this list who know it is a good thing
to have connected ... for the smog and the environment... and they do need
to have it connected for emission inspection annually..

what is the problem we are working on here Alan...???
