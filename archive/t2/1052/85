Subject: Parcel Tray Installation

I am finally getting around to installing my OG parcel trays for my  
Double Cab. I have the original bracketry, but I wonder if anyone has  
some photos of them installed, and the location of the inside brackets  
as well as the attachment to the vent covers.

Thanks,

Jon
