I haven't used a grommet in years, and you don't need to disconnect
anything to properly protect your fuel line, better than that cheap
grommet will ever be.

Get some inner tube rubber and cut a strip about 2 inches wide and 18
inches long.

Pull the grommet out the front side of the tin.  It can stay on the line,
just push it out of the way.

Wrap the inner tube rubber around and around the fuel line until it is
slightly larger than the hole in the tin.  Trim off the excess end of the
strip.

Push the inner tube wrap into the hole in the tin, leaving an inch on
either side.  You're done, probably for a decade or more.

The advantage to this technique is that, if the inner tube starts to fail,
it will fail from the outside-in, splitting in two around the hole.  This
will give lots of time to notice and replace the strip.  Grommets tend to
fail all at once, starting the slow slotting of the metal line.
