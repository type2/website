Subject: Missing 3rd Gear

Here is my problem.  Please help.

Situation:
1971 Westfalia with 6-rib transmission transplant from a 1976.
Everything has been working fine for about four months.  All gears have worked
fine but I hit the emergency brake handle when I go into third gear.  I was
coming home from a car show this weekend when suddenly I can't get into third.
I can get first, second, and fourth (when going down the road) but not third.
Limped home with 3 of the 4 forward gears.  Stopped the vehicle and I can
shift into all 4 gears.
I adjusted the gear shift and now I can get into third sometimes but other
times it seems that it goes into first when I shift into third.  It seems
(might just be my perception) that I can get into third better when going less
than 10mph.

Question:
Am I looking at transmission problems or just some sort of linkage and/or gear
shift adjustment problem?


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael Martin
Montevallo, Alabama
