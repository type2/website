Subject: Re: [T2] Curtain rings for 71 Westy sliding door

As I recall, the curtain rod sliders (look like little mushroom caps)you 
get at a fabric place like JoAnn's may slide into the same groove- the 
spacing in a curtain rod (the kind that takes the sliders) is similar. 
You sew the curtain to the sliders, which are longer than stock.
