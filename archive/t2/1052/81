Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable streaching

If it stretches more than a little bit, your cable may be unraveling.

When adjusting it during installation, did you just spin the wing nut
with your hand? Or did you use a wrench or pliers on the hex shaped
part of the threaded end? If the former, you've unraveled it.
