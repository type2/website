Subject: Found a mouse and nest in my 78 Riveria

Not sure if it has been all the rain we have had or because I haven't driven
my Van in a month or two but this weekend when I went to use it I found
evidence of mice droppings.  Upon further investigation had a mouse run past
me while I was driving and went up under the front kick panels.  My wife found
that the mouse had taken a nice pair of oven mits and made a nest in which we
found about 6 newborn mice.  They have moved to the dumpster but am not sure
if Momma left or is still hanging around.  During winter storage I use moth
balls but am not sure they work so am looking for suggestions as to making
sure the mouse is gone and how to keep them out.  We're going camping this
coming weekend and I don't want to wake up next to anything other than my
wife.  Thanks for any help you can give me. Kevin
