Hi All, Pat, 

Actually, my plug wires *are* jumped 1 position.  The location of my
coil stretches the distributor-to-coil wire too tightly with the "stock"
placement of the dizzy drive gear.  It also makes it easier to get the
dizzy cap clips on and off.  I may have gotten the dizzy drive gear a
tooth off, but it's properly timed with the right amount of advance.  

*I* know that it's one position off, and I documented that in my Bentley
in the section on the distributor, so if I forget and drag out the
manual, it'll be staring me in the face. :)  

Since I don't plan on selling the bus unless there's some disaster of
biblical proportions that happens to my wife and myself, I don't mind
"buggering" the bus a little bit.  But you'd better bet your posterior I
document all my "fixes" in the Bentley!  A 1 minute note scribbled in
the appropriate section saves an hour trying to figure out what the hell
I did in the first place, and why.... (IE, like trying to figure out
exactly how the hell the DPO wired in the stereo & amp....)

Only thing that worries me about futzing with the distributor is that
little washer down there.  When assembling the engine, I just "glued" it
to the bottom of the dizzy shaft with grease.  I don't want it falling
down into the engine if I remove said shaft.  What do I do if that
happens?  I'm well aware of the trick of dropping it in over a pencil,
also.  

Thanks, and keep the ideas coming!

Shad H.
