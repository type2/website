Subject: Clutch cable streaching

Hey Volks,

I was wondering if someone could help me narrow down the cause of my
troubles.  The clutch cable on my '74 transporter is wearing out
(stretching) at an insanely quick pace.  I have replaced the clutch cable
three times now.  The first time, I used a Brazilian made cable but since
that I have used German made cables that I got from Bughaus.  The
transmission in the van was rebuilt two years ago but the problem hasn't
started until now.

Here are the specs:

2.0ltr air cooled motor from a '80 Vanagon
Original 215mm Flywheel
When the motor was replaced, I put in a new clutch plate, pressure plate,
and throw out bearing.

This problem started when I put the new motor in.  Could this be the cause
even if I have used the original clutch and flywheel?  Right now I don't see
any reason why the cable would be stretching but it is.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Thanks,
Andrew
