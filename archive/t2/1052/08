Hi Alan,

Order a replacement cable ASAP unless you already have one.

When I had the symptoms you mention, it was due to fraying of the cable 
where it crossed through the tin. About a third of the strands had 
broken and were binding up the cable in the tube. For a while I was able 
to keep it going with a stronger return spring, but the cable eventually 
broke, and stranded me on the way home from TCWBC 2006. At the side of 
the 401. In February. At -20C.

Changing out the cable in your driveway is a LOT more convenient. Change 
it now and keep the original as a spare, that way you will have a spare 
that you KNOW fits the van.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
