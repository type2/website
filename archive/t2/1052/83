Any cable will stretch some, but is it stretching to the point of 
breaking, or stretching to the point that you don't have any more 
adjustment room on the end of the thread?

If it's the former, where is it breaking?  If it's the latter, I'd 
recommend getting a new bowden tube and then putting a few shim washers 
in to increase the bend in the tube (unless you already have excessive 
bend).  I'd also check that the tranny-side bowden tube mount is good 
and not cracked or flexing when pressing the clutch pedal (have someone 
press it while you watch underneath.
