Subject: Steering wheel question

Hi, folks -

The steering wheel in my 72 Riviera is currently sitting about 30 degrees
right of center, despite a fairly recent front end alignment.  The car
drives straight, does not pull to one side or the other.  Is this something
that can be remedied by simply pulling the steering wheel off and re-setting
it to center?

Cheers,
Iain McLennon
