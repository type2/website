I had a rattle that was driving me apesh*t for a while, too. I have a '79
Cali emissions model.
What I eventually found was the left (FIF) exhaust manifold was cracked
completely around the pipe between the two exhaust ports.
It was invisible because it was hidden under the heat shield material. I
finally determined that the rattle was in the exhaust by plugging the
exhaust pipe with my foot while the engine was running. Pulled the exhaust
system, and sure enough by grabbing both ends of the manifold I discovered
they were not actually connected. Pulled off the insulation and the whole
thing fell apart. Luckily, I had a spare and installed it, back on the road
the same day. Had the other one welded up for a spare.
