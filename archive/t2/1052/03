My engine races after a long run, then it settles down.

Where should I look for a possible vacuum leak?

Could be the vaccum at the dizzy?

Basically, how do I go about troubleshooting this one?

Cheers,

when mine was doing this, it was the breaker plate in the distributor.  It was
sticking sometime in the fully advanced position and i had to remove the
distributor and service/lube it to get it freed up.
