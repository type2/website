Subject: 72 Westy in Portland, OR

Up for sale is a 1972 Westy, which I purchased in 2007.  Just prior to my
ownership, she received an interior redecoration, with all new upholstery
and matching curtains, as well as a new coat of paint. All original camping
equipment is present and in good working condition, including ice-box, sink,
bed, upper and front cots and stool.  Mosquito netting for rear hatch and
front windows is included.  Keeping in mind that the original camping
equipment and is 36 years old, it is remarkably clean, though it does show
it9s age in spots (some small areas of peeling laminate).
Since she has been in my care I have invested a great deal of time and money
(>$6000) in mechanical repairs and upgrades (receipts included).  All of
these were done by a well-respected Portland air-cooled shop, and include:
- Complete engine rebuild with 2 liter block
- New 40mm Kadron dual carbs
- New electric fuel pump
- New (not rebuilt) Bosch SVDA distributor, curved for current engine set-up
by AJ Simms (3Mr. Kadron2) in Orange Country
-  New Comp-U-Fire electronic ignition
- New brake lines, pads and new left front caliper
- New VDO gauges installed (CHT, oil temp and voltmeter)
- New muffler and exhaust
- New Hankook 185R14 8 -ply tires (these exceed requirements for this
vehicle)
- Replaced heater box
- Replaced fuel lines
- New dipstick boot
- Paint touch-ups
This is an extremely clean, straight and solid bus.  It has been my daily
driver for the past year and is as reliable as can be. Please let me know if
you have any specific questions.  I have many receipts from the past year
and receipts from previous owners dating back ~ 10 years.  With a bit of
interior restoration and some love, this could easily be a show vehicle
(though I prefer to camp in it!).
