Subject: RE: [T2] Curtain rings for 71 Westy sliding door

I just redid my curtains in my 71 Westy and actually used some #4 stainless
screws with washers and nuts.  The head of the screws was just big enough to
slide in the track but not come out.  I put the screws in this type of
arrangement...

Screw head - washer - curtain - washer - nut.

It has worked pretty good.  If you want pictures, let me know and I will take
some tonight.
