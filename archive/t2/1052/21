Subject: RE: [T2] Wiper Switch

The 3 terminals that are disconnected are the horizontally oriented one at
the
top center, the top left side terminal and the "6th" terminal mentioned in
#4
above.

The three wires that are disconnected are: Black, Black/Violet?, Brown (the
Black and Yellow from the wiper motor is connected to the switch already).
