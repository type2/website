Subject: Curtain rings for 71 Westy sliding door

Does anyone have a source for this type of curtain "ring" 
<http://bellsouthpwp.net/u/s/ustroedler/Westphalia/curtainrings.jpg>?  
The metal strip over the door contains a single channel in which the 
flat part of the ring is inserted.

I've not been able to see anything similar at the usual vendor's web 
sites. I think that you can see it is sewn directly onto the material 
and does not use the normal German "curtain tape" nor their standard 
Rollring.
