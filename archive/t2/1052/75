Subject: Replace Dogleg Instructions and Pics

OK here it is.  I'm going to attempt my first Dogleg replacements on my SC.
It is a 1960 and I plan to do both sides.  I was wondering if anyone had pics,
pointers, instructions or warnings about replacing the Doglegs.  I was also
wondering where the spot welds are located so I can drill them out.  Pics
would be great...
any help would be great.
