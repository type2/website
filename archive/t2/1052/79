Subject: Cool air fans

Does anyone know how I can get a pair of cool air fans for my double cab?
They are 2 electric fans that fit in the vent cowling.  Does anybody even make
them or are they going to be to hard to acquire?  I remember seeing them in
Ratwell's site and I believe they were not available in the states.  Any help
would be appreciated.
