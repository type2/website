Mike asked:

OK here it is. I'm going to attempt my first Dogleg replacements on my SC.It
is a 1960 and I plan to do both sides. I was wondering if anyone had
pics,pointers, instructions or warnings about replacing the Doglegs. I was
alsowondering where the spot welds are located so I can drill them out.
Picswould be great...any help would be great.Mike Q
