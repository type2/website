Subject: Re: [T2] First time engine puller needs help in Fullerton, CA

Hey William, I would be happy to provide my assistance to your project. I 
live in Fullerton as well so it's just a matter of you letting me know when 
you want to get together and we can figure out what you need to get started.  
I currently have a 1970 westy poptop that I'm working on. 
  Are you sure that you have a type 1 engine in that 72 ? It should be a type 
4 in there. Does it have the proper sheetmetal to seal up the engine 
compartment? Please P-mail me for my phone # if you;re interested , thanks!
