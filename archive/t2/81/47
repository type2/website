 Hi
I was in a similar situation and decided a couple of years ago to rebuild my 
type 1 engine..first time. Been runnnig well since with good oil pressure and 
MPG for a bus so anyway, after I'd done the rebuild I wrote up an account of 
the experience and hope it will help others revive their engines !! It took 
me a winter to do the rebuild and I took all the advise I could, the only 
problem I encounted was with oil leakage from the crankshaft seal 
.....anyway, here is the site..hope it is useful. I also agree that Wilson's 
book is a must if you want a step by step account :

More recently I have included a fuel tank renovation and brake pipe 
replacement (just finished) ..can't recommend the later in an English winter 
outside though !!
cheers
