Subject: Using roller board for engine removal/install

The posts on the engine dolly leads me to comment:

Working alone with my 71 engine, I'd use 2 scissor jacks on a ply board
spanning the heaterboxes that sat on 2-3 broomsticks- rolled it right in
by adding a broomstick at the front as one rolled out the rear.  The
rear of the bus was lifted around 4" and the trans was dropped so it was
PARALLEL to the board holding the engine. This makes for easy access to
the upper mounting nuts behind the air housing and allows much easier
alignment as you turn both scissor jack handles at the same time to lift
the engine.  The advantage of the board was that I needed only a small
sledge to beat on edges of the board to align the engine studs with the
bell housing holes, all while lying underneath.  As I recall, I had
screwed down edgings around the scissor jacks on the board so they could
not shift while the board was being tapped.  The T4 engine is too heavy
for scissor jacks and I got a real garage rolling jack now!
