Subject: Holidays in Britain

Hi Guys,
It's been a while since I've taken part in any threads
on this list.
I'm on holiday in Britain at the moment and I know
what you're going to say......"It's the wrong time of
year!"
Unfortunately you either spend Christmas and New Year
with your relatives or you go at the time when all the
VW shows are on.
Fortunately I was able to meet up with 2 fellow bus
afficianados, Glynn Seabridge and Howard Dickens, who
both live in Wales and they gave this sadly VW
deprived boy a day of innocent fun.
Glynn has owned buses for years, split screen campers
for choice, but his last one was written off last year
when a stupid driver lost it on a blind corner and
slammed into the bus.
What he does own, however, is a right hand drive Type
181 known as a Trekker rather than a Thing.
Not only did Glynn take Howard and I out in the
Trekker with the top down on a day that was very wet
to begin with, but he also let both of us drive it, a
HUGE priveledge considering the VERY tight insurance
rules here in Britain.
Howard also took us out for a run in his 1970 Devon
Camper and we all had a blast playing VW's :-)
I hope that anyone that goes a long way from home can
have the same marvellous welcome and generosity as
I've experienced here in Britain.
Here's some pics if you'd like a look.
