Subject: I need, I need, I need, I need,  I need...

OK, my therapist (actually my wife, who is an actual therapist) says that I need to express my needs more clearly, so here goes:  I NEED SOME MATERIAL TO MAKE A DIAPHRAGM FOR THE FUEL REGULATOR ON MY EARLY BN4 GAS HEATER.  I got everything working and made a diaphram out of material from an old pair of rubber fishing waders, it actually worked!! (for about 10 minutes) and then the diphram got all stretched and warped.  Anybody got any of this material laying around that they would sell a brother or trade for some parts  OR does anyone have a line on a supplier where I can get some of this stuff.  I think its Ron Vanness has a great procedure for making these diaphrams in the library, but I can't find the right kind of material.  HELP!!! I really want heat in my 71 Westy.
