WOW John!,
When your message came out, it was in one long line.
I read it and missed the part "for the fuel regulator on my early bn4 gas heater" and read it as

"OK, my therapist (actually my wife, who is an actual therapist) says
that I need to express my needs more clearly, so here goes:
I NEED SOME MATERIAL TO MAKE A DIAPHRAGM"

I at first thought you were taking personal contraceptive rights to a new plateau.  Especially with the subject line of "I need, I need, I need...."

Now I don't know who needs the shrinking more, you or me.

For the rest of you, read the passage below and in your mind edit out the 10 words listed above.  I especially liked the part about making a new diaphram out of old fishing waders and it lasting for 10 minutes.  Way to go John!

Thanks for the laugh,
Scott

I got everything working and made a diaphram out of material from an old pair of rubber fishing waders, it actually worked!! (for about 10 minutes) and then the diphram got all stretched and warped.  Anybody got any of this material laying around that they would sell a brother or trade for some parts  OR does anyone have a line on a supplier where I can get some of this stuff.  I think its Ron Vanness has a great procedure for making these diaphrams in the library, but I can't find the right kind of material.  HELP!!! I really want heat in my 71 Westy.
