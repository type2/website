Just a quick clarification; Retarded timing does NOT result in a cooler
running engine (it makes it hotter). Combustion speed increases with engine
temperature, so retarded timing results "in the same timing the cylinder
sees" on a hot engine. Close, but very different. This is why VW retarded #3
on in-shroud cooler engines, not to cool #3, but to keep it from detonating
(it has a faster ignition speed because of the higher temps).
