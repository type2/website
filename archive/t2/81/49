Subject: To repair, or replace?

Hello fellow bus fans! Thanks again for all the help you guys offered when I 
was having tranny problems! Unfortunately though, I am faced again with more 
problems! About 2 months after re-doing the transmission on my 71 bus, I 
noticed a slight chugging noise while driving, my engine (1600 single carb) 
has also taken to burning oil, now needing a quart or 2 every couple weeks. 
I tried doing some (crude) timing adjustments, replacing the spark plugs, 
and other things but it keeps worsening. The chugging noise  is much louder 
and is causing the engine to sound quite similar to a lawnmower! I tried 
idling the engine, and pulling plugs one at a time on the distributor and 
the chugging *did* cease when I pulled the wire for the back left cylinder, 
but it is getting plenty of power so I know it's not electrical. I've been 
trying to solve this problem for about a month now but without knowing 
anybody of significantly greater engine knowledge I have had little insight 
on how to fix this. Some of my vw friends (unfortunately with as much or 
even less engine knowledge as me) think the engine is shot, and if so I am 
prepared to buy another one, but I would much rather, if possible, save the 
life of the one I have now. Any ideas?
