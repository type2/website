No worries. I've solved my problem. Read on.

You read too much into my prose. It's always something different. In fact, I
haven't burned up any valves yet (read on). I rebuilt once because it was the
first time and the engine was worn out all over. rebuilt again when my
crankshaft broke. rebuilt again when the plug for the exhaust port exhaust pump
hole on the weird old rebuilt head I was using blew out and made ungodly racket.
Rebuilt again when a ring stuck and munged up a cylinder. Pulled engine again to
deal with oil leak from bent flange on an oil pump.

Good idea. I've added these one at a time over the past few rebuilds. have all 3
in place for 3 years now.

They all indicate that I'm running cool and generally OK. head temp spiked once
briefly when that ring stuck.

Let me get this straight. I would get less HP with 2.0L heads than with the
1800s? That's a trip. Maybe I should be staying with 1800 heads then.

OK, here's the punch line. After checking out everything, doing a thorough
tuneup, compression tests up the wazoo all coming back 110psi+ and not hearing
the valve clatter for several days, I began to suspect my automatic tranny or
torque converter to be failing. I drained the ATF, inspected the tranny pan to
find nothing but very tiny, fine normal sludge. Refilled with fresh ATF and-
PROBLEM GONE! Runs like a top. So go figure. My heads are fine. My engine is
fine. It was my neglectful maintenance schedule on the ATF that got me. So I'm
back in the fast lane again. Yay!

Thanks for your helpful advice, Steve and everyone else who shared.
