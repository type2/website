Recycled halon systems are still available from Kidde Aerospace, who builds
airliner fire suppression systems. They are outrageously expensive--a fire
detector for $3000, valves for $5000, the manifold for over $30,000. (Which
are just some prices I can remember...they don't sell entire systems through
the catalog I saw because the people who are buying this stuff get the
system with the airplane.)

"Hey guys! I spent $2000 for a Bus then put a $60,000 fire extinguisher in
it!" is a sure one-way ticket to the asylum.
