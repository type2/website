Liquid propane gas,, LPG is what is in the tank / cylinder, and it "boils" at
minus 44 deg F when it is released from the pressure of the tank, past the
regulator, it boils and turns to a vapour, just like water does when it is
boiled,, turns to steam

So,, you have to have a pretty darn cold day to have a low flow situation,as the
apparent temp reaches the minus 44 deg F point the flow will slow down and stop,
the common cure to this is to pour water on the tank,, regulator or what ever is
frozen,,, COLD water is a lot warmer than minus 44 deg F ,,, so no need for HOT
water.

I have only experienced Lpg vapourizer freeze up on vehicles like forklifts ,,
so lifting the seat, and pouring water on the propane carb and vapourizer isn't
a big deal, other that the ice rink it leaves behind!
the fork lift vapourizer is supposed to pass engine liquid coolant past the Lpg
and "warm" it ,, but if the engine coolant level gets low, the Lpg will only be
warmed by ambient air,, thus being to cold and slow to flow,, and it will ice up
and plug the lines.

So,, If you get something that is MINUS 44 degrees F on your skin,, it will BURN
you very fast!  BTDT.

For you scientific folks,, propane can be released from a BBQ tank by turning it
upside down, and opening the valve,, when I  held a styrofoam cup under the
drops using welding gloves,, it collected like water coming out of a tap , in
the cup.  When I put My bare finger in the cup,,the liquid boils and emits a bit
of a fog like dry ice,, it also burned the tip of my finger like frostbite! 
When I put a Q tip in the liquid,, it gets the tip very cold,, and I applied it
to a wart, which froze and fell off!  Dr's do this much colder and safer,, they
use liquid nitrogen,, which isn't flammable! 
It is also nifty to spill some liquid in a cold frying pan,, just a small drop
.. it will dance around just like putting water on a hot wood stove top! 

Don't do it at home folks ,, it leaves lasting scars on your skin just like a
fire will!
