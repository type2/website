They are indeed 8mm.  Not sure of the exact length but it's somewhere in 
the neighborhood of 1".  Those threads stripping is a common problem - 
therefore the result of underengineering (lot of stress, magnesium 
threads).  Helicoil is probably the best bet to fix it, although tapping it 
out to a larger size would work too if you drill out the holes in the 
bracket.  Be careful tapping it - don't drill/tap in too far.  The boss can 
also break off if abused (I've seen two trannies so afflicted).
