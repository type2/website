>Someone e-mailed me a warning on the Cooper
tires lawsuit so be careful on them:

Being sued doesn't mean anything.  How many
zillions of times was VW sued after Nader
declared them all unsafe?  Being sued means some
plaintiff attorney paid enough to get a college
professor "expert" somewhere to say his stats
suggest they are unsafe, nothing more.  Money
talks.  EVERY SINGLE TIRE MANUFACTURER, AUTO
MANUFACTUER, AND PRODUCER OF CUSTOM VAN PARTS
currently has many suits against them.

>If you are in the market for 14" rims ... check
out the Cooper tires. 

Including there value leader brand Mastercraft. 
I've run D-rated Mastercraft Courser R/D 195R14's
on my bus and my vanagon.  C-rated 185's are
available.  The price was great!

First economy tires I ever bought.  I was in the
mood for another set of Michelins but couldn't
stomach the Agilis prices and didn't like there
crummy highway rib tread to boot.  Maybe if you
camp only on paved pads at KOA they'd be all
right.  Probably would have purchassed Hakka all
seasons but that closest supplier was 6 hours
away.  

These Mastercrafts are great for getting rid of
that boat-like side-to-side squishiness that
P-rated tires give a bus.  Also very tough
against rock gouges when off road.  30,000 miles
and they still look new.  

Buy what brand you want, but make it a load-rated
truck tire folks because reinforced passenger
tires are a thing of the past.
