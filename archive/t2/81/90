Subject: Clutch cable replacement help

Replaced the clutch cable in anticipation of new clutch and complete
engine rebuild. Found the Flexible guide tube (Bordon tube) was worn
out. See Bently page52 figure 15-16. Proceeded to replace it and found
the 2 bolts that hold the bracket that holds this tube had stripped the
holes in the trans or they were simply the wrong size??? Can't see in
the bolt holes to inspect the threads. The bolts that came out of these
holes have 8mm threads. Is this correct? Thinking about Helicoil. Does
anyone know for sure what size and how long these bolts should be?
Thanks,
Tom
The Turtlebus is about to live again!!!
