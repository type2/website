Subject: Re: [T2] push rod tubes



although, i might add to this topic, that if you are not eager to pull the 
heads back off, or if someone already cut the old tubes, several of the 
aftermarket vw companies have the collapsable pushrod tubes. i have not used 
these, as t4 slide thru, but they seem like they might be good for pushrod 
tube only problems. on the other hand, they always seem to me like they 
might leak oil though... anyone have experience with this?
