Subject: Re: [T2] heating project? (using propane)

Hi Roger- I'd get a low oxygen sensor; propane burns clean-Only water
and CO2 is released. (especially cataytic), so no CO worries unless you
are burning an orange flame.  I use a stove that has the burner on top
of the squat tank; it stands on the floor for cooking.
The separate tanks stay warm enough to work fine if kept in the bus with
you.  I wonder if your regulator works right; shouldn't it accomodate
pressure changes due to cold gas?
