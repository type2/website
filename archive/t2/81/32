Subject: RE: [T2] Engine dolly plan is now available as a .pdf file

Does anybody have an actual picture of this dolly they can post with the
.pdf's? I think I am going to make one, but would like to see an actual
picture of one from different angles. I think it would help a lot when
building this so that I do not miss anything. 

Thanks,
Corbett
