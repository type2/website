Subject: Rocky Mountain lifetime warranty

Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone has had experience with
Rocky Mountains lifetime warranty claim.  As I have
posted these last few days, my drivers side heater box
has gone South.  Both the flanges are broken off and
this is why I was sounding like the "African Queen".
I bought the Dansk units in the fall of 99' and have
all the paper work from the sale still, so hopefully
:-)

Last night I took it down and bolted up a loaner and a
new Ernst muffler, sounds much better (hopefully will
smell much better soon too... PEW, new muffler
burnin..)

Thanks for all the words of encouragement!
