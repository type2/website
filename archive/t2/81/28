Subject: flywheel install-where does the 'o'ring go

Any help welcome on this one-type 1 engine 1600 DP -where does the large
'o'-ring go that is supplied in the gasket kit.The only place it seems to
fit is over the end of the crank and if you put the flywheel on it only just
goes on the dowels and therefore would be crushed when the galnd nut is
tightened-is this right? Also wher can i get the large spring washer from
that goes under the gland nut.BTW there is also a paper/cardboard gasket
that goes? on the dowels do i need this as I remember reading that it's not
necessary and it isn't refered to (or illustrated) in the Bentley manual
TIA-Martin(England) '71 bus '69 bug.
