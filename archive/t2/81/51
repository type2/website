Subject: MA and NH listees FYI

Hello NH and MA listees I just visited JACK's used auto parts in
Billerica and there are 2 2 liter engines sitting in the back of a 77
bus.  Jacks is very cheap especially now in the cold months so if anyone
needs or wants a 2 liter these are freshly pulled, one is out of an 80s
bus that i almost pulled myself but looks like the staff there pulled
both engines so they could stack the buses
also there is a 74 beetle that is very much salvageable needs engine and
trans but looks very good for a new england car. pmail me if you need
any details or if you save the bug, wish i could but i have no place to
put it and no money.
