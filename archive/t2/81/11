Aha!

This just reminded me...my Dad pulls the plugs in his Ch**y S10 and cleans
them.  A week or so later he complains to me that it is not running right.

We spend 3 weeks and $140 at the local "shade tree" to make it run
right...still no good.  Misses weirdly at certain speeds and temperatures.

Finally we sit down with a couple of brewski's and spend 30 minutes
analyzing the situation.  I finally decide that we have checked everything
possible and go buy him new plugs....mention the weirdness to the counter
man who laughs and asks if my Dad is a WD40 fan(he absolutely is!)...

Turns out that wd40 "poisons" the ceramic in the plugs so that it conducts
at certain temperatures.

New plugs....end of story...yes, he did clean his plugs and then sprayed
them with wd40 before he put them back in....

Bob,  did you have wd40 nearby when installing new plugs???<grin>


Cheers, dave
