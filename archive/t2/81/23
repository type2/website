Sounds like you are missing one of the O rings for the spark plug.  Check my
web site and click on the spark plug and see the picture.  Also, there is a
proper gap and alignment for the ground, you can set the ground with the
tool shown on the web site and the gap also which should be .080.  That's a
good place for the heater, it will circulate the air inside the bus heating
it up much faster.  Be sure to check all fuel lines and have new ones made
locally if they look cracked.  Use only the pressure lines with pressed on
fittings.  NEVER use hose clamps.
