John,

I don't know what the interaction may have been, only, like lots of other
stuff on the list, what the solution "seemed" to be.

We put the new plugs in and that was the end of the problem...my Dad drove
the truck with the new plugs in it for probably another 25,000 miles
before he traded it in on a new one....never did have the problem again.

as always<grin> you mileage may vary, dave
