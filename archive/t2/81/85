Yes, I can read.  Pretty decent at it, especially
for a hillbilly.  Can even cipher a bit, but I'm
better with my shoes and socks off.  

Now search yahoo for Michelin Tire Litigation.
Read about settlements or "experts" bragging
about there testimony in cases that ended in
secret settlements.   You'll get about 400 hits. 
Insert any tire brand you want.  You'll get
hundreds.  

Buy what you want.  But get tires rated for the
proper load.
