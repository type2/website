A little play is normal, at least it has existed in every bus tranny I've seen.

I think you will find that a new plate won't have much more than 1/8" above 
the rivets.  Sounds like yours is fairly new.

You will get different opinions on that.  I'm not "into" throwing away 
perfectly good parts so I always re-use these parts if they are in the 
condition you describe (smooth but not glazed, burned or cracked).   They 
are KNOWN GOOD parts and will have a long service life left if treated 
properly.  In the past I've bought and installed rebuilt clutch parts that 
had problems right out of the box.  If you must replace, go with new OE 
parts and take comfort in the fact that you blew a lot of money so you 
won't have to pull the engine again for a while, or maybe you will.  But 
maybe you improved your odds a little.  Maybe.
