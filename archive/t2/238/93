For what ever it is worth, I have one sitting in my garage.  I 
installed  it and never broke it in before the bus body died.  
I plan it install it  in my new bus when the current engine goes. 

I have heard rumblings that they might have issues but never got any real 
information about it.  Seems everyone has had a problem with somebody.  
Like I said never got any proof or realy data that they were bad.
 
I am in Chicago so they were real close.  I have bought many parts there 
and even installed some of them.  I am getting ready to rebuild my front 
end with parts I got there.

Everyone I have talked to there has been helpful and patient.
 
I hope this helps.
