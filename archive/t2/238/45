Look under the dashboard and remove the white nylon plug that holds the lever onto the mechanism then the levers pull straight. 
But while you've got your head there to see what you are doing then you might as well change the bulbs without removing the dash. 
I found the clips that the 4 screws in dash corners go into are a real $*(-at-)!! to get back in place - disconnect you battery while putting them back otherwise they may fall onto the light switch and cause a short circuit. 

Good luck
