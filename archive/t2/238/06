----------ever compare the ghia to the audi t4? coincidence? i think
not... lol, just kidding. i think it looks as much like the ghia as the
new beetle looks like the original beetle.

--------excellent point... i think their age DOES have something to do
with their character, and it is sad to think of a day when no one can
tell younger people what it was like to own a brand new splitty, bay
window or even vanagon... *tear*

--------unfortunately, i dont believe ANY car made today will be around
in 40 years. i hate to say it, but "they just dont make 'em like they
used to!!!"
