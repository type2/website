Subject: places to stow stuff

While going through the interior of my 'new' 79 Westy
a couple weeks ago, I happily discovered the original
child's cot and poles cozily stowed in a little notch
in the footlocker under the rear seat/bed.  

It looks like it was designed to be stowed there.  Or
is it?  In my '69 Westy, the child's cot is stowed (I
believe) in the long flat area on top of the coat
closet.

I can't figure out, however, where the big L-shaped
table leg (in the '79) goes when not in use. 
Westfaliawerks designed the table to be strapped down
in the rear cargo area, so I assume there must be a
logical place somewhere for the table leg, right? 
Maybe it goes where I found the cot and the cot goes,
once again, above the closet?

I'm being anal retentive here, I know.  But that table
leg can be quite a projectile when not secured
somewhere, and I haven't found an ideal spot.
