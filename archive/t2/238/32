Subject: RE: [T2]  New Microbus ( S A V W )



I had a good long think about the wave a while back.  When I rode a
motorcycle, I got the wave from other bikers, and I get the wave/nod/pull
over and help from other bussers. But on the whole I dont wave to or even
notice the thousands of passat owners, or jetta folks, or the golfers.

It seems to come down to a shared experience, being part of something that
sets you apart.  Motorcycles people nod to each other because they are in
the same hyper-dangerous place you are (the road), with the same worries
(drunk old ladies - hey, I live in Florida).  Motorcycles are alone on the
road together.  Tends to bring you closer- you know you have something in
common with that guy because you both face imminent death every 10 minutes.

Old buses are the same way - someone with a bus probably has stories to tell
and some grease under their nails (figurtively, although you never know).
We all struggle with impossible to find parts, a FLAPS infrastructure that
doesn;t care about us, and a pervasive climate (new/disposable) that runs
counter to our love for our cars. We are a minority, and that is why we
wave- we recognize fellow brothers and sisters in arms. Solidarity.  Your
not alone out there.

New beetles are cool, they got style- but until they start breakiung down in
15 years and you start a list just so you can have a FI debugging think
tank, then they probably wont get waves.
