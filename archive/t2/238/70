Hi Phil,

You are right in your assumption that this is not the correct engine for
your bus.
However the EA engine is still a 1700cc (1679cc) engine but it was meant to
be built in a Type 4 Volkswagen during 08/'70>07/'74.
The EA engine was also put in the Volkswagen Porsche 914 during
08/'72>07/'73.

The right engine that should have been in your bus is either a CA CB CD or
CE engine. These were all 1679cc engines meant for the Type 2.
The CA and CB engines were both 49Kw/66Hp engines and used during
08/'71>07/'74.
The CD and CE engines were both 46Kw/62Hp engines and used during
08/'72>07/'74.

My 1972 bus that was produced in april 1972 was fitted with a CA engine for
the Swedish market.
