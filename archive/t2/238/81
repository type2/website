Here in West Los Angeles, I can't believe all the buses I see everyday - 
and I'm pretty sure in the last ten years only one person has ever waved 
back at me.  
Also, in the two or so years I've been wandering around town putting 
those type 2 flyers on people's buses windshields wherever they may be 
(along with a nice handwritten note from me saying something like, "Hey, 
nice bus.  I live down the way.  Check out type2.com.  Call me and we 
can have a great time talking about and fixing up our buses") - anyway, 
in all the time I've been giving bus people flyers, NO ONE has ever come 
by the house or called.  Not one.  The other day I waited with my 
daughter outside the market next to a really nice 68-71 sunroof bus - 
the sunroof was caulked shut and I wanted to tell the owner about how 
I'd seen some talk on the list about how easy it is to fix a leaky 
sunroof.  When the guy comes out, he looks like I'm asking for money and 
drives away fast.  Whatever, my friend, just trying to help...

I'd kill to have a bus owner down the road who'd like to poke around 
each others' buses!  It's really depressing, and just about the exact 
opposite of this helpful, friendly list.  Go figure.
