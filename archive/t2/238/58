Subject: Side window swap

I have a 68 Westy, what is the problem (other than keeping it stock) 
with replacing the rear side passenger window with a 70 window. 
Reason is to have a vent wing for my kids in the back seat. I have 
access to lots of junk yard busses with these window. Any 
suggestions as to where to buy seal?
