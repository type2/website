Subject: occasional smokey start

Hello everyone,

My '71 bus with stock exhaust occasionally spits out a cloud of smoke when
started.  It has never happened while starting hot.  It's fairly
embarrassing (especially after I smoked out that lady walking by one
afternoon) and I'd like to take care of it.  Does anyone have any ideas to
the cause of this and what I could do to fix it?

Thanks,
Brian
