RE: Wave<<This is the same phenomna with the new VW crowd--no loyalty--wh=

This is the sort of thinking that grinds my gears...As a guy who has owne=

I think that VW owners, while loyal, are sometimes not as friendly as we =
think we are. How many times has anyone gone to a Bug Show only to see ot=

I can only imagine what reaction they get from the air cooled car group. =20
I love VW's. I think that by and far they are the best engineered cars ev=

 same kind of fan appreciation that they did the last 50 years, the owner=

Maybe modern owners don't appreciate the History of the company, so they =
don't wave. Or maybe the modern owner does not wave because none of the '=
