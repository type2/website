Ah-hah!

Now I think we can help you find the right vacuums for the ports on your
Dizzy can.  Having a '79 you probably have F/I or duel carbs and I
haven't played with this set up yet.  I copied the list again (my first
reply was off list) so maybe someone else can chime in.  I've only delt
with duel vacuum on Type 1 engines.

You need two types of sources.  

1. The vacuum is off at idle and comes on right after you open the
throttle.  This source will go to the advance side of the vacuum can
(the side away from the dizzy cap and probably smaller in size).

2. The vacuum is on only at idle and goes away as soon as the throttle
opens.  This source will go to the retard side which is the side closest
to the dizzy cap.

My (limited) understanding is that the retard was added to heat the
heads up at idle to cause a cleaner burn.  Idle seems to be less
efficient.  As I said my understanding is limited so take that with the
proper grain of salt.

Anyway, Once you get the vacuum sources sorted out and hooked up, you
should be able to set timing correctly.  Hopefully someone else can tell
you where to hook what.

Good luck!
