So I guess we have to ask what poeple wave for?  Why are we waving?

I certainly don't wave because of brand loyalty, or what substance transfers
heat from a crankcase.  I wave at other buses, get a funny feeling driving
behind other busses caravan style - because of the type of people I assume
are driving the other bus.

Stereotyping is dangerous, I know, but its also natural and smart, and keeps
me from walking into a biker bar and asking about the latest tennis match.
Who drives old buses?  Someone who drives them for the same reasons I do,
whatever that is.  They appreciate the concessions made for maintainability.
The philosophy behind an engine you can pull in 15 minutes.  Understandable
FI.  A culture of friendlyness.

I personally think people want to buy a retro car also want the world be
become some weird retro Mayberry- Barney and Andy on the corner, smiling and
waving as they go buy, with their silk flowers in their blumvasen because
they dont have tiome to get fresh ones.

And oddly enough, we have this weird utopia amoungst ourselves.  Everytime
I've been stuck on the side of the rtoad, another bus I'd never seen had
stopped within 10 minutes.  They would help me push, and I'd never see them
again - a guy once helped me yank a tire, drove me a a tire shop, and drove
me back.  I've done this for other buses.

Sterotyping again.  Bus Folk  aren't going to kill you, rob you, shoot you.
That bus family.  A.I.R.S.  That poor girl Nicki with the bad luck.  We feel
we know each other, even if we dont.  I don't know new beetle people.  I
could become a new beetle person myself with some good financing.  No
mechanic illusions, no lofty philosphy.  Good financing.

I don't feel the need to wave at folks with good financing.

However, those poor 412 folks need all the love they can get.  We shouldn't
just wave, we should get out and hug them.

  RE: Wave<<This is the same phenomna with the new VW crowd--no loyalty--who
  cares--I'm getting to where I have got to go , and that's it.
  No Marque recognition---just plain old transportation-->>>

  This is the sort of thinking that grinds my gears...As a guy who has owned
a 1968 Beetle, a 1964 Beetle, a 1975 Bus, a 1975 Rabbit along with two 1980
Rabbits, a 1973 Super Beetle, a 1973 Squareback, a 1971 Beetle, a 1973 Ghia,
a 1978 Bus and now a 2002 Beetle, all I can say is that the most 'waves' I
ever got was while driving either of my Buses. All those Beetles, and I can
honestly say I got more waves when I drove my 1990 Jeep.

  I think that VW owners, while loyal, are sometimes not as friendly as we
think we are. How many times has anyone gone to a Bug Show only to see
others (or worse, they have done this) looked down their noses at anyone
with a water cooled VW? And with the new Beetle showing up at these shows, I
can only imagine what reaction they get from the air cooled car group.

  I love VW's. I think that by and far they are the best engineered cars
ever. However, if they are going to continue into the 21st century with the
same kind of fan appreciation that they did the last 50 years, the owners
today need to embrace the new Beetles, the new (soon) Micro Bus (even with
my misgivings) and the Water Cooled group (you know, the Jettas et all)...

  Maybe modern owners don't appreciate the History of the company, so they
don't wave. Or maybe the modern owner does not wave because none of the 'old
guard' don't offer a wave first.

  TJ, who waves while driving his Bus or Beetle. Call him Hopeless if you
wish.
