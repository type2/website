Subject: Re: [T2] Generator Swap 30 AMP for 38 AMP

I always use a 30 amp generator in a bus. But remember to also 
use a 30 amp regulator, or it will burn out. Never had an 
amperage problem even on long night trips, and the 30 amp 
stuff is easy to find since the bugs use them.

When you think about it, what extra electrical draw is
there in a bus that isn't there in a bug?

Hello all,

My question is, I have a working 30 AMP generator and
voltage regulator on my 71 KG that I could swap out if
needed.  From the archives, I would have to use the KG
generator pulley, would anything suffer from the
decreased amperage??

Daylight driving only, stock radio, etc...
