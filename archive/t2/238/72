My bus has lots of plastic parts that are deteriorating or completely 
gone.  Where did you find an all-metal bus?

Hmmm, I'm not going to get into a public pissing match over old vs. new 
cars.  I am mature enough to realize that they both have their strengths 
and weaknesses.  I would however be happy to explain some of the strengths 
of newer cars offline to those who think their 30-year-old VW is the best 
vehicle that ever was, period.
