Subject: Hot Start Relay Question

I have installed a hot start relay as per the type2 library on my 1977 bus.
I have now tried 3 different relays and several different pieces of wire.
The problem is that with the relay I get a fast clicking which will start
the engine. If I run a wire directly to the battery from the starter it
sounds normal. That wire is about a 16 gauge. The relay wires are about 12
gauge with a 25amp fuse. Is my starter getting too much juice? Am I going to
fry it? Is the clicking just the starter turning very fast? It starts
quickly but I am worried that I will be ruining the flywheel or something
more expensive. Any advice is appreciated.
