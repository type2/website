Well, I am here, Paul! My husband and I both love the buses! We are in
Inglewood, near LAX.
I cannot say that I see a ton of buses, although I just retired and I don't
get out as much anymore. But LA is not such a friendly place, really, and
buses are still common enough that no one thinks it is a really big deal
when you see one.
I had a '69, too... almost got another, but ended up getting another '71..
Now I've got three '71's, and one I'm going to convert to a Westy this
coming year. I don't think I'll have time until next year. We'll see.  Jan B

I'd kill to have a bus owner down the road who'd like to poke around each
others' buses!  It's really depressing, and just about the exact opposite of
this helpful, friendly list.  Go figure.
