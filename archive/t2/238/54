Subject: Re: [T2] REAR LIGHTS

Take the turn signal assemby off and clean the contacts with Q-tips soaked
in rubbing alcohol.. You would be surprised how dirty these can get and it
can cause strange, intermittent problems. Manually operate the switch and
you will see where these contacts are. Then see how it does. I would do this
before I started tearing into any wiring. Also, check your taillight grounds
and your chassis/transmission ground. Jan B

At present my 72 van has no rear lights working.they were working last week
, at least most of them
but last night i was driving with no rear lights.freaky! the guy who had it
previously did some wacky wiring,
confusing my mind. somehow he rigged it up so the left signal is up on the
turn signal and right turn is up again?
kinda wacky.
