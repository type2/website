Subject: Exhaust Questions


While my engine's out, I'm disassembling my exhaust & heat exchanger stuff
to replace the rusty nuts and bolts...I assume metric nuts and bolts from
any hardware store can be used as replacements?  If the exhaust gaskets are
intact can they be re-used?  .  Also, is there any benefit to painting and
preserving exhaust parts & heat exchangers?

Thanks,
