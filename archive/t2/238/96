Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Degreaser


I use Castrol's Super Clean on EVERYthing exterior to my engine(s).  If you 
have access to a pressure washer that can accept additives, I would 
recommend this to try out.  If you're worried about the mess, use a 
spray-bottle full of water to mist the cleaned area, and wipe it dry.

I want to brush it off, then wipe dry.  I looked at
engine degreasers at FLAPS but they want me to hose it off.  Don't wanna do
it.

Thoughts please.
