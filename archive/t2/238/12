At idle, when you disconnect the vacuum hose on the nipple that points towards
the dist what happens?
Does the engine speed up?
Is there vacuum at that hose?
If no, follow it back and tell me where it goes. It should go to a nipple on
the REAR of the throttle housing. Rear is rear. The rear nipple is between #1
intake runner and the idle speed screw.
Does it go to a nipple on the FRONT of the throttle housing? If yes, that is
ported vacuum. It goes to the outer pointing nipple. Vacuum advance.

Vacuum retard is manifold vacuum and it goes to the inner nipple.
Manifold vacuum is vacuum at idle.
Vacuum advance is ported vacuum and it goes to the outer nipple.
Ported vacuum appears when you open the throttle.

Ported vacuum comes from the front of the throttle housing and goes to the vac
advance and tees to the EEC purge valve on the back of the air cleaner.
Manifold vacuum is in 2 places on a 79 Cal engine. One is the nipple on the
right side of the plenum between 1 and 2 runners. It feeds the decel valve and
tees off to the fuel pressure regulator. The other comes off the rear of the
throttle housing and only goes to vac retard.

I honesty believe you do not have any vacuum to the retard side. If you did
and set the timing at 5 after, and then disconnected the vacuum, the timing
would be at 7.5 before and it would run fine.
