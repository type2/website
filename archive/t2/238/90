Subject: Feedback Request on MoFoCo Type IV Engines

I posted the other day needing a reliable engine for my '77 
Westphalia with a blown cylinder.  Mofoco is in Milwaukee, about 5 
hours from me, and sell rebuilt  Type IV engines for about 1600$.  I 
could drive there and pick the thing up and save some $$$/hassles 
re:shipping.  But I don't want to buy a "pig in a poke".  Has anyone 
tried their engines?  I did try Jake Raby as per several suggestions 
but I don't think my van is worth the $3500 he needs as starters for 
an engine...I think if the kids and I had a breakdown out a thousand 
miles we'd junk the van and take a bus home, or limp back if we could.

Good price on longblocks from Bus Depot.  Any reactions based on 
experience regarding their engines?

Cordially,

Dan
