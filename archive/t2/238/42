I remember the bike and VW waves, late '50s to mid-late '60s, and the reason
for them. Sportscar owners too waved. It was an open road salute, an
acknowledgement that the other guy/gal is there, with whom you feel an
affinity, that you and they are not alone.

BTW when I bought and began restoring my bus about a year ago I thought my
two sons, 20 and 16, would be excited by the automotive project and even
more so by the end result. Not so. Today my younger son pleads to take our
beat-up '87 Taurus wagon so not to be seen in his dad's weird bus, although
it looks new. My wife has ridden in it only once, when I insisted.
