The problem I am having is the old bushing is on the shift rod down in the
guide pipe. I thought about disconnecting the "rear" shift rod from the
tranny, well since I have a 72 there is another joint on the rear shift rod,
this prevents disconnecting the rear shift rod and pulling it far enough
forward to take the bushing off.
