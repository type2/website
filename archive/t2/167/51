Subject: stripes

>I got a quote on my 78 Champagen edition this
weekend and am thinking seriously about doing
it....The only problem he has though, are the 3
stripes around the bottom of the  bus.  He says
that finding some that are as wide(about 2") as
what the stock ones are is going to be difficult.

Go to one of the small time guys who cuts stripes
and lettering for business vehicles.  It should
be cheap and easy.

Peace and blessings,
