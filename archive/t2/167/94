Subject: Shocking!

Does anybody have any insights as to how long KYB gas shocks are really good 
for?  I know they've got a lifetime warranty or some such foolishness, but how 
long will they provide really tight handling?

I put a set on my 73 Westy about 5 years/40k miles ago.  When I installed them, 
they felt great.  And for 2 or 3 years after, they felt great.  But lately, my 
bus seems to have become very "soft" again.  I checked each shock using the 
bounce-the-bus method and they all seem to be damping properly, but they sure 
do seem a lot softer than they used to.

I'm thinking about putting on a new set just to get that stiff solid feel 
again.  Any thoughts?

Thanks.
