Subject: Re: [T2] cheap oil temp guage?

Chris,  I was the one who first posted re using a digital meat
thermometer for oil temp.  I took apart the kind that has the sender rod
coming right out of the gauge, splicing in phone wiring.  The gauge is
quite small, showing oil temp all the time (buttyon battery lasts for
about a year).  The dipstick was extend with brass tubing from a hobby
shop epoxied over the original end; I had to extend the wiring down to
the tip for this.  You can check the cooking/kitchen dept. of a Walmart
or Target; most food markets have these now.  The kind with the bend
sender can be straightened, and it has a mini-mini  plug going to the
display unit.  It is easy the extend this; Radio Shack has mini-mini
plugs (male and female) so you coud make your own extension.  They make
one that signals an alarm at a preset temp, like 240 degr.
