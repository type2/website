Subject: Oil temperature measurement point

I took a 200-mile trip up to Atascadero (from LA) and decided to play
around a bit with my IR thermometer.  After climbing the Grapevine I
stopped at Gorman for breakfast and checked the sump temperature with the
IR gadget.  The results were rather interesting

(1600dp Mexican type 1 engine)

The sump temperature varied quite widely depending upon where I aimed the
themomometor.  Here are the temps:

Left Front quadrant:  175F
Rignt Front quadrant: 180F
Left Rear quadrant:   185F
Right Rear quadrant:  200F
Sump Plate            170F
Oil Gallery just behind the sender:  195F
Flat spot on case just below the sender:  200F

Interesting that the sump plate (where most folks put the sender) showed
up considerably cooler than the other locations.

Speculation:  the oil screen has a solid barrier between the drain plug
and the pickup tube, so oil directly above the sump plate is stagnant.
Since it isn't moving, it loses its heat through the sump plate and is
cooler than the main stream of oil.

More speculation:  the forward pressure valve (after the oil cooler)
releases oil from the cooler directly back to the sump.  This may be why
the forward left quadrant was cooler than the right rear quadrant.

The main oil gallery seemed to be just a bit cooler than the hottest part
of the sump, so the main oil flow seems to be over the right rear part of
the sump to the oil screen and thence to the pump and main gallery.

Seems as though the best location for the sender is in the main oil
gallery or in the right rear quadrant of the sump where a dipstick sender
would live.  The sump plate does not seem to be such a good place for a
sender.
