Volks,

All this talk of dizzys has given me ported vacuum envy.  I have a 78 westy
running the weber progressive.  Don't want to go back to FI.  Sounds like a
dual configuration is what I should be thinking about.  Advice?  Soon
running during the cold in the winter will be an issue (moving up near SLC
from Phoenix).  Are there air cleaner configurations for duals that can suck
prewarmed air?

TIA
