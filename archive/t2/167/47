Subject: Re: [T2] Still having problems with clutch install...



Sean,
     The only thing left is the pilot bearing.  If the transmission doesn't 
mate up with the pilot bearing, you will have these symptoms.  Having the 
car in gear, and turning a wheel while mating the engine and tranny seems to 
do the trick.
