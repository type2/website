All this talk about paint jobs.....

I got a quote on my 78 Champagen edition this weekend and am thinking 
seriously about doing it.  The quote is from a local guy who has painted 
about half the cars that are in the local club.

The only problem he has though, are the 3 stripes around the bottom of the 
bus.  He says that finding some that are as wide(about 2") as what the 
stock ones are is going to be difficult.

Any one else have/solved this problem?

Cheers, dave
