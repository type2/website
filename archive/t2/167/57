Subject: vacuum integrity of "biscuits"

With the insight gained from the recent thread on svda dizzys, I took 
my Mityvac to the garage today, applied 28 psi of vacuum to the 
advance and retard ports on four dual vacuum advance distributors, 
and measured the time it took for the gauge reading to decrease to 
zero.

The results varied quite a bit. For at least one unit, neither 
reading changed in 60 seconds.  This establishes a baseline for 
tightness.  At the other extreme was a unit that (1) would not 
sustain  more than 15 ps even initially, and (2) had this value 
decrease to zero within a few seconds.

Given this, my question is: Are the "biscuits" interchangeable among 
distributors such as AN, AJ , etc, that are almost stock for my '71 
1600 DP? Some of these dizzys suffer from problems such as wandering 
timing, caused I think by wobbly shaft. So I might want to couple the 
best dizzy with the best vacuum biscuit.

Seems to me that all that is required is that the stroke induced by 
the diaphram on the advance side be the same among all these.
