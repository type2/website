Clogged idle circuit.

The easy fix would 2 or 3 tanks treated with STP.

More likely would be the need to pull the carb down for a proper cleaning.

Seems like I used to just pull the idle jets on the right side of the carb 
and using my mouth I would check to see that they flow. A couple of squirts 
of carb cleaner would help.
