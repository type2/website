Subject: Re: [T2] Still having problems with clutch install...

Does the pressure plate have a ring on fingers in the center?
Does the transaxle have a tube that the throw-out bearing rides on?
It is hard to see what you have mis-matched.....
70 should have no tube, so it should have a ring on the pressure plate and a
flat-faced bearing.
If you have a tube, you should have no ring and a curved face bearing. This
bearing holder is longer to make up the distance for no ring on the plate.
The flat side of the disc goes towards the flywheel.
The side where the center hub is farther out from the friction material goes
to the plate side.
