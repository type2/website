Craig,

What I usually do is get a nice big washer (but not too big to not fit in =
the frame channel) and weld a nut to one side of it.  Once you've done =
that you need to drill out the hole where the bolt used to thread into the =
nut that used to be tacked to the inside of the frame so it's big enough =
to accept your new nut.  Now clean up the frame with a wire wheel, stick =
the nut/washer combo in the hole with the nut on top and weld it in.  It =
may seem crude, but I carry a motorcycle off the back of my '71 while =
pulling a trailer and have never had problems with it. =20

Cheers, Mark=20

'71 Westy w/2.0 (Frankenbus)=20
'72 911 T Targa
'79 Bradley GTII

Hi Folks,

Just got my bus back from the paint shop.  Looks real nice.  Went to
reinstall rear bumper and on the passenger side the "nuts" up inside the
"sorta" chassis are missing.  Is there anyway to get at these or put
another one in there?  What other alternatives are there?  My first
thought is a large self tapping bolt.

Craig
