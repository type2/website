Subject: VW Bob's Salvage Yard in PA

Hello All,

I'm heading along interstate 80 tomorrow in Pennsylvania and thought I 
tried to work in a stop to VW Bob's Salvage Yard. His banner used to be 
on The Samba but his website (www.vwbob.com) seems to be down these 
days. I recall that his place is off of 80 in western PA, but I don't 
know exactly how to get there. Just curious if anyone's been there and 
might have directions off of 80 West or a number I can call to get 
directions, um, directly.

Thanks!

Steve
