Subject: head stud came out - won't thread back in

This is the third time this has happened - what I assume is a head stud (it
looks like a valve adjust screw - threaded like a bolt but with a common
screwdriver slot in one end). It worked its way out of a hole in the head
just forward of the intake manifold on cylinder #3. The first time this
happened, I was able to just screw it back in. Then it happened on cylinder
#4 - which I screwed back in. Now #3 is out again and I can't get it to
thread right.

I cleaned up the threads on the stud as best I can, but I can't seem to get
it to catch. This is all by feel as the hole is really impossible to see
(and yes, I'm using some lock-tite this time). I need to try to fix it in
the morning as I'm driving to Atlanta and then on to Florida this week.

Any thoughts? What is the worst that can happen if I just leave it out
until I get to Florida? Once there I can drop the engine and really figure
out what's going on...
