I put the axles on after I install the engine and tranny as a unit.

Not at all.  You will need an assistant to pull the stick shift backwards.
Then, you will guide the coupler over the shift rod, as your assistant
pushes the stick forward.

If you have not replaced the shift rod bushings lately, now is the perfect 
time.
