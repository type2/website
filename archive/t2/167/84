Howdy Campers,
If you are reading this and do not know why, it is because I have added you
to a distribution list of prospects for our next gathering.  If you would
like to be removed, kindly let me know, and I will delete your e-dress.
For the knowing, I am extremely busy since BNB, and have just added your
e-dresses.  We have decided on date for our next gathering, August 9-12.
Why this date?  It will coincide with an extremely large Vintage VW show
(350 Vintage VW's last year) a festival in the host city, a classic car
show, and a whole lot of activity for the adventurous.  Be on the lookout
for a web page and info on the gathering, to be called "The Dixie Bus
Gathering".  Why Dixie?  That's the festival in the host city, the creator
of the song Dixie is from Mt Vernon Oh, and a large festival celebrates a
Northern Yankee creating the anthem of the Southern Rebel.
If you were at BNB, you have reason to expect an awesome time.  We will have
a chili supper one evening, a pot luck another evening, I have reason to
believe that Man Made Moon will again entertain us, we will have a hayride,
kids activities, and well heck, much too much to list.  I expect we will
have a carabus going to the vw show Sat morning.
If anyone creative (I am talking to you Floyd) can help me with a logo and
such, I will be much appreciative.
I will posting my pix of BNB soon, just not enough time for a rookie like me
to create a web page, but it will happen.

By the way,,, who built that fire??

Respectfully,

Frank E Biffath III
