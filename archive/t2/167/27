Dan,

You need to remove the CV to get the boot off, yes.  If you don't have
one, head on down to Sears and get a set of Lock Ring Pliers (Item #
00947386000)  This will really help with the retaining ring on the end of
the shaft.

There is a theoretic difference between the inner and outer face of a CV.
I believe it is that the raised lip on the inner hub, the bevel on the
cage, and the groove on the outer go toward the center of the axle.
OTOH, I have mismatched them without ill effect.  If you are trying to
"flip" them to bring a new wear surface into action, they are important
alignment marks, other than that I hardly pay attention, but I'd love to
learn if this is wrong.
