<<<It will try to
 start, make it for a split second, and if no gas is
 applied, dies right out.  If gas is applied, it will
 run at high RPMS, but will not idle, and dies once
gas
 is released.  Any suggestions?>>>>

I missed what year bus You have, but on my 74 there is
a metal crossover tube that runs across and behind the
aircleaner. This tube goes across and then down on
both
sides of the engine. At the ends there are rubber
"elbow" splices. If these elbows crack or come off it
will run but only if I feather the gas to keep
the RPM up a bit. Wont idle. Sooo long to short.. You
might have a VAC leak. You gotta reach all the way
back
and down close to the tin to feel this connection.

Removing vernier:
You can try a heat gun and see if the adhesive will
soften... or you can use a adhesive eater. I am pretty
sure Formby <sp?> makes one.. messy tho. Make sure
that it is the stuff that evaporates or it will soak
into the base wood which is probably a particle board
and will realy mess with you when you try an glue new
stuff down. You might try a local cabinet shop and
talk
to them about what they use... even though you arent
buying cabinets .. a lot of times these guys are happy
to give you some insight into how they work their
magic. They might even sell the stuff they use.
