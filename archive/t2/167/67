The symptoms are consistant with a lean condition...

Assuming no exhaust leaks...

Were it mine, I'd first spray each intake joint with carb cleaner to
assure no vacuum leaks.  If no leaks, then I'd fatten up the mains a
couple steps and note the change.  If better, I'd bump them up another
step and see again, better or worse.  Wash, rinse, repeat...

Then... I'd find the local guy with a Sun distributor machine and have
the 009 curved to match the curve in the straight mechanical distributor
that came in the early buses. Don't wemember the number, but 010 seems
that it might be the one. (Jim Thompson's distributor database could
help here. <http://www.oldvolkshome.com>)

Running twin carbs and a mechanical advance distributor will probably
yield abysmal mileage, but as always, YMMV.
