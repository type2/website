Subject: Transmission oil cooler - again

Guys and Gals,

I posted the message below about a week ago but did not receive any
replies. Is this something no one has tried yet or is it a project
doomed to fail?

Thanks,
Marcus

List,

I am not sure if this has come up yet - I have not checked the archives
...

I am in the process of restoring my 74 Westfalia Duesseldorf. It has
the later 70hp dual carb 2 liter engine (CJ) and an automatic tranny. It
also has a trailer hitch rated at 1.2 tons.

I have towed loads of up to 2 tons with a standard transmission (VW
suggests no more than 1.5 tons) with no problems. VW limits the towing
capacity on automatic buses to 600 kg. The limiting factor here is
tranny oil temperature.

Now I was thinking about adding an external tranny oil cooler. Has
anyone done that before? If so, what kind of cooler did you use (any
kits out there?) and how did you connect it to the transmission?
