Subject: Installing rear bumper on 72

Hi Folks,

Just got my bus back from the paint shop.  Looks real nice.  Went to
reinstall rear bumper and on the passenger side the "nuts" up inside the
"sorta" chassis are missing.  Is there anyway to get at these or put
another one in there?  What other alternatives are there?  My first
thought is a large self tapping bolt.

Craig
