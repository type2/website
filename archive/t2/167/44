Must suggest that the rainbow colors of the races comes from the final heat 
treating and is seen on new joints. That's what makes the first several 
thousands of an inch of the races hard. This is always done after machining 
as the hardened surface can't be machined without very expensive tooling. 
Excess heat will be apparent from burnt, dry grease and worn balls and 
races which is evident as a sloppy joint. In operation the joint will come 
apart long before it every reaches the temperatures that would discolor the 
base metal. Any metallurgists care to expound upon my basic understanding 
here???
