Subject: back home

hello list.

i am back from my recent adventures in southwestern Utah.  stops included
Zion, Bryce & Capitol Reef Nat'l Parks as well as a few other destinations.

just wanted to say thanks to fellow listees who offered very helpful info
on traveling in that area.

pics & trip report coming soon!

[OBC] i saw a 15-20 bay window Westys, 1 bay Riviera, 1 SC splitty,
2 Eurovans & MANY Vanagon Westys. did not get to talk to any owners, tho.

also, just outside of Capitol Reef N.P. (Torrey, UT), there is a blue
bay (73-up) that has been sitting there a while. no headlights nor tail
lenses.  also has one of those orange stickers on it, so it looks like it
will be towed soon.  i did not stop to look closely, but the body appeared
to be in VERY good shape.  this would be a great find for someone in the area.

glad to be home,
