Subject: Still having problems with clutch install...

I'm really hoping there's a clutch guru online today. I posted yesterday 
about problems with my clutch install -- replaced throwout bearing, clutch 
plate and disc. Put everything back together and all I got was a 
whirring/grinding noise when I let out the clutch pedal (in gear only), bus 
didn't move except in reverse and even then it sounded like it was eating 
itself.

My bus is a 1970 with a Mexican 1600 and standard 3-rib tranny.

Okay, so I must not have put it together correctly, yes? Removed engine 
again, inspect everything, notice some metal filings lining the tranny case. 
Also notice the teeth on the clutch disc are a little chewed up. Removed the 
plate and disc to compare to originals. Plates match up fine, but the discs 
are different. New one has four springs (old one has six), and the piece 
that mates with the shaft from the tranny is shorter than the original. I'm 
no Einstein, but I could see that the new one is not the correct part, so I 
put the old disc back in, reassembled everything, fired her up and tried to 
get her to move. Nothing. Same problem as yesterday -- makes a 
whirring/grinding noise (chewing up the teeth on the clutch disc, I'm sure) 
and won't move.

Someone (Karl, I think?) suggested I had the disc in backwards -- it wasn't. 
I also checked the free play of the clutch pedal and that's fine (even tried 
adjusting it up and down, but it didn't help).

Am I missing something here when I mate the tranny and motor back up? It 
seems like the shaft isn't coming together with the clutch disc correctly. 
The throwout bearing is brand new and installed according to Bentley 
yesterday -- looked okay today while I had it all apart. Also, the shaft 
looks fine -- no visible damage, anyways.

Any ideas? I need to get this done today since this is my daily driver, so 
quick replies are verrry welcome!

Thanks,

Sean
