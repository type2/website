Subject: let me try to type slower

i read that the shafts are the same, but are the c/v joints the same too. 
what we have here is both shafts out ready to to take apart and install new 
boots and repack(not in that order). what i need to know is if it makes a 
diffrence as to which c/v goes to the trans and the one that goes to the 
wheel.

man do i really have to take apart that whole c/v to replace the boot ! 
should have got the leaky kind you bolt on.

man i need a smoke :)
