Subject: 1971 Westy Running Problems

Howdy All,

This might be a long post but I want everybody that might be able to help 
know all the details.

1971 Westy.
Stock 1600 dual port.
Rebuilt motor bought by previous owner and put in less than 10,000 miles 
before I got it.

Ran fine with stock dist and carb.
But wanted a little more power for the long trips so here is what I did.

Installed brand new Kadrons.
New 009 Dist. with pertronix ignitor and coil.
Extractor exhaust with quiet pack muffler.

Problem is:
Idles perfect.
Can rev it up a couple of times with no problems.
But if you go Rev, Rev, Rev real quick then wait a second then Rev again 
pops thru carbs.
And if you rev it and hold it at a certain idle for a while it will start to 
run rough.
Cant drive under load...pops thru carbs.
Sometimes pops up thru carbs then kicks in...like it has a dead spot.....and 
RPM goes up nice but then might start popping again.
Popping is thru both carbs.

Have gone thru bus about 4 times now each time checking:
spark plugs...tried 2 sets already
plug wires...tried two new sets already.
Took brand new carbs apart 3 times already to check if jets are 
clogged...took them out and were fine.
Checked valve clearance already 3 times.
Sprayed starting fluid around base of manifolds and base of carbs...no idle 
change.
Exelerator pumps are adjusted per A.J.'s site and work as expected.
Idle mixture screw is adjusted as per A.J.'s site.
Compression checked on all cylanders between 100-120.

But here is something I found.
Timed to 10 degrees BTDC at idle.
But dist only goes to max 28 degress BTDC at around 3000-3500 RPM.

Have a 68 double cab with same set up.
Double cab runs great thats why I wanted to do they same to the bus.
But 009 on double cab starts at 10 at idle and goes to 35 at 3000-3500 RPM.

Haved talked to the Kardon wiz A.J. on the phone two times already.
He keeps suggestting things I've double and triple checked so am running out 
of ideas.

Carbs have stock Jets...55 Idle 130 main.
He says they should be fine.
But exhaust got grey real fast after install and plugs get black real quick.
Ran it by him that other people suggeste carbs to lean but he says check 
other things.
Well I've checked and checked and still no good.

Just for the record I just wanted to add that I have 10 years of Auto 
Mechanic experience but this problem is going to be the death of me.
Been out of the field for about 5 years but still fix cars on the side so am 
pretty experienced.
But if I missed something please please please let me know.

Anybody ever run into this.
Any ideas...bigger main jets....bad 009 dist??

I cant drive this thing and would hate to see the money I spent on the carbs 
go to waste and have to put the stocker back on.

Sorry for any spelling mistakes.

Thanks Much,
Kevin
