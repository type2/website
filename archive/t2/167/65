Subject: another distributor question  

hey all!  quick question- can i run a distributor 113905205k on a 70 
westy with a 1600 dp (yes i know it was a sp originally, engine case was 
a rebuilt 70 bus)?  if so, can i static time it to 0 TDC and then take 
it from there?  any pros and cons will be appreciated!!
thanks, bruce.
