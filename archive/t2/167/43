Subject: Re: [T2] Still having problems with clutch install...

Hi Karl,

No tube -- I've got the ring on the pressure plate, flat faced bearing, and 
the flat side of the disc (that reads "flywheel") facing the flywheel.

Should the bus be in gear or out of gear when reassembling? I had it in 
neutral both times. What else would cause the shaft not to match up to the 
hub on the clutch disc?

Thanks for the help!

Sean
