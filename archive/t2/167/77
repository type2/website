Higher gear ratio = slower revs = less cooling potential = engine thinks 
it's climbing a hill all the time = better chances to overheat the engine.

If you drive carefully, you might pull it off.

If it is b/c of the noise soundproof it better for the same cost and never 
hear the engine.

Lastly I don't know if the gearsets will swap.

Are you doing an interesting engine swap?
