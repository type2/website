The bolt on boots are short term solutions. The regular boots are long term 
IF you can find decent boots.

I have seen the bolt on boots last longer than the cheap aftermarket boots 
(mine lasted less than a year).

Basically you don't have to disassemble the joint, just take it off of the 
axle. I'd properly clean and pack the joint with grease since you are there 
anyhow. Just depends I suppose on how you feel about maintenance.

Give up those cigs man - they'll kill ya - it's confirmed! <grin>
