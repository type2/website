Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel cut off

Hi Chris, I finally dug out the info on the solenoid. The brand is Airod,
have a look at the link of a local supplier
http://www.medauto.com.au/main_files/solenoidvalves.htm
I paid A$40 for model S26, so that should be ~$20 for you.
It also came with two fittings to adapt the 1/8"NPT to a hose end.
I've had it on for about 2 months and ~6000Mi with no problems except the
pressure build up.

Just a note on this, after the last couple of long runs I've done I left
solenoid turned on for a few minutes and NO pressure build up.
By the way, if you have FI, I though your fuel system should be designed to
handle much more pressure than the 3-4psi put out by the dual carb fuel
pumps. So I thought they would suffer less fuel leaking problems than the
carb models??
And besides, how's your Corvair conversion coming along?
Good luck!!
Richard
