Subject: Re: [T2] fuel cutoff solenoid

Thanks - now I know what you are talking about. I skipped a couple 
important details when i read the message.

Valid concerns you have I think.

I just realized that I've got to have TWO cutoff solenoids since I have a 
fuel injection engine - one for the supply and one for the return. Guess I 
will have to turn off the supply first, idle a second and then turn off the 
return line solenoid.
