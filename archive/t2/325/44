Subject: suicide doors

Here is a random Friday question. Does anyone know how much it would cost to 
get suicide doors, installed, in a bug? Now i know that this isnt a Bug 
list, but im sure that there are people who know people, if they havent 
themselves, who have suicide doors in their bugs. What about any drawbacks 
to them?? Let me hear some feedback from people and what they think of them.

joey
