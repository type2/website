Or worse, dinging up the old bushings and not being able to put it back
together at all!  :)

It's easy with the rignt tools.

You need
1. A Washer with and OD slightly smaller than the OD of the bushing,
2. A deep socket that will hold both bushings inside.
3. A piece of all-thread that will pass through the square drive of the
socket and long enough to pass all the way though the length of the socket
and through the swing lever bushing tube in the front beam with a few
inches left over.
4. Four nuts to fit the all-thread.

Use two nuts on one end of the all-thread.  Jam them together so they
won't turn.

Add one more nut and spin it down near the jammed nuts.  Leave it loose.

Pass the free end of the all-thread through the socket (drive end first)
and through the bushing tube in the beam from below.

Put the washer on the top end of the all-thread.

Put the last nut on the end of the all-thread.  Make sure it is spun on
with several free threads showing.

Hold the jammed nuts still with a wrench and tighten the free nut on the
bottom end of the all thread upward toward the socket.  As you tighten the
free nut, the top nut and washer will slowly pull the bushings down the
tube and out into the socket.

You can use the same setup to install the new bushings.
