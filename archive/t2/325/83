Why are you doing this? You're getting pre-detonation so you're trying a
higher octane?

Under ideal operating conditions, timing at idle it set about 4 degrees
after pre-detonation would occur. FYI.

If you don't have the tuned ear of a seasoned mechanic, like myself, get a
dwell/tach automotive meter. Although setting the idle speed is the last
part of a tune-up is handy to watch the rpm change due to timing/vacuum.

From the sound of it you could be running way too lean. Excessive heat will
overcome octane. Back in September when you did your cross country trip, you
had a problem with high oil temps and high cylinder temps.

What did you do to resolve the problem then?  Did you:

- hook up a vacuum gauge to the air plenum and see what the reading was
despite being unable to locate any leaks at the time?

- have a mechanic check and reset the idle mixture with a gas analyzer?

You lost one head to heat already...
