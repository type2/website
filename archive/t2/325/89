One other thing:  You do not want wider-than-stock tires on a pre-73 bus.
These had the older worm-and-peg steering box which was rather fragile.  I
think that they went to the worm-and-roller box in '73 due to the
increased number of failures resulting from the use of wider radial tires.
It took more force to turn the radials and if you do a lot of steering
when not in motion you will put a lot of stress on the box.  Boxes aren't
cheap, either and unfortunately the '73-up box does not fit the early
bays.
