Subject: Re: [T2] Re:coilover shocks-were they ever VW option?

I'm at the point of buying some used coils that clamp on to my stock shocks
with brackets and u-bolts to produce a frankenstein coil-over of sorts.
I've seen this setup work on a mega-overloaded housebus, with no apparent
ill effects.  Any thoughts on this idea?  It would seem to retain stock
shock travel, just adding some stiffness.  My idea was to jack the bus up a
couple of inches, measure shock expansion, remove, add coils at that
expansion (current ride height +3in) and reinstall.  The shocks would then
be slightly tensioned at all times, raising the rear perhaps an inch or so
and adding some stiffness.  Advice/comments?  Also, what do folks think
about substituting the Astro Van coilovers?  Ala Jamie's suggestion:

If driven on the street?  Off-road?
Sorry to belabor this FART, but I am still getting conflicting advice and
opinions, and trying to make it up in volume, I guess...  TIA!
