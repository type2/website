You do have to loosen the e-brake cables.

If you look on the back side of the backing plates you will see four holes
around the bottom edge.  They may be plugged with rubber plugs.

The outer two holes are for inspection of the lining thickness.  The inner
two holes are for adjustement.  If you look into these holes, you will see
the adjustment stars edge-on.  You lever the points up and down with a
screwdriver to adjust the brakes.

You might want to remove the wheels and drums (easy on the '72) so that
you can familiarize yourself with the guts of the brakes.  While you're in
there, you might want to disassemble things and grease the stars and
adjusters with anti-sieze.  It makes them move much easier.
