My bus is a '78 Westy and it does have the fixed delay wipers - that is 
delay - off - low speed - high speed.

I think I could in my case substitute the programmable delay relay for the 
fixed delay relay on my bus after double checking the wiring schematics in 
my Bentley. As for the early baywindows I think it would still be easy to 
wire this up with an external switch.

This external switch would be wired to the relay and then to the low speed 
side of the wiper motor. The switch applies 12 volts to the delay relay 
just like the delay position on my '78's delay position.

I believe this is how most of the JC Whitney sourced aftermarket kits work.
