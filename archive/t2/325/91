I own R&T issues from 1959 through about 1985 or so.  R&T lost most all 
it's personality when John and Ilene Bond sold it. There are still a 
couple good columnists (ie: Peter Egan) but for all intents and purposes 
it's just another Motor Trend these days. No personality.

For you young folks, there are a couple of old R&T articles on 
<http://wetwesties1.tripod.com> that will show you how it used to be. 
Just plain superb writing.
