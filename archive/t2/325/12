Engine noise can get monotonous on 1,000 mile trips.  I added lots of gauges so that I could feel confident about my engine's general condition without having to hear it, if I choose.  Sometimes it's nice to hear the engine sing while you're cruising the hills of Sedona on a warm evening with the windows down.  Sometimes it's nice to watch the forests of the Ozarks roll by while listening to your favorite tunes on the CD player.  Both are part of the bus-experience for me and I like to be able to choose.

Sometimes I wish I had made the cabinet shorter like yours.  Next time, I might make it shorter and taller.  I kept the height down so it would clear the seatbelt buckles (in fact, they seem to help keep the cabinet in place) with the idea that I could always add an "insert" on top for whatever functionality I needed, like a seat cushion, storage cabinet, etc..  Never got around to making the inserts though.
