Subject: Becker Mexico TR follow up and update

Hello

thanks to the listee who helped me out on my Becker mexico Tr.

One german ebayer told me that all mexico are easy to switch to 12V, so i
opened my mexico and it was true.

Ive add some more picture on my website:

http://www.chez.com/westfalia/splitradio.html

i still have 2 question:

-Why there is a small paper between two contact on the automatic tuning?

-why the 2 wire coming out of the radio are soldered to the back of the power
knob ?  maybe a switch shortcut!!

Thanks to all

I hope it will help other Becker Mexico Owner also
