Subject: Re: [T2] Complete engine gasket kit

Maybe I didn't explain what information I'm seeking very clearly.  I suppose gasket kits do vary in price according to what's in them.  But it's not the price that I'm trying to find out.  So, assuming I find and buy the most thorough gasket kit I can find, what can I expect to find in it?  I guess the info I'm looking for would be something to the effect of :  Flywheel washer (1), offset exhaust manifold gaskets (4), etc etc.  Then, with this information I could determine that I don't have, say, the exhaust gaskets, so I would buy them seperately.  That way, when assembly time comes, I don't suddenly realize that I don't have gasket X.  I, too, get most of my parts in the mail, so that would mean another week or so delay from that great pleasure, actually DRIVING the bus!

Thanks,

Charles
