Subject: tents

Hi,

My wife and I would like to investigate the "zip up and driveaway from" 
style tents for the VW Westy.

Basically we want to expand our camping area for foul weather, indoors.

Would someone have any suggestions on the ultimate source for tents or 
would you have one you would like to sell us here in the Maritimes of 
Canada? We plan to camp a lot this summer.
