As I pointed out some more torque not tons

Mine has full flow.

Will they? I have not seen this at all. Maybe the 2 liter will but I have 
more friends with dead type 4's of the 1700 and 1800 group then I do type 
1's.
And either way, lets assume you can get 100,000 miles from a type 1 in a 
bus.
(But as I have posted before I have owned and known people with busses who 
have taken their type 1 in a bus to 200 to 300 thousand miles).
OK lets assume 100,000 miles for a VW type 1 enigne in a bus. Now lets 
assume a
type 2 goes 300,000 miles.
So i do 1 rebuild during that time, and then we are ready to rebuild both,
assuming we still own our busses (100,000 miles is a long way!)
I have mine out in 20 minutes. I rebuild it with new bearings new top end. I 
spend about $400 or I could get a used engine for about $350. Then its 20 
minutes back in. And you spend how much? Double? or more? Type 1 is the way 
to go.
