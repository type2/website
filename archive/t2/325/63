On NA Volvos they come as bright reds on both sides and I see them left on 
full time alot by uneducated drivers.

We had them on all late model cars in Italy when I was stationed there. It 
showed which side was the left side of your car (for passing) and did not 
confuse anyone about whether your brake lights were one or not. All of the 
ones I remember were below the tailights and below the brake lights.

I plan to add them (or something like them) to my bus and my current Honda. 
I think they are a GREAT idea. Miss those clever little foreign cars.
