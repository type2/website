Subject: Rear Brakes

I have a 72 bus and I need to adjust the rear drum brakes.  I am having
problems understanding what the adjustment "star" is.  The drivers side
wheel is really hard to turn and the passenger wheel is free moving.
Will I have to losen the parking brake cables first and then adjust the
rear brakes.  Any help.
