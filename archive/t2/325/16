Subject: Complete engine gaqsket kit

Friends--

I am a confirmed list maker.  I write all sorts of lists.  Since I'm rebuilding a 2 liter engine, I have plenty of opportunity to write lists.  One list I am lacking is an itemized list of what gaskets are included in a complete engine gasket kit.  Anyone out there know exactly how many of what kinds of gaskets are included?

Thanks,

Charles
