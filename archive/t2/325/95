you parts gurus supply those numbers for me?

There were 2 different windows, early and late. The difference is where the wire connectors are. Early are in
the center, the wires go thru the hatch and come out thru a grommet. Late are at the top, the wires do not
touch the hatch. I believe the break was at the end of 74.
Early = 211 845 495
Late = 211 845 495A
