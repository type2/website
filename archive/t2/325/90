Subject: Re: [T2] Correct Tires vs Good Tires?

Hiya Phil,

As has been mentioned in the preceeding posts, the topic of this thread is 
one which provokes a lot of dissenting opinions.  Tire choice, apparently, is 
a very personal process.
This piece of information is being offered just as a place to start.  As has 
been mentioned a 185R14 (if radial) was the original equipment on your bus.  
The originals may have been bias ply tires also, but that's another story.  I 
would suggest you scribble the size down and hop down the block and visit 
Les.  I went to Schwab's when I bought the tires for my Bus.  He has what you 
need in both load range C (a six ply tire) and D (eight ply).  It's a good 
place to get started actually looking at the tires.
Also, I'd suggest you spend some time in the Type 2 library researching 
other's past experiences and ratings of the various brands.
