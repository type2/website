Of course, check out the placement of ads vis-a-vis articles...A very long
time ago, the two mags had a distinct personality. R&T was traditional
sports car oriented and Car and Driver was the brash up-start (Pontiac
GTO vs, the Ferrari GTO, for example). Both have become "brands" (think
'Nike'), more interested in being the flagship that pulls their flotilla of 
for-
sale products along...
