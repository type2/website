Subject: Temp sensor II graph

I was reading through the library and archives about the temp sensor II and was wondering how mine was operating because it's 25 years old and my engine warm-up is a little rougher than I think it should be.  I was also wondering how the mixture was being affected when the engine finally warmed up because when the mixture was last adjust it took a big turn of the screw. I know the sensor is working because it passes the basic continuity tests and if I disconnect it the engine won't start but I wasn't sure if it was in spec.

I picked up a new one and decided to test it against the old using a stove pot, some canola oil (high smoke point), a digital turkey thermometer to measure the oil temp and a VOM to measure the thermistor resistance.

This is the graph that resulted:

At 68F I got 2290 Ohms.  Bentley says 2500 is spec and the workshop manual says 2-3 kOhms is spec at 68F and 250-400 Ohms at 176F so I expect Bentley just split the difference.

It's interesting to note that as the sensor ages, it seems to affects warm-up enrichment the most by running richer than necessary.

At high engine (canola) temperatures, 325F, there's hardly any difference at least with the two I tested. If the sensor tests zero or infinite resistance it's obviously broken. You'll have to use the air temperature to get a rough resistance reading and of course touching it with fingers will change the reading.

After 20 minutes of normal driving I witnessed a reading of ~90 Ohms if I took a measurement right after turning the engine off.  With the new sensor warm-up is smoother but most surprising it that idle is even steadier now at the end of my short trip to work. Small differences at the rigth of the gaph seem enough to affect mixture at normal operating temps. Putting in electronic ignition made a big difference and eliminated most of the hunting in the timing but I didn't expect a new sensor to have such an impact.

It seems a small difference of + 200 Ohms when the engine is cold make for a sloppier warm up.

The sensor I pulled is stamped 022 906 041 but ETKA says the VW part number is 311 906 041A. Karl? Both have the same bosch part# 0 280 130 012.
