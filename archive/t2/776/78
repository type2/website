We've been using premium fuel on our cross country jaunt.  For ~$2.00 a 
tank extra over regular, I'll gamble that it may actually help 
something.  We also have a VDO CHT gauge with sender ring under #3 
spark plug.  Realizing there are a lot of variables here, what max head 
temp is "safe" for the AMC heads many of us have?  I understand that 
the gauge may read 20 degrees cool at 90 ambient, but what actual head 
temp are we watching for!?!

Our 1978 bus with FI 2.0 cruises at around 425-450 at 60 mph on a 70 
degree day, depending on wind direction and grade.  I have played with 
timing, mixture, and made incremental cooling improvements, but those 
cruising temps don't seem to change.  The bus will happily cruise at 
65-70, but head temp readings rise to 450-475 at those speeds so we've 
kept it to 55-60.

Thanks for any advice/experience.  We want this bus to get us back to 
Montana!
