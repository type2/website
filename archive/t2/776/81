Man, what a great idea. Here's a start:

It looks like they require some sort of heat sink, and operate at 0-15
volts DC. Not being an electrical guy, it seems to me you could
assemble a cooler with a fan and tie it to a common power source...
and at $12.95 you coupld probably rig up mulitple locations, too. My
father is an electrical engineer who revels in this sort of think.
I'll buy the parts and demand that he build me one!
