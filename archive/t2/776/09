Ok, its dead.  Bummer.  Have you considered a T2
burial?  We could put the hard-disk & software into a
rusted-out T2 shell, and push it off a cliff
somewhere.  Uhh, back up a moment....we could douse it
with gasoline, light it, and then push the bus over a
cliff.
   
We have a local 10 o'clock news anchor who owns an
early 70's T2 named the Party Pickle.  We could have
him catch the event on film.

PS:  Nice send-off.  But that is immediately before we
are cited for littering, discarding burning materials,
failure to purchase a burning permit, improper
hazardous waste disposal (gasoline, and the asbestos
on the heater tubes), an unlicensed burial,
discharging a foul mouth within county lines,
discourteous treatment of an officer of the law....
