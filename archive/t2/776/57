Subject: Re: [T2] How many solenoids..

Hi Barry,

I do remember that *SO* well..... One of the many things on the list  
of items that helped swing me over to L-Jetronic...

Those spade connecters on the solenoids are angled to drop LIVE 12V  
wires off the clips onto the engine.  Not a very smart design.



Happy trails,
