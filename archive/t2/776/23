Barry,

I don't think there are any other solenoids, except perfhaps the idle
jet cut off valve on the carb'ed models.

Depends on whether you migh classify a relay as a "solenoid"....usually 
doesn't have a metal core that slides, but simply a largish metal square 
or circle on one end that responds to the magnetic influence to actuall 
move the current carrying contacts back and forth.

Also depends on whether you have remote door locks installed or not<grin>.

hmmmm.....I gues that a horn might be tentatively classified as a 
solenoid, or relay(intermittent).

Cheers, dave
