Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westy Cheap (fwd)

I know, it is killing me. I would jump on it normally, but I am packing up 
to move to Orlando myself on August 14th, so I don't have any spare time to 
do the deal. I always wanted a Westy, especially a 71, the year of my 7 
passenger deluxe. Someone, please buy this bus so I won't feel so bad about 
letting it get away.
