Subject: Re: [T2] Fried wire solenoid to alternator

Thanks for all the replies.  And the warnings!  (By the way, I did wait
until the burny smell had disappeared, and I knew the bus wasn't going to
catch fire, before I went to bed... :)

Before I got these responses, I disconnected the battery and removed the
burnt wire from the solenoid.  It fell apart in my hands.  Traced it back
and pulled it thru the grommet at the engine tin - no short there.   The
burnt wire then connected in with the 4 wires from the voltage regulator.
So I disconnected those from the regulator.  Tracing the big wire to the
alternator, there is a grommet at the rear alternator cover.  Can't tell the
inside because haven't taken out alternator yet.  Am intimidated.  But I
have Muir and I have Bartnik's procedure with pics! blessed pics! from this
page.  I did remove the starter - oh well -(I didn't want to start it with
the bad wire anyway) and that was easy, so maybe this won't be so bad... The
warranty shop unfortunately is in Santa Monica, California, so even if the
alternator is bad I'm not so sure their warranty will help me.  At least not
now.  

I'm hoping there's a shop here in CO Springs where I can test my alternator,
voltage regulator, and starter before replacing them.  Any advice from you
CO folks?

Thanks again for the help... I'm sure there will be more Qs before I'm
through, but I'm doing my best to research first.
