hey guys   This is a sign of the head overheating and the cooler air coming 
in the intake causing the seat to shrink and the head to expand.  My guess is 
he doesnt have a CHT sensor.   Running high grade gas will also help with this 
problem but the main thing is to keep the clylinder temps down  .   Of all the 
heads I have seen it is usually the intake seat that comes loose close to 90% 
.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
