Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus smog pump

73 & 74 Buses were equipped with the smog pump but not catalytic
converters.  They did have a Charcoal Vapor Cannister, which worked
with the smog pump, which should not be confused with the catalytic
converter Todd mentions.  By the time catalytic converters were
intro'd on the 1975 model year Type 2, the smog pump was dropped from
the production, so the two were never used together.

smog pump is supposed to force outside air into the exhaust so that when the
exhaust and added air make it to the catalytic converter, it'll burn easier.
