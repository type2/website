Subject: Re: [T2] clean out crank case without opening it?

I have heard that diesel works pretty well. At one time i had soaked an oil
cooler in it, and it worked fairly well, but I wasn't able to see how much
dried/cooked oil it had removed due to the fact the oil cooler is full of
tiny fins and low visability :)
 good luck and happy bussing!
