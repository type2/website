Subject: Re: [T2] Fried wire solenoid to alternator

Before you replace the starter and solenoid, check the
wire from the alternator to the solenoid for being
shorted out to the tin where it goes through the fire
wall. There may not be anything wrong with the
starter, replace the wire and check for places that
the wire will be cut by the tin and insulate it from
the source. then try the starter again before calling
it bad.  Phil
