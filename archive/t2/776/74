Subject: Re: [T2] How many solenoids.. (can dance on the head of a pin?)

I learned basic systems wiring (HVAC systems) as an apprentice.
Whether it's solenoids or relays, basic electricity (not solid state
stuff) all boils down to switches and loads. Relays and solenoids are
both electromagnetic switches. Relay contacts switch electrical loads,
like lights. Solenoids are electrical switches that convert electrical
energy to a physical action like opening and closing fuel valves or
causing gears to mesh like a starter and flywheel.
