Subject: Looking for flycatcher, chrome for grill, rubber seal for

I have a 71 Bus and can't seem to find the plastic flycatcher that fits
behind the grill (part # 211-259-165A), the chrome around the grill, rubber
seals that fit the rear-bumber splashguards, and a decent diagram and parts
list for the rear folding seat/bed.  I would appreciate any help.

Thanks,

Brian Warner
