Hi All,



I bought a 1981 Vanagon last week and have a couple of questions. It has
a green knob on the dash with the word "temp" on it. It is not listed in
the owners manual. What does it do? Also, will a standard aftermarket
stereo fit the stock opening?



Thanks



-Jeff



PS. My 1970 westy is for sale on the samba.
