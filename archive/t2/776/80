Anyone heard of this? Sounds like a solution that could seriously be considered and ADDED to the STOCK vent system for a no-moving parts system at speed or with ambulance fans at idle or in traffic.

Time to check prices for some parts to play with...

Another idea: my '97 VW Cabrio has a stock a/c compressor which does not cycle the clutch. My Bentley describes it as a variable displacement compressor. I had noticed the clutch wasn't clicking in and then later out in traffic or on the highway. That's why... Nice upgrade to a traditional a/c system in my opinion.
