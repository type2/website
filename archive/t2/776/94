Seriously switch to synthetic oil. Each time I have done this to an engine it has been BLACK very quickly after the oil change. 

They also make some engine flushes for this purpose. Mix with old oil right before change. Can't drive it this way because of the decreased lubricating properties of this stuff.

I had a friend that used to substitute a quart of auto tranny oil for engine oil and drive it that way... Dunno 'bout that one... 

Change your oil more often than necessary. At 2K instead of 3K. Take some road trips...
