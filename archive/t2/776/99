Assuming your gauge is accurate those temps are too high. The problems I've 
seen recently mentioned on various lists resulting in high head temps are: 
vacuum leaks, flaps attached to the thermostat not fully opening, and a 
cylinder with low compression.

Have you tried taking off sparkplug leads one at a time when the engine is 
idling? If the cylinder is firing properly there will be a noticeable drop 
in revs when its lead is removed.

Cheers,

Martin.
