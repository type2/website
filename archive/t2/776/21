Subject: How many solenoids..

I took a look at the definition of SOLENOID on the internet, and I got:

so7le7noid    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (sl-noid)
n.

   1. A current-carrying coil of wire that acts like a magnet when a current 
passes through it.

   2. An assembly used as a switch, consisting of a coil and a metal core 
free to slide along the coil axis under the influence of the magnetic field.


Wow ! !   So that's what the starter solenoid does ! !   You send a current 
through the starter solenoid and it kicks a metal core arm that pushes the 
starter motor's gear into the flywheel, making a mesh out of the whole 
thing, and at the same time, the power from the battery that is coming to 
the starter solenoid is passed to the starter motor, turning the starter 
motor, which turns the flywheel, which turns the crank shaft, which turns 
the cam shaft which turns the distributor . . .[['dem bones, 'dem bones, 
'dem dry bones...]]

On a basic type 2 bus, are here any other solenoids??  If so, what are their 
functions.
