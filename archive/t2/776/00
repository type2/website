Same year as my high top.

$54 + $15 core charge:

That's the exact one I have in my bus. Got me here from Cali.I
installed it last October I think. Drove from Cali to Denver in Feb.

The red/white bus thing is because there's a woman in my complex with
one. I've never met her so thought it was possible. Would have been a
funky coincidence. heh
