Should not have an effect unless the chambers are different. I thought
about this overnight and thought I should add the context of his
statement was in a smaller head that had been flycut to larger
cylinders being returned to smaller cylinders. I don't know if the
mating surface will be right for a larger head fitted to smaller
cylinders even if flycut.
