Barry,

Don't be embarrassed...I've been doing this a loooooong time.
Well, maybe not as long as Karl, but pretty close.


A tip:  when the electrical spade connectors get bad enough where you 
start tightening them up, it is time to just put new ones on....and *not* 
the ones made in China!  This is an oportunity to do it right as well, 
insulated spade lug with shrink wrap on it(better than factory!).

Drove over to a friends house 3 miles down the road.  Was going to let his 
wife drive my "other" VW, but it wouldn't start...starter whirred, but 
wouln't connect with the engine...turns out that the electrical connector
was "loose"...pushed it back on a little tighter and didn't have any 
further problems....the first thing I did the next morning was to put a 
new one on.....end of problem.

Cheers, dave

 No even 1 mile later the wire had popped off the idle solenoid again.  This 
 time I used a pair of pliers to firm up the two female connectors on that 3" 
 piece of wire.  All is well again.
