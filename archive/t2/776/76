Do you mean you think my CHT is shot? I certainly do
have one, but it's on the opposite head (the one that
went bad was #1 & #2 head). Are we talking about the
standard CHT sensor that's part of the L-jetronic
system, or do you mean an aftermarket cyl-head temp
sensor and gauge?

All my tinware is present and correct; is there
anything else that could be causing the overheating?

The word from Taylor at gowesty was that they can't
really be competitive in the aircooled market, because
many people shop by price rather than quality, and
their stuff comes in at a premium by the time they've
had the machining done. I get the impression that
those guys are very genuine and will only ever do a
top-quality job, but not many people want to spend the
extra $$ for a "Cadillac" (if that's not a faux pas on
a VW list ;-)
