Pop down to the local library and see if they have (or can get)
a copy of John Jerome's "Truck"...Not at all about VW's but
quite good as to the mind set needed to restore/rebuild/
just get running, an old vehicle...
After you read that, try "Roadster" by Chris Goodrich, about
a non-wrench who decides to build his own sports car...(Fans
of "The Prisoner" TV series probably already know the car... ;-)
