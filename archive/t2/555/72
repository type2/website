Negatory Bob---

For a hitch--I can beat the Rust-O-Leum Shake Rattle and Spray-- 

Get a spray can of Morton's Urethane bed liner-- Tough stuff--- bullet
proof--

There is a picture of the can with a description waaay on the bottom of
the Van Stuff web page below--

Price??
 
About 7--8 bucks a can.


Hasta, 

TK


 
 Terry will probably have a fit, but for this application a couple coats
of Rust-o-leum would probably work fine.. 
Rattle cans are not all bad.
