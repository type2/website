'77 2.0L with a .009

The PO of my Bus put a .009 in when the FI was stripped off for the Weber. I 
now have a 205P that is waiting to be cleaned up and installed. But I 
noticed that compared to some stock engines the placement of the wires to 
the .009 are about 90 degrees off clockwise. Is this due to the design of 
the .009 or am I missing something? After a week or two when I get around to 
the 205 it will not matter anymore... or will it? Looking at the Dist. Cap 
and wire placement the #1 and #4 wires are parallel with the #3 and #4 
Cylinders. On others that I have seen they were parallel with the fan shroud 
not truley square but close.

TravelOn,
