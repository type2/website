A few years ago I found a 1971 deluxe bus on the
junkyard with a sunroof, this bus had the underfloor
panels at the side and the one in the middle. The
middle one was welded on (just like the one on Rus'
1971 bus).

My 1976 Us-microfiche says this about it:

partnumber 215 703 715 C
"Underfloor plate, center"

Is fitted on models:

215 = Panelvan, LHD, sliding door left and right
216 = Panelvan, RHD, sliding door left and right
225 = Microbus, LHD, sldng dr right, sunroof
228 = Microbus, RHD, sldng dr left, sunroof
235 = Kombi, LHD, sldng dr right, sunroof
241 = Microbus Deluxe, LHD, sldng dr right
244 = Microbus Deluxe, RHD, sldng dr left

The modelcodes 241 and 244 stand for 'microbus
deluxe', which had a sunroof as standard equipment.
The codes 241 and 244 were used until modelyear 1973.

The center belly pan is also fitted in other buses as
part of these M-codes:

M060 = Eberspdcher BA6 petrolheater (fitted under
       cargofloor)
M520 = With sliding door on left and right side 

I think however that it was also fitted as part of:

M191 = With outer and center underfloor plates

I found M191 so far only on early baywindow
Westfalia's that were built with a Dormobile roof
instead of the Westfalia roof (Dormobile roof uses
biger opening). And also on most British camper
conversions such as Danbury, Devon and Dormobile.
