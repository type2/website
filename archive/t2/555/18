Subject: The bug shop in Delta BC?

Has anyone dealt with the Bug Shop in Delta BC Canada.  They are supposed to
be the biggest surplus (used) VW parts people around.  I'm talking to them
about building an 1800 cc motor for my "new" 74 (free bird?) and would like to
know others' experiences dealing with them.
