Subject: Fwd: [T2] help with my auto transmission

Hi Bob,

If it's in PARK it shouldn't be spinning a wheel.

I think maybe the linkage is off a notch.

If I read the original message correctly,
PRNDL = What the stick says
RNDL= What the tranny is doing.

So the stick isn't getting the tranny all the way back to park. 
Something is too loose or too tight, and the adjustment is out of spec.

Disconnect the shifter linkage and manually shift the lever all the way 
back to park. Then connect the linkage and adjust it to read P at the 
lever. Verify that all the other gears are also reading OK, and you're 
good to go.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
