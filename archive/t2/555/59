(carb x 2) will help my T2 engine run cooler, give more HP and better

when you add up the costs of carbs, fuel pump etc.  I would enjoy some more
HP as I live in the foothills of the Cascades and I sometimes wonder if I9ll
make it over these passes.  What about rebuilt carbs, they seem more within
my budget?  Why would VW change over to FI if it isn9t as efficient?  Less
pollution maybe?  Thanks for putting up with me.

Either carbs or FI can be made as efficient as your expertise will allow...
Modern FI is probably the only way to get HP and still meet today's regs
and get decent mileage. Aftermarket FI (Megasquirt is a relatively low-
cost system...) but there are other FI systems that are quite pricey
but can also be programmed to fit older engines to give superior per-
formance to original carb(s)...The limits to HP or mileage on a VW en-
gine are also limited by the air cooled design...HP produces heat that
the design was never meant to cope with unless you go to the extreme
engineering of the Porsche engine...Likewise, mileage...Lean is mean
to the air cooled engine (as is the lack of aerodynamics and weight of
the Bus)
