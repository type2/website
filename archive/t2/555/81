Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon into Bay

I currently am running an 80 Vanagon Motor in my 79 Westy.

I opened up the holes in my baywindow mounts, but as another alternative you 
could put thread inserts into your vanagon case and use the bay 
bolts/mounts.

Since you'll have 2 dipsticks (unless you decide to just plug one hole up 
with something) you'll have the perfect place for a dipstick temp sender!!  
One dipstick to be a "permanent" temp sender and the other to use as the oil 
level gauge.
