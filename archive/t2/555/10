Subject: Re: [T2] Molding for roof panel

I know the stuff well... I have also been looking for some for my '69
Westy.  I have been unsuccessful finding anything locally.  Tried all the
usual online VW places (GoWesty, Bus Co, etc)... no dice.

Would sure LOVE to find something that will work.  Suggestions?  Thanks.
