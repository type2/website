Subject: Re: [T2] Talk me out of giving up :(

I've said it once and I will say it again: there are no cheap buses. 
Barring miracles or some seriously crafty horse-trading, every bus 
costs around $4000 before it is safe and reliable.

In fact, it's pretty easy to spend $10,000 on a $700 bus.

The only reason to give up is that you refuse to spend as much as $4000 
on a vehicle.

But here are a couple of pointers:

1. Money alone does not solve problems with buses. There are plenty of 
pricey parts out there that are bad parts. That being the case, the 
best thing to do is:

2. Find a really, really competent mechanic who knows buses inside and 
out, or

3. Expect a costly learning curve as you discover what works and what 
doesn't.

Either way, it is going to cost money. But the good news is that 
eventually both the money curve and the learning curve will flatten 
out.
