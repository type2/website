Subject: Re: [T2] belly pans.... (bolted or welded?)

One more thing I just noticed on the fiche.

It shows three extra items as well: a bolt a washer
and a plug.

28 bolts and washers were used on the buses from 1973
and onwards.

12 bolts and washers were used in combination with M60
(the gas heater). This says from 1974 onwards, but
that's probably because the underfloor heater was
available from model 1974 onwards.

The plug is used on all the models I talked about in
my previous message and on the buses with double
sliding door (M520).

I don't know if this is of any use, but here are the
partnrs and descriptions:

N 011 525 13  "WASHER A 8.4"
N 010 239 11  "BOLT, HEX. HD. M 8x18"
N 020 004 1   "PLUG A 16.5"

Any more remarks. let me know! I think original
specifications is and interesting subject! ;-)

So are there any late Bays with sunroof that have the
center plate WELDED on? (or not welded, just
wondering)
