Subject: Re: [T2] kadron question

Hi Zach,

I'm running dual Kadrons. I had John at Aircooled.net provide a modified 
throttle body for the right carb with vacuum inlet. Connects to a SVDA 
dizzie. The whole setup works /much/ better than my previous setup, a 
40IDF and 009. If I had one thing that I would improve with this setup 
it would be the crap linkage that came with the dual carb kit.
