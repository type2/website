I agree. Don't look at the long list of things to do. Look at the list that has 5 items per page and worry onyl about those next 5 items for now... Finish those and worry about hte next 5.

I've been building old cars with Dad since I was about 10. All of the early cars seemed an impossible project but the more I cars I worked on, the smaller the mountain seemed at the beginning b/c each obstacle is less of an issue. Putting glass in was once a big deal. No big deal now. I can do a bus in a couple hours. 

Paint jobs were a big deal but now I know it just just takes time. 

Corvair engine installs are no big deal... Well - they are still kind of a big deal as I still haven't gotten mine done, but the next one wouldn't be such a big deal! 

Hang in there... And keep that thing out of the street so the tickets don't pile up. You need that cash for parts!
