i'm not in a position to say what you should have feelings for, or what to
get rid of.  but if you can't take care of one fire at a time you're only
going to maintain misery. i say that with a grain of salt so take it with
one: lots of people like to 'drive' themselves crazy. let's assume you're
not one of them. i bet there's one other person on the list besides myself
who has been down the road your on. share the road. you have to take it one
thing at a time. i promise you one item, it's going to cost money. we live,
we die. during that time throw your money at the crap that makes you happy.
