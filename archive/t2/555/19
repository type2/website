Subject: Talk me out of giving up :(

Ok, I paid way too much for this basket case. $700 and $200 in registration. 
See pics at the link in my sig.

I drove it from Hollywood where I bought it to Anaheim where I live. Aside 
from the REALLY sloppy steering and some backfiring it ran ok. Did 60 all 
the way home, no problem.

As I've owned it, the thing has gotten flakier and flakier. I've discovered 
vacuum leaks, fuel leaks, repaired them all. Had the drag link replaced to 
help the steering. I added many parts that were missing- air filter, idle 
intake hose, etc.  Oil change, spark plugs, wires, cap & rotor.

Not stock dizzy: It has no vacuum advance. I can't get my fat head in the 
engine compartment far enough to try to read the numbers.

I timed it when it was running. I read the Bently on adjusting the carbs.

It seems the more I do to it, the worse it gets. I can't get it to idle at 
all now. And when I run it up in RPMs it backfires constantly.

It's still got serious wiring problems. Hi beams = left headlight. Low beams 
= right headlight. Wires that are corroded, high resistance, or just don't 
seem to be connected to anything.

While listening to the backfiring, I noticed something I hadn't before. 
Sounds like a sledgehammer hitting the engine repeatedly. Great. Busted 
connecting rod? Who knows.

Spark plugs were sooty (probably due to me dinking with the carbs), but 
otherwise ok.

I spent all day yesterday and all evening today trying to get it running. I 
gave up. Tomorrow's street sweeping and the bus will get a ticket. I don't 
really care right now. I certainly can't afford it, but I need to be sane 
enough to go to work in the morning so I can buy more crap that will make my 
bus run worse.

I'll probably be in a better state of mind this weekend, but right now I 
just want to pour gasoline all over the thing and watch it burn. At least 
get some satisfaction out of the over $1000 I've got into the thing right 
now...
