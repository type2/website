Ok Don,
    Consider this your official talking to..."don't give up on the
bus"
Let me tell you what I do to make big projects more manageable.  Get
your self a package of 3 by 5 cards and on each one write, in general
terms, just one of the things that needs to be done.  Now prioritize
the jobs by putting the cards in order.  First job goes to the top of
the pile last job to the bottom and everything else goes in order, in
between.  As you progress through the pile you will probably have to
reprioritize and make more cards, no problem, just do it.  The card
makes a good place to keep notes on each job like what parts you'll
need, when and from whom you ordered them, ect.
    Now take a deep breath and relax.  Keep in mind, having a bus is
more like being in a relationship than like owning a car.  You'll have
to work at it to make it successful.
