The heads are the same, but I don't know about the heater boxes and exhaust.  Cooling fan may be different to.  I do have a spare bay window cooling fan housing that I could interchange but I think you would need to reuse you heater boxes as I think 79 is a one only year.
 
Ask the list about interchangeability on a 83 to 79.  Someone will know.
