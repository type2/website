<< Tony... You and I e-corresponded some weeks ago concerning rust treatment 

products.  My local Benjamin Moore gonniff wanted to charge me twice what you 

pay for the stuff.  I was browsing the Tractor Supply catalogue and noted 
they 

offer a rust treatment product around $20/gallon... bought some the other 
day.  

Had planned to work up under the front pan area of my 69 Bay; unfortunately 
we 

are having some serious rain today.  Will let you know how it works out when 
I 

get to it.  Thanks again for your info..... Glenn

If there's a mason supply yard near you, they should have Phosphoric Acid...
for etching and cleaning concrete. Phosphoric acid is the magic ingredient
in rust treatments/convertors (also Coca-Cola... ;-) If anyone knows the
"right" percentage of phosphoric acid, I'd be interested to know...All of the
treatments require a top coat after the iron oxide is converted to iron
phosphate to prevent the rust from returning...
