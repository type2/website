Subject: 2.0 piston/cyl needed.

So here's the story...

Over the winter I got an 81 ASI that was running on three. Got good 
motor.  Put motor in ASI and sold ASI.  Used $ from sale to put new 
Overland 1.9 into the diesel Westy. Three cylindered motor remains. I 
also have a '77 ASI that  is v. tired in the motor department.  Plan 
was to pull '77 motor, have heads done, put heads on Vanagon motor and 
install into '77. Well.....

The '81 motor did not drop a valve or seat as would be expected.  It 
stuck a ring and pulled a chunk of piston off.  Motor is a 12k mile old 
rebuild from SIR. Not the best, but it's not a GEX. Looks to have been 
done right. All oil gallery plugs have been replaced with screw in 
plugs. End play is right, etc, etc, etc. So...

Anyone have A (as in one) spare 94mm piston and cylinder that they 
might be persuaded to part with?

TIA,

Jim
