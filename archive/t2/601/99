The carpet is an indoor/outdoor carpet, however it's not the plastic type
stuff, it's a nice cloth. I didn't install it...was like that when I got the
bus. The fellow I bought the bus from removed all the interior, Rhino lined
the floor and added a new floor and the carpet. It looks too good to change
it and it stays pretty darn clean!! My bus is my only vehicle and we camp in
it pretty hardcore and yet the carpet still looks great after a year now.

I am going to redo my kickpanels though as the carpet looks a bit odd on
them, I think.

Good luck,
