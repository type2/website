Get one of those backpacking mattresses that self-inflate -- thermalux
or something like that.

An even better idea, if you have the time and money, is to create a
sort of double-width sleeping bag of sheet material, with a pocket sown
in the underside. Go to a mattress place and get some "wonder foam" or
memory foam, and put it in the pocket. The whole thing can be rolled up
in the daytime and washed after a trip (take out the foam).
Comfortable, clean, civilized, wife-friendly.
