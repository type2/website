Hello all -
 
I'm looking for anyone who might have some experience with electric fuel pumps.  I have a 72 Westy with a 67 upright 1500cc motor.  It is using a Bosch electric fuel pump which was until recently located on the fan shroud.  I was told by someone I trust as a source of information that those pumps are gravity feed and should be located lower than the level of the gas tank.  In the past from time to time, you could hear the pump clicking away(which my friend told me was the sound of the pump running dry).  Now that I have relocated the pump, I can hear it constantly clicking away.  The bus is running just fine, but I'm worried about burning the pump up if I have done something wrong.
 
Thanks in advance everybody.....
