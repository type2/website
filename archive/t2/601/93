I'm gonna finish pulling tonight. For those who use Muir's 2x4 and chain
method of supporting the tranny, how long is the 2x4 and about how much chain
do I need. Last time we used a jack, but itmoved when we rolled the bus (made
lining everything back up a real bear). I gotta stop on the way home tonight.
My wife sure gets grumpy when we share cars :)

Thanks
