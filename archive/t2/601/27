Subject: Larger Tires for more speed? 

I read on some site somewhere that if you put on like 255's instead of our
195's that you'll get higher top speeds, better mileage, and improved
handling. Is their any truth to that? My bus has plenty of power to spare.
Vroom vroom, but in 4th on the freeway doing 60mph gets my RPM's WAY high. And
starting out in 1st takes hardly any gas at all, and only takes me to like
10mph. I can easily start out in 2nd, even up minor hills, but I fear that's
bad for the tranny.

TIA
