Subject: Re: [T2] Engine/tranny install advice

I've dropped and installed my engine several times without help.  The
biggest
problem I have run into was the height required because of the carbs.  With
carbs
off it would have been alot easier.  I had two high lift jacks on either
side of the bus, and
the engine on two floor jacks.  I blocked the front wheels so that it didn't
roll forward.
Thinking back the bus was up higher than I should have gone.  I should have
just taken
the carbs off but oh well.  The second time I did it, I ended up cutting out
the cross bar
since the bus had been rearended and needed a new one.  This made it alot
easier.  I was
also inside a garage on flat smooth cement and was well lit.  I can't
imagine doing the same
thing in a parking lot at midnight.  For something like that I would ask and
friend to help
and offer them dinner or something for helping.

I would hate to see you, your bus or your engine harmed in anyway.  I don't
know where you live
but I personally would be willing to help if you live near me.  Imp in Salt
Lake City, UT.
