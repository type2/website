Subject: Re: [T2] oil change question

Hello WHOever      I would keep the same type and brand of oil  If you dont 
know then change it and stick with that. There use to be some problems with 
certain oils mixing that would gunk up the engine. Don't know if that is still 
true but I wouldn't risk it  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
