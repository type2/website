Todd,

I don't either, tho PB blaster would probably be fine, as it has an oil
base.  It might swell the gasket a bit over time would be my only worry.
I DON'T USE ARMORALL AT ALL and highly recommend that you don't either!
It is alcohol-based and will dry the seal or any other rubber/plastic bit
unless you constantly retreat.  It's like heroin for plastic!

I have actually done more windshields than I can count and figure this one
to be a doddle, but posted to give anyone who wanted to watch it done an
opportunity to do so.  And there is the extra, added incentive of beer as
well :-)
