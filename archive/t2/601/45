Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Cable - hints??

Hello Barry   First check the clevis pin and lever arm at the front of the 
cable. I have seen these break and /or wear out . If they are OK then remove the 
adjusting nut and bowden tube to inspect the cable. this is where it will 
usually break or come apart.  IT could also be the pressure plate.   later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing
