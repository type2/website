Bill, you can adapt a Beetle towbar to a Bus without doing any damage to the towbar. Michael Benthin sent me these pictures of his setup so take a look at them. http://mypage.iusb.edu/~kahlgrim/latebustowbar.jpg 

Besides having a Beetle towbar I also have one someone made and gave to me. Using the same principle as the Beetle towbar setup I made my own. You can view that at http://mypage.iusb.edu/~kahlgrim/77bus 

If you have any questions let me know. I bought my steel square tubing at Menards. It was a six foot piece that I cut in half. I bought the axle u-bolts at Tractor Supply along with the other square u-bolts at the towhooks. I have less then $25.00 in the metal and bolts. If I could of found sign posts I probably would have used them but the square tubing I think does have some advantages.
