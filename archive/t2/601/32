Subject: rust treatment

 I refinished my '71 bus wheels by removing the rust with a product I bought 
at 
the local car paint store.  It is "Metalprep 79".  It is a blue watery liquid 
that
has phosporic acid as main ingredient. I bought a gallon for around $20. This 
stuff
is great for removing rust. My wheels were covered with surface rust with none
of the original paint color showing.  In just a few minutes I was down to bare
steel ready for repaint.  There is a little work involved but not much. Pour 
a cup
or two of the solution into a plastic dish, get a wad of #1 medium steel 
wool, dip 
it into the solution and start wiping the wheel. Keep wiping, keeping the 
wheel
wet with the solution. In just a few minutes the rust seems to dissolve and 
you are
down to clean steel.  You don't have to scrub hard, just steady firm wiping. 
When clean, hose off and wipe dry.  I then put masked off the tire with 
masking tape
and newspaper and spray painted the wheels using Plasti-kote Steel Wheel paint
that I bought at Pep Boys. They turned out great, look like new.
   That Metalprep 79 works good on any part that needs the rust removed. The 
good thing is that it works fast. I was able to derust and paint all 4 wheels 
on a Saturday
with no problem..........
