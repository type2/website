Subject: Re: [T2] seat cover install

   I few years ago I recovered the bucket seats on my '69 MG-C. The 
instructions
suggested draping saran wrap over the seat back, and spraying a little 
silicone
spray on the saran wrap. I did this and it worked great. The covers slid on 
quite
easily.  It might work on your seats also..........
