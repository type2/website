Subject: sleeping in a Bay Bus

Hi,

Anyone tell me what is a good way to improve the matress situation in the
bus???

One of the problems we have is that for some reason our backs hurt after
sleeping in the bus.

An air matress would be a bit big for up top. Any thoughts on what people
do??

Also, my 1978 has clips on the window posts and the behind the seats for
something. I suspect a childs cot. Any thoughts on where I can get one?? My 6
year old could sleep nicely up there.

Cheers,

Alan
