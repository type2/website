just use a chain and a couple of hooks or clamps to tie it off with.
you need around 10' i think to do it comfortably.

jack the engine/tranny  up a little after you unbolt the rear support bar.
slide under and loop the chain over one side of the frame. there is a
convenient spot on each side. loop the chain on the other side and fasten
it tight against the tranny.
you will have a mobile bus you can push around with the engine out.
you dont want too much slack because it is easier if the tranny is held
about level with where you want it when you reinstall.
its not that important because you can adjust it once the engine is out.
