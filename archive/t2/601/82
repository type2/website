"When I want to open my rear folding bed, I put the table leg in the spare
tire compartment behind the driver seat, and lay the table top vertical
behind the passenger seat".

Yes I actually have two of the, original to my bus, front dash tables. I
have the second one mounted on the cabinet door, using some original dash
cleats and an original table socket for the leg on the floor. This allows me
to have a table even when the z-bed is pulled out. Here is a pic before I
bolted the "socket" to the floor (I had to do this to keep the leg
vertical):

I had some plaid bags sewn up to store them both in when on the road. This
table is nice, but is kind of small. We like to play board games and such
and it would be nice to start taking the large table again.

Thanks for the advice! My spare tire cabinet actually holds my third
battery, etc., so I am still thinking of a good place to put the large table
leg when camping if anyone has any more suggestions.
