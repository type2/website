Thanks, Karl,

My Westy's supplementary camper manual (page 12) says, "Bear in mind 
that in addition to the normal vehicle electricity used for lights, 
ignition radio, etc.," (which clearly refers to the main vehicle 
battery), "your battery also feeds the interior light over the sink, the 
refrigerator, water pump, control lights in the sink cabinet, and any 
appliance plugged into the plug on the dashboard."

So I am confused. The manual refers to one single battery. Perhaps I do 
not have a deluxe Westy? How can one tell? And if this is not a deluxe, 
perhaps the space under the driver's seat is empty.

(I would look except that the Westy is at an upholsterer's getting new 
covers on the seats and mattress pads.
