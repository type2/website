One of our favorite bus trips is over to Kansas City where we are members of
the Kansas City Live Steamers club.  On the second saturday of each month
they have a free public ride day and usually haul close to 1,000 people.  It
is a lot of fun to see all the kids big and small enjoying riding the
trains.  We get a lot of compliments on the bus too.

One of my dreams is to finish our '63 double cab and haul an engine and
riding car around the country visiting both railroads and VW shows, that
would be a perfect trip!!!!!!!
