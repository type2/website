Subject: Did Westfalia do Hightops?

Hi Gang,

I've been looking at Hightop campers lately, and just saw an
interesting one on TheSamba.  Looks like an Adventurewagen hightop,
but the interior is obviously early 70's Westfalia.  Did Westfalia
dabble in hightops?  Here is the link if your interested:

Thanks.
