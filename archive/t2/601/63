Subject: Wanted: 73 Auto transmission in Southern Ontario.

Hi Volks,

Dave Ireland has had a problem with his bus this past weekend and is 
looking for a 73 auto tranny... His TC and flex plate are fine, he 
needs a new/used final drive section. If anyone has any leads, please 
email  daveireland(-at-)sympatico.ca.

Dave is located in the Kitchener/Waterloo area but anything within a 
couple hours drive would be considered worth looking into.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
