Mark,

The DIY fuel injection folks would say yes.  The plenum volume
"should" be the same size as the engine displacement.

You can also "tune" for a particular rpm range by the length of the runner 
intakes and the size of the plenum....there are big books on this that 
come with math formulas to choose what you want...

Go here http://www.dune-buggy.com/turbo/intake.htm

look at the pics and read the text....you are probably better off leaving 
it alone....just my opinion...<grin>



Cheers, dave
