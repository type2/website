Subject: How Much Time?

Hello,

I about to remove my engine and tranny for the following reason:

1. I need to replace the shift rod bushing's
2. Fix a leaking gear shift housing

My question is how long should it take to remove a tranny and engine. I am 
trying to budget my time? I have removed engines lots of times and it takes 
me about 2 to 3 hours on my own. I have never removed a tranny.

Thanks, Phil

72 Westy.
