Subject: Windshield replacement in N. Virginia

Volks,

I broke my windshield and will be installing a replacement tomorrow here
in Alexandria, Virginia.  If anyone in/near Alexandria is interested in
watching/helping, they would be welcome!  E-mail me for directions to my
place.  I am thinkng this will happen at ~ noon and will take about an
hour.
