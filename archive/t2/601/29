Well, you won't get more power, or necessarily better handling. The fact
that the tires are newer, and if you get nicer compounds you'll have better
handling. Larger tires effectively gives you a higher gear ratio (or lower,
or whatever the proper term is). It basically means that your top-speed will
be increased. It will take LESS engine RPMS to maintain a speed that you
were currently at.

It will however give you slower acceleration. Higher top-speed, for slower
acceleration.

This is rather nice though because it will improve your fuel economy, and
give you better high-way cruising speeds.

One of the other side effects is that it will increase the height of your
bus, which can hurt the handling, and increase the chances of it tipping
over under emergency maneuvers.

If you get wider and taller tires, that'll help the handling, but it may
reduce your fuel economy (or keep it unchanged) due to the increase drag
from teh road.
