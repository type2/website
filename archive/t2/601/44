Subject: Clutch Cable - hints??

On a '76 4 speed, air conditioned, Claifornia Westy deluxe:

I pushed the clutch pedal down and heard a light 'crack' sound from the 
clutch pedal area.  Then the '76 did not shift as smothly as before.  I 
expect as issue with the clutch cable.  Everything goes into gear, but 
better on 3 & 4 than 1 & 2.

I read Hayes and Bentley, and it seems that work on the clutch cable is 
relatively straight forward (adjusting or R&R), but are there any 
stories/experiences that I should be aware of before I go under the Wesy?

I mention that it is a DPD air conditioned Westy with the big, flat air 
conditioner thing under the belly, and a California model. so there might be 
differences somewhere (the tube encasing the clutch cable is probably in A-1 
shape, being from California and North Carolina.  I pulled the front splash 
pan two months ago and inspected and greased accordingly.  I did not notice 
anything on the clutch pedal area.)

I mention 'Deluxe' becaue of the propane tank (on the opposite side) but the 
gas lines go over to the driver side for the furnace.

Any unusual experiences by the list in working on the clutch cable?  I know 
the basics, I am just looking for horror stories I should watch out for...

Clutch is probably good.
