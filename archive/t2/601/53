Subject: parts for sale

I was not able to go to HCBF, so would like to offer a few parts for sale.
 
Oil Bath air filter and connector tube - $45
Leveler pads (over engine compartment) original vinyl, no tears - $50
Sink/Cooler - fair condition, with water reservoir - $35
VW logo gas cap -$12
71 glove box owners manual -$20
1600 upright alternator stand and oil intake - $15
71 Bumper (rear) -$25
Voltage regulator and connetor wires, used -$10
Front grill and screen - $20
 
I'm in western NC, and can't ship the sink/cooler or pads. Those would have to be picked up. Other prices do not include the cost of shipping. Anyone who would be interested in everything would get a substantial discount for the lot. Contact me at vwbaybus(-at-)yahoo.com .
