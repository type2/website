Subject: Key problem

Amigos,

My wife is towing my 75 Westy back to Texas and I was getting it ready, when I
lost the dang keys.

Somewhere between 8 am this morning when I was unloading her and 6 pm this
evening the keys got very lost.

Here's the question. Presuming I can find a way to get into the bus. Is there
any safe way to disable the ignition key steering wheel interlock?

Let's put it this way, what IS the easiest way. It's going to cost $160 bucks
to have a locksmith solve the problem.

Thanks

Chuck Harvey
