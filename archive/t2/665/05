My mistake. The manual survey occurs at the top of the middle column
under Repair Manuals as follows:

My VW Technical Articles:

Temperature Sensor II 
DIY Fuel Tank Restoration 
Vacuum Hose Diagrams 
Fuel Hoses 
Windshield Washer System 
Bosch L-Jetronic Tester 
Repair Manuals 

Again, this is on:
