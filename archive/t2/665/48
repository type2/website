On my personal bus it was maybe two years ago, but I just bought
another one for another bus this summer.

When I needed the first one, I tried bus boys first, but they sold me
the wrong one (too small ID), so I had to take it back and they
recommended wolfgang. When I went over there and told Steve the
trouble I had, he acted like it was no big deal and they have them all
the time. IIRC this is an aftermarket item.

This item does not appear in their print catalog either, but the web
site and catalog do say to call if you don't see what you need.
