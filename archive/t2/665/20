Subject: Only getting 11.6 mpg.  Any suggestions?

Hello all -
 
Got my 81 Westy Vanagon back on the road.  It's running great, but seems to be eating the gas.  I'd like to figure this out, since it will one day be a daily driver, and I can't afford such poor gas mileage.  
 
A couple of things - 
 
It's a hybridized vehicle - originally CA emissions, but I had to replace the exhaust with a 49 state system.  I re-installed the oxygen sensor in the crossover pipe right before the catalytic converter.
 
My stock distributor pooped out, and my mechanic replaced it with an older unit that has points.
 
The 81 originally had both an oxygen sensor and an EGR filter.  The EGR filter was in pieces, and rusted almost to dust.  I have been unable to find a replacement.  After getting advice from a few people, I did away with the EGR filter.  I sealed up the opening on the top of the engine, and also sealed the opening on the crossover pipe where it should go.  
 
Finally, I have no thermostat or flaps.  The previous owner must have removed them.  I'm in NJ, and it's been around 50 degrees out.
 
The engine has been rebuilt, and I've been breaking it in gently.  Changed the oil and filter at 300 miles, and now am just over 400.
 
Again, the vehicle is running great - starting right up and all.  Do you think some or all of these are affecting my lousy gas mileage?  If so, which ones are the most serious and need to be addressed right away?
 
Thanks!
 
Marc
