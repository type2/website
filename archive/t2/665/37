Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door parts?????

David asked:


 Yesterday at lunch, my three year old daughter and I were sitting in 
the back eating lunch at Sonic and I noticed something I haven't for 
the 12 years I've owned the bus.  On the inside of the sliding door 
above the handle in front is a black bracket and to rear of the inside 
door is a protrusion that looks like it was a knob of some sort.  What 
did these components used to be?  Just really, really curious.  Can't 
believe I never questioned their  existence before!!  Oh the things I 
 discover......

Not sure what you are referring to about the 'black bracket' on the front. But on the rear, 
are you seeing a silver piece held on by 2 10mm headed bolts? 
If yes, does it have a square shaft with a threaded hole in it?
Or does it have a odd round metal piece held on with a phillips screw?

If it is a square shaft, then you are missing the 'helper' handle. This is a sliding door
handle that is the same as the front one.... but does NOT move.

If it is a odd shaped metal piece, then the 'helper' handle broke off and you are 
seeing the cast-in support piece of it.

Here is a pic of sliding door in the parts fische:

#15A is the silver bracket, #16 is the helper handle [same as the front one] BUT not movable.
Now if you are talking about #29 as being a black bracket, that is the lock mechanism
that holds the doors latched when it is all the way open.... keeps the door from sliding closed
when you are on a hill etc.
