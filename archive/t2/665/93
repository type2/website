You'll have to calibrate it to find out for sure.

It's hard to read FI plugs. All the plugs reading tips are from the carb
days when leaded fuel was available. Even the shut off and coast method is
not helpful.

IMHO you have to test every gauge before isntalling it otherwise you go from
guessing to further guessing. I don't know if they are consistently
accurate/inaccurate and everyone has a different engine which makes
compatison harder but check out how bad this VDO OT gauge performed:

I'm on the verge on a CHT measuring experiment. I'll have some data to share
to give you an idea of how the gauge should perform.
