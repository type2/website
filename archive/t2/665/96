I would like to amplify the answer to the first question, will the crank
from a 1.8l engine fit into the 2.0 case, and the answer is an emphatic YES.
All cranks use the same main bearings, so they all fit into the case and use
the same main bearings.

In order to use the 1.8l bottom end, you need all of it. The pistons are not
interchangeable, 1.7/1.8 have a different piston pin height than 2.0. You
need the 1.7/1.8 rods and pistons also. The 2.0 heads will "fit" on the 1.8
cylinders, yes the quotes are intentional, but take care to measure your
compression ratio because it will change when you mix and match like this.
And "fit" is a relative term in this instance.
