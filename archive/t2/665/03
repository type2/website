Sorry I didn't respond sooner, but I suggest if you go with the 2.0 motor, 
it would be best to salvage a complete FI system from one of those years. 
Even among the stock 2.0 systems, there are at least 4 permutations of 
throttle switch setups among them, 5 or more ECU's and several AFM's, so 
you must match that throttle body and the AFM that go with that unique 
harness and ECU. So, if you need to look far and wide, try Campbell-Nelson 
in Lynwood, WA, used parts division. They break a bunch of VW's and surely 
have a stock of stock Bus/Van systems. They also break more Porsches than 
anyone else in the Seattle Metro area. Bet they have some of those if you 
want. The key to the Bus 2.0 is using the properly matched throttle body & 
switch/s, AFM, ECU and harness. California will have oxy feedback so the 
exhaust parts differ as well.

If I was you, I would use the later model 78-79 2.0 setup with both oxy 
feedback and electronic ignition. Very clean running all the time with 
simple maintenance. Also very easy to set CO precisely using open loop feed 
from the oxy, then verify response in closed loop, all with a quality VOM 
capable of 0.02 v tolerance.

Note also on valve lash. Even with hyd lifters, they should be reset after 
break in, and at something like 30 to 50k, 5 year intervals. Never checking 
this till the engine pukes don't sound prudent to my pocketbook. Even low 
rates of wear add up over time so prudent to reverify valve initial setting 
as a matter of ruling out non-spec tolerances.

If you salvage a stock system complete you at least can verify all the 
parts correct for that one setup and rule out a mix and match mishap.
