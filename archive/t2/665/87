I got into the bus this morning to find the little yellow (amber?) lens gone
from the parking brake indicator. :O(

It fell out once before, but I found it on the floor later. Haven't found
it yet.

Is there a source for replacements? Other than the bone yard.

Actually, it was originally red! The sun kills the color.

The lens is not available separately. It is part of the assembly. Should be the same as
a late Super beetle, since it is part # 113 919 233B. I will keep an eye out for one at the yards.
