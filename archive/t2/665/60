I was living in the mountains with no 'puter when I needed mine back in January.  I took a 
wander through the plumbing and heating sections of Ace Hardware and found something 
(damned if I can remember *what* now, but something) that's been doing great ever since.

The other choice would have been an hour each way over the mountain to Redding to hit 
up Bus Boys and/or Wolfgang .. but with two feet of snow on Buckhorn and a low-slung 
Cabrio it just wasn't going to happen.  Bus was dead..
