Subject: crankshaft interchangability?

Good day all,
I've searched the archives on this one with no luck...will a 1.8L motor's 66
mm stroke crankshaft fit in a 2.0 Vanagon engine case (for fitting in to an
automatic transmission without modification)?  I have an automatic Vanagon
Westy with a case knock and am weighing my options for repairs.  I have a
the 1800 crank/rods handy and the top-end of the Vanagon engine is good.
I'm considering splitting the Vanagon case and swapping out the cranks and
rods if this is possible...

Any advice appreciated!
