Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on CD ROM

I went through the Bentley website, and it appears that what I'm wanting 
is this:

http://www.bentleypublishers.com/product.htm?code=vfac

--if I'm just interested in bay windows buses. Can anybody confirm this?
Also, I wasn't able to find the printed equivalents page on Richard's 
website. Can anybody point me to an URL?

Thanks,
John Tracy
