This article has some guidelines on acceptable readings for your CHT:

http://www.germansupply.com/xcart/customer/home.php?gspage=customer/main/tech/cht/cht_install_4.tpl

This looks like you are within their suggestions since you are in the
400-425 range suggested for a bus.

For a second opinion, Fisher pp 89-90 has the following information
published by Chevrolet regarding Corvair head temps:

200-300 Idle
350-475 Cruise 30-60 mph
460-575 3-5K RPM full throttle

The Corvair head temp warning light comes on at 575 degrees.

I will be curious to see what responses you get on oil pressure
because my bus behaves similalry to yours, but the spec on the oil
pressure relief spring is 28 pounds.

 Now, on to those blasted readings.  OP I guess I can live with, but it
 seems high.  The engine has about 20k on it (reman. by VW Canada).  Oil
 is Mobil 1 10w30 synthetic.  Cold start gives a reading around 55-60psi
 at 30 degrees.  Warm running hangs around 50, warm idle 40 in cold (30
 degree)  weather.  It dropped to 30 at idle after a hard highway run on
 a 50 degree day, and that's the lowest I've seen it.  Are these high
 enough to be worrisome, or is my engine just that spectacular?  Ha!
 
 The CHT is the gauge giving me fits.  I understand the cold junction
 temp problem, but I'm still running awfully hot by the gauge.  I went
 fishing yesterday during a local heat wave (45-50 degrees F).  Here are
 my readings with rough temp adjustment (~-25 degrees).

 ---------------------------                  ------     -------------
 Idle after initial warmup            340   /  315

 mild hill at 60-65                       475-500  /  450-475
 
 Either the gauge is off 50 degrees or more, even after the temp
 compensation, or my engine should already be toast right?  I've driven
 it a lot harder than this through the Cascades without a gauge and
 shudder to think what the readings would have been.  The engine runs
 very strong, has a working thermostat, and shows no other signs of
 running too hot.  I don't have the equipment to check precisely, but
 the plugs don't show lean running, fuel mileage is about right (~18mpg
 driving hard).  There are no other signs of overheating (I can grab the
 dipstick, OP is fine).  I don't know.  I'd like to blame the gauge and,
 in hindsight, should have tested it in frying oil.  It behaves
 suspiciously, though.  For instance, it hits 200 (~170 actual) within
 30 seconds after startup on a cool day and is at 350 (~320) after about
 a minute and a half).  It's sitting there now at slightly over 100
 degrees, cold engine, 30 degree night.  In other words, it thinks its
 about 80 out.
 
 Seals are in place, etc, etc.  Something that might help me is knowing
 the trends of other FI busses with CHTs.  That is, what's the range you
 see from idle to around town to easy highway to hard highway?  This bus
 is getting frustrating, and I haven't even had a serious electrical
 problem yet (discounting my instrument light goof)!  I knew the gauges
 would bring worry, but I hope in the end they pay off.
