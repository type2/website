Don,

I was looking at the pages on your project web site, and thinking about 
your shoulder and the $20 to your name, and wondering how in the world 
you ever got into this mess. This bus is a rich man's project.

I'm thinking that you may still be better off putting a halt to this 
project and getting a different bus, painful and wrenching as that may 
be.

Mark
