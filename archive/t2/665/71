Subject: Re: [T2] instrument panel lights

From Joseph:

For the curious, I was probing with the multimeter through the radio 
hole--trying to find the instrument lighting lead for the new 
gauges--when I found out that the radio hole is rimmed with steel.  
Duh.  Bulbs went down bravely, saving a 10 cent fuse.  Ha!

ALL 5 bulbs in the cluster light string burned out at once?!?

Does not sound like it could happen. Are you sure you have power to the sockets?
Or did you actually loose the resister in the headlight switch?
