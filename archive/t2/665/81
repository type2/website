Subject: Parking brake indicator lens

I got into the bus this morning to find the little yellow (amber?) lens gone
from the parking brake indicator. :O(

It fell out once before, but I found it on the floor later.  Haven't found
it yet.

Is there a source for replacements?  Other than the bone yard.

And I know.  Had I repro'ed it when I got the bus, I wouldn't need another
one...
