This modification will turn your 2.0 engine into a 1.8 engine. VW made
the 2.0 motor by offset machining the 1.8 crank to increase stroke to
give the added displacement. Consequently the rod journals on the 2.0
are smaller. If you use the 1.8 crank with the 1.8 rods you should be
okay. If there are other issues with deck height due to piston pin
position, others will have to add in here. A starting point for
reading is here:

 I've searched the archives on this one with no luck...will a 1.8L motor's 66
 mm stroke crankshaft fit in a 2.0 Vanagon engine case (for fitting in to an
 automatic transmission without modification)?  I have an automatic Vanagon
 Westy with a case knock and am weighing my options for repairs.  I have a
 the 1800 crank/rods handy and the top-end of the Vanagon engine is good.
 I'm considering splitting the Vanagon case and swapping out the cranks and
 rods if this is possible...
