By "filled in" do you mean that the circle and letter should be solid white
and not just outlined?  If this is a repro it might be a product of the
manufacturing process.  It's easier to hit just the raised edge of something
with paint than to carefully fill in the entire thing by hand.

I can't remember how mine was painted.
