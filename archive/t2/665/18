Suggestion:  Don't do it.
     
Warning, you are heading into a mine-field.  Sir, for
the cheapest & most dependable conversion, I would
recommend either you re-use the 1800 FI parts on a
purchased 1.8, or get a 2.0 of late '77 to '79
vintage, AS AN ENTIRE PACKAGE.  FI, Distributor, and
exhaust parts.  Why?  Their specs changed swiftly
between '75 to '83.  I have a '78.  But I can't use
'79 heads or '79 exhaust.  Nor can I use '77 heads or
'77 exhaust.  '79 head exhaust ports are square, not
oval as on my '78, and the '79's had the oxy/Lambda
sensor system my '78 federal did not have.  To
continue, my '78 can't use most of the parts from a
1.8 except the aux air valve, injectors, cold start
(5th inj.), thermo-time, and a couple of other minor
parts.  My Air Flow Sensor, although the same as on a
'79 Federal, has 7 electrical contacts and a
integrated air temperature sensor a '76 AFS did not
have.  My '78 Federal did not use a Catalytic
converter.  Most of the FI California models did.  One
of the few upgrades I made from stock was to install
an 009 distributor with AccuFire Eletronic Ignition. 
But I believe a '79 came with Elec ignition from the
factory.  And then there is the Engine wiring harness.
 It must match everything else.  The Throttle body
changed in '76 to exclude a switch.  On, and on, and
on.  Caution.
   
The ECU (AKA Brain) and Thermo-time switch differed
between Manual and Automatic Transmissions between the
various years.
     
Your original question was related to installing
hydraulic lifters into an earlier model motor.  I have
no definitive answer here.  But with the pitfalls in
FI components, exhaust components, distributor types,
ECU (AKA Brain), I would recommend you not take the
chance.  Err on the side of dependability and "stock
config."  Whatever you end-up with, try to keep all of
the parts together and of the same vintage.
