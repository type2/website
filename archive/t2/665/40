Truer words were never spoken! The battery and the cables are the heart of
the tinman. Without them, you end up with wierd friends searching for help
through the haunted forest. Just watch out for them flying monkeys! :-)

 

New cables are the cheapest fix you'll ever find. After that you get the
awesome color wiring schematics from the Type2 library, (if memory serves me
correctly) and you print them out in color. Then you take each one and trace
it with your multimeter for continuity to each electrical component. If you
have a battery drain, you take off the neg terminal of the battery, put your
mulitmeter in between the terminal and the battery post, set to the 10 amp
setting initially to see IF you have a drain. You then pull each fuse one at
a time until the multimeter says, "Hey!! The drain stopped!" Bingo, you have
discovered the evil doer circuit, and can act suitably by tracing the
problem. 

 

Go ahead, ask me how I know? Cause I have 2 VW bugs that just beg to be
diagnosed at least once every few years as I add CD players, or
instrumentation. The bugs are 35 years old, hell, some of you guys on this
list are mere puppies compared to those cars.

Above all have fun, it's a hobby. If you want reliability, (and you can, I
ve gotten 10's of thousands of miles on my Bugs and Buses all over North
America), you either put in the time, or buy a Toyota Corolla. :-)

 

Regards,

Courtney

Folks(and I'm not picking on Don or Jason here either).

 

It seems like half of the posts lately have been dealing with electrical

and battery issues....we got folks that are ready to suicide and sell

their buses cause they can't get the wiring and electrical issues

resolved.

 

My *personal* opinion and experience is to make the electrical system

*as new* before almost anything else. You may have a fresh engine with

500hp, but if you can't get it started, then what's the point?

 

Total outlay if you have a new/good battery might be $50 for new primary

battery cables and some sandpaper or wire wheel for your dremel.

 

Make those 30 year old battery cables *new* they've done their job for a

long time, so tossem and start over....and *don't* buy the leaded

connector ones...buy the ones that look like the ones in your newer car.

While I like to keep my bus "vintage", it doesn't mean I can't upgrade

critical components that are a "better idea" and just plain work better.

 

Get the $1 little green and red felt "anti corrosion" pads that go under

the battery...every one has them in the battery section and *they work*.

 

Look...no *really* look at the ground wires everywhere...green colored

around the spade lug?...can't see shiny copper?

Get *good* new spade lugs and the proper tool and change them out...you

might cut 1/4" off the wire...ya still got plenty of wire and you have a

NEW uncoroded connection(after you wire brush or sandpaper the ground lug).

 

Bought a new battery?...Don't put it in till you charge it

overnight....most batteries *really* need a good charge before you put

them in service....and the manufacturer will tell you the same.

 

Do it! Do it now!<grin>

 

-end of rant-

 

Cheers, dave
