Subject: FW: [T2] Where to wire Stereo power?

In 1988 I payed an installer to install my radio into my bus.  In 1991 I
removed that unit and replaced it with one I liked better.  The installer
had chosen to run the power for the head unit off of the headlight switch
instead of the fusebox.  It worked fine since my headlights don't fully
light unless the key is turned inside the ignition.  I have no idea if this
was too large a load for that switch or not,.. but it worked great 15 years
ago.  I think that if I wanted to replace a radio in my bus that I would
definately run it to the fuse box,.. which terminal I have not yet decided.
