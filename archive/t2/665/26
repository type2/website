Subject: Fuel hose size

Yes, I'M asking a fuel hose question. :-)

On this 72 bus the outlet for the tank is 5mm but the inlet for the pump
takes a larger hose:

This pump isn't original but even so I'm wondering how a single hose was
adapted to secure the fuel line without resorting to using a smaller hose
clamp at the fuel tank. Anyone remember?
