Subject: Genuine Hella Tail Lenses on Sale - Housings being

Just a quick note that I have obtained a small quantity of genuine Hella
'72-79 tail lenses at half price - $16.95 each.  These are superior to the
Indian or Brazilian aftermarket ones usually found for about this price.
Normally I don't carry the Hellas, because at close to $35 just for a tail
lens it's hardly a bargain. But for this price it's worth grabbing a pair
while you can, if yours are starting to deteriorate.

On a related note, Hella has now discontinued the complete taillight
assemblies for '72-79.  This is very unfortunate news, since, as Richard
Atwell has noted, they are far superior to the repro.  I have a few sets on
hand, and more coming in two weeks, but as far as I know this next shipment
will be my last. These include lenses as well.
