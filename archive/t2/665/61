Subject: Behr AC Help

Hi, I'm new to the list and couldn't much help on this topic elsewhere. I 
have a 1980 Vanagon that has an aftermarket Behr AC system in it (I believe 
this came with the van when purchased as new as a dealer option). After 
messing with it and having mechanically inclined friends inspect it we 
realized the unit is intact and working fine, but there is no compressor. 
Does anyone have a Behr AC system and know what type of compressor is used? 
Is it possible that I could buy a compressor from another type of AC unit 
and use it on my van? Any help about these Behr AC units is much 
appreciated.

Thanks,
Kellen
