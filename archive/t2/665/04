That depends what year bus you have. If you have a 75-79 bus, the
product you are looking at is somewhat of a misnomer because the fuel
system and perhaps other sections do not cover 75-79, so you will need
the Type 2 75-79 CD for this coverage.

Richard's survery of manuals appears about halfway down the center
column of his website with this text:

Manuals:
VWoA Service Publications

 Also, I wasn't able to find the printed equivalents page on Richard's
