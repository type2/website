Subject: instrument panel lights

I need to replace...ahem...all of my instrument panel light bulbs.  Is 
this something that the FLAPS might actually have or am I wasting my 
time?  VW dealer?  BD at (gasp!) $4.75 a pop?

For the curious, I was probing with the multimeter through the radio 
hole--trying to find the instrument lighting lead for the new 
gauges--when I found out that the radio hole is rimmed with steel.  
Duh.  Bulbs went down bravely, saving a 10 cent fuse.  Ha!

More on the gauges in a moment...
