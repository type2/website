I myself was confused over the same issue. When I was having to spend
so much time with customer support with these CD's, I found myself
looking at the two and asking myself why I bought the Type 2 1975 to
1979 CD when the other one says it includes Type 2 1969-1979.

I haven't done much looking to compare the two CD's, but one thing I
have found for sure is that on the CD labelled Types 1, 2, 3, 4
1969-1979, when you look at the Contents page, it shows Fuel System
Type 2 1969-1979. But when you click on that, it takes you to another
menu that says Fuel System Type 2 1969-1974. When you click on that,
all the fuel system information is about carburetors, so there is no
infomation at all on fuel injection on this CD. So you have to have
the 1975-1979 CD for this information. I don't know how much other
overlap there is between the other subsystems on these two CD's.
