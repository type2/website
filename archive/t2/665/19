Mark,

Gauge the caliper against some drill bits and a micrometer.

I think you might be pleasantly surprised.  A friend of mine bought one of 
the Chinese digital ones on a lark and said it was as good as his $200 
Mitsutoyo(sp?).

I have a couple of expensive Sterret micrometers and everything I have 
measured with them and compared to the cheap caliper matched.

YMMV of course<grin>.

Cheers, dave
