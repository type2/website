OK, I was being hyperbolic.  I lost the fuel gauge cluster and speedo 
light.  The one by the levers was already blown.  The hazard light 
switch and the new gauges are still lit on the same circuit, so I don't 
think it could be the switch (they were unhooked when I had my probe 
"accident").  What's the 5th?  Rear defogger?  Never has been lit.

There is 12v to the sockets.  I pulled one bulb and the filament is 
broken.  The resistor works like all the dimmers I've ever had.  Two 
settings: bright and flicker.

thanks,
joe
