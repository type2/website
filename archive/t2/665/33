Don,

I might suggest that your starter has picked this particular time to go 
south....waaaaay south.

OR!  one of your battery cables/connections to the starter has decided
that it's time to give up the ghost.

If your battery will turn over the Volvo, then put the battery back in the 
bus and start tracing and checking the main primary wires....(with battery 
disconnected of course).

Hi speed clicking always means that either the battery is pretty dead, or 
the starter is not getting all the juice it needs, or the starter is 
toast....you pick one.


Pull all of them off of the starter and get serious with fine sandpaper.

Same with grounds.  You been around awhile, you know the drill....

Double check the big wires for broken strands, corroded terminals and 
connectors...etc.


Once that is done, then *make sure* bus is in neutral, crawl underneath
and short the starter to see if it turns the engine...leave everything 
else just like it was before and work from there.

The object is to make the starter work consistently and reliably whether 
anything else is hooked up or not.

Cheers, dave
