Mark, I totally agree!!

About the only use for that cot bed is when one or two people are camping, 
and you want to get a whole bunch of junk off the floor, like back packs, 
coolers, sleeping bags, wet clothing, loose food, extra shoes, maps, and all 
the little things that add up to an inconvenience when you want to move 
around inside the vw.
