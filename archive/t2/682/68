>>incident to take-out my T2, what is it worth?

	Well, in October of 2002 I was rear ended in my '78 Transporter.  My
insurance company at the time thought it was worth totaling and so went
about the task of claiming the value.  I believe their original estimate was
somewhere just north of $1,300.00.  However, I was able to supply them with
receipts showing another grand worth of engine rebuilding costs.  They took
that info, added it to their estimate and wrote a check.  It all seemed to
easy since they never asked for actual copies of the engine rebuild receipts
etc.  So all in all they came up with roughly $2,300.00.  Although, I don't
think much thought went into it on their part.
	All this talk about insurance companies etc in the past few days has
me somewhat concerned though.  Do I drop our current coverage in favor of a
company that specializes in vintage vehicles or do I stay where I am at and
worry about the repercussions after a possible accident.  It seems like are
good and bad to both sides.

Good luck
