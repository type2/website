The cost factor is the real reason we chose VW. The multiplying
features of modern cars means more to break and fix. Plus the
disposable philosophy of the current industry doesn't help. The VW
culture was a welcome side benefit of our economic decision.

When major problems crop up they can really throw you as you hunt down hard to find parts and labor over PO abuses. I've tried using exaggeration to speed along repairs but it only seems to work for posting messages.

Well, that's a point, but I think all vehicle repairs have this factor.

You have certainly taken what you've acquired and passed it on for
all, myself included, to benefit from.
