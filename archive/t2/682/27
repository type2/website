Subject: Re: [T2] Twisted frame??

The bus uses unibody construction. "Frame" damage still looks the
same. The difference is in the repair.

For example, if a bug had the same thing happen to it, the pan would
be bent. Unbolt the body, straighten the pan, bolt back up. With a
bus, however, things have to be cut and welded.

I worked in a Toyota body shop many moons ago and they had a frame
rack. Many gears and bars and doohickies for precision realignment of
unibody vehicles. Tack welds were broken loose, panels realigned, and
then re-welded.

It can be done, but it's not a simple or inexpensive procedure. The
shop's adjuster WILL try to total the bus.
