Subject: [T2] Vintage Vehicle Valuation & Appraisals

I belive this is a new discussion thread.  Hearing of
the "bent frame" incident has me thinking.  Were an
incident to take-out my T2, what is it worth?
   
I've spent a lot of $$ on my T2.  But, what is the
value of my vehicle?  Were my T2 to be totally
destroyed tomorrow, are we at the whim of Insurance
Adjusters?  As far as my Insurance company is
concerned, that "total" figure is $500 to $1000.  I
know.  I asked.  My agent has already warned me to
have the vehicle appraised when the refurb is
finished, to protect it's value; to protect my
investment.  Separately, I think some of us have heard
horror stories from Vintage Vehicle owners, recounting
the unrealisticly low Insurance Settlement offers
after "totalling" accidents.
   
In the next year or 2, (I presume) my T2 will be able
to sell for a high 4-digit figure, maybe even a low 5
digit figure.  It is my intention to get its value in
that "high range."  I don't want to sell my T2, but I
do wish to know its value, and to protect my
investment.  But from an Insurance standpoint, T2
members, please validate the comment from my agent
that I must protect my investment, by having the
Vintage Vehicle appraised, and then insured for that
value.  
   
Any insights?  Not looking for legal advice here, just
down-to-earth facts on a topic I have awareness of,
but zero experience with.
