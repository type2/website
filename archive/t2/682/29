Unfortunately, I have had to use AAA several times. Only twice for my bus,
before I knew much about it, but 3 times for my raggedy old Jeep when I
first got it. I've always been picked up within an hour, and have gotten a
few extra free miles out of them, above the 100 mile limit, a couple
times, mainly from chatting with the friendly driver. One time, my jeep
broke down late a t night, and I had it towed to my parents house, hich
was about 90 miles away. The next day in daylight, I fixed it (wiring
problem) and headed out...about 20 miles later it died again ( really
nasty wiring), so they towed it another 120 miles back to my house...and
it was only $0.50/mile for the over 100 limit. I have also gotten tons of
free maps and travel information from them, had them come out to jumpstart
dead batteries, help change a tire by the road when the #&*^$%(-at-) lug nuts
were too tight to get off with a standard lugwrench, and had them unlock a
locked car...
I'm thrilled to have them...I'd hate to break down in the middle of
nowhere and have to try to find a tow truck without a phone book or clue
as to who was good/trustworthy/etc...AAA card is always in my wallet...

Just offering that different perspective...
