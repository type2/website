Unless he also adds a relay in the starter circuit that's
activated by the current from the ignition switch, and
routes the current from the battery directly to the starter.
My 1966, 6 Volt Bug had this.  Worked like a charm (until 
the relay died, which caused a funny little expedition 
through the car's electrical system because I had no idea
the relay was there and thus checked everything else ...).
