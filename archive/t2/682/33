Subject: Re: [T2]Advance auto Parts

That seal you've found is a Beck Arnley. They seem to repackage some parts for resale - at least I have seen that happen before. They are an import parts distributor. FWIW I have never had any problems with a Beck Arnley part. Seem to be pretty good stuff. 

I buy their parts for my VW Cabrio from Napa, I have an oil pan gasket to install next oil change. 

I used to work at Advance Auto Parts and seldom set foot in the place anymore! <grin!> Their Beck Arnley parts are just as good (same parts) but I would not touch Advance's electrical stuff unless it was a Beck Arnley. 

I am voting with my dollar where Advance is concerned. At the time I worked there they were the world's worst for hiring young folks that didn't know a spark plug from a fan belt and you had to be careful about the parts you bought (name brands were okay) b/c they were just cheap. Chinese brakes rotors that were thinner than the OEM 250K mile rotor a customer brought in...
