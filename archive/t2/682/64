to buy you off, oh and the blue book is not accurate for older vehicles,
check the "Green" book for accurate value on older vehicles,  I found a
copy at my library when I needed one.

sorry for the turkeys that have broken your bus, make em fix it right.

Depending on your situation...Available space, your own expertise at
mechanical repairs, etc, etc, ...It "might" be worth it to take the re-
pair money (and it should be something close to the value of the Bus)
and use it to transfer the best parts of your Bus to another shell.
A vehicle that twisted can be repaired, but will probably never be
"the same" as an original. Something to think about and maybe dis-
cuss with your insurance agent before signing off anything for re-
pairs...
