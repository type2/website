 pretty outrageous.

Our 82 Westy broke down on the way from our wedding to our reception 3
years ago. The 180 mile tow was covered 100 miles by my wife's AAA,
and the 80 miles at $3 per mile.

 take care of your towing needs in cash.

That's always been my policy, so we dropped it when we got married.
Though I've been reconsidering after going exclusively air cooled vw,
with the long trip to BBB alone this weekend getting me thinking about
it again.

 you'll be at the bottom of the list when you call for a tow, *and* you won't
 get left stranded in the middle of the night by someone who couldn't care one
 iota less sitting in a call center somewhere thousands of miles away.
 (Anyone with an "AAA showed up in 10 minutes and towed me 150 miles for free
 even though they didn't have to" story, speak up now!)

I think it depends on the contracting tow station. Ours was fast. But
when I told the driver the owner's manual called for it to be towed on
a car carrier,  he said it would move it to the front wheels when he
got off the freeway. When I got home I found the odometer rolled back
180 miles.

Thanks for reminding me not to get AAA! I need to think ahead and
print out AIRS before I travel....
