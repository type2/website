There's an aspect of this thread that I am not tracking. Everything 
that's being said makes sense if you are driving your bus, and you're 
at fault (or if coverage for uninsured motorists kicks in). But what if 
you are not at fault. What do arrangements with one's own insurance 
company have to do with settlements from the other driver's insurer?
