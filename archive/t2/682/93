Hello David   No it shouldnt be a problem  In the future what you should do 
is install the drive gear before mating the case halfs . I have never 
understood why the books show the hard way to do this .  I install the gear and dizzy 
set it on number 1 and then when installing the crank have the number 1 rod at 
the top. check that the timing marks are on top and presto you are on TDC   
later and have fun  mark dearing   Salem Import Service  Salem Va
