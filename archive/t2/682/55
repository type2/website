URGENT LEGISLATIVE ALERT

 Arizona:  Emissions Test Exemption for Collectible Vehicles

15-Years Old and Older

  A bill (H.B.  2357) has been introduced in the Arizona House of
Representatives to exempt qualified collectible vehicles 15 years old and
older from the state's mandatory emissions inspection and maintenance
program.  Qualifying vehicles would have to maintain appropriate collectible
or classic automobile insurance to retain these benefits.  THE BILL IS BEING
HEARD BY THE HOUSE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE TOMORROW, JANUARY 19.



ACT NOW! Contact House Environment Committee Members (List Attached)
Immediately to Request Support for this Bill

  7       H.B. 2357 defines collectible vehicles as 15 years old or older,
of unique or rare design, of limited production and an object of curiosity
and maintained primarily for car club activities, exhibitions, parades, etc.
and is used infrequently for other purposes.

    a.. H.B. 2357 provides for a rolling 15-year emissions inspection
exemption that would exempt qualifying vehicles upon enactment and would
pick up an additional model year for each year the law is in effect.

    b.. H.B. 2357 provides for an emissions inspection exemption for
collectible vehicles for which the owner holds appropriate insurance
coverage.

    c.. H.B. 2357 acknowledges the relatively minimal environmental impact
of older vehicles, such as the older vehicles targeted for this exemption.

    d.. H.B. 2357 recognizes that such vehicles constitute a small portion
of the vehicle fleet and are well-maintained and infrequently operated.

    DON'T DELAY!  Please contact members of the Arizona House Environment
Committee immediately by phone or e-mail to request their support of this
bill.
