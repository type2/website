Shouldn't have this kind of difficulty. We were discussing my 73
recently which still has the stock carbs. The one thing I like about
this westy is that it starts first time every time, no fuss, no muss.

I usually pump the gas twice, crank with the pedal half way or a
little more to the floor, and it fires almost instantly.

Since doing the carb adjustment described last week, it stalls at stop
signs in the first five minutes, and then is fine. I'm thinking of
adjusting the choke for that.
