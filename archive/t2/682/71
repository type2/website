I have a full coverage agreed value policy with Met Life insurance (yeah
the Snoopy guys) they had no problems insuring my bus.  do charge me an
extra $200 a year for the "ageed value" part but I don't mind. I live
right in the heart of a large city and all car insurance is very high
here and that really isn't that much.  I also had similar coverage with
Maryland Casualty (Farmers insurance) company

good luck
Bob
