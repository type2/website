Subject: Rust  Removal Shops?

Hey, I posted this once before, but I don't remember
getting any response back.  Whether it just didn't go
through or it was just such a ludicrous question, I
don't know.  Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone
knew if there was such thing as a rust removal shop. 
Like a place that I could take the bus and have them
repair any and all rust including the rusted out
parts.  I know this sounds very unrealistic and lazy,
but I don't have the tools or knowledge to do it
myself.  Again, any help is greatly appreciated.
