Ideally, no light at all. Think of a gap that is just 1/16" wide but 
eight inches long (or in circumference). That makes the equivalent of a 
hole 1/2" by 1". And that's just something you can see. There are many 
places in the system where you won't be able to see anything using 
Bob's light test.

Most people don't seal the edges where pieces of tin come together. I 
wonder whether that's a false economy. The later buses with pancake 
engines have much more complicated (and less effective) systems of tin 
and seals than do the early uprights.

More important, though, is to watch for things like big holes in the 
battery shelves, especially the aux battery shelf.
