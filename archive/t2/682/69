Subject: seattle sighting and rain rain rain

A orange late bay Westy merged in front me on the I-5 north
yesterday... he got off at the West Seattle bridge exit.. anyone here?

Bus stuff: The unusual amount of rain has shown me that my heater
system needs to have some maint. done. I hit a couple of deep water
streams on the freeway and the bus filled with steam.. 8-O good thing
traffic was crawling along as it took a while to get the windows clear.
The bilge blower fan is still the best way to go for heat..IMHO..
however
it would seem that the plumbing needs to be sealed up a little better.
