Subject: moving the battery in a Westy Vanagon?

Hello all,
 
I've been wondering why the battery in my 81 Westy is so far from the starter (it's under the passenger seat).  I think part of my cold starting problem is the old wiring and the length of wire separating the battery from the starter.
 
I was thinking of trying to move the battery to the storage area under the rear seat.  If I drill a hole through the metal, the battery will only be two feet or so from the starter.  It will also be a lot closer to the alternator to.
 
Anyone done this?  Or will I create more problems?
 
A penny for your thoughts....
 
Marc
