Subject: Re: [T2] Rust  Removal Shops?

You are looking for a body shop. They can cut out old and weld in new. Shop around because they are not all created equally. Some are paint shops with a little bit of bodywork, some are bodywork with a bit of paint (you want this type) and some are the types that take your money and do nothing but store your vehicle for outrageous amounts of time - they are full of promises and the stuff found on the ground in barn yards. 

Yellow pages are good, referrals from car club folks in your area are better (references with results), and don't forget to check with the high schools and community colleges (technical colleges) who may have bodyshop course and would just love to practice on your car! (not as bad as it sounds).
