One problem is that a '71 won't take a bus towbar because of the brake
booster near the axle. Perhaps someone has a special towbar or a tow
dolly

I'd suggest that Olive use her AAA to get as close to her Sunland mechanic
as she can.  Lots more VW help in LA than Palm Springs.  She can either
make an attempt to get the last 30 miles on 3 cylinders, or drive a couple
of miles and call AAA for a second tow.
