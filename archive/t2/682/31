There used to be a concept in America called "saving for a rainy day." 
After a breakdown in my bus that stranded me 70 miles from home (with 
just regular AAA coverage, not the 100-mile kind), I decided to deploy 
this old-fashioned concept for future travel. I decided never to go 
anywhere unless I had the wherewithal to (1) get my bus towed to a 
place where I could rent a U-haul truck, (2) rent a small truck and a 
trailer to haul the bus home, one-way, and (3) stay overnight if need 
be while waiting for all of this to come together. Or. if it turned out 
to be cheaper, get a wrecker to do the haul. Sometimes it's cheaper and 
sometimes it's not. I still keep my AAA paid up.

This has at least a couple of salutary consequences. One is that the 
money to do this is tucked away, earning interest. It's a pitifully 
small amount of interest but it's there just the same. Second, because 
I really don't want to spend that money, I work extra hard to make sure 
that I won't have to. It takes the vague notion of "what if I break 
down?" and turns it into something quantifiable, something I can wrap 
my head around.

I can hear people saying "what if I can't afford to do that?" (I can 
hear because I have heard it.) If you can't afford to do that, then can 
you really afford to travel in your own vehicle? It's not unlike people 
who eat in restaurants but can't afford a reasonable tip. If you can't 
afford a reasonable tip, you can't afford to eat in a restaurant.
