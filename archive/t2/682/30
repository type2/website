Hello Guys  Sorry but I disagree    Thje first tow will cover your cost , 
also you get better discounts on motels and rental cars thur AAA  than say ARP  
ask this old fa*t how he knows  The problem is the over mile tows then there 
will be crooks. Also they will not pick up your car unless you are with it . But 
as much traveling as I do I'll keep AAA   Use the AIRS list first then AAA    
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
