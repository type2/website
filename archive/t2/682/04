As the supply of split window buses dries up, the demand for bay
window buses will likewise go up.

 Has everyone thought of how much that Mitubashie is going to be worth in 2

 are going up on the cost of a VW Bus I would say invest in Buses instead of
 the stock market. I have traded as a hobby for 5 yrs and know a little bit
 about the market. The market and the economy are going to have a big shock
 coming very soon and well into the next decade. Believe me, the equity gain
 in Bus investing is going to have the best return compaired to the market.
 People are going to be shocked how much their mutual fund goes down and how
 much their Bus gain is going to go up. Buses ( most of all the splities )
 are a wonderfull investment for the future. That is if you have some land to
 store them on in a dry climate. Cree,  Three Bays so far and looking for the
