I don't remember any fuse with the kit I installed. And I don't see why you 
would need one there.

Subject: [T2] WR1 Relay Kit
Date: Mon, 1 Apr 2002 18:08:23 -0600

Hello All -
The other day I had my girlfriend pick up a WR1 relay kit while at her VW
mechanic's part shop so that I can soon install it in her 77 bus.  (She is
having the dreaded "hot start" problem.)  I've installed one of these relays
before in my own bus, so I'm pretty familiar with the kit itself as well as
putting it in.  However, when leaving the shop her mechanic said something
to her - with regard to installing the WR1 - to the effect of "Don't put the
fuse inline with it" (she assumed the "it" to mean the relay kit).  Does
this statement make any sense to anyone?  Is there an inline fuse in the kit
that I really should not use?  Is there an additional fuse that a lot of
people install but really shouldn't?  When I installed the WR1 in my bus, I
put it in the way it came - with no problems whatsover since.  Anyway, if
anyone has any idea what this person is talking about, I would appreciate
being enlightened.  Thank you!
