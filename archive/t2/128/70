When we did the painting it wasn't my bus, so I wasn't buying the paint, =
but I don't think it was more than $100.  We went to a local =
(Seattle/Burien) auto paint store that will mix any color and put it in =
cans for you.  They were good cans too, with a nice nozzle.  We sanded =
the bus with a DeWalt random orbit palm sander, wiped it down with tack =
cloths, primed it and let it dry, and then painted it.  We went panel by =
panel so that we didn't have to do the whole thing in 1 day.  I think we =
spent about $125 total.  It was almost the cost of a Maaco job, so it =
might be worth it to do the sanding/prep/taping work and then drive it =
over, give it a wipe with tack cloths and then let them shoot it.  I'm =
not sure, but I think Maaco charges a bit more for vans and buses, but =
still I think you can do the whole thing for under $300.  The bulk of =
the work is in the prep.  We didn't do a lot in the prep department =
which is why the paint doesn't look so good up close.  If I did it again =
I'd spend more time on the sanding.  We also purposely painted it in =
white as that best hides problems.  Still it looks a lot better than =
before we started and we were done in a weekend and camping the next.

Well said Hal.  I for one appreciate hearing that it's ok NOT to have a =
pristine bus.  I have a friend who painted his Jimmy with Tremclad =
Black.  It too passes the 20/20 rule.  Although I don't think I'd do it =
to my Westy, I've often wondered about spray cans.  I guess it'd be =
pretty expensive in cans.
I'm in the middle of a very busy time career wise and I'd love to have =
the time to devote to a full strip-down of the Westy and redo the body =
the way I've seen some do on their Web Sites.  I'm amazed at how great =
they look.
I'd venture a guess that they are professional or are good friends with =
pros and are in a situation that makes it a bit easier than most.  A =
situation they undoubtedly made a conscious decision to set up. I =
consider myself lucky to have a friend who has rebuilt a type 4 engine =
and I was able to part out his old westy, engine included!  I gotta say =
that it's pretty cool to have someone in my life who likes VW's as much =
as I do.
For the time being, I'll do the best I can with my ex-mechanic skills, =
repair what needs repairing, prevent what I can and maybe, just maybe, =
I'll price out cartons of rattle cans.  Can you get sage green???

Thanks for listening...
