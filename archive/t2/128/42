Billy,


If Shake, Rattle and Prime is the best you can do, you best not do
nothing----

All your going to be doing at beast is make things worse---

If you can't afford the proper material's, get a bucket of tar, and tar
the rusted area's---

This would be a better solution than what your up to anyway-----and you
can, at a later date wash off the tar, and do the job  right-----

Don't even waste your time with the K-Mart primer---

Later,

Terry

Jim Mowreader says of painting: 
* Primer alone will not protect the metal. 
* Using rattle can enamel over your real-car-paint primer means you get
to strip off the rattle can paint plus the real-car-paint primer when
you want to get the Bus painted. 
You need a "washprimer" under the high-build primer/surfacer. This will
keep the bus from rusting until you get the topcoat on it. 
I says: 
These sound like fine products for a quality job which I cannot afford
right now. I am saving my money for the paint itself. I think it's
important to note for the low budget crowd/newbies that you can, like
me, derust with the wirewheel/naval jelly, rattle can primer and paint,
then paint over all that if that's all you can do.
