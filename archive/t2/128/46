Mark, could you please get back in contact with me regarding the info on Subaru engines adapted for VW Buses & other vehicles.

I believe there was also a Subaru mailing list.

By the way, check out what my brother is doing with a ea-25(I think that's the model number) in a Beetle-based late 60's J&S Beach Buggy at http://geocities.com/peterwood73.

Cheers
