McMaster is next to god.  Simple as that, if you need hardware
and you need it tomorrow, you call McMaster.  In the day their
major problem was that you needed to be a hell of a talker or
buy about $100,000 a year to get a catalog.  No joke, engineers,
real DESIGN engineers prized their McMaster catalogs as far more
valuable than the Gutenberg (sp?) bible.  I had an old 98 catalog
and when the www firrst got rolling email conned em into a 101 which
was a major coup as out plant was only allocated like 5 a year and we
probably did $500,000 business with em a year, maybe more.  Now
that the www catalog is there and much improved anyone can order
any time, I bought some hose clamps and some bronze from them
last week.  You order it ground it comes next day.  If they don't have
it you probably don't need it 8-)
