Subject: Installing master cylinder

I've replaced a leaky master cylinder on my '68.
Brand-new german part. Also replaced the hose to the
filler reservoir.
Next step is putting in the fluid, adjusting the
shoes, and bleeding. Argh.
(I've never had much luck fixing brakes and have gone
near insane bleeding brakes. I can only assume I
dented my karma in a previous life.)

To add to my anxiety, i came across a problem in the
Type II archives I never anticipated. Something about
not being able to push fluid from the reservoir into
the new master cyl. Somebody went as far as filling
the master up BEFORE putting it in!

Is the a common problem?! I do not want to take it out
again.

I was hoping to:
1. Fill the reservoir
2. Pump 50-60 times.
3. Keep the reservoir filled while i went through the
bleeding process.
4. Go crazy with frustration. Give up and take it too
a brake place.
5. Drive to national parks in Utah this weekend.

Any help or warnings appreciated.
