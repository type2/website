Does anybody know where I could get the ice tray for the 70 Westfalia?  =
As far as I can tell there is supposed to be a tray there in the middle =
of the "fridge" with the drain hose hooked to the bottom. I have the =
hose running out the back but no tray.  Looks a little inefficient =
compared to a regular cooler but space is pretty tight in there so I =
want to find the tray if I can.  Another long shot part I am looking to =
find is the water fitting that goes on top of the water tank.  It =
appears there is supposed to be a fitting that threads on the top of the =
tank and extends it up the last 5 inches or so to the level of the top =
of the sink.  Actually I have a complete 1983 kitchen with the 12/gas =
fridge which I may put in there if I get desperate.  Won't be able to =
fold down the bed, though!  Glen Ward
