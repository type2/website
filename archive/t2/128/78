Here's my take.

AA)  Clutch differences

Old style (I assume you mean three finger)
New style (I assume you mean the 18 finger)

Three-finger is the original design.  Because there
are only three fingers, each is very strong, meaning
that more pedal pressure is required.  The 18 finger
applies equal pressure across the entire clutch plate,
leading to smoother clutch performance.  To tell you
the truth, I haven't seen a new three-finger plate is
years.  If given a choice, definitely go 18 finger.

BB)  Main seal

If yours is going bad as quickly as you claim, you
probably have a bigger problem.  Quickly though, there
are many manufacturers.  I use only the German made
Elring - these are black with a red ring on the
inside.  The overall construction is cleaner and feels
more durable than the Brazilian made seals.

Back to your leak.  When you install your flywheel, be
sure to use very fine emery cloth (around 300 grit)
with oil to finely polish the surface of the flywheel
which contact the seal.  If not polished, it will lead
to premature seal leakage.  Also, check your end play.
 Too much endplay beats the seal, also leading to
premature leakage.
