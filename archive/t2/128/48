Subject: Casper Update & Questions

Hello List,

Went to work on Casper yesterday, and got the damaged section all cut out.
Will do clean up grinding today and start to fit in the new tin so as to 
properly place for weldment.

Discovered a few things that were surprising, as always seems to happen 
when you work on something old, but no major heartburn to be had, and I am 
going to be happy that I am repairing the big guy properly.

While Casper's engine is out, I will do a teardown to the degree I feel 
necessary, and do those inspections and component changes that support 
Casper's engine having a continued high probability of making more long 
mileage and long time frame trips without incident.

Question(s):

AA)
Clutch in Casper is of the "new" design.
The one I just put in NewBus was of the "old" design.
Might someone point me to info that will allow me to understand the 
benefits of one vs the other?

BB)
Main seal in Casper leaks. I seem to be replacing it every time I pull the 
engine because of that dern thing always having just a small leak.
Beyond proper installation, is there some specific seal source that is 
better than others?

I guess I am wondering about the possibility of obtaining a seal from some 
manufacturer that might be better selected if given an opportunity to 
choose same.

Is there more than one "brand" of seal, and if so, which brand is preferred?
I seem to recall the original seal in Casper being black.
The ones I have been putting in were red, as I recall, as but one example 
to illustrate that "some" aspects of "identical" components might differ.

Thank you so very much list for
continuing to be being such a great source of comradery info,
.
