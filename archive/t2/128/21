Doesn't exist.  That is only like a 5mm screw, wouldn't get much
through a drilled 5mm.  Secure, hose clamp it is holding the exact
same pressure everywhere else along the ring main, same barbed
fitting there, don't get much more secure than that.  Going to be a
bit pricey though to use good fuel hose to bring it up to the front to
see if you are doing it alone, I'd rec using an extension of copper
maybe with little brass compression ferrules soldered on each end
to provide a barb, or some of the factory hard plastic line stolen off
a vanagon.
