in INDIA, in a FAG box at German bearing prices. What's it going to take to

know where our parts are made?.  So out of 10 different numbers this is what

countries they are from, Malaysia, Korea, India, Mexico and believe it or

not, 1 number is from the U S of A.

Welcome to the wonderful world of free floating capital...On a similar note,
new Alfa Romeos may be coming back to the USA - made in India, tho', ciao.
Pop into your local Wal-Mart and try to find something made in America...
Even the venerable Stanley Tool Works (formerly of Connecticut) is now
headquartered in Bermuda (at least on paper and for tax avoidance)...
Besides, don't VW ads say, "Well, at least the engineering is German"...
