Subject: westy front curtain

I have an original Westfalia early bay or late split front windshield
curtain I don't need. It is the one that covers only the windshield and not
the front doors (they had the slider type front curtains). It is in great
condition. I hate to sell it so I would trade somebody something for it.

I need for my 72 westy:

cylinder head temp gauge
72/73 jumpseat "butt" cushion
new rear hatch seal
2 new front door seals
late Eberspacher heat duct (thru the firewall)


Maybe something else. Pmail me if you are interested. I am in Charlotte and
could deliver to Everybus. If I don't get something nice for it I am going
to raffle it off at Everybus for the Jonathan Walker fund.
