Rubber shoppers,

Go list! What a great resource we have. Keeping the dream alive without
getting "busted", in the wallet! I just have to give a shout out to all the
great guys at West Coast Metrics, because they have been so great to us.
They are manufacturers and importer of restoration parts for our buses. We
get our rubber from them. They also let folks know about us when they don't
have the parts or someone needs something that's only available used. You'll
get the same great price from us www.bustedbus.com as you will from them
www.westcoastmetric.com .

Don't forget to call on us for you technical questions,
Joe Mitchell
