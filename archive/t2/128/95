I concur with that and have done it myself several times.  My basic approach
(particularly on these older vehicles) is to go ahead and get a complete
flush from the reservoir al the way out to the WC/calipers.  Current auto
mfg. recommendations are to flush completely every 2 years.  How many of us
do that?  And what price do we pay for not?  Brake fluid is highly
hydrophilic (water-loving) and this fact contributes greatly to steel lines
rusting from the inside out.  I personally want a high level of confidence
when I mash on that pedal that what I'm expecting to happen really does
happen.  Of course one of the great things about this country is that it's
your a**, no one's gonna make you do it if you don't want to.  I just hope
I'm not in front of you when it all comes tumblin' down...
