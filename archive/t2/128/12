Subject: 79 Westy FS in Wisconsin

Hi all,

to 
> focus more on our 69 (my first "love"- lol ), we have decided to put our 79 
> up for sale.
>      I bought the westy almost 2 years ago, and during that time have done

>      INTERIOR:   Better than most.  Inside was redone at some point in the 
> not too distant past.  Has newer wood panels.  All camping stuff present, 
and 
> everything works except for the fridge. Has correct child's cot, stool, 
both 
> front and rear tables, rear bug screen.  Fabric on Z bed and upper bunk in 
> very good shape with no rips. Decent carpet.  Front seats could be redone, 
> though. Good screens on louvered side windows.  Poptop canvas has a tear in 
> one side, I think PO got it caught in the hinge for the poptop.  He did 
sort 
> of a patch job on it, so it is functional, but could be replaced somewhere 
in 
> the future. Cabinets and drawers in above average shape. All curtains, 
> including the front curtain, are there.
> 
>      EXTERIOR:  Some rust in the usual spots that most bays have.  Overall, 
> the floors are in good shape, but there is some rust in the lower rockers, 
> also bottom corner of sliding door, minor rust in battery tray, etc.  All 
of 
> this is fixable, or drive as is.  Both pans underneath- the belly pan, and 
> the "pedal" pan, are present, a rarity in a bus. Frame good. Bumpers are 
OK, 
> but could use a repaint. All glass good.  All seals are OK except hatch 
seal 
> has minor leak. Bus is stored in garage, so I never made it a priority to 
> replace it. One key fits ignition and all doors except hatch lock has 
> separate key. There is some rust in the rain gutter too, but no holes.
> 
>       MECHANICAL:    2.0L FI motor, 4 speed manual trans.   
>                                Motor runs fairly smooth with good power.  
The 
> idle is high, due to a vacuum leak somewhere, also needs a tune up (have 
> parts, more on that later). Trans has a little slop in the shifter, very 
> driveable, does NOT pop out of gear or anything, just could use shifter 
> bushings. Has good brakes, parking brake works too. Has newer Goodyears all 
> around.  Exhaust a little loud, needs heater box replaced on one side(have 
> part), other side and muffler are new.  Drives down the road straight and 
> stops straight. I would also replace the rear shocks if I were keeping it. 
> Fuel gauge is dead, problem is gauge itself (have part). Needs cooling tin 
> installed (have parts)
> 
>       SPARE PARTS to go with bus.  (Please don't ask me to separate, 
> everything goes with the bus)
> 
>         Tune up parts- Have new plugs, wires, and NEW complete distributor 
in 
> the box. Just needs to be installed. 
>          Have new heat exchanger for the side that needs it- purchased from 
> Bus Depot. 
>         Includes the missing tin, just needs installation.
>         Have good used fuel gauge that needs to be installed in the dash.
>          Also have complete extra set of curtains, including extra front 
> curtain that is ike new.  Have an extra rod for the sliding door, too, also
