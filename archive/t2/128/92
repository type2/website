Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [[T2] Installing master cylinder]

What I've typically done in the past instead of a bench bleed is to install
the master cylinder, hook up all the hoses including the fluid supply.  Then
to get the air bubble out I typically will crack the lines coming into the
master cylinder and then have someone work the pedal until bubbles stop
oozing out past the threads and it's just clean fluid.  Then I just tighten
the lines back up and go on to the regular bleeding.  It's worked each time
I've used it.

Its called a 'bench bleed'. Older replacement GM MCs come with a set of
plugs
for the ports and advise to fill the MC with fluid and depress the plunger
an
inch or so. You will see little bubbles float up. You wait 20 sec and then
do
it again. You keep doing this until you see no more bubbles.
