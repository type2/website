Yes. =

1.Because people don't maintain them or operate them properly - like lett=

the engine run low on oil. =

2.Use of low-quality aftermarket heads. =

3.Seat jobs and head rebuilds by questionable shops.

Your drawing an inference that the ticking was a symptom of an impending
dropped seat (if thats what it was) may or may not be true.

Wrong. You see can only see seats when you pull the heads. You are lookin=

valve *guides*.
A valve guide coming loose is serious, but not as serious as a dropped se=

To look for sinking seats,  pull the rocker assy. and lay a straight edge=

Watch for a particular valve clearance tightening up at each adjustment. =

Just like the GM engines with bad valve *seals*, although on a VW, it mea=

the guide and a head pull. On a GM it means a set of rubber valve seals.
