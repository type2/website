Subject: interior fabric

List,
As the bus nears completion (the body work part) I will need to replace 
the interior plastic type covering for the window posts and all other 
places that the wood panels don't cover. I am assuming that this is 
easier to do while the windows are out rather than later. It is wise to 
use fabric for this or should I try and acquire the perforated vinyl 
stuff?  Does anyone know where I could get this fabric and if it needs 
to be treated with something for fire??
Thanks
Kev
