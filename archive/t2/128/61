Many  thanks for all your help on this one.

I've now got the engine running again, but it is running very lumpy and
shaking the bus about on tick over.
Smooths out a bit on higher revs.

I've yet to pull the heads off. - I dread to think what I'll find.

Yes.
1.Because people don't maintain them or operate them properly - like letting
the engine run low on oil.
2.Use of low-quality aftermarket heads.
3.Seat jobs and head rebuilds by questionable shops.

Your drawing an inference that the ticking was a symptom of an impending
dropped seat (if thats what it was) may or may not be true.

Wrong. You see can only see seats when you pull the heads. You are looking
at
valve *guides*.
A valve guide coming loose is serious, but not as serious as a dropped seat.
To look for sinking seats,  pull the rocker assy. and lay a straight edge
across the stems. The high ones are suspect...
Watch for a particular valve clearance tightening up at each adjustment.
Hold
this valve/seat suspect.

You know why you see puffs of oil at start with worn/loose guides? Because
when the engine is cooling off, the oil in the rockerbox seeps back up the
valve stem and collects in the combustion chamber.
Just like the GM engines with bad valve *seals*, although on a VW, it means
the guide and a head pull. On a GM it means a set of rubber valve seals.
