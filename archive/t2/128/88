Hi Shawn, 

In 1986 I painted my 72 westy with black tremclad using a brush and roller.
I added gold spray on the wiper arms and headlight rings, put a gold
pinstripe down the side just below the beltline and found some decent gold
plastic hubcaps.  It already had gold curtains and a  gold cover for the
nose-mounted spare. I wound up with a Campmobile John Players Special
edition, more or less. It looked terrific as a 20/20.

Fast forward to spring of 1997, when I acquired a very rusty 1973 westy.
It's typical of older vehicles in these parts... some places are fine, and
some places I find bondo 3 layers deep. I figure it maybe has 3 seasons left
in it so I pop-riveted fresh sheet-metal in place over the rockers and
doglegs, laid in a skin of bondo and headed to Canadian Tire for a gallon of
maroon Tremclad and a couple of those handy little 4" rollers. It was a
great 20/20 job for 2 years, and it was into its 4th season on that paint
before I dissected it in 2000 to build my Westfakia.

I painted the Westfakia at Maaco for a couple of reasons; but mostly because
I didn't have time to do it myself and still attend Everybus last year. I
don't expect the Maaco paint to last forever, but for $200 it will last long
enough to allow me to save the $$$ to get it done better the next time,
maybe in two years or so.

Making the bus safe and reliable is important. Making it pretty is just an
ego thing. <Flame suit fully engaged, fire when ready!>

That's my experience, YMMV.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
