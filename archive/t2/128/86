Subject:   Aftermarket Wheel pics wanted

I am creating a comprehensive online listing of accessory and aftermarket
wheels that were and are available for all aircooled VWs .
 I am looking for anyone with pics of wheels, to email me them. If you can
supply a
name and manufacture for them would be good as well.

Thanks in advance,
 Bryan
