Subject: Re: [T2] Installing master cylinder

This really isn't that big a deal.  I just did it in about 1/2 hour a few
weeks ago.  One of the wheel cylinders was crap and the resevoir was empty.
Replaced the WC and bled.  Always bleed from furthest point back in.  Should
be simple.

Good luck,
Bill
