Here's the cheap way to do it right:

Start by getting rid of all the rust, dust, dings, rips and tears. How you
do it is up to you.

Go to an auto paint store and buy some Lacquer primer. The guy I go to sells
it for $8 a quart. You will probably need two quarts, and a gallon of
lacquer thinner. Stop at a home store and buy a Purdy natural bristle
brush--accept no substitutes--and some 400-grit wet & dry sandpaper.
Investment so far: maybe $40.

Take this home and prime the Bus. Give it a good time to dry, then gently
smooth out the brush marks.

In a day or so, go to a farm-supply store and purchase a gallon of Tractor
Paint. This will cost you about $20. (Home Depot can order you a similar
paint if you have no tractor paint dealers in your area.) Also get a gallon
of whatever thinner is used to dilute tractor paint. Take this home and
paint the Bus. After a week, sand with 600-grit sandpaper to get out the
brush marks, touch up anything that needs it, use polishing compound to make
the paint shiny, and wax. Tractor paint is billed as being able to stop
rust.

Total cost: about what a quart of single-stage Autocryl costs. Disadvantage:
your Bus is going to be the color of a tractor.
