Jim Mowreader says of painting:

* Primer alone will not protect the metal.
* Using rattle can enamel over your real-car-paint primer means you get to strip off the rattle can paint plus the real-car-paint primer when you want to get the Bus painted.

You need a "washprimer" under the high-build primer/surfacer. This will keep the bus from rusting until you get the topcoat on it.

I says:

These sound like fine products for a quality job which I cannot afford right now. I am saving my money for the paint itself. I think it's important to note for the low budget crowd/newbies that you can, like me, derust with the wirewheel/naval jelly, rattle can primer and paint, then paint over all that if that's all you can do.
