Somebody went as far as filling
the master up BEFORE putting it in!

Any help or warnings appreciated.

Its called a 'bench bleed'. Older replacement GM MCs come with a set of p=
lugs
for the ports and advise to fill the MC with fluid and depress the plunge=
r an
inch or so. You will see little bubbles float up. You wait 20 sec and the=
n do
it again. You keep doing this until you see no more bubbles. The pressure=
 on
the plunger will increase significantly through this process until you ca=
n get
next to no travel. You then install the part and bleed the system.
I'd say with the reservoir (sp?) mounted and filled and if you could find=

plugs for the ports, you can bench bleed a bus MC.  I'd say do it. If you=

don't you'll have to bleed the air in the MC out through the rest of the
system which can be a hassle and take along time.

A friend advised recently an effective, if time consuming way to bleed th=
e
system solo is to attach tubes to the bleeders, place the other end of th=
e
tubes in containers of DOT3, fill the MC, open the valves and let her sit=
 for
a few hours.
Haven't tried it, but i may someday.

YMMV,
