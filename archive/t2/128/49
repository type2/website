Subject: If you must cut the bus to make a truck

Ric,
       I'm not sure if you were April fooling us about cutting the bus to
make a truck or not.  After all, a member of the Long Island Bus Alliance
sawz-alled the body off his '65 bus and then grafted that body onto the
chassis of an 80something Toyota van.  Now he's got speed, power and HEAT in
what appears to be a splitty.  But just in case you are serious..........you
asked...." Any ideas about what type of caulk to apply to the wood for a
good seal?"
    Instead of using plywood to close the back of the cab, why not cut the
back of the bus off and weld it to the rear of the cab.  That way you'll get
a rear window and the strength of the metal instead of the splinters of
plywood.
