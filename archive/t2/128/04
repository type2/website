* Primer alone will not protect the metal.
* Using rattle can enamel over your real-car-paint primer means you get to
strip off the rattle can paint plus the real-car-paint primer when you want
to get the Bus painted.

You need a "washprimer" under the high-build primer/surfacer. This will keep
the bus from rusting until you get the topcoat on it.
