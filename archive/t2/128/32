Subject: Re: The Dreaded R1 Double Relay Resistor = 2.7 ohms

Matt,

Glad to hear you are up and running. You may have unearthed a common Bus 
problem. And saved the price of a new relay ($80 from Rocky Mtn).

The 20 ohm measurement was with a 3 volt ohm meter. The ohm meter has to 
over come the diode forward bias (0.7V). You would get a higher reading if 
you use a 1.5 V ohm meter or a different meter range.

I think that the resistor is there to reduce the stress on the relay coil. 
The coil is designed to pull in at about 7 or 8 volts to make sure of a pull 
in when the battery is loaded during starting. Also the forward drop of the 
diode must be included in the pull in calculation.

In the run condition the relay coil voltage would jump up to 13 volts with 
out the resistor. Current would be almost twice the starting condition. This 
will be hard on the relay coil over the long run.

You can measure the resistance of the coil and the resistor in series. You 
measured ~200 ohms I measured 65 ohms(86b to 85). THERE IS NO NON LINEAR 
RESISTANCE (DIODE) IN THIS MEASUREMENT. Pick the resistor value based on 
this measurement not the measurement involving the diode. Keep this value up 
to ~ 13/.2 or 65 ohms for a safe coil current of ~ 200 MA.

I also measured the resistance of the diode (in the forward mode) and 
resistor in series over 20 ohms (86a to 86b). THERE IS A NON LINEAR 
RESISTANCE (DIODE) IN THIS MEASUREMENT. It is affected by the meter design.

Anyway this is a classic design margin problem. Bring it up at school.

Later
Chuck
