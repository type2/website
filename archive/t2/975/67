I just gave them a call, but they told me they weren't licensed for  
Washington.
The agent had me contact Haggerty.  Haggerty would only be $100.00 a  
year, but it has these caveats:

> Hagerty offers insurance only for collector vehicles. We do not  
> insure vehicles used for daily driving.
>
> Our general program requirements are:
>
>     * Regular Use Vehicles - Each licensed household driver needs  
> to have a regular-use vehicle for daily driving and must maintain  
> regular-use insurance in his or her own name;
>     * Usage - Collector vehicles must not be driven daily and  
> should be for pleasure driving, car shows, and club events only;
>     * Driver Eligibility - Applicants must have 5 or more years  
> driving experience except in the following states: AL, AR, AZ, CO,  
> DE, DC, FL, GA, ID, IL, MD, ME, MI, MO, MT, NE, OH, PA, SC, SD, UT,  
> WI, WY. Household drivers (non-applicants) with less than five  
> years driving experience must have clean driving records; and
>     * Storage - Collector vehicles must be stored in a fully
