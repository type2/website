Subject: Re:To clamp or not to clamp. That is the question...

My '82 was clamped when I bought it, and with new sleeves I put a bit of 
Kuril (non-hardening sealer) on them, and lightly clamped them again (no 
rubber crushing strangulation necessary). Perhaps not needed, but the 
sleeves don't go on really tight on their own, so why not clamp them? 
Vac leaks are always a pain to track down and fix.
