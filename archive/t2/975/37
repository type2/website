Hi Skyboy,

David Scharze is converting a bus to turbo diesel.  There is a lot of  
fabrication required, including motor mounts, transmission adapter,  
cooling system, and exhaust system. It is not a job for the  
squeamish, or for those on a tight budget.

It's certainly a worthy idea to entertain, but getting there requires  
substantial effort and resources.

Happy Trails,
