I didn't stay long, but here's a quickie...

Breakfast at Gunther Toody's:
You guys need new alarm clocks! ;-) Everybody was there by 10am. Close
enough I suppose. Yummy food!

The show:
Not much swap going on. I guess I've been spoiled by OCTO's mass of
sellers. I bought a pair of German front disc rotors for $45. New in
the boxes. That's $45 for BOTH! heh I also picked up a shark pin from
the pin guy...

Some outstanding dubs there. I fell in love with a kit car that looked
like an early Porsche. It was just stunning. I was surprised at how
many Dormobiles there were! Wonderful!

Anyway, after making a couple passes through the show lugging two
rotors and running out of drool, I headed out.

Nice seeing ya'll! I had a great time!

Jason (sykboy), I've still got your hubcaps!
