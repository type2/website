Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes pulling to the left on a '72

A couple weekends ago I was out at Andrew Stevens in University Park
Maryland..  Andrew's camper pulled very strongly to the RIGHT > >

Back at his house, Andrew jacked both front wheels off the ground, and it
seemed like the right front wheel (disk brakes) was fairly free wheeling,
but the left (driver's side) had some drag to it.  This seemed strange,
since the camper pulled to the RIGHT...

From the driver side door and with the engine off, I reached in and pressed
the  brake pedal with my hand until Andrew, on the RIGHT side, said his
wheel was locked tight.  I could still turn the wheel on the LEFT driver
side; there was little, if any effect on the LEFT driver's side wheel.

Obviously the RIGHT front wheel was catching first, causing the pull to the
RIGHT.

Andrew said he would put in new/rebuilt calipers, but I suggested that he
replace the front hoses first (and the rotors!!), since my bet was a clogged
LEFT brake hose,

I was having a bit of noise at my left front tire on my '78.  The heavy
scraping noise was easy to overcome, simply press the brakes a bit.  After
sharing Andrew's problem, I decided to replace both my front brake hoses.

It's never too late to change out those original 30 year old brake hoses!!!
Next time you are making a buy from Bus Depot or CIP1, be sure to stock up
on a set of rear (Bus Depot) and front (CIP1) brake hoses.

Oh, and don't forget a couple of oil dip stick tube bellows (Say, who has
the best or worst of these??).  They get hard from the heat and you will
absolutely need to replace yous if you ever pull the fan shroud.  Don't
forget..
