Ok Volks,
   I continue to struggle along with my dual carb and SVDA installation on a 1700.
  Still not super clear on the whole TDC thing. Need to have the dizzy rotor pointing at the #1 and the mark on the fan lined up with the mark on the timing scale. Which time? Line it up and it points one way, spin it 180 and the mark lines up again butr the dizzy points the other way, which is the right one?
   
  Two vac nipples, one on each carb do I use both or just one to go to the dizzy?
  Two big nipple on the carb too, how do I hook up my brake booster? what about the line from the breather box, where does it go?
  Thanks,
