Subject: Re: [T2] Mystery diagnosis....Please help!!!

Did you set the timing after you set the points?  
You have to if you did not..
Did you replace the condenser as well?
Did you take the distributor out to change the points?
If so, did the distributor drive shaft get seated well?  180 out?
Good luck..
