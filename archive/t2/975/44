Hey everyone,

So I've decided to give another go at getting my '78 fi back on the road, but I'm STILL having quite a problem figuring out what exactly is wrong with it.  

The last time it ran, which was probably almost a year ago, I decided it was time to attempt to give her a tune up so that I would be able to pass inspection and maybe drive her around every once in a while.  Sounds like a simple plan, right?  Not for me.  The first thing I did was change the points, and I was quite certain I did everything correctly, but apparently, whatever I did, the car didn't like it.  It wouldn't fire, only turn over, and eventually the battery became run down from trying to start so much.  It did start once, but only after I jump started it, and only for a very short time before it stalled out again.  I was quite baffled by this, because I am certain I did everything correctly:  I installed and set the points the proper distance, I attached all the wires and made sure everything was snuggly in place, I even found where tdc was and set the points accordingly.  I also checked the spark to make sure that the coil was functional.  The spark plugs
 themselves are out of the question because I had just installed new ones prior to the tune up.  After this ordeal, I grew quite frustrated and gave up on it for quite a while, leaving it to sit until I had more time to work on it.  

Well, that time has come, and the frustration has not subsided.  I started from the very beginning and the new problems I've found don't even make sense.  I started by checking the battery, both it's charge and it's connections.  The reading came up as 11.6 and the connections were snug.  I cleaned them off just in case but to no avail.  I also checked to see if there was a short by touching the ground wire to the frame; nothing.  Some how, even though the battery has full charge (according to the vom), the bus still will not even turn over, it only clucks when the ignition is turned like the battery is dead.  Even more confusing is the fact that the dashboard lights all go on with no dimming, as well as the parking lights, but the headlights don't go on at all.  Could the battery be dead even though the vom says other wise?  Or is there a possible cause I'm completely overlooking?

Thanks for taking to the time to read all this.  If anyone can help me, it's you guys.

-Rob
