Subject: key stuck in ignition

You might try shooting some WD40 down the keyway and then rocking the key to 
see if it can be removed.  The lock can probably be salvaged with a clean 
lubricate and check.  Chances are the key is quite worn and  a new code cut 
key would help.  The problem could also be that the electrical part of the 
swith has welded itself together...we've seen that happen also.  Feel free 
to as if you have more questions.
