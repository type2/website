Subject: Volkswagen REgistration Number

Hi All:
I am in the process of changing my registration/title back to California 
from Pennsylvania.  The problem I ran into was that DMV wanted to identify 
the VIN No in two locations.  The one at the windshield was readable since 
it is pressed into metal  The decal label don the drivers side door entrance 
is damaged so you cannot read all the numbers.

DMV said I had to make an appointment with the CA Highway Patrol since there 
are hidden location they know about in the event a vehicle is stolen.  I was 
given a temporary permit for thirty days.

Do any of you know where these numbers are placed on the vehicles.  I have 
the VW mechanics manual but it only identifies the windshield VIN location 
and the engine id number location.

I called the HIghway Patrol (I'm in Dublin/Livemore area) and they will not 
see me the same day.

The DMV said if I found someone who knew where to look, they would accept 
that and do it themselves but they do not have the info themselves.

Cheers,
Janyce Bartlett
