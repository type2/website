Subject: Interior Rear Panel Attachment Method

Sooo.... my 1979 Kombi came stock with plain unupholstered panelboard in all
of the rear compartment: Back sides of the front seats, sliding door, rear
of sliding door, rear, two pieces on the driver's side, and the rear hatch.
These ere all factory installed. The two panels on the backside of the front
seats were pop-riveted to the metal. The sliding door and rear hatch were
attached with chrome buttons, ala Westy. The rear panel on the passenger
side and the two panels on the driver's side were attached with small oval
head sheet-metal screws and finish washers, with the top edge held in with a
metal channel, also ala Westy. I am upholstering all of the panels with some
foam and fabric, which adds quite a bit of thickness to the panels, so
screws and pop-rivets are out (they'd make really obvious dimples).

My question for those of you who have upholstered panels in the rear is: How
are they attached? Are they like the front doors, with the hidden clips? Do
they have visible screws through from the front? Do they have the buttlons
like the rear hatch and slider, but covered up with the vinyl upholstry? All
my experience has been with the Westy style interior, which is identical to
this Kombi.

Thanks!
