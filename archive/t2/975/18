Hello James, are you on the swedishbricks list?  There's your best 
source for info, very similar in character to this list.

I was a 122 guy before switching to the Van and a Porsche 944.

Search and you shall find:

For injectors go with cruizinperformance.com, popular on this list and 
from personal experience.  They replace broken pintle caps too, which is 
the little 'hat' you referred to.

Here are some vendors I used to use:
