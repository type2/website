Subject: To clamp or not to clamp. That is the question...

That is the intake sleeve on the Guac. Just a bit over a year old.
I've been a big proponent of clamping. They don't leak or anything.
But I'm going to pull off the intakes soon and figure I'll replace the
sleeves while it's apart. And I was wondering if maybe it's not such a
good idea...
