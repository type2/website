	The Brazilians have had quite a few cars running on E100 for 
many y.  I'm almost certain some of those were aircooled VW  -  until 
they quit selling those vehicles just 1 or 2 y ago.  Compression 
ratios around 16:1 are normal with E100 engines.  The first obvious 
perfection of this class of motor was the J.A. Prestwich 500cc 
pushrod single which monopolised speedway in the UK, Australia & NZ 
(with several world champs from Kiwiland) till swept aside by the 
Jawa/ESO 500 single.  Pure alcohol is a good fuel.
	But you have to slap in much bigger jets, and some flexible 
parts in the fuel system can get corroded, so converting to E100 is 
not just a matter of pouring the grog in the tank.
	If you want an E100 VW, it would probably be best to get a 
Brazilian motor & ancillaries  -  and sell your petrol machinery to 
some petrolhead.
	Our U of Canterbury did some research on alcohol mixtures in 
the late 1970s (last time we were threatened with energy farming). 
They convinced me E85 is a nicer fuel  -  vapour not explosive.

	E10 is of course widespread in the USA, thanx to billions 
annually subsidising Archer Daniels Midland.  It is OK but hardly 
counts as 'running on ethanol'.
