Subject: Re: [T2] Transition from Gas to Diesel

Volks,

Why not just replace with a VW TDI engine and get a transmission adapter from 
that adapter guy. Kennedy? 
The electronics are much more simple on a diesel. This is not rocket science. 
The only concern I would have is torque and gearing, although diesels are known 
for their low end torque. The engine specs must be available on the web, and it 
would I think there is a gearing spreadsheet available in excel.
