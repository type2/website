Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp warnings

Lugging = lowest rpms for maximum throttle - not a happy combination.  I 
always downshift/drop to 3,000 rpm if flooring it is required beyond 
getting onto the freewa. I reached 248,000 orig. mi (and could have gone 
much further based on head wear, but low oil pressure/overheating due to 
worn cam and pump and clogged up fins on the cylinders was keeping me to 
50 mph in summer to keep oil temp below 245)- I've used my meat 
thermometer for most of the time I've had the bus and it must have helped.
