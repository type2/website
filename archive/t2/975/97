Subject: Really Soft Brakes

I am stumped. I have literally done a hundred brake jobs in my life and I
have been trying to get my '70's brakes solid since I bought it. 

 

There is no resistance at all for almost the entire throw of the brake
pedal. When the brakes engage, they are really soft and the pedal only
engages at about 1.5" off the floor. I have adjusted the drums correctly and
replaced most of the major components. I blew out all of the hard lines to
check for blockage and they are clear. With the OG master cylinder - soft /
Rebuilt master cylinder - soft / New master cylinder - soft. There are no
leaks anywhere and I can't see any loss in the reservoir.

 

Replaced:

Master Cylinder (NEW Ate dual circuit)

Rear Wheel Cylinders

All rubber brake lines

New shoes/drums front

New shoes/drums rear

All new adjusting nuts and springs etc front and rear.

 

Do I have to bench-top bleed the M/C? What is the secret to drum brakes
here? I am just about ready to go up to BustedBus and pull a disc beam so I
don't have to keep messing with this. And brake fluid is so messy. grumble,
grumble, grumble
