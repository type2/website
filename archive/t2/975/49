Verify that the fuel filter is not plugged from the goo that develops 
in the fuel when sitting for long periods. Take it off, drain it from 
the back into a clean cup, then blow through it. Compare to new 
filter. Install new if old gives resistance or a bunch of crud drains 
out the back into the cup.

You don't set timing by adjusting the points. You turn the dizzy to set timing.

Hot blue SNAP!!! spark at the gap. A yellow "phuuut" confirms weak engergy.

Confirm proper brand and gaps.

A fully charged battery will rest at 12.6+. Anything less than about 
12.3 will start to cause problems of weak spark energy and slow 
turning when trying to start.

11.6 volts IS discharged. Gotta fix that first.

As above, yes, your battery must be not less than 12.6 for good results.

>Or is there a possible cause I'm completely overlooking?

Now, if you fix the battery and confirm hot spark at right time and 
the fuel filter is good, you have one of several other possible faults to find.
1.) compression, vehicles that sit for a long time sometimes will 
develop corrosion on the cylinders/rings and upon trying to start, 
will instantly scratch the cylinders and lose compression.
2.) you must do a fuel pressure test. Anything less than 23 lbs in 
the loop during starting could well be the problem.
3.) Temp sensor at the No. 3 cylinder. Verify per Bentley.
4.) AFM, verify that the flap swings freely. Other tests per Bentley.
5. Vaccuum leaks. Search archive for "Vacuum Schlucks".
