Subject: intake manifold gaskets

Are the intake manifold gaskets those ones that couple the large body above
the engine via the very large rubber and cloth tubes to the engines air
intake? I think I have them new from 5 years ago.

 

I think the intake manifold is the one that ends up at the mass air flow
variable resistor via the air filter.

 

Sorry for posting these simple posts.
