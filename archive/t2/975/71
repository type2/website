Very true. I was kind of surprised at the lack of vendors. I guess I am still a little spoiled since at last year's Bug-In at Bandimere, I scored a wire-feed welder (Craftsman Professional) for $30!

I did dig the guys bus (who came in as we were all leaving) that had the roof of the bug welded to the top of his bus... said he has had it there for well over 30 years!

Some nice vehicles overall though, and a great opportunity to meet the Colorado boys! Love that paint Laster!
