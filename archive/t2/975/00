Subject: cold start injector

Hi,

 

When I was doing work on my dizzy, it is always easier to put the cable for
my cold start valve.

 

After I put it back together, one wire popped out just enough for it to not
make contact.

 

Is +10C really considered cold by this engine?

 

I have now bent up the clip tabs and seated them correctly in the connector.
Bus starts just fine.

 

However, I still have the question.

 

Alan
