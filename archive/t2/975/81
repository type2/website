Subject: Re: [T2] TDC and vac questions

as far as lining it all up goes...
   
  make sure the point on the rotor button points straight at the notch in the rim of the dizzy..at the same time the notch in the fan pulley lines up with TDC 0 mark on your timing scale....
   
  also you can once getting it to this point... check #1 plug hole with a pencil to make sure your piston is up...(gently ) dont break nothing off in there.. erasers, lead, pencil, etc/./.
  if all these things are right as i wrote  you are at TDC.... or surely should be..
  if it comes down to that poiint and you still arent sure you might want to look at your valves to see whicvh ones are open at what you think is TDC that will tell you all you should need to know .. 
   
  DO NOT START THE BUS UNLESS YOU ARE SURE YOU DID THE VALVE ADJUSTMENT AND ALL RIGHT....
   
  as far as the vaccum goes for duals.. its been awhile since i ran duals but i almost wanna say it has a T connector you put on the carbs to run to one port ... T umm together...? i might be wrong. cant remember that far back...
   
  just the nightmares of bad linkage push it away from my memory...
   
  good luck

  Ok Volks,
I continue to struggle along with my dual carb and SVDA installation on a 1700.
Still not super clear on the whole TDC thing. Need to have the dizzy rotor pointing at the #1 and the mark on the fan lined up with the mark on the timing scale. Which time? Line it up and it points one way, spin it 180 and the mark lines up again butr the dizzy points the other way, which is the right one?

Two vac nipples, one on each carb do I use both or just one to go to the dizzy?
Two big nipple on the carb too, how do I hook up my brake booster? what about the line from the breather box, where does it go?
Thanks,
