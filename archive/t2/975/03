Subject: [T2] - Key stuck in ignition..

Just got off of the phone with a buddy and he said that his key was stuck in
the ignition switch and he cant get it out and it wont turn either.. Anyone
ever heard of this before??

He got the bus towed to his work this morning, but cannot move it..
Any suggestions would be helpful..

Thanks...
