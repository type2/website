If I'm correct, all you need to do is increase your idle speed when you 
get to altitude.  Because the air is thinner, less air gets through the 
currently set idle opening and causes a drop in idle.

The AFM should compensate for the change in air density and lean out 
your mixture accordingly because it directly senses the amount of air 
flowing into the engine.  I was having some problems with my megasquirt 
at altitude because it uses manifold vacuum to compute the amount of air 
flowing into the engine, which can be problematic at various barometric 
pressures.  Newer versions of the code, however, have compensated for 
this problem.
