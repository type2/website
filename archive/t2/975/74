Rick,

There is a bit of room above the valve cover, yes.  Maybe 1.5 inches or 
so.  The main problem with mounting it straight up would be that many of 
the more important engine parts (manifolds, oil pan, etc.) were designed 
to be used in the 15-degree configuration and would probably not perform 
their jobs correctly if mounted straight-up.  I'm almost certain that 
the turbo could not be reclocked to work straight up with the Jetta 
intake and exhaust manifolds.  The 50-degree configuration has its own 
set of problems.  Thanks for the "A" but I really can't accept it until 
I get the bus running!  I don't think I ever got better than a C for an 
assignment I (ahem) didn't finish.
