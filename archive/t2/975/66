Unless there's something special about the 79 model that I'm not 
familiar with, the lambda sensor will correct for any anomalies with the 
mixture at cruise, but it won't correct the idle speed.  For that it 
would need some kinda idle control valve, something I'm pretty sure it 
doesn't have.  Cars are usually tuned slightly rich at idle, anyways, so 
an NBO2 sensor wouldn't help much there.

Even then, the lambda sensor still isn't going to make the mixture 
adjustments at other RPMS.  The AFM flapper is a mass airflow sensor, so 
it should automatically corrects for the less dense air with less 
deflection which in turn will inject less fuel.
