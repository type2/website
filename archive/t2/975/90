Subject: idle speed screw(bypass screw)

took out the bypass screw today.  no reason, just screwin' around.
noticed dark patches on opposing sides( if a cylinder can have sides).
 looked like a hole had been filled.  should there be a hole in the
threads about half way up?  just curiosity.


thanks,

jeremiah
