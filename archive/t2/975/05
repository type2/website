Hi Aaron:

Here's what needs to be done:

Once the lock cylinder is removed it should be possible to start the  
bus from the switch behind the column until the key switch is replaced.

www.steveslockshop.com would be a good source to get a replacement  
ignition cylinder pre-keyed to match the door locks.


Happy Trails,
