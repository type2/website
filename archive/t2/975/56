Subject: bus road trip update #5

Yes, it is true!  I have finally made an update to my trip journal.  I
know, it's only taken me, what... 8 months since I finished the trip.
But worry not, I WILL finish it!... I guess I just kinda got lazy.

Anyways, on my previous update I left off at day 12, so here are a few
more days after that.  I hope to have it finished very soon ;)

enjoy!
