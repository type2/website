Oh yes - sorry, I forgot. Everywhere you see a hose of
any significance, grab hold of it and confirm that it
is (A) not crumbling apart from age and heat; (B)
firmly attached at BOTH ends (Do this by FEEL not by
looking)

Also, about hoses - I was referring above to vacuum
hoses. The fuel hoses have probably been on there
since the bus was new. Everything after the fuel pump
and through the engine compartment back to the
pressure regulator on the other side is subject to
high pressure. If the hoses are not in perfect shape,
they can leak high pressure gasoline spray all over
your equally old wiring. 
Furthermore, if the hoses on the return side or
anywhere in between are deteriorating inside and
develop a blockage, that pump is capable of pressures
over 100psi. It's nearly the perfect fire when it
goes! I don't feel this is likely the reason it isn't
running, but be sure to give proper attention to the
#1 cause of declining bus population!

If it smokes a lot of black smoke when it does fire,
get back to us as that is another chapter! -BaH
