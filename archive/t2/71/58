Well, I'll probably have to pop the afm cap open and adjust the spring
tension because that screw only adjusts the idle mixture, and here in
california, they test at 15 and 25mph.

So, seeing as my mixture is so lean I'm wondering if this is also what
caused the nice hole in my piston... errrr

Had almost the exact problem with my bus.  76 2.0 FI.  Turned the
mixture screw in a little to richen it up a bit.  Did
the trick on the spot.  Guy at the inspection station said an oil change
usually cleans up the NOx outputs too.  I was
lucky enough to have a guy who let me adjust it while it was still
hooked up to the sniffer.  Let me tune it in perfectly. 
Maybe a 20 dollar bill could convince your inspector let you do the
same.  Happy tuning!!
