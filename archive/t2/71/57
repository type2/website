Had almost the exact problem with my bus.  76 2.0 FI.  Turned the mixture 
screw in a little to richen it up a bit.  Did the trick on the spot.  Guy at 
the inspection station said an oil change usually cleans up the NOx outputs 
too.  I was lucky enough to have a guy who let me adjust it while it was 
still hooked up to the sniffer.  Let me tune it in perfectly.  Maybe a 20 
dollar bill could convince your inspector let you do the same.  Happy 
tuning!!
