Subject: Carpeted pedastals

A buddy brought over his new 74 Westy the other day and it had black
carpeted kick panels and complete seat pedastals that matched the
aftermarket front carpet. I have looked at the bus parts places I know of,
but didn't see them listed.  Does anyone know where to get these?
