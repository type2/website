Moving the arm "up" moves the throw out bearing toward the pressure plate
and moving the arm "down" moves it away, as I'm sure you know.   When the
"ball" at the end of the arm is properly seated in the "socket" at the top
of the slave cylinder push rod, the pressure of the hydraulic system keeps
the face of the throw out bearing  pressing slightly against the fingers of
the pressure plate.  Remove that pressure, as is your case, and there's
nothing to keep the throw out bearing in *any* position, and it's free to
flop back and forth, as yours is.  An inch of movement seems about right.

So, there's no "spring tension" on the throw out bearing when the arm is not
attached to the slave cylinder.  I've never tried to move the throw out
bearing through its "normal operating range" by hand, so I don't really know
if you can move the fingers of the pressure plate using only the hand
pressure you can exert on the throw out bearing arm.  I know if I tried what
you're trying, pushing the arm "up" by hand, that the arm would move freely
until the face of the bearing met the fingers of the pressure plate.  *If*
you can actually move the fingers of the pressure plate by pushing on the
throw out bearing arm, then I'd expect it would get harder and harder to
push as you moved the arm higher.
