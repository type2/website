Subject: The Home of Chrome

Greetings All,

I have a 1970 Deluxe Bus from which I need to remove all chrome.  It's going 
in for a paint job.  Of course I'll have the Bentley by my side as I go 
through this operation.  But.....................I was wondering if any of 
you bus-savvy types who have removed chrome from your rigs have any juicy 
little tips on how to do it easier or better?  And....................Any 
other "before the too expensive paint job" ideas?

Always looking for practical knowledge!

Mike
