Subject: RE: [T2] Is this to hard for a beginner?

Johan,
	Congratulations. Good decision. Now you need to gather some resources. Get
a copy of "how to keep your volkswagen alive" by John Muir. Famous guru and
spoken well of on the list. Read it. Then a genuine manual for your model.
(library) Get a friend to help, set aside a weekend and you should be
driving by Sunday lunch.
	 As to the wiring, this is a pig of a job imho - wait and see what works.
Good luck.
	Barry Wright
