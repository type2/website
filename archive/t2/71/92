Subject: 72 westy FS

Hey folks,

I have a decent 1972 westy for sales. Minus the sink and top cot. Other than
that this this is complete. The jump seat is not the nice yellow plaid. This
bus had a nice hit in the front and we welded in a new clip. Looks pretty
good. Not show mind you. This was an Arizona bus and has no rust to speak
of. Even the battery tray is nice. It has the 1700 cc engine with a single
carb. Runs good. Everything has been gone through and checked out.
Everything works heat, interior light, cool sapphire original radio. Plastic
spare cover in rear cargo. Original vinyl on nice seats. Good canvas. New
tires, brakes, heater cables, pedestal covering, seat belt hooks. I have it
up for sale on the streets of Boulder for $2750.00. If you really want a
nice clean bus then this is it. One could spend some more time with the
front end and make it sweet. I am also selling this bus with $250 of used
and $500 of our wholesale cost plus 10% on new parts. You choose the parts.
Think of it as a warranty. Anyway if you think that you might want this then
please give me a call 303-579-0312. I can give more details and also I have
pictures, let me know.
