Subject: Bus Depot- Good Service as Usual

Just received my most recent TBD order.  Called
on Tuesday evening and paid a little extra to
have it sent 3rd day.  I was told it would arrive
Friday or Saturday.  It was on my doorstep today.
 

I also started to order other things from TBD and
was well informed by Ron's employee (forget the
name) that those items were not in stock.  I
thought about ordering from the dealer, as it
might arrive quicker and be close to the same
price.  But I resolved (again) to buy everything
from Ron, even if it means waiting a few days for
the part to arrive for items he doesn't stock.  

Ron and the other list vendors keep our hobby
alive.  I'd hate to have to rely on VWOA for
parts.
