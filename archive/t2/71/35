Subject: Thermostat for 78 2.0L

Hello,
I have a question that I hope someone would be willing to answer.

About a year ago I rebuilt the motor in my 78 Westy. The thermostat was
shot and I could not find a new one, so I did without. I now see from
looking at the Bus Boys website that they are available again at about
$50.

In looking at the mounts I realized I wasn't sure anymore exactly how
things work. Is it true that the cold position is the closed position?
The warm position the open position? In other words, the thermostat
heats up, lengthens a bit and the spring at the top of the fan housing
pulls the cable to allow the flaps into the open position?

Has anyone tried using a manual cable rig to operate the flaps?

Thanks to all for your consideration!

In the spirit of reciprocity, I have the center console (between the two
front seats) from my 78 Deluxe Pop Top boxed (in near new condition with
factory brown and beige plaid upholstery) and doing nothing. It is free
(you pay shipping) to anyone who would enjoy it.

Kindest Regards,
Chris
