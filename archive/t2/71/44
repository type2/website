Subject: 74 bus question update #2

O.k.
So I got the bus Home the other day and found some
more interesting stuff. I found that somebady replaced
all of the westy wiring and replaced in a half assed
way. The control panel has just two electrical outlets
and a breaker that looks like the ones in my houses
fuse box. The breaker has three settings, 1. Off 2.
Tripped. 3. On, maybe, not written on there. The
fridge and sink are spliced into some old electrical
plugs and plugged into the control panel. I want to
replace all of this  eventually but want to find out
if my fridge and sink work at all. There is no second
battery so can this run off the normal battery? I
plugged an extention cord into the bus and nothing
worked. I got out my multimeter and plugged it into
one of the outlets on the fridge cabinet and read
nothing. Are the outlets original or from the same
dumbass PO, There are 9 total in strips of 3. How can
I get it to work enough that I can see wether the
fridge and sink work or not? Did all the westys from
this era come with a secondary batery?
Thanks in Advance
Tyler
