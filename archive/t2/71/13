Hi everyone and Happy Holidays, 
I just put together my rebuilt 2L with the 4 spd tranny. It seemed to go
together ok. A little twisting and turning and clunk it was ready to put the
bolts in. The engine was professionally rebuilt by a local reliable shop.
The tranny seems to be ok as is and did not need any work.

However I put the engine back into the chassis and I am now trying to put
the clutch slave cylinder back on the mounting bracket. It wont go ! It does
not fit flush with the bracket. I checked to make sure that the "pin" that
pushes between the cyl and arm was lined up properly, and it was. Then
opened the slave cyl hydraulic bleeder valve and tried to push the cyl back
up in... no luck (it could be frozen after sitting for two years). I have
ordered a new cyl (locally, sorry Ron) and will try that.

One question I do have though is:
how much up and down movement should I see in the throw out bearing arm
lever (while I am underneath the tranny) ? It moves a good inch. Also should
there be any spring tension in it, or should it get harder to push as it
engages/disengages the clutch ? 

Exactly what kind of movement should I be feeling when I actuate it with my
hand ????
