Around here, many of the old farm tractors had water injection on them from
the factory.  You could really tell a difference when the tractor was
pulling hard and you turned up the water a bit.

If you think about it, water (H2O) when broken down has two parts hydrogen
which burns very well and one part oxygen which helps support a flame or
burn, and with high combustion chamber temps, doesn't the water brake down
like it would under electrolisis (sp?)?
