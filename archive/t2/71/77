Subject: Goodwood Races in London 2002

Hi Volks, Since it's Friday I wanted to know if any listers have ever
attended the Goodwood Revival in GB? It looks like a real blast and I want
to go this year. Do any UK listers have any suggestions where to stay and
any WWII historical monuments to see while I'm over there? Also does anyone
know of a Westy rental place in London? Thanks for any and all input.
