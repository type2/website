This is about a bug, but it's an air-cooled story none-the-less. Bus content 
- I traded this car for my Camper.

I used to work for a company called YearOne, it's a muscle car mail-order 
catalog business. For the most part, the parking lot was always filled with 
a wide array of the employees vintage Detroit steel. I can't even begin to 
explain the grief I got when I started working there and I showed up in my 
VW (73 Super at the time). Even though my car was about 95% restored, and 
was daily driver/show car that could hold it's own against the big boys - 
they were relentless. It was common place for me to receive notes on the car 
offering to have it towed to the junk-yard for free, for people to tell me 
to let them know when my car grew up, etc...

However, my car lived to get it's revenge...

Since they are such a leader in the industry, one of the popular TV muscle 
car shows from Speedvision wanted to do a show about the company and the 
fact that most of the employees actually drive cars that they sell parts 
for. The VP of marketing (my boss) sent out a memo to all the employees 
asking that if they did not drive a vintage muscle car, to please park in 
the back parking lot (he really wanted to impress the TV folks). He also 
told me, under no cirmumstances was I to drive my car that day. Well, let's 
just say that when everyone showed up for work on the day of the shoot, my 
car was parked in the very first spot - right in front of the main door! 
While my boss was threatening to fire me if I did not removed the car from 
"his" property, we overheard the host of the show asking who owned the car 
and could he take a look. The guy loved the car and wanted to go for a 
ride.Suddenly, my car became the hit of the day. With all those mega $$ 
muscle cars around, the only thing that really piqued the guys interest was 
a lowly air-cooled bug.

As for having the only bus in the parking lot where I currently work, more 
often-than-not, when I go outside I find at least one person give the bus an 
up-close and personal inspection, and asking if they can go for a ride. 
Gotta love these things.
