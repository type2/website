Subject: Westy water pump hook-up?

Here is the situation:

74 Westy, no second battery.  Where do I hook up the power to the water
pump. There is a wire that rund to the fron of the bus but is has been
cut.  I assume it goes to the fuse box, but I dont know where.

I dont have internet access at home so if someone couldjust tell me that
would be great.

Thanks,
