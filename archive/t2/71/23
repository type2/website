Temp Sensor II very likely.
A wire broken inside the plastic will make intermittent contact
and finding this can be difficult and frustrating.
Other potential problem areas:
1) ground connection at double relay ( very likely )
2) ground connections at case front ( FIF ) center  ( less likely )
3) AFM - check as per Bentley.
