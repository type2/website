Just to add a bit, I use my bus as a daily driver cranking out 10k+ each
year on her so this has not been an option.  But I recently found a
company that will allow assigned value AND full coverage for an older
bus.  and the price isn't bad either.  My 78 insurance is slightly less
than my wife's new S*turn but that is a good price too.  so try a company
I would never have thought of, Metropolatan Life Insurance?  I guess they
insure Snoopys' Sopwith Camel (dog house) they'll do VW's too

to everyone, 
have a safe and happy holidays
