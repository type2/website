Subject: Oil Breather Hose

Does anybody know if a replace hose that goes from the oil breather on a 79 TIV to the intake elbow (FI) is available.  I used some heater hose from the local parts store but it collapses and doesn't allow proper function. Please let me know if this can be found or if there is another alternative. Thanks!
