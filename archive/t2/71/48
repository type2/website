Subject: the ford pump

I am not the person who forwarded the pump idea, I just bought one and
hooked it up, and have received several mails on what year,,so I'll pass
it along,,\
     1985-88 ford truck F-150 , the elect. pump mounts on the inside of
the frame rail....a locale salvage yard had one on the shelf and was
tickled to sell it to me for $20.bucks..
      hope it works as well on yours as it did on mine.
