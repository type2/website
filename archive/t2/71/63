Subject: camp stool

That was quite the nice gesture, Chris. If anyone EVER has a camp stool
(console) they care to part with, PLEASE keep me in mind.  I have searched
for one of these since fall, 1993 when (at busses by the arch campout) I
realized my westy was missing this handy piece.
I am willing to pay a fair price if anyone knows the whereabouts of one.
This has topped my Christmas list for years.
