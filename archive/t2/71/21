Sounds to me like a reasonably easy do-it-yourself project. I bought a big 
old blue rug on the discount bin at a Walmart type store and cut it into a 
rear mat (with a hole for the screw-in table leg and everything) and a front 
carpet. I already had a black rubber mat that covered the front floor, so it 
was easy to use that as a pattern. Get yourself some thick, fairly flexable 
board and use your existing kick panels as patterns, then cut rug to match 
and glue it over those. If you want to be really fancy, you can do something 
similar with the pedistals, maybe drilling holes so they can screw on and 
off. Otherwise, you can just use carpet glue to stick cut rugs on. Easy 
enough...
