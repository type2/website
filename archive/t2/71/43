It's a kludge to counteract bad head design. Until just a couple years ago,
NASCAR was running 14.5:1 compression in their engines, which burn 110-
"octane"--you can't go higher than 100 and really call it octane--racing
gasoline. Now it's 12:1 on the same fuel. Rusty Wallace ran 9200rpm down the
backstretch at Pocono this July and didn't blow the engine; if you have an
engine that's pinging, you're probably going to send parts of it through the
beer logo on the hood at that speed.

I had a motorcycle in the 1980s that had 10.5:1 compression and I always
went to the cheapest gas station in Clarksville to put the cheapest gas they
had in it, and never had a ping problem.

All of those engines have one thing in common: refined head design.
