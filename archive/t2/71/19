Your fix may be as easy as using slightly longer bolts.  I have fixed two 
motors with this ailment using that method.  Just go to the hardware store and 
find a couple of m6 bolts that are about 1/8-3/16 inch longer than the old 
ones.  Go gentle when you run them in the first time to make sure they aren't 
going to bottom out.
