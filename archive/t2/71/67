As opposed to...?  If we're talking Bays, I've had a '71 deluxe station wagon, a '71 westy, and a '68 westy.  All had the heater outlet in the walkthrough, and when it 
was operational, you pulled out the knob to make it so.  

IIRC the term "microbus" was never applied to Bays, but if you mean the fancy-trim model, those westies don't fall into that category.  (OTOH maybe they do, since 
they started with sunroof body shells?)
