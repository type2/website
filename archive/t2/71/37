Subject: Volkswagen busses at the office

You know, this post got me thinking about the parking lot where i work. My 
77 westy is the only vdub in the lot, other than a 75 vert that was here 
twice and a 74 thing parked in the grass down the street (there is a 2.0 914 
under a tarp on the next block, but that doesn't really count). it might be 
fun to share about our commute companions, the vw's in our employee lots, 
and what it is like (in my case) to have the only bus at work. In fact, when 
i drive the 65 everyone goes "hey is that your bus too?" It has gotten to 
the point where people come into my office and say "hey i saw a bus today," 
like they bumped into one of my family members. Which, i guess maybe they 
did!
