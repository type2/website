Subject: FS: T4 valve springs

Well I just bought 50 NOS German T4 valve springs, solid lifter
style off a certain auction site for no apparent reason.  As I only
want to keep 2 sets, the rest are for sale at $1.50 per spring which
is only about ten cents more each than I paid after shipping.  Anyway
with say a priorty pack to anywhere in the US that would be a nice
round figure of $16-17 the set to anyone interested (not sure off hand
if they'll go in the $3.95 or the $5.20 priority pack.)  These are the early
021 109 623 E springs suitable for any solid lifter 1.7, 1.8, maybe 2.0
application, supposed to be German from VW.  Anyway if anyone is
interested obviously not trying to make a lot here, Bus Depot wants
$3 each for these.  I have 4 sets to sell or will sell all 34 I don't need.
I also bought 10 of the plastic thermostat roller pulley wheels from the
same guy for $2.50 each, I'll toss them in at what I paid to anyone
taking a set of springs but they aren't worth shipping otherwise.

Happy Holidays
