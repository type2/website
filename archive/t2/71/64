List,
Figured i'd get this in before we go down.

I'm parting out this 71 adventurewagen.
Still got the "highly sought after" pull-out step.
It is in good shape - has been painted white, but the adventurewagen plaq=
ue is
still on it.
Easy install on any bus and should be an easy ship.
Complete your adventurewagen...


I also have three sets (2 each) of axles;
1 set from the 71 (good boots, good joints) $100
1 set from a 74 (bad boots - good joints) $75
1 set from a 76 automatic bus (good boots and joints) $100

I have other stuff i need to move.
Pmail me,

Clark Gordon
Morehead, ky.
