With State Farm Insurance, you base a stated value policy on an actual 
appraisal.

It would seem to me that having a signed and dated appraisal on file complete 
with pictures that was done when I had my bus polished up, running and 
looking its best is going to make it a_LOT_easier to negotiate a favorable $$ 
settlement than if I wait and try to establish value on it based on local 
newspaper adds when its sitting smashed up or burned out in the mud behind a 
garage or on a back lot somewhere.
