Subject: 85' Vanagon Weekender For sale in MD

My friend asked me to post this again because now he has an e-mail address
and we took some digital pictures which he can share. The vanagon runs
terrific and looks great. He has a lot of extras for it and doesnt really
want to sell it but he has too many vehicles right now. Email him directly
to get more details and see pictures.
