Here in NH, they've changed the laws regarding Antique/Classic Autos.
Used to be to-from events, no more than 2500 miles a year.

Now there is no limitations about where/ when or how far you can drive
your Antique or Classic...

Antique plates are issued from April to April and cost $5 per year,
Vanity or Custom adds another $25.

One of the reasons Bill Collins of VW Trends fame likes living here in
NH..!  Costs under $50 per car for his fleet of Rare & Wonderous
V-dubs...

    Can't wait till 2008, when I can start registering my '83.5 Westies
as Antiques...  <<G>>
