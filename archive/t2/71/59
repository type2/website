Subject: Heating ducts

Rick

The heating duct that exits between the front seats and ejects hot
(hopefully) air rearwards into the passenger compartment was only fitted
to microbuses. It is operated by the contol knob on the driver seat
pedestal, this opens an air valve directly behind the front beam. This
air valve is situated in the ducting immediately in front of the front
cross member where the duct has an off-take.
