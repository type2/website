Just curious here James,

Why are you hanging a Rube looking steel channel bumper on the back end
of your Bus just for the sake of taking some pedal power bikes along,
when you you could just hang a receiver to accommodate a bike rack under
the stock bumper.

Mack Truck tough is good---but I think a stock bumper not only would
look better, but you could get a hitch under it that would do the job a
bunch cheaper, and without all the ruby laborious acts.
