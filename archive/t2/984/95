Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

I remember painting a replacement rear engine lid for my 71 back in the 
70's-kansas beig-?Ditzler lacquer paint- spray, fine sand, spray, fine 
sand, etc- that sucker shone like you wouldn't believe when I was done. 
  Scratched way too easily, buffed out just as easily with rubbing 
compound. The bus is in the woods now; all the paint fell off the front 
where a shop had weld-seamed half a panel and bondoed the center overlap 
(poor priming?-told the insurance co they replaced the whole front 
,,,,,,); my lid still looks great!
