Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

Bumper's are not supposed to stop a  impact.
They are decorative stop gaps between the fool that wacks you in the
butt, and your sheet metal.

Now if the guy is flying--your in trouble.

The Bus could have a 1/4" plate box channel on the back and your still
going to suffer body damage.
( the guy's ride that slammed into you would really be hurting )

Thank God there isn't plastic cover's over a reinforcement on the back
end--everybody here would be really singing the blues.---

The best defense is keep an eye in your rear view mirror when
stopped--be ready to go when you see a nose dived vehicle coming at you,
and you hear locked up rubber sliding on the pavement.
