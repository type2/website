    If you're talkin' about that "buzzer" sprayer, it's only good for 
paintin'
the back fence... ;-)

And as regards usin' a roller to paint...There usta be a product sold in the
UK called "coach paint" for doin' that. You need a dust free area and lots 
of wet sanding between coats to get a nice finish...But hey, lots of cars
built in the pre-war period (that's WWII...) were painted that way...
I saw a late thirties Bentley that was done that way and asked about it...
The owner said he did it himself but it took six months... ;-(
