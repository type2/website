Subject: locating exhaust leaks with smoke; warning: long

  I'd like to report a successful attempt at locating exhaust leaks 
with smoke.  Maybe this is old hat to some of you, but for me it was 
neat and I thought worth a post.

A month ago, I bought a toy smoke generator and intended to use it to 
locate vacuum leaks. Before I had chance to try it for that, i had to 
replace a stock muffler on a 1600DP.

For me, this is the nastiest job in all of VW land. I replaced the 
muffler, took the vehicle for a drive, and heard the obvious sound of 
exhaust leaks.

So, taking a tip from a recent post, I connected the hose from the 
input of my little shop vac to the exhaust pipe and crawled under 
with the smoke generator. I was able to generate smoke with one hand 
and push the hose on and off the pipe with the other.

I tried the two rear exhaust port joints first. No effect on the 
smoke. It just wafted upwards. Hmmm, I thought. Maybe I don't 
understand the path of the exhaust gases after all. At the front, 
however, the story was  different. With the hose not connected to the 
pipe, the smoke just wafted up; with the hose connected, all the 
smoke was drawn into the joint between heat riser and exhaust port. 
It was a dramatic effect. Unfortunately, this happened on both sides.

I had used new gaskets. I know I tightened the nuts, but clearly not 
tight enough. I was so relieved that I got the old nuts off without 
stripping or breaking the studs, that I must have been too gentle 
putting the new nuts on.

So it's back under again with a tool and a prayer.  Next time, I'll 
do the smoke test *before* I put all the parts back together.

FWIW.
