Subject: carbs chirping or pre ignition?

All,
In doing the tune up on the bus, set the dwell, timing, etc.  In driving the bus this morning, noticed it sounded like (i think) detonation under moderate to heavy acceleration.  But I cannot tell if it is the dual carb chirping, which I have heard that they sometimes do, or if it is indeed pinging.  It almost sounded like a chirp or whistle.... It would occur mainly approaching a hill in 4th gear, gradually increasing throttle, or on the hill, shifting down to third, and upon letting out the clutch, and hitting the throttle to get the higher rpms.  I want to believe that it is a chirp, not pre-ignition.  How can I know for sure?  
Engine is a 2.0L w/ hyd. lifters, and dual drla carbs.  The distributor is a 205S with the vacuum advance can on the side (for advance only).  Dwell is set right at 49 - 50 degrees, and timing is at 7 - 8 degrees BTDC with timing light, and vacuum line attached.  Now where I get sketchy is the total advance, it will shoot up to almost 40 degrees of advance upon higher rpms.  Wasn't there originally some sort of a set up where it would only allow the higher advance only if you were in a higher gear or it had a vac switch on the trans that kicked in that additional advance, or something like that?  Could this be causing some problems?           

Mark
