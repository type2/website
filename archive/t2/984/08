Dang, guys.  These things came with a cylinder to spare!  :)  Good to know you can get by on three.   Probably get REALLY angry looks then, though.  My problems seem to be solved now.  Now I can get to work on my 2.0.  Gonna put brand new heads on that one.  Two AVP horror stories in two weeks got my attention.  Off to disconnect that spare cylinder...KR

Coming down for John Brown's Buses 2006 I drove from BuffaloNY -  
Bedford MD and home to Toronto ON, on three cylinders, that's about  
800 miles.
