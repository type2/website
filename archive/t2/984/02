Subject: new westy project - day 1

It all started last September when Chris rescued a 78 Westy near Aspen, 
CO.  The bus had no engine or tranny, but was otherwise complete and in 
nice rust free shape.  After sitting under several feet of snow all 
winter it was drug to our work areas and pressure washed.  I removed the 
gas tank and inspected it.  It was bone dry and rust free.  The sender 
was tested, and the empty, full and 1/2 full Ohm readings were right on. 
  I washed off the outside of the tank, pressure washed the tank area, 
and reinstalled the tank after replacing the filler tube, filler neck, 
and all the vent lines.  I even waxed a small area with come cleaner 
wax, and the oxidation came off easily.  It shines!

We got the engine and transmission pulled from the 77 donor bus.  It had 
been sitting for 10 years, and was full of turds.  I got it all cleaned 
up and replaced all the fuel lines.  I'll be replacing the intake 
manifold hoses, fuel filter, manifold to head spacers, the three rear 
shift rod bushings, and the triangle HE gaskets before installing the 
engine and tranny tomorrow.

Here's some pics of the new bus and of our progress.
