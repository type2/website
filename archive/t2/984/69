Hi all,

First missive from Kurt.

Ned

Ni hon everybody,

am in Suzhou, China, kinda near Shanghai. We have ridden one day and need a
break.  This town seems pretty nice, and will walkabout today.  Shanghai was
huge confusing to walk around in and a convincing mixture of modern and
"traditional" (small busy asian street activity.)  The whole city seems like
a skyline.  Many high risers.  \Construction here is amazing.  At least ten
sky scrapers going up at once.  Traffic is laughable.  At first I described
it as chaotic.  Now I characteize it as individuals or small bands of like
vehicles taking calculated risks in the face of oncoming traffic.  I
thought, at first this would be an intimidating place to start.  Once we
bought our bikes however ($40 one speeds, and heavy) we rode like natives.
It's still laughable, and it is exciting.  Riding to the new town (90km
away) started great. we managed to find our way out of S'hai fine.  Then it
got hot, real hot and humid.  Along the way we passed an area of heavy and
light industry which probably is the cradle of so many of the things that
get exported.

Tomorrow we head south.  Where we'll stop???  We won't go too far though as
it takes a while to get into shape.  One these one speed bikes, one pedals
more rotations than normal.

Ned, please pass this note to all the gang, and please pass to my parents at
graka(-at-)comcast.net. Thanks

ps will scribe when i can

pss I dont know anyones phone number, but I now have a phone card that can
be used to reach the states.  it'll be a quick call but it'll be nice to
hear sentences in english strung together.

Regards, Kurt
