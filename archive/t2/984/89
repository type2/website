Thanks. I'd almost wiped the horror of those bolts from my memory! 
 From what I recall, the stock bolt has a tapered threadless section 
which helps, but only a little. I had only one stock bolt ... ;)

something.

What condition are the brake wheel cylinders in? Mine were weeping 
slightly (the brake dust was dark around them). I also discovered ONE 
had been replaced in the past (different brand) - a definite no no. 
Always replace both sides where brake bits are concerned.

I'd also change all the fuses. That way you know they're all good. I 
found that on one of mine the metal was cracked but still just 
holding and another was much higher amps than it should have been.
