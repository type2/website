Subject: RE: [T2] still cant keep my bug running

That exact thing happened to me as well in my '67, and I was about to
bring that up.  But Leo says it's happening in any gear.  Not sure what
would cause that unless that reverse switch is shorting out in any gear?
As Anthony states, try disconnecting the wire.  For my part, I had a bad
fuse on the backup light wire, maybe had some grease in the connector in
the engine compartment, and after cleaning it out and using a new fuse,
the problem went away.

in (or shorting out into)main coil hot wire .Had customer who after
installing his motor had back up switch on side of trans pinched
shorting hot coil wire making motor die when he put in reverse....But
only reverse.....disconnect back up light wire at trans to check..may be
part of problem..Good luck
