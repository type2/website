Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

The other day I came perilously close to finding out what damage the front-mounted spare tire can do in a collision.  I came over a hill after a very light rain to see a police road-block.  In my momentary panic, I jammed on the brakes.  The bus went into a slide and the rear end started to come around.  I wasn't going very fast or I wouldn't have been able to stop it where I did, about 2" from a telephone pole right square in the middle of the spare tire.  I thought I was in trouble as the cop started charging towards me.  But he just warned me to be more careful on slick roads.  Could have been much worse.  Whew...KR

Right Bob---

I think there isn't nothing nicer looking than the stock bumper on the
back of a Bus---

The Garbage Truck Mack Bumper is a bit of an overkill, and isn't really
eye appealing.
