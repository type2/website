OK Don,
I give.

What in the hell is a "Turbine"

I know it makes electricity, power's steam ships, and makes jets fly.
But how does a turbine blow paint?

Is this thing one of them gizmo's that I have seen in Hemmings Motor
New's--the red box with the hose & spray nozzle attached?

It's gotta be making some kind of propellant to get the paint outa the
cup.

Is it the same kinda turbine you install under your air cleaner for
better fuel mileage?
