Subject: Re: [T2] can a '72 spindle and rotor be used with a 74 brake

The spindles are different.

211 405 311 E  Left 71-72
211 405 312 E  Right 71-72

211 405 311 F  Left 73-79
211 405 312 F  Right 73-79

The 74 caliper will not work with the 71-72 spindles - gotta change 'em
out.  And ya gotta go to 73-79 rotors too (211 615 301 B).  But you'll have
better brakes when yer done :-)

BTDT with a 71 upgrading to 73 Brakes back in 1984.
