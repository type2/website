The amount of water evaporated is the problem.  The systems that spray
water on the RV radiators use the RVs fresh water tank for a supply, and
use several gallons of water per hour when in operation.  The water bag
evaporates its contents much slower so the effect on the temperature of
the air entering the radiator would be tiny, on the order of a fraction
of a degree.
