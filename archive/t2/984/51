Jamie's hitches are the bomb.

 My advice is to buy a rear receiver hitch from him (here's hoping you
have a late bay - I don't think he does one for the early...) and then
get a nice receiver bike rack...  VERY strong, it's mounted to the frame
under the bumper, and now you have the added versatility of being able
to use OTHER goodies - maybe instead of a bike rack, you can get one of
the flat racks and already you've got multiple functionality.  Horrible
Freight's got 'em, and some great 4' x 8' trailer kits - dry weight of
the frame about 250 lbs.  Having one of these trailers is great - I
don't pull more than 1k total weight with my bus, but that's a lot of
payload.  Very handy, but don't talk it up to your friends who are
moving.  ;-)  Unless you like moving hell...

In short, a properly constructed and mounted rear receiver will give you
the most bang for the buck in the long haul.
