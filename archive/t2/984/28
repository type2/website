Subject: Bumper replacement

Some might remember my post about wanting to
get a new bike rack, possible mounting the bikes to the
front tire etc...

In my infinite (ly small) wisdom I am making a new rear bumper

2x4" 1/8th thick rectangular steel bumper with a 2" reciever
from Princess auto welded to the bottom for the back bumper.

Have all the parts and just need my dad's welder to finish it up.
Going to paint it with POR15 and then white paint to match it
up to foxy. Figured what the heck.
Total cost (in canadian funds): 45$ - tubular steel, 5$ flat steel to
weld onto ends, 9$ for 2" reciever and a little bit of brown nosing
to get the welding done pronto... not too bad. And I think
it will look sharp too.  Safer as well to put 4+ bikes onto.

If interested I can put up a picture later.
