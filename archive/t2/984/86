Subject: Re: [T2] idiot light

Had a similar incident a year ago on my 84 Westy.  Turned out the brushes
and the slip ring were really wearing bad (I guess I would after 22 years -
original alternator).  Would have just replaced the Voltage Regulator/Brush
Assy (specific for the 80s Vanagon), but as I said the slip ring needed
resurfacing, so I just put a Bosch reman alternator in to fix the problem.
Been fine ever since.
