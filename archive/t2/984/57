Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

Don,

If you had ever used a suction gun , you would know where I'm coming
from.
The difference is night and day.

If a guy enjoys wet sanding, and then some more wet sanding to get a
slick finish--then the HLVP gun is the way to go.

The Binks 7 gun I've been refinishing trucks with for 35 years lays down
paint as smooth as a baby's ass.

When the paint is cured MAYBE I I blast over the dust nubs with 2000
paper, hit it with Finesse, and I'm done.

Put on your Ray Ban's , cause it's gonna blind ya.

Prejudice?
Naw--I just want to get the job done right the first time.

If your into the concrete block look--use that HLVP.
