Subject: Re: HALLALUH!!! SING!!! > testing coil

Just want to relate that this weekend I finally got my 78 camper running 
after reading Bob's post. I had a minor engine fire last year (a mechanic 
I respected had replaced my FI hoses with reg fuel line during an engine 
swap a few years back and it started weeping) right at the cold start 
injector.  Melted lots of stuff.
So I replaced my FI harness with my spare and new wires, cap and rotor, 
spare distributor, replaced all my fuel hoses myself.  I wasn't getting a 
spark so I replaced the coil with my spare coil.  Still no spark.  started 
going over and over my wiring, sure that while rewiring I had screwed 
something up.
The little troubleshooting list that Bob recently posted helped me out and 
then after reading his post I refer to above eventually I decided to try a 
different coil from a blown engine that was sitting in a parts bus.
Started right up and ran pretty good once I set the dwell and timing.

So is there any test for a coil? The resistance between the side terminals 
and center terminal is the same for all three coils so it's not shorted.
