Subject: idiot light

Hey, guys.   My idiot alternator light is coming on more and more at idle lately.  Is that a symptom that the alternator is on its way out?  It was on the bus when I bought it 8 years ago.  Where does it actually measure the voltage?  In the guage itself?  The alternator still works fine otherwise.  And I've got a good battery. Never considered putting in a real voltmeter. May have to rethink that.   Thanks...KR
