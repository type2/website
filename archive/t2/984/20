Subject: summer trip, new cht gauge, and advice on the route

List,
I got a new cht gauge and plan on having it hooked up for the trip.  We are
taking a family camping vacation to Cape Cod, Mass, leaving Pittsburgh PA area
7-7-07, and traveling to Finger lakes region in New York to camp a night, next
day traveling to somewhere across the Massachusetts border, to camp out a
night, then on the third day arrive at the tip of Cape Cod MA.  Spend four
nights there, and then make the trip back in 2 or 3 days.  Any advice on the
best bus friendly route?  Any can't miss special points of interest along this
route?  Anything interesting for the kids?
I plan on printing out AIRS info to take with, but my biggest concern is
mountains and lessening their impact if possible.....  I plan on logging cht's
to pass that info on upon my return.  Also, this will be the maiden voyage of
the "new camper layout", as with 4 kids and the wife, stock westy no longer
fit...  Let me know, all, and safe travels!
Mark
