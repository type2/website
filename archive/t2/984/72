Subject: Re: [T2] Custom Exhaust

Hi Jeffrey,

A word of caution... Empi/Bugpack custom mufflers flow well and sound  
great but they don't hold up over time. In my experience the empi  
duals look sharp and sound good but are not well supported and come  
apart pretty fast. My last one only held up for a year,

There's a different style out there that uses a spaghetti-header with  
separate muffler which tends to last a bit longer. Usually the  
muffler rots out after about 18 months but you can replace it for  
about $60 and get another 18 months use out of the header before it  
comes apart.

In my book the best "bang-for-the-buck" is a nice heavy original  
german muffler.

Happy Trails,
