Mark,

I can confirm Jules' assesment of Route 5 as a good alternate to the
Thruway:


".... Alternately, if you end up on the north end of the
finger lakes, US5 through Syracuse and Utica is a very viable bus
route. It follows the Mohawk river and canals and the rail lines much
of the way and is a good, mostly flat route....."


Although there are some hills to deal with in the Auburn/Jordan/area,
I've been over them with my old '70 & '74 Busses & recently with my '71
without incident; just had to use the slow lane.

I'm on the AIRS list & located in Syracuse, just a stone's throw from
the Thruway & Rt. 481, & a slightly longer stone's throw from Rt. 5.

I'd be happy to lend assistande if you should need it, or just yak
about VW's if you need a break from the road...
