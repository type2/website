Subject: can a '72 spindle and rotor be used with a 74 brake caliper?

I have a '71 or '72 beam in my '74 westy.  Just try to install the brake
caliper and it doesn't fit properly.  Has anyone used '74 front calipers on a
'72 beam setup??  if not can I use a spacer to move the caliber back in order
to work??/  other option I guess it to change the spindle, will this fit the
beam and just bolt in??

thanks in advance.\
