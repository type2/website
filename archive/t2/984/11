Subject: [T2] new Westy project - day 1

Nice Westy Dan!... you forgot to mention that, after sitting in a field for 10 years, the (donor bus) 77 F.I. solid 2.0 fired right up. It had been parked 10 years ago due to the "fuel pump not working." The actual problem was that the AFM was unplugged. Wow. Everything on the motor was original, including fuel lines. They were actually in very good shape. Nothing needed replaced in order to fire it up. This donor bus was filled with dead rats, mice, and turds. The wiring harness was chewed through. But, nothing on the motor was touched with teeth and with new gas (man, 10 year old gas is horrible), it roared to life. Simply amazing.
I can't get the new motor in my 79 to idle but Dan's P.O.S. donor bus motor fires right up with good compression after sleeping with the turds for 10 years. 
Another bus back on the road! Yay!

P.S. to test the 091, we drove the donor bus with only a motor in it, totally parted out. Man, are these things fast when there's no weight in them!! Also, wear goggles if you have no windshield in your bus. :-) Try not to open your mouth too wide (bugs) while laughing hysterically.
