Just ordered another pump from Bus Depot and am
wondering what to do with it when I get it?  I tried
the archives for installation instructions, couldn't
find.  I have the champaign edition with stove and
sink but holy cow, do I have to take the whole
shelving under the sink out?  the instructions
(Volkswagen Official Service Manual) I have are for
the non-champaign and seem to have a drawer in the
ice-box cabinet which I don't have.

 Muriel ('79 Westy) and I live with each other in
Victoria and travel Vancouver Island for work. Hate
not to have the water working on the road and would
love to fix it myself.

 Any help would be very much appreciated.  I read most
of the emails on this list whether I understand them
or not ;)  I know Muriel is impressed.

You have a 1979 Champagne Edition?!?!   Are you sure??
The CEII was made for 3-4 months from 1/78 to sometime in 4/78 as a 1978 yr model because VW had so much
success the year before.
Here are 4 pages from the Champagne series brochure:
 http://www.baywindowbus.com/78champagne.htm
The 1978 CEII line included Rabbits, Sciroccos,Dashers, Buses, Campmobiles, and Beetle convertibles.

There was a very limited run of Champagne Edition buses in 1977 to celebrate the 1,000,000 Rabbit being made,
but the 1977 CE bus was hard to distinguish from a standard bus.

Please: email me your vin number and the build date on the silver sticker on the drivers door post.  And if
you can get all the numbers and letters off your M-code plate, I would love to see them.

As far as your water pump replacement, there is no difference between a Westy and a CEII as far as the camping
equipment goes. But I am assuming you don't have the stove because you are in Canada or it is not a P-27
Westfalia?

Down under the water tank is a square opening in the wood. You access the pump there.
