<<or even just extend the stock bumper on longer mounting brackets.>>

Right Bob---

I think there isn't nothing nicer looking than the stock bumper on the
back of a Bus---

The Garbage Truck Mack Bumper is a bit of an overkill, and isn't really
eye appealing.

But hey--It ain't my vehicle.

He could make plenty of room for himself when parallel parking--just
heave-ho the vehicle behind him outa his way---

Anthony---

I'll take the 58 Olds front and rear bumper, the boxed frame sections
any day over this tin, plastic toilet paper cover's they ahve on
vehicles today.

I just saw on the tube the other night, that in a good highway wack
today--nobody walks in comparison with a mid 70's car.

I'd like to stuff that 58 Olds, Pontiac, Buick, Caddy, into a Sion XA,
XB or XC at about 70 mph--see who wins the Joey Chitwood walk away
award--- ~ 8 )-
