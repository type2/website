Subject: [T2] Bumper replacement

I've seen so many buses with caved-in rear bumpers that I decided to do 
something about my restored '76 Westy before it got hit. I built a steel 
reinforcement under the actual bumper that is completely hidden. Sure 
enough, one day a friend who was following me a little too close, 
slammed into me at 30 mph at a stop sign, and only made a couple of 
small dents in the stock bumper, which was protected by the real (and 
very ugly) steel bumper that was underneath that. (which weighs an 
additional 50 lbs)
