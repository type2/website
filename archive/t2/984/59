Don't believe what you read on what a mfg. is usng for paint.

It's the old; who is supplying what for the least.

Glasurit is a tough skinned paint, but a bitch to get it to lay down
right.

If you mix the stuff like they want you to, it's either gas out the
finish, or have  orange peel a ft, thick.

Don't let it cure all the way prior to wet sanding it smooth--it's like
trying to sand glass, or a year old cured Imron.

A buddy of mine builds Hot Rods, and turn one out a year.
Usually 36-37 Fords.

He called me and asked if I could stop on the way home from work to take
a look at the paint he had applied the night prior.

Wow---the whole car had mniscule gas bubbles all over it---terrible.

"Jack , what the hell did you do here?"

He told me he mixed the base coat as per--as well as the clear.

The stuff was still spongy, and the solvents were still trying to escape
from under the top skin of the paint.

The Glassurit folks instruct a guy to under reduce the paint--EPA regs
and all.
But by doing this, the top coat will skin and not allow the material to
set up under it at the same rate, and it'll have inverted pock marks all
over it.
Phooey.

I helped him sand & reshoot the car.
I over reduced the material to get it to lay down flat, and cure faster
so the gas pocking would stop.


Two more of my friends--( brother's) got 6 gallons of black Glassurit
from a friend of their's who runs a Monster Truck on the circuit.
Glassurit is a sponsor, and they get the stuff for free.
They passed along the savings to the brother's to paint their cab over
Peterbuilt.

They mixed the single stage Glassurit as per----
The whole rolling house on wheels gassed out.
Three days of sanding later--the mad men do it all again--
Guess what?

Same exact happeneing--gas marks all over it.

They gave me a call--"what the?"

I take a 150 mile trip--help them sand down the tuck again with 320.

I literally took whatever they had left for paint--walked out to the
burn barrel and tossed the junk out--forget it.

I went to town and bought 2 gallons of PPG Black Deltron, and the job
was all done but the shouting.

We had dinner , and I drove 150 miles back home .

Done.

As far as I'm concerned there are better products out there, that are
easier to use, to get the same job done in less time, with the same or
better durability.

The Kruat Paint in my opinion ain't all that it's made up to be.

Regardless of what Morgan is using--(this week.)
