Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

Hi James,

Your bumper sounds impressive. It sounds like a Jamie Rivers Hitch  
with a beefy bumper added on top.

Me, I think the "Rivers hitch" is the way to go. It's a quality built  
item and it doesn't change the look of the bus at all. The only  
caveat is that it might not work with certain non-stock exhaust  
setups. I don't have one myself, but every single customer that I  
have talked to was happy with it. My dad even bought 2 hitches from  
Jamie for his Vanagon Fleet.

I have also seen a bus where the owner extended the rear bumper about  
12" backwards to create a rear porch; I think it was used to haul a  
motorcycle. I didn't see how it was connected to the bus but it  
looked pretty sturdy and the original bumper was still used.

Just a thought...


Happy Trails,
