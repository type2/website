Relative strengths of common acids from highest to lowest:

hydrocloric acid (HCl, or by the old name muratic)
sulfuric acid (H2SO4) 
phosporic acid (H3PO4): the same ingredient in soda-pop.
acetic acid (CH3COOH): aka vinegar

The strength of RUST FREE will depend on it's concentration: e.g. I can water down HCl so it's less effective than vinegar so without testing it against a particular acid solution I can't say.
