Subject: 72 westy shuts down when hot

Volks,
I just purchased a 72 Westy, beautiful looking bus but..., after about 40-45 
minutes of driving it shuts down. No warning lights, or any other obvious 
problems. My mechanic tried to diagnose over the phone, and gave me a 
replacement coil, no change. It again drove fine for 45 minutes and again 
shut down. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks in advance

Vic
