Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon bench seats

Hi Dan,

A full width vanagon bench is approximately 6" too wide to be used in  
a baywindow bus. It will fit inside as cargo, but not as passenger  
seating. The 2-passenger seats will fit.

You may be able to use the baywindow hardware to secure the vanagon  
seats; but the vanagon hardware is quite different.

Happy trails,
