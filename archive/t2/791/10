Congrats from South Carolina.

I'll be honest and say I was SO tempted to force my family to move to 
Boulder (a place we love) but ultimately we decided that this year was 
not the year for this sort of life change for us.

MANY CONGRATS!

Let me be the first to say we're looking for hardware to make Puffy's 
sliding door work! Door intact...and hanging by a thread!
