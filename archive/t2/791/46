Look to see if it has a Pertronix added. Some of those types of items will die when hot, fine when cold. 

1 question would be - how hot is hot? Is it hot or overheated? 

You're going to have to get it hot and then test for fuel pressure and spark to see which one is letting you down. 

A compression test when hot would be a good idea BUT it is my opinion not wise to remove spark plugs when they are hot. A decent mechanic can listen and tell if it has compression on all cylinders while it is trying to start just by listening. 

Hope that helps... I haven't read the rest of the responses so hopefully someone has nailed the cause.
