Subject: heads for 73 bus: compatibility question

old heads (one dropped a seat):
021 101 371 Q  (air injection ports for exhaust)


new heads (bought off net)
022 101 372 3 (no air injection ports)


looks like everything will bolt up no problem,


are these the correct heads for 1700 73 bus?

http://tunacan.net/t4/reference/cylhead.htm

shows my "new" heads as being 1800.
will they still work?


should I replace both with the "new" ones I
bought, or just left side, which dropped
the seat?  I read you should "match cc's",
IE make sure both heads have same volume.
