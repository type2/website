Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield washer check valve

Re electric washer pump location being above tank-- mine is along the 
bottom of the cavity behind the kick panel, witht he tank just above it. 
  Priming is no problem, but it does run back from the washer nozzle to 
the tank and the delay is based on that.  I'd be concerned about pump 
burnout if the check valve leaks even the tiniest bit.
