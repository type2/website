of miscreants and evildoers raiding farms for their storage tank-
fulls of diesel... :-(>

Hey, had a doctor friend in Italy that kept 500 liters of diesel at his house b/c of the fluctions in price and limited availability (gas strikes). Prob some ag diesel in his tank too... <griN!> We kept 150 liters of gasoline at ours during the same period. Of course not so smart of us to have it in the garage.
