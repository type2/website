Subject: Re: [T2] Headliner Install

If you bought the kit, say from West Coast Metric, go ahead and do it
yourself. To do the sides right, you'll need to pull all the side windows
(or hopefully your seals are supple enough to be moved out of the way with
the windows in). The Bentley has some information on it, but it's really
pretty obvious how it all goes in. At least, if you have the old one still
installed to compare to.

This is something I've been studying lately. My 71 has a decent headliner
but there are a few tears. So I was looking at how difficult it would be to
repair vs replace. I think in my case there will be enough difference that
I'll repair the old one.
