Oh good, something that the less mechanically inclined ( like me ) MAY be 
able to help with.

Firstly, I'd suspect the door switch before the front light internals for 
that problem, door switches play up much of the time, they get knocked out 
of line and/or are more liable to be getting wet etc to form corrosion.

Seconly, Arnaud pointed out the dash switch which controls power to the rear 
light "I have a doubt though because there is also this switch on the dash 
(on the right of the steering wheel. leftmost button) that I believe is 
supposed to turn on one of these domes. My switch is broken and I dunno if 
it was supposed to control dome front or dome back.", well, if he wasn't 
stuck with the a broken switch he would have, that's why the rear light in 
my '74 Campmobile only has an on/off, I can turn power on/off from the dash 
as well, and it's definitely a factory switch. ( In defense of the Vendor, 
this may only be a Camper thing, maybe the "regular" Kombis & Microbusses 
didn't have the rear power switch? )
