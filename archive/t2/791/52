We had to put a new one in, and it is a PIA if you don't have the right 
tool. You also risk damaging the gear teeth themselves if you "force" 
it in."

I recently installed a brand-new Mexi Motor (1600 DP), didn't have the correct tool, I used a cut off round pencil, tapped it down into the center hole on the dizzy drive gear and twisting a bit to the left while jiggling up and down, pulled it out.
This was suggested to me on the Samba, worked well.
Reinstalling, gear would not line up per Muir/Bentley, was ~15 degrees off one way or the other, seems to be no big deal if your vacuum can is clear.
Good luck
