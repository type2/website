Subject: '79 Westy Packed and Ready to go to Buses by the Beach!

Got the '79 all packed for Buses by the Beach tomorrow NW of Grand
Rapids at Grand Rogue Campground. Lots of great buses and many good
Volks.

It's the first big bus event for my "new" bus if you don't count the
Kendallville Indiana Bluegrass Festival where there were 8 buses.
Nancy will be driving the '87 Westy.

Looking forward to total bus immersion!
