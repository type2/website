OK...Now I know why the two lower studs are too short to catch more than 
3 threads !  My setup is exactly the same, (78 2.0 L into a 74).  
Sooooooo what do I do about it?  The "holes" in the engine casing seem 
to have some sort of washer set-up in them but they are not removable 
(at least at first glance).   Can anything be done to "fix" this 
situation short of getting a new tranny?
