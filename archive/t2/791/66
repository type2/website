Subject: What did I do wrong?

A long time ago whilst experimenting, I set too much advance on my 1600 
DP type 1 motor. A few miles down the highway, my beautiful combi seemed 
to die. After letting her cool down, I reset the timing , and all was 
well. My, my, that engine was HOT!

When I got home I found I had developed an oil leak aound the 
gearbox/engine join. I put up with the leak for a long time, until last 
month when I pulled the engine, replaced the flywheel seal and O ring, 
and appeared to stop the leak dead. A few short test drives were 
reassuring - no leak.

Hooray I thought. Then after my first long run, the leak reappeared. 
Spluttering and cursing I wondered what could be wrong. To cheer myself 
up, I checked the timing - ten degrees advanced at idle! Normally I run 
at TDC, or perhaps 4 degrees advanced (I found this setting with a 
timing strobe and a set of ear muffs so I could rev  my 009 dizzy 
powered engine at 4000 rpm and check  the advance was under the 
recommended limit).

Three questions that haunt me;

What sort of oil leaks would be associated with a bad overheating 
episode? As in caused by it, and then staying even after the overheating 
was corrected.

What are the most likely suspects for my leak coming back so soon?

Was I really foolish not to check my timing after re-installing the 
engine? It never occured to me that it would change, so if it did, why?
