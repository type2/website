Subject: 73 bus tin diagrams--also vacuum diagrams

looking for these.  I have the manuals
but none are very good.

I removed the fan housing to get
the head off...  some of the head
tin wouldn't come off with the fan
housing on....

anyone know the thread specs for
the air injector ports on the heads?
I'd like to plug those.
