Emily,

Welcome back!  I haven't been on the list quite that long...only since 
about 20001.

Here are some pics of my 78 Champagne Edition that I restored....maybe 
that will provide some inspiration?

Good to see you back!

 I was active on this list in 1996-1998.  I am trying to not be chatty to
 comply with list charter but I would love to hear from any of you who
 remember me.  I figured a Friday was safe to post an intro...  Please email
 me privately if you remember me.  My last name used to be Hanlon - I helped

 the credits page which is kind of amazing!
