Gary,

Change a known good firing wire and plug with the suspect one.

In other words, pull #2 plug and wire and put it in #1.  
#1 plug and wire in #2.

Start bus and see if the problem follows the wire and plug or stays with 
#1.

Just because you get spark on the grounded visible plug doesn't mean that 
you will get it under the compression inside the cylinder.  You could have 
a "weak" plug wire.  Read Bentley about how to check/test plug wires.
You may have a bad spark plug connector.

I've seen them break internally and leave me with a great idle, but no 
power under load....and i intially broke while driving down the hiway at 
70mph.

You may have a rotor or distributor cap problem with #1 while the others 
are ok.

If your #1 plug was "wet" with gas you should be able to get it to fire
if all the electical stuff works well.

The "surge" you are feeling is an almost certain sign of a plug 
wire/rotor/distributor electrical problem.


Cheers, dave

 I'm not sure what to check next.  When driving I will occasionally get 
 a surge of power for a few blocks as if the everything is fine, then 
 I'm back to the feeling of running on 3 cylinders.  Since I checked 
 spark, I'm not sure what to check next.
