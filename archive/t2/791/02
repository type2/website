Alrighty.. I didn't know the SR87 starter and 091 Bellhousing will mesh with the
210mm flywheel
Thanks Barry Burneskis

I was under the impression the starter was tooo short and didn't engage with the
flywheel..
I think I was thinking that you can't put the SR15 or SR17 starter on the 091
bellhousing as it is 12mm too short to engage the ring gear..

Here is a corrected version...

The automatic starter,,, SR17 ,, will NOT mate with the "bigger" flywheel
<228mm>


The 1972 Trans is supposed to be a 002.  this bellhousing accepts 215mm and
smaller flywheels.. 200mm , 210mm and 215mm flywheels will work with the SR17
starter <A/T> .. or the SR15 <M/T>

The later model 091 trans uses a deeper starter ,, the SR87.. which will spin
the 228mm and the smaller ones also

you can not put a SR87 starter in a 002 bellhousing, the starter is 12mm too
long in the gear area.
I have never tried to clearance for a 228mm flywheel in a 002 bellhousing, but
the starter is tooo long and won't fit the 002 bellhousing even if you did get
the 228mm flywheel in .... afaik

one other note i just remembered.. the 091 bellhousing requires longer studs and
bolts for the engine to attach to the bellhousing... you can use spacers..   if
you have the engine from a 002 bellhousing , the bolts and studs are too short
