keep it, you'll be sorry if you don't and your kid will hate you and the
cats will stop using the liter box, all sorts of things will happen if you
sell her

Type 2's love to romp in the snow, I ski and my 78 bus never seems happier
than when it is climbing a snow covered road to a ski slope.  Break down
and get a nice gas heater for her. (check that e-thing or ask around on
the board here, I got mine from a list member)  she'll keep you and your
little one (and even hubby) nice and toasty and she will get thru.

take care

Bob
