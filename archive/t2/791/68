Warped head? At least that's happened to me with a wasser cooled engine. 
But...is the oil leaking from the same place as before? Or does it leak from 
somewhere else?

When doing major repair work it always pays to recheck the valves and 
timing. But I doubt that timing being off a bit would cause an oil leak.
