Subject: what body panels do I need?

Hi,

I'm want to restore my rocker panels on both sides of my '73 Bay Window.
Inner and outer rockers are rusted out, as is the lower track the sliding
door rides on. I 'm not sure what panels I need to order - I'm looking at
various websites and body panel diagrams and there seems to be more than one
type of inner or outer rocker panel. I'm a little confused. What is commonly
done for this repair?



Also - has anyone purchased panels from California Imports? Good-bad? OK?



Any help would be appreciated.
