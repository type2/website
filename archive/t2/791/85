Subject: Headliner Install

Greetings everyone. New to the list.  Have a 68 Type II which is in
remarkably good shape for it's age.
Opinion needed.  Do I attempt to install a new headliner myself or get  a
pro to do it?  I have asked around here (Northern New Jersey) to the various
VW shops and no one wants to touch it.  Any suggestions?
