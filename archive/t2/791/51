I had a beetle years ago that had a similar problem and it drove me nuts,
took several months but it turned out to be a tiny leak in the vacuum side
of the fuel line, when cold it was tight and didn't leak but as the engine
and the fuel line warmed a bit it softened up just enough for the fuel
pump to suck air. and it would just stop


my suggestion might be to replace all your fuel lines, you should do this
anyway and this will do double duty
