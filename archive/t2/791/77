Subject: Re: [T2] its different for dome lights

My '71 deluxe works like this:

Front dome is DOOR, OFF, ON.

Rear dome is ON or OFF, also controlled by the front switch, so both have 
to be ON for it to work. Different size than the front. My parents always 
used that switch as punishment when on long trips if we were reading or 
whatever in the back seat. If my brother and I started fighting or making 
too much noise they would toss us into darkness. I always wanted to rewire 
it like a dual switch in a house so either switch changed the state of the 
light when toggled.

If your front is not working, it is usually the door switch or wiring. For 
either it may just be corrosion or weak spring holding the bulb.
