Subject: Digital calipers

My $20 digital chinese made calipers from eBay just went haywire and I can't seem to fix it (battery, stuck buttons, etc). As soon as I turn it on the origin is set to some huge number. The same thing happens whenever I hit the origin button making measurement a math exercise.

I'm going to replace it with a better brand name. Has anyone used one of the newer IP66/67 coolant proof units? I'd like to hear some feedback if you have any.
