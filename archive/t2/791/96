Subject: Screw in plug set and taps

I am going to rebuild a Type IV motor for my '79 camper. I have several  
cases but they need oil plugs replaced. Where can I get the screw in plug set  and 
taps? Also where can I get a clutch shaft for a 68-71 buts. I have a '72,  
but it is too long.
 
Thanks
Bill
