Subject: Windshield washer check valve

Inspired by fellow listmembers I converted the washer pump to electric.
Unfortunately the location I selected for the pump is above the tank and the
pump has to "prime itself" before every usage. This will probably wear the
pump faster and it is not nice to wait 5 seconds before the fluid comes out.

I'm looking for a check valve that would fit the washer hoses diameter. Any
idea where this can be purchased ?

To make room for the coming speakers I also moved the tank to the left :

the pump went there :

too high
and here goes the switch :
