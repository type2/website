Subject: Couple Questions (doors, cold engine)

I've got a '76 camper (I believe a Hi Top as it's called?) and it has
a 1.8LNon Fuel Injected with the Dual carbs off a '72 transporter.
My first question is about cold starting. It starts alright, but idles
terribly when first started. Will idle for 10 secs and die. Also, if you put
it in gear, and try to take off, or even just rev the engine with the gas
pedal, it will die instantly. As soon as you touch the gas pedal, the only
luck I've had is if I put it in gear before I start it, start it a couple
times and just go, let the cluch out and floor it. It will chug for a
second, etc.
I've tried to adjust the idle up (infact, it's pretty freaking fast,
probably 1000 or 1500 rpm, I don't have a tach). I'm not very experienced in
carbs so I'm a tad afraid to go mucking in it (cause there's 2).

2nd, simple question. One of the outside door handles won't work. The button
just clicks, it doesn't do anyting. The inside handle works perfectly. I'm
sure this a common problem and I've pulled the door pannel back (but not
off) and I can't seem to see where I'd fix it. Anyone have any suggestions
on how to fix it?

Thanks,
