Subject: Oktoberbus counting down

It's ONLY 29 days until Oktoberbus 2005!  I'm tellin' ya I'm really 
excited about this year and the new location.  Don't forget to bring a 
pumpkin to carve for your entry in the carving contest.  Of course, 
you're not limited to just one pumpkin.  For more info and directions, 
visit the ufishul Oktoberbus web site,

29 days can be converted to one of these units:
2,505,600 seconds
41,760 minutes
696 hours

Less than 4 weeks!!!

I'm going to camp at the site tomorrow night because I want to camp this 
weekend but couldn't afford to go to Fire on the Mountain.  There's a 
meteor shower happening and a Full Moon too!
