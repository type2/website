Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser tubes

It's not noramlly but if somehow the intake was damaged or rotted out that
it was, it would cause huge issues. I believe that is extermely uncommon to
near impossible though as they tend to be carbon clogged instead, and the
center casting would prevent that even further..

Good luck on your hunt. Mostly they happen at the dual port rubber boots or
the dual port manifold ends to head connections, if you still have the
original DP in there.
