Subject: Starter continues on

Hey Folks,
I had a 60 DC with 1600 DP hotwired and taken for a joy ride.  I just got
the wires re-connected to the ignition switch, and I have power, and it
starts.  Problem is the starter will not quit once it starts.  This is a new
issue.  Is it related to the wiring?
Anyone have thoughts or ideas?  This has been converted from 6v to 12v, and
yes as a novice mechanic, I do have wires left over, no clue where they
go...

Thank You in advance


Make it a Great Day!!
