<then grab the short ones with a pair of
locking pliers (vice grips, FUBAR tool) and back out the existing studs>

Or thread 1 nut onto the stud, then another and then tighten them together. Will allow you to remove the stud without damaging it. They might useful for something else or someone else... 

Just a suggestion...
