Subject: Re: [T2] dist. drive gear?

Hello Gail  No it will not have one and it is important that you set the 
engine up on TDC  and install the drive gear in the proper direction. Also be real 
careful with the washers under the gear use grease to hold them in place 
before installing the gear. later  Mark Dearing
