Subject: 78 Flywheel Seal Tips - Oil Leak Fixin'

I'm pulling my engine to fix an oil leak on Sunday.
I ordered the rear seal, oil ring and gasket from Bus
Depot. 

I'm hoping someone can clarify I am on the right
track:

1. The O-Ring goes inside the flywheel.
2. I will pry out the old rear seal, put a little 
engine oil on the new seal, put a piece of wood over
it
and gently tap the wood with a hammer to seat the
seal.
Sound right?
3. I'm not sure where the gasket/washer goes. It's
metal and has the 5 holes so I am assuming it must go
 between the flywheel and the engine. Right?

I'm going to check for leaky oil galley plugs at the 
same time. I can't pressurize the engine with it out
so
I am hoping any leak will be obvious.

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks
