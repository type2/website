Subject: Re: [T2] dist. drive gear?

Our brand-new Mexi Motor (1600 DP) did NOT come with a dizzy drive gear 
in place.

We had to put a new one in, and it is a PIA if you don't have the right 
tool. You also risk damaging the gear teeth themselves if you "force" 
it in.

That was our recent experience.

Best,
