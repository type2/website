Subject: Re: [T2] Digital calipers

Bob,
I'm only seventy so not an old phart like yourself but I do have a an old 
Sears vernier caliper which I find difficult to read nowadays. Accordingly I 
have a Harbor Freight Dial type caliper and an HF digital. I find even the 
dial type to be harder to read than the digital. I'm surprised that at your 
age you are still able to read the vernier.

I had the same problem Richard describes with the digital and found that in 
my case it was just a low battery. Ace Hardware carries the batteries for a 
buck or so.

Personally I have found the "get what you pay for" rule to be often untrue. 
I have many expensive things that are very unsatisfactory (poor values) and 
quite a few inexpensive things that I value much more than what I paid for 
them.
Regards,
Phil
