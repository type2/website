Subject: Padded Parts

I am still working on my '72 Bus.  I am looking for the padded part just
behind the front driver and passenger seats on the top.  One of mine is
starting to split and I would like to replace them.

The Headliner is now installed, it needed 9 guage wire to support the new
headliner.  Now my Bus is really white inside.

Thanks
