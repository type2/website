Hi Frank,

I think you have the ignition wires confoosed. The ignition should be  
a 2-stage switch. Stage 1 is power to coil and accessories. Stage 2  
is a momentary contact that sends power to the starter solenoid.

The symptoms you describe lead me to the conclusion that you have the  
starter solenoid wired to the coil wire power.

Happy trails,
