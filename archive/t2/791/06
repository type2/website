I just saw this add, and thought maybe someone on the list needed parts (not
a camper)

At the coast this weekend, my blue 84 Vanagon broke down. It has 190,000
miles. I can't afford to fix it right now, so I had it towed to junkyard
where it awaits a cubed death. It's got a blown head gasket, and there's a
short somewhere in the electrical system, probably the starter because it's
starting on it's own when connected to a battery. Other than those major
things, it's in good shape, haha. The body is rust free and very straight.
The interior is in wonderful shape. The tags are current through 2006. I'm
hoping someone wants to resurrect it. It's at the coast, in Seaside. If you
can get it to where you are, it's yours. Email me if interested. Brandon
