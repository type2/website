    check that #1/2 plug wires aren't switched. I've only done this =
about 189
    times.

    John

    That solved half of it...I fell like a dumb***.  Now i am running on =
2, 3, and 4..................I am going to switch  a wire on number one =
and see what happens...............

    Compression test came back at 120 for one and two..........



    Kadron jets are as follows: 130 main (the one in bottom of float =
bowl)

    150 air corrector (or is that the main? sort of on top between the =
venturi and the float bowl..........

    52 idle.

    Last time I changed mine I was recommended to use the paper ones.  I =

    have any scientific evidence as to whether they are better or not, =
