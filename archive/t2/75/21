The con to placing the filter before the pump is that the restriction 
of the filter will reduce the absolute pressure in the fuel line and 
possibly cause vapor lock.  I think that this is a good location for a 
filter, but be sure to use a filter with a lot of filtering area (not 
the little plastic wonders you see on VWs) and make it a regular 
maintainance replacement item.  If your bus suddenly gets fuel 
starvation on a warm day, don't forget what you have installed!
