Dear John & Bill

An M10 x 1.0mm bottom tap should be readily available through good tool 
suplliers, but it might cost more than a few pounds or dollars.

M10 x 1.0mm, is the standard thread size for metric brake pipe fittings, 
some domestic electrical fittings, the oil-pressure switch tapping on 
VW-Audis, VW 2000 Type 2 valve rocker screws, etc.

Regards.

        Nigel A. Skeet
