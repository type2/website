As I said, try any of the other lists (Scions of Lucas...;-)
to see what other chronologically challenged car owners
are asking...VW parts are at the very least, available, and
reasonable - again, at least the parts to keep it running.
Some cosmetic parts are rare, but they're not essential
to the driving experience.
Try keeping something like an Armstrong-Siddeley alive;
or a Citroen, or an Alfa Romeo, or even an American car
like the Allstate...8-(
