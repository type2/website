Subject: '78 Bus, Advice for Engine & Trans Replace

Hi Guys,

My bus has been running like sh** lately. Hard to start, idles rough, etc. I =
decided to do a compression test. Last time I did this I had two at 130 and two =
at 90. This time, the highest cylinder was 80 and the rest were lower. At 25 =
psi on one cylinder, it's not surprising it runs rough. What IS surprising is =
that it will still to 75 mph on a flat surface ;-)

Anyway, I'm getting myself committed to the big cash outlay for the new motor =
and I'm also thinking of putting in a new transmission while everything is =
apart. The transmission I have now works fine, doesn't pop out of gear, it's =
just noisy and a little fussy about reverse. Does this make sense or am I going =
to be disappointed with the quality of the rebuilt trans? I hear of rebuilt =
ones popping out of gear and being a PITA. If I go the rebuilt trans route, I =
want the new one to perform better than my current one.

I am thinking about getting an AVP motor and Rancho trans through Bus Depot. =
Any comments, suggestions or things to watch out for?

Thanks much!
