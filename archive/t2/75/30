Hi, Bryan--

Not sure where you're located, so this may not be much help geographically, 
but here in Portland OR I've been talking to Kevin at Auto Glass Past and 
Present (503) 224-4485 / (503) 781-5710 about putting a new windsheild on my 
1970. He said he would have to order it, but he made it sound pretty 
routine, not like there was anything unusual or difficult about getting it. 
You might want to contact him and see if you can find out his supplier? 
[Although, in your original post, you seemed careful not to use the word 
"new"--are you interested in new glass, or do you want to rescue a used 
piece?]

Hope this helps

Bill
Beaverton OR USA
