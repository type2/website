HI all;
I'm new to the list; I have just bought a 78 Westy this summer and am =
new to the Air cooled VW scene.
My girlfriend has been a VW nut her whole life and I helped restore her =
74 Bug a few years ago.
Right now I would like to put a 2nd battery in my Westy, one to power =
the auxiliary stuff and one to start it. Anyone know how to do this!
Thanks! =3D)
