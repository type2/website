Subject: Re: [T2] Tilt bed????

Shouldn't be too hard to build one to sit on the bed of your truck.  You
might want to contact a local small trailer sales and find out if they have
any dump bed trailers, you could get ideas from that.  It won't be cheap to
build one.  You may be better off just buying a dump bed trailer and pulling
it, that way the weight is on the trailer axle, not your truck.  And you can
pull a trailer with different vehicles, but once you put a dump bed on your
truck, it may be hard to remove it.  The little dump bed trailers use a
cheap floor jack to raise the bed.
