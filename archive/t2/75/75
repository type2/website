====================>
That presumes the vehicle to be capable of such a trip, and I have done 
this very thing on three occasions.
Drove a bus from Georgia to Houston.
Drove a bus from California to Houston.
Drove a Notch from Chicago to Houston.

On each occasion, I flew to the pickup point, spent the night with the 
seller, and drove off the next morning. The trips were rewarding and the 
feel was excellent.

On the chance that the trip karma might change, I was packin' plenty of 
tools and the basics of spares.

My memories of those trips? .................. awesome !
Kind of like a first date with someone really fine all way 'round.
