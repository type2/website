Clark,

The answer is "no", altho I am mystified by the question.  The exhaust on
'72-75 has heater boxes with trapezoidal flanges on the rear end.  In
'76, VW changed to triangular flanges.

The thing that mystifies me is that '72-75 did not have a crossover pipe!
Look a figures 5-2 and 5-3 in the engine section of your Bentley manual.
From '72-75, the muffler connects directly to the heater boxes.  If you
*have* a crossover pipe on your bus, then it is possible that you have the
'76-78 exhaust and if that is true, then the '76-78 crossover pipe will
(of course) fit.
