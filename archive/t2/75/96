Subject: Westy Tent

Mom's and Dad's Boy's and girl's--

I amaze myself sometimes---

Again Dr. Terrence has approriated another factory tent-----

Here's what;s wrong with it----

The two poles that hold up the flap are missing, and 3" of the rubber
connecter flap that hooks the tent to the Bus / Van needs to be sewed
back to the tent material, no bag for the tent---the thing other than
that is clean as a whistle---- very little use--------

Jen---- here is your chance to get a real nice tent---

Contact me via P- Mail for specific's----


Hasta Lavista,
