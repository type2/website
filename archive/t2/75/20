Well, this list is about bus technical issues, and you're reading the 
combined problems of about 1000 listees.  Buses are not inherently 
unreliable, but as with any 30-year-old mechanical device they do 
require regular attention if they are to work well.

A bus will not go 100K miles without a tuneup, like a "modern" car 
will, but on the other hand any failure will be much less costly than 
that of the "modern" car.

 One story recounted - as almost miraculous -  driving 2,000 miles 
without a major problem.

If one's bus is not in good repair, this can be considered a miracle.  
OTOH, I regularly take 4000+ mile summer vacations in my '71 with no 
problems.  My bus is in good (not perfect) stock condition and I have 
no problems with driving it anywhere I want to go.

 What's the scoop? Am I going to have to get into the Tao of VW repair 
or go nuts in denial (turn the radio up when I hear a noise, take it to 
car wash when it seems to be over heating, etc.?)    Trudell

No, you pay close attention to the signs and signals of your bus and 
put things right before they cost you big $$$.  Buses are usually quite 
eloquent in voicing their needs if the owner listens.  Very seldom does 
a problem heal up by itself.

Welcome to the group!
