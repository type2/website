Subject: ''76 Pertronics?


Hi Folks

I have a stock dual vacuum distributor on a l976 2000cc FI. 
Does anyone use a Pertronics ignitor on one of these setups and does it work 
OK?
Somebody told me that the Ignitors do not trigger the fuel injectors in these 
models of engines and only standard points will. True?
The Pertonics folks are vague about this issue and only say it "may" work, to 
try it.
Easier and cheaper to ask the list first.
Thanks
Bucket
