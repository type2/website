Prescott. Blue and white. No name. The owner wanted to find it a good =
home. I had done something similar for my oldest. I had gotten him a '72 =
Chevy and he worked on it for 5 years before he was legally driving. =
When he drove off into the proverbial sunset, he was mechanically =
confident and proud of his vehicle. My youngest wanted a bus and I'm a =
"former" hippie. I wanted one too! After purchasing it and reading all =
the stuff on the net I got scared and thought I had let nostalgia get =

develops his mechanical abilities while transforming his vehicle. I =
thank you all for being out there and have truly appreciated all of your =
responses!     Trudell
