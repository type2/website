Woah!  I've never seen a Torx fastener on a VW bus.  The CV bolts are 
either triple-square (usually) or Allen hex.  The triple-square can be 
undone only with a triple-square wrench, commonly available from VW 
suppliers in the form of a 3/8 inch drive socket.

If the bolts are stubborn, spray your favorite penetrating oil around 
the back of the stub axle flange, on the wheel side of the CV.  This is 
hard to get to, but this is where the threads live.  Spraying the heads 
of the CV bolts won't do much good.

When you reassemble, put a dab of anti-sieze on the bolts!
