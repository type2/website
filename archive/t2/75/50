Subject: fixed - Re: [T2] Understanding AFC fuel injection--question

My first post was confusing.. I retyped it:

Adam,
Look at it this way, it's just like opening the throttle valve a little
more, which in turn will let more air in, which will deflect the
AFM\flap and give more fuel.

This is the same thing that the aux air regulator is doing, but it is
controlled via a thermo switch.  When the engine/regulator is cold, it
is open and allows more air into the manifold.  As the engine/regulator
heats up, the valve closes and less air is allowed into the manifold. 
The air that goes through the aux air regulator and the air that go
through the throttle valve both come from the same place and end up in
the same place; the aux air regulator just allows *more* air so you
don't have to have your foot on the gas pedal at startup.  But it's
pretty much just the same as pressing on the gas pedal when you're
starting your car.. just automated.

Lastly, there is a temperature sensor built inside the AFM and there is
also the temp sensor on the heads.  Now, these are both on the 76-79
models, so I'm guessing the same or similar with the later models.

What I do not get is the process when it is starting cold.....air flows thru the AFM, and if the motor is cold enough, the auxillary air regulator is open, and air is diverted to the intake manifold, thus bypassing the throttle body.  This book says that this enables the motor to act the same cold as it does hot, for the control unit adds additional fuel to the injectors when it senses the engine is cold.  Now, there is no sensor, or anything on the throttle body, so how does this auxillary air regulator do anything?  The air still ends up in the intake manifold and thus diverted to the cylinders anyway..................I could see it doing something if it were unregulated air, but it is regulated at the AFm.................
