I'm taking the opportunity of a long wet winter to go through my newly =
acquired 71 westy and right some of the wrongs that have been done or =
have happened to it in the 30 years of its life.  At this point I've =
completely gutted it and am putting a stop to the rust thats there.  In =
the living area (from behind the drivers seats to where the floor starts =
to slop up at the rear wheel wells) I've sanded the rust, applied rust =
inhibitor and given it a dash of paint for durability.  After looking at =
how the westfalia floor was originally created (1/2" ply, 1/4" ply, =
vinyl) I'm wondering if there isn't a better way.  Here's my thoughts, =
and please would someone stop me if this is a horrible idea.  First I =
was thinking of applying a spray on truck bed liner to the floor (but =
not in the seams, so as to avoid trapping any water that leaks in from =
the outside through the pan should holes form in the future) as a =
vibration damper.  On top of that laying a 1/2" slab of hard, closed =
cell Styrofoam (like is used to insulate houses, only thinner), and then =
on top of that lay a sheet of 1/4" plywood followed by some indoor =
outdoor carpet.  It would seem the foam would still adequately support =
the plywood and unless I decide to start wearing spike heels, the 1/4" =
sheet should be solid enough for walking.  The big advantage would be a =
reduction in weight.  Alternatively, I've considered looking for some =
sort of honeycomb material (even cardboard) with a sheet of masonite =
applied to the top.

Sorry for the rambling.
