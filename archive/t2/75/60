Subject: Sliding door is balky

I just finished painting my 72 Riviera.  I removed the slider and link for
the sliding tur.  Previously, it worked perfectly, but after I put the
slider back in, complete with oil and grease in the appropriate places, it
became balky.  It works fine once I pull the back end away from the bus, but
it won't open with a mere twist of the handle as in days of yore.

Whaddya think?

Regards,

Grant
