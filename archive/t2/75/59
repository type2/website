Subject: Financing a Car

Volks,

As I was composing my reply to Graham, I had occasion to visit an
amortization calculator.  What it told me was that financing a $20,000
loan (about the price of a new minivan) for 4 years at 8% interest would
leave you with a $488.26/month payment.

Now I know our buses are not new minivans... I would stoutly maintain that
they are *better* than new minvans!  At the same time, they still cost.
In line with my post to Graham and my recent post to Trudell, finances are
an important part of owning any vehicle.

First, I maintain that time, materials, and money are the same thing
expressed in different ways.  That is, you can trade one of any of them
for another.  You can trade the brake job you do for the cost of materials
(~$100) plus your time spent doing it for the brake jobe done by a good
mechanic ($400).  You are trading time not spent under the bus for money
not spent on other things, for instance.

Second... *IF* you figure that *any* vehicle is going to cost you about
the same amount, *AND* you figure that amount as half of the price of a
new car ($250, compared to the minivan), *AND* you start depositing even
half the cost of a new car in a separate "car account" every month, *THEN*
within 5 years, you will be driving a show-quality, new-condition bus,
even if you do no work yourself.  If you work on it yourself, you will
have a very large surplus in the car account! That surplus may even be
even enough to buy another bus!  :-)

Third (and lastly :) An important note, in line with my post to Trudell,
is that you *may* need a significant "down payment" to get thru the
initial "year in hell."  If you get into the game without a "nut", then
you will likely go broke before the jackpot hand.
