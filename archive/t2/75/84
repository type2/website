     Mikes right about having the hole spotlessly clean, you'll never get the 
Allen in far enough if your compressing crud in it.  As for the water pik, 
Mike your a brave soul, I'd never make it out the door without my wife going 
totally nuts!!  So I settle for a pick tool and a little WD-40 to flush them 
out.  I myself have a 6 mm Allen with a 3/8 drive.  I put this on a 3/8 
impact, a couple of quick taps with a hammer and they free right up.  This 
also helps out those that have been rounded out.  I have also been know to 
use the impact to put them back in on problem vehicles.  My lifted Thing was 
so bad about it,  the impact helped, but didn't cure it.  I finally had to 
safety wire the little buggers.
     My norm on the CV's is if one is bad, I as well might as well clean, 
check, relube the other end.  I've often kicked around the idea of mounting a 
zerk fitting to the boot so I could freshen up the lube, but I've just never 
found the time.  Hence I just to the squeeze thing whenever I happen to be 
under there.
                                                                  Peace and 
Happy New Year,
