find body shops in your area to give you estimates.  give the estimates to
the insurance company.  if they refuse to give you a reasonable amount to
get your bus repaired, threaten to sue them.  they will likely pay up.  i
think they are required to give you a reasonable amount.  those estimates
are your best weapon.

good luck,
