Subject: The 232,000mi bus lost a clutch cable!

Well, the 232,000 mi engine turneth yet, but yesterday evening about 12
mi from home I felt a pop in the clutch pedal at the McDonald's window
and the bus began to self move.  Killed the ignition, smiled sheepishly,
said "Oops, just broke the clutch cable", and started it up in first,
lurching away at the same time.  It was too cold to shift just using rpm
matching and so I drove home at a very slow 12 mph in first gear!  Now
mind you, I changed the original cable at 150,000 mi and it was still
working; but this lasted only 80,000- and failed right at the junction
of the cable to the threads, twanging all but 2 "subcables".  Has
quality gone downhill?  Does the LUK heavy duty release plate have too
much tension compared to the stock one?  Beats me, but today I got out
the spare...messing with grease is no fun in 20 deg weather and quit
after finally getting it down the tube.  I'll finish it next year (-8 
FROHES NEUES JAHR!
