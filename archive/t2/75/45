"I bought the '73 bus for my youngest son. "

Good for you, Trudell.  I wish I'd better appreciated the '60 bug that four
of us five Hartranfts passed from kid to kid, and learned more about it's
mechanics.  It was a great first car.  Say what you will, I think one of the
worst things anyone can do is buy their child a "perfect" car.  They'll
never have a clue as to what to do when it grows old or hiccups, and (from
what I've observed) just keep buying those same kinds of cars forever,
missing all sorts of fun opportunities and paying too much.

By the way, there's a good chance he'll be the only kid he knows who can
drive a stick shift.  Teach him to double clutch and not only will the
tranny last forever, even his driver's ed teacher won't know what he's
talking about.

Best of luck to you both.  This list is a great group for situations like
this.  Happy New Year!
