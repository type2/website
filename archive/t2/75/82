Subject: cv bolt removal tips

Can't get at all the cv bolts?
Get the wheel off the ground by getting the bus axle tube or side body
tube on a good jackstand.  Then you can rotate the wheel to get the cv
bolt into position for removal.  The hanging wheel puts enough angle on
the axle so it's out of the way of the lower positioned bolt.\ Spraying
with penetrant or using heat is iffy because the threads are way inside
past the full width of the joint! Clean the hex hole carefully; blow it
out with compressed air or use a water pic filled with hot water to
blast the hole clean.  I use a 6mm allen socket that you put on a socket
wrench, but also have used an unbunged 6mm bent wrench with and
extension made from 3/8" pipe.  With the socket head you can tap on the
socket itself with a small sledge to shock the hidden threads.  Keep the
head square in the socket  as you apply torque.  If you have a sliding
handle for the socket, you can tap on it with  the hammer as you apply
torque.
   If all fails (you bunged the hole) try a vise grip on the head.  Get
a dremyl tool with a FIBER cutting disk and slice off the head as a last
resort.
