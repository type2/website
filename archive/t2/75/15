Subject: Fuel filters

Well I didn't get my fuel lines replaced today because I had trouble getting
new line.  I clipped off a piece of my old line, took it to the parts store,
and said, 6ft of fuel injection line this size, please. (I did say please)

Advance just didn't have it.  Auto zone gave me regular fuel line, though
adament that it was FI line.  Oh well, it is for a carb anyway.

I did notice while under the Bus there is no fuel filter.  I'd like to put
one in, albeit in a more convenient place than where it should be.  What do
some of you do for fuel filters?  Pros/cons for locating it before/after the
fuel pump?

Much appreciated.
