Dear Simon.

I managed to find the article at home. It's as follows :-

Dave Cormack, Installing Gene Berg's Kadron Carb Linkage, VW Trends, 
November 2000, pages 72 to 75.

The relevant caption, from Jon Chabot of Top Line Parts, is on page 74, 
which describes and illustrates where the two vacuum connection need to be.

Jon Chabot, Top Line Parts, 2910 East Miraloma Avenue, #C Anaheim, 
California, CA 92806, USA

Tel. (USA) 714 630 8371

I imagine that it would be possible in principle, to add vaccuum connections 
to almost any carburettor; including the Weber or Dellorto.

Regards.
