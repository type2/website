hi
I had a crack in my my windshield awhile back and wanted to replace it.
I did -a lot- of searching and ended up using these guys.
Diamond Triumph auto glass  #1-800-333-2935
I believe they are a franchise throughout the united states.

When i ordered they asked if i wanted the top of the glass tinted or not.
I was very impressed with these guys, they had my glass in stock when i
called
and they deliver and installed it for free.  I think i called on a monday
and
ended up getting it installed on a thursday. very quick
They had the least expensive glass - total was $125 for everything
they might even have the other glass your looking for

by the way, they didn't have a windshield seal so they ended up using the
one i bought. I guess they usually supply a seal. You might ask if you order
from them.
