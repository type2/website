Reread your second sentence. You just bought a 29 year old vehicle. Anybody 
with
cars of the same or similar vintage will tell you that their lists are full 
of repairs,
too. Unless you've got the time/money/expertise of Dr. Tim, your bus is 
probably
going to be subject to a great deal of "sorting out", before it's completely 
rebuilt/
rehabbed/ to whatever degree you think it should be.
You neglected to mention the condition of your bus...Is it a body-off 
restoration?
Or a found in a backyard when we cut the grass? Somewhere in between? Makes
a bit of difference when judging reliability...
Be more specific about what you bought, and I'm sure the list will be more 
than
willing to assist you...
