Christopher,

If you have an allen wrench, then I fear you have the wrong tool.  I have
never had good luck with the short "L" shaped allen wrenches in this job.

Go to Sears tomorrow and buy an 8mm allen socket.  On a 3/8" drive ratchet
or extension handle with a 1' cheater pipe... *then* you have the torque
you need to remove those bolts.  The torque spec for them is not that
high, but they have been in place for 20+ years and will take 100+ ft./lb.
of torque to get started (which is why they need to be clean and why a
little L wrench won't touch them :-(
