Another question, what is everyone's experience with the AVP rebuilt Type IV
engines, such as offered by The Bus Depot.

****************************
I am running an 1.8 ltr. AVP long block rebuild in my 74 that the PO
purchased directly from AVP but never installed. I put it in right after
getting the bus and I'm now coming up on 10,000 miles without any problems
that can be attributed to the rebuild. I was careful while breaking it in
and I probably change the oil more often than is really necessary. It
doesn't leak a drop of oil anywhere, runs like a champ, and I'm very
satisfied. Of course, YMMV.
