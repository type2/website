Subject: Rebuild kit 4 2000

Just as the sun sets so does gloom always follow this poor 
"loooooser"......, got the FI system straightened out on my '78 (elvis) 
only to find the valves are shot in one head. So I need to find the best 
deal  on a complete rebuild kit for it, it comes out - it goes back 
rebuilt......
   also......
 my '73 is shot too and needs a rebuild...but Since I have another 2000, 
I am thinking of rebuilding it and putting it in the '73 instead of the 
1700....pros-cons? goods-bads?
       

                                            Thanks,
                                         scott in N.C.
