This time, the highest cylinder was 80 and the rest were lower. At 25 psi on one cylinder, it's not surprising it runs rough. What IS surprising is that it will still to 75 mph on a flat surface ;-)

The transmission I have now works fine, doesn't pop out of gear, it's just noisy and a little fussy about reverse. Does this make sense or am I going to be disappointed with the quality of the rebuilt trans? I hear of rebuilt ones popping out of gear and being a PITA. If I go the rebuilt trans route, I want the new one to perform better than my current one.
