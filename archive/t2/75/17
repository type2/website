Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filters

Hiya Mike,

I've run into a variety of opinions on just where to locate an inline fuel 
filter.  I'm sure you will get a sample of those various viewpoints.  Here's 
mine...............
Locate your fuel filter BEFORE the fuel pump and OUT of the engine 
compartment.  

The reasons for this opinion may be self-evident but here they are 
nonetheless.  Locating the filter before the pump actually makes the pump 
work in favor of keeping the filter connections tight.  The suction of the 
pump helps to insure the connections stay connected.  Of course these 
connections at the fuel filter should be clamped.  But this position still is 
much preferable (at least from a safety standpoint) than locating the filter 
after the pump.  In this position the pump is working to put pressure on 
those very connections.  This is especially dangerous as the filter is 
located in the engine compartment directly over the engine.

Granted, it is much easier to change out the filter if it is located in the 
engine compartment.  But the more awkward position (usually in line between 
tank and firewall) of the filter is a small price to pay for the added margin 
of safety.
