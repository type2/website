Whoa!

It musta been a *bad* day for someone...I'm getting to the point
where I am having trouble finding straight 30 weight in my brand.

I must say though, that like everyplace else, it depends on who is behind
the counter.  The guys at my NAPA place are really nice on Saturday 
morning...even to the point of offering me a "fleet" discount for some
dynamat that I was considering buying....they thought the price was
outrageous too!

Cheers, dave
