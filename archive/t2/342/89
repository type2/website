Well I finally made it up to Rudi's Schaffner Motors
in
North Seattle. Lost my gas cap so it was a good excuse
to go for a visit.
http://biznw.com/schaffner/
  Aside from a selection of nice buses and bugs for
sale
he has a HUGE selection of parts that he has pulled
over
the last 30 years or so. Rudi has been part of the VW
community for a long time and is very pleasent to talk
with.
  I got a chance to look at a bus that a guy was
picking up that Rudi's shop had replaced the engine
in.. very nice.
  Rudi sends his machine work out to NW connecting rod
which also has a good reputation.
  Long and short.. if you are looking for those
elusive
bits and pieces go to Rudi's! Need a reliable
mechanic?
Just want to look at a impressive collection of VW
toys and parts.. a good place to spend some time
looking.

take the 220th st exit off I-5 and go to hwy 99 an
go right for about a block.
