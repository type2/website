Subject: EveryBus Carabus through WV  - Route opinions Wanted

Hi Volks,

Everybus is now only three weeks away. With the Ontario spring thaw now 
only a few hours away here in the Great White North, I can hardly wait.

The Carabus I will be travelling with will have 4 or 5 buses, and we're 
looking at shaving a few hours off the trip this year by on coming 
through West Virginia on i79-19-i77 from Morgantown through to 
Bluefield.  If we make good time we'll camp out at the state park in 
Beckley, but if we don't get that far the first day we might end up 
closer to Morgantown. Either destination puts us in good range to get 
to EveryBus on the second day.

If anyone has any suggestions about this route, ( I pronounce that 
"r-ew-t" BTW) please let me know. If there's a private camp you can 
recommend or driveway you can offer, I'd be happy to hear it.  If there 
are hills to be avoided or campgrounds to stay away from I'd like to 
hear that too. And if people can warn me about where NOT to buy gas, I 
might shave a few hours off the time it took to get there last year.

Happy trails, and Thanks in advance.
