Subject: VW Parts - JC Whitney???

Hey guys,

 

            Quick question.... I haven't purchased a whole lot of parts from
JC Whitney before, but what I have gotten, I've been pretty satisfied with.
I understand that the JC Whitney catalog has a decent selection of
Volkswagen parts. How would you guys rate their parts, particularly
suspension pieces and whatnot. I plan on rebuilding the suspension in my
BUS. I also need the steering components (center-link) to my 81 Bandit, just
curious what kind of quality they provide.

 

 

Thanks,
