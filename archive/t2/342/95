As Robert says, despite his experience, many listmembers have positive
things to say about AVP.  I'm one of them, not just as a retailer but as
a customer and listmember as well. Not only have I been selling AVP's
heads and engines for years, but I've had them in several of my own
busses and Vanagons. I have never had one fail.  

In my experience with perhaps hundreds of AVP products, I'd have to say
that Robert's experience with AVP is far from typical. (Not to discredit
him, as I have no knowledge of his individual case.)  In fact, quite to
the contrary, I wish all of my suppliers were as conscientious,
professional, and consumer oriented as I have found AVP to be.  

AVP is a small, family run business that specializes in Bus and Vanagon
engines, not a big assembly line operation like GEX and the now-defunct
SIR.  Leonard, the owner, is directly involved in the rebuilding, and
you deal directly with him or his wife, Erin (who, for the "boss's
wife," knows more about type 4 engines than I will ever know :-).  For
years they have been using the same "no-dropped-seat" design that
now-defunct Mark Stephens heavily promoted, and indeed I have never had
an AVP head drop a valve seat. This is a dramatic improvement over the
original design, which had a weakness in that area and a tendancy to
drop valve seats if overheated (a weakness that still exists on the new
heads from AMC, or so I'm told).  

Contrary to Robert's experience, I have never even once heard AVP say
"sorry, not our problem" in response to any warranty issue. Then again,
I've almost never had an AVP head or engine fail, but when there was an
issue AVP has always stood behind it 110 percent.  In one case, where
there was a misaligned exhaust stud on an engine, they not only
air-freighted another head at their expense, but even reimbursed the
customer's mechanics labor charge (despite the fact their written
warranty covered neither labor nor air shipment). In another case, where
an engine failed and showed clear signs of abuse, they still split the
tab with the customer. I can't think of any other rebuilder who would
have done that.  They are also very fair with core deposits, even going
as far at times to offer partial refunds on cores that really were junk
and of no use to them.  By comparison, most other rebuilders I've dealt
with tend to view core deposits as a profit center, and look for any
excuse not to refund the core deposit. In some cases, to get your whole
deposit back, you'd have to send back a core that didn't need rebuilding
to begin with!  

Does that mean that you cannot possibly build a better engine or head
than an AVP?  No. I'm sure that if price and time were no object, 100%
original OEM German parts were used, hours were taken on every minute
detail, etc. you might have a better product (depending on the
experience/abilities of the rebuilder). Certainly there are some
individual mechanics out there who are as good as AVP (but may not use
the improved valve seat design - a major factor in long term reliability
in my opinion - and may not have a lot of experience rebuilding type 4
engines in particular, another important consideration).  Also, while I
have not personally had any experience with Bob Donalds' work, his list
reputation is also excellent.  But based on hundreds of experiences and
years as both a bus owner and parts retailer, I do not hesitate to
recommend AVP.
