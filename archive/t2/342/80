Since JC Whitney is right here in LaSalle, IL and only about a mile from my
house, I was wondering what accent the kids had.  I'd say that the bulk of
the employees are out of high school.  You might be right about the IQs,
though.  

Whenever I've gone to their outlet store, however, I've been served by
normal adults.  The 18-23 year-olds generally work the warehouse.
