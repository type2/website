Subject: bee expert needed

yes, it is bus related!!
i have a T4 case on a shelf, and when i went to move it, i found it 
had been infested with halictid bees. mason or carpenter, i'm not 
sure (blue-black, bees one to a chamber).
anyways, i'm not a 'hose 'em with beekiller and be done with it' guy 
- i need to know how territorial they are, as i want to move the case 
to a shelf where i'm out of their way, and they're out of mine, and 
don't feel like being sting a zillion times.  a nighttime move to a 
prepared spot is the plan.

do i win an award for weirdest question today?

"Why of course the people don't want war. . . . That is understood. But,
after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy 
and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it 
is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliamnent, or a 
communist
dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to 
the  bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell 
them they  are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack 
of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same 
in any country."
   Hermann Goering during his Nuremberg war crimes trial
