Subject: replacing brake booster, how hard??

Hey Listees,

I am wondering how hard it is to replace my brake booster. I've heard it can 
be hell getting them off. Hoping to hear from some people that have done it 
so i can decide if this is something that I can tackle myself or if i should 
have my mechanic do it. I'm fairly mechanical and have dropped my engine 
twice.

Thanks in advance.
