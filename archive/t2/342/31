I've seen bars broken after being adjusted too high (for more clearance)
on Baja Bugs, but have never seen one on a bus.  My bus has been driving
around for 8 years on readjusted bars and is still at stock ride height.

Has anyone on the list broken their bars after adjustment?

For metal in continuous flexing like torsion bars, the fatigue life is
usually designed to be infinite.
