George(and others),

I have seen a lot of people talking about torsion bars lately and the 
group thought on it seems to be that hi mileage vehicles(bugs and busses) 
probably just need both sides replaced.

The reasoning is that the metal is fatiguing after 30-50 years and 
adjustment may help for awhile, but apparently the bug folks are starting 
to break theirs after adjustment.

They should *always* be replaced in pairs.....

I am getting ready to adjust mine as I only have 132k on the bus...I don't 
expect them to break.

As always YMMV!

Chers, dave
