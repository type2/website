silver nasa bubble insulation sold at home depot in 16" or 24" or 48" widths. can 
make permanent panel pieces or removable ones. works on the inside or outside (if you 
use it as a wrap) for repelling heat (sun) or keeping heat in from the cold outside.

i have a riviera (straight up pop top) and one roll $19.99 24" works perfectly i can 
wrap the window level of the bus keep the top fairly closed and frost stays outside 
and inside nice and toasty. (just got back from a week with nite temps in the 20's in 
canada and it was wonderful) used it in arizona in january around the window level to 
keep the solar heat out! used it in oregon freezing wrapped around the pop top fabric 
since my son was sleeping up there and bus didn't loose heat in the night like normal.
other folks have taken and made 'covers' for their ice chests and been able to easily 
keep a block of ice for a weekend in the summer.  '
other folks i know with vanagons have precut pieces to velcro up on the inside of the 
wedge cloth top (need the 48" for that) and/or also cut window size pieces to use 
inside in winter also.
but i just got mine in october and think it is super.

  I am wanting to insulate the
> inside top, can someone who has done this give me some ideas of the
> materials to use?
