Subject: Need a Bus Checked in NC

Could I impose upon somebody in the Chapel Hill area to look at a bus for
me? It's a Vanagon. Type 4 experience would be lovely but any willing body
will do. Compensation provided in the excessive beverage/chili modality at
Everybus if you say this bus is a go.

Thx,
