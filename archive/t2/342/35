Subject: WVA I-77 / free camp spot

Greg,

The stretch of I-77 from Bluefield to Wytheville is a steep stretch of
interstate, (for my old 1600SP at least) with only a few exits along the 25
miles or so.  There isn't an easy way around it if you are going south from
West Virginia.  Not to dissuade you, and I love West "by God" Virginia, but
I remember making some of the grades at little more than 30mph loaded down,
northbound anyways.  If you have strong Type IV buses then you will probably
shrug off "the mountain" easily.

I don't think you will "shave hours" by going through West Virginia compared
to the Blue Ridge, but it is definitely more scenic and much less truck
traffic than the forsaken I-81.  I prefer the U.S. routes if I have a few
extra hours, but I understand that you are driving very far and with limited
vacation time!

If you go that way, there is a free US Army Corps of Engineers campground,
always open, at the base of Summersville Dam just off of U.S. 19 near
Fayetteville. pmail me for details.  Also keep in mind that Mark Dearing's
(VWBrain) VW shop (Salem Import Service) is in Salem-Roanoake VA.

Hopefully I can convince my SO (SHMBO) so we can make the trip to EveryBus
this year!
