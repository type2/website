Subject: Can I borrow a backyard in Bellingham, WA?

I was looking at eBay and came across this auction

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2407192920&cat
egory=6763

for all kinds of VW parts, including several Vanagons.  Anybody in
Bellingham, WA have a backyard I can stack all this stuff in, after I win
the auction?

(It's a joke folks.  Just wishful thinking.)
