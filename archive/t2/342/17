Pink insulation is good.

Foam board for insulating the outside of houses is good when covered in 
vinyl or upholstery for appearance. Very lightweight.

Foam rubber used under upholstery (3/4" thick) or carpet underlayment.

Go to a fabric shop - some specialize in foam and neoprene.

$3 a yard locally approx.
