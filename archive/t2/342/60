Subject: rebuilt 2L heads? where?

Hello,

So, who gives the best heads?  =O

Bus Depot sells heads for about $189 + $40 core, and shipping. 

My mechanic said he has some he trusts, but they are about $280 a piece,
which seems a little high, unless that is an expected rate to pay and
the ones bus depot sells are not really the greatest in the world, or
whatever, but ive always liked everything I got from them, so im just
looking for personal experiences. 

The place my mechanic gets them from is called JCS, and they are out of
southern CA. 

There was one thread in the archives with someone asking about them, but
there was no response, so who knows. Someone wanted them from AVP, but
AVP was backed up and couldn't get them in time. 

Any thoughts? 

Christopher
