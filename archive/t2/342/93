Subject: RE : Got my second bus tonight

Good go on the second bus(westy is a good campermobile
I have a 81). The brake cylinder the same to rebuild
as a brake cylinder, take it out, take it apart,clean
and hone it. Get a washer for it at the local FLAPS,
put it back together and bleed the system. Phil
