Subject: RE: [T2] VW Parts - JC Whitney???

I know they do take things off their catalogs, but believe it or not, they
actually sell more than what's on their catalog. They can also special order
things. I used to have a 1982 Recaro TransAm LU5. I wanted a set of headers
and they sold a fairly decent pair (turned out to be FlowTECHS). They didn't
offer the Y-pipe however.. in their catalog. I called up the order number
and they ordered me the Y-pipe at their own discounted price.

In the last couple of JC catalogs I got I noticed a serious reduction in
the VW parts they carry. Down to like 2 1/2 pages. Bus specific stuff
pretty much gone.
