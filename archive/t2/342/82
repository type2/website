Subject: Got my second bus tonight

Well I really hope I Haven't made a mistake but I bought my second bus 
tonight! I wonder if i can actually call it a bus without getting the 
list mad at me? It's an 81 westy, so I guess that makes it a van 
technically. It is air cooled though so that's cool with me.

On the hot side, It has a real heater in it. That's important to me 
being I live at about 7000 ft elevation.

On the negative side, it needs a  slave cylinder for the clutch  to be 
movable under her/his own power. Is there such a thing as a rebuild kit 
for this or do I have to get the whole thing?

I also need the sliding door handle and maybe some of the inner workings 
of the latch. Not too sure because I haven't taken it apart yet. But the 
handle is laying on the floor inside. looks as though the Hulk wanted in 
when the door was locked. Does anyone have one just cluttering up their 
shop? If so I'm interested
Thanks
Tom

P.s. I hope my 75 doesn't get jealous
