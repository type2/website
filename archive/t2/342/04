Dear vwbus(-at-)ckoon.org,

I am a beekeeper and a bus owner; it is my pleasure to
help, though I know little of the Halictidae.  However,
as the Halictidae are also wasps and most are foraging
pollinators, perhaps my beekeeping knowledge will be
of some use.

A nightime move is the right idea if you want all the
foragers to be at home, otherwise a portion of them
will be out and about.

Is this a room that is cold?  Almost all wasps are
torpid below 45(F) and probably cannot fly below
50(F).  Cold might be your best friend if your primary
motive is to move them for a few minutes without being
harmed yourself.

If your motive is to convince the hive to live on a
different shelf, you may have some trouble.  At least
with honeybees (Apis mellifera) a hive must be moved
something over a mile for the move to take.  If the
hive is moved less than that, the foragers leaving for
the day will not reset their location and will
therefore return to their old home at the end of the
day.  It is that they are moved over a mile (about
one minute of arc) that forcibly resets their homing
location.

A beekeeper relocating a hive would wait until dark,
strap the hive tightly together and plug the entrance.
This hive would be transported as a unit to the distant
location and the entrance plug removed after a period
of quiet but before sunrise.  If you mean to relocate
your hive of Halictidae, and there is an entrance to
actually plug, perhaps you would copy the beekeeper's
procedure.
