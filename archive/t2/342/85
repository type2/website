i checked, these prices are usually less than half of catalog, PLUS 
i'll pay shipping if you use paypal! cripes, me paying shipping on 
the crank alone will save you $15!

also some 36 and 40 hp items:
what i would LIKE to do is get someone to take it all, or all the 36 
or all the 40 hp items - give me a fair offer, i'll box and tally 
shipping, and off we go; i'm not interested in cherrypicking, but if 
no-one ponies up for all of it i'll consider it as a last resort 
(well, ebarf is the last resort).
i understand that much of this stuff might be considered junk or easy 
to find in your neck of the woods, but YMMV.
i aslo have a few 40hp cases, but those seem easier to find... pmail 
if interested.

if you ARE serious about buying, pmail me and i can dig the stuff 
back out of the boxes and provide details.
