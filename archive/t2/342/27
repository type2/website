Eric,

Oh!  The side marker on the rear should have a bulb in it..fronts are 
reflectors...ummm... rear should have a bulb I think, just like the other 
side.

On my 78, the rear of that side marker light tends to get whacked 
everytime you move the battery in and out.  Should have a ground and a hot 
wire and turn on when you turn on your running lights or front beams.

Beware of removing it as the little plastic tabs that hold it on the body 
break easily when they get old.

Cheers, dave
