Hey, Greg.  

By taking I79 to Rt19 to I77 you won't be in my
neck of the woods, so I don't have much info re:
camping.  I know that John Anderson lives in
Morgantown, but I don't know anyone else.  John
hasn't been on the list much.  Bloss is living a
little west of Charleston.  I'm about an hour
west of Charleston in Huntington.  

I do know, however, that the Rt 19 thing can be
dicey.  The terrain is hilly and there are speed
traps like crazy in Summersville.  Don't laugh,
I'm talking 55 to 35 deals.  

Summersville has a state park, and I'm sure it's
cheap.  I'd expect $7 USD for the night.  I
haven't been there for decades.  I doubt you'll
have trouble finding a space but you should call
ahead.  Burnsville and Sutton are also
possibilities.  Here's a link to the state parks:

If you're really interested in scenery, diverting
a little east and taking 219 from Elkins to White
Sulphur is a beautiful trip.  

If you took I64 to Charleston, you might be able
to hook up with the Ohio Valley Tribe heading
south out of Cincy and Columbus.  

Good luck,
Ray
