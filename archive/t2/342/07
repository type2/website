  Type2parts.com is expanding heavy into the post 67 bus parts market (due
to customer demand) and has been building up inventory, testing product for
longevity and fit for the last year (testing done in house and by bus
drivers). 
  bpierce send me your address and I will send you 4 lens to install and
report to me and the list about for FREE. I have a couple sources for these
and just received another shipment from a new source. I sell these for less
then 5 dollars each

I need a suggestion from the collective wisdom of the list.

I bought a set of side marker lens for my bus 18 months or so ago.  All 
four, front and back, are starting to turn white and the plastic is 
brittle.  Has anyone gotten a set of side marker lens that have lasted a 
long time and is satisfied with them?  If so tell me where you bought 
them and I'll go there.

Thanks for your help.

Bradley,
79 bus
