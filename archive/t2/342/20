Subject: RE: [T2] side marker lens

I have an expanded question about side markers, as I have been dealng with
mine for about a week now.

First of all, I only have 3. I have the 2 red ones on the back, but only 1
orange on the the front (driver side). There are NO holes on the passenger
side to mount one.

Secondly, The front is only a reflector, is that the way it should be?

Third, I cannot get one of the rear lights to work. I replaced the bulb and
checked the connections, seems to be OK. Perhaps I need a new light
assembly? Any Thoughts??

Thanks
