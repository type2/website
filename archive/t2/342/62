Glad to see that the JC Whitney tradition continues.  20 years ago it
seemed as though half of their stuff was drop-shipped from Venus.  What
you did get was often not in good enough shape to use.  I once received an
order consisting of four H-4 headlight bulbs and a Delco alternator.  They
were placed loose in the same cardboard box with _1 sheet_ of newspaper
for padding.  After a trip through the US postal service the bulbs
consisted of two well-hammered metal bases and glass powder.  The
alternator worked fine, though!

That was my last order and I still received catalogs regularly for the
next 15 years or so.

And better for your bus too.  Cheap parts are often more expensive in the
long run in terms of aggrivation and damage.
