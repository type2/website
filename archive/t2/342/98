I had a Solex single progressive for a while on my 1835 DP.  Ran OK but had
a problem with running too rich, maybe a stuck float valve, I would be glad
to sell you the one I have so I can get rid of it.

Three choices I would offer:

	1.  Dual Kadrons
	2.  Dual Weber ICT's
	3.  Dual Dellorto 34 FRDs

The Kadrons are easiest to find new but I don't know much else about them.
The Webers and the Dells are simple and very similar--34mm, single throat,
no choke.  I am running the Dells ("Baby Dells") now and am very pleased.
Took a while to locate the linkage pieces and set up but it is a wonderful
difference. (hauls)

Don't be afraid of dual carbs, buy a good synchronizer and plunk down the
cash for the setup.  There are lots of dual carbs for sale on thesamba.com
at reasonable prices.

> B. Can a 1776 engine be retrofitted for fuel injection?

yes, but does not comply with your "simple as possible" objective.
