Subject: squeaking/squealing noise only under load?

i can't figure out what it is.  Definately nothing to do with the alternator because I removed the belt and it still happens.  Only under moderate to heavy acceleration between about 2600 and 3400 rpm's.<p>

Maybe the noise could even be described as a whining/whistling tone.  Because it is a '72 westy i don't have the inspection cover in the rear hatch, but I did have a friend drive while I held open the rear hatch and engine bonnet.  Could not determine where it was coming from other than the engine bay.  Wheel bearings? I doubt it.  CV's have been repacked.  A piece of tin resonating?  Maybe, but I don't think so.<p>

any ideas?<p>

 

Paul.
