Miles,

On 1971 and earlier buses with the type1 engine, the rear vallance bar is
removable.  On 1972 and later buses it isn't. While the complete engine
can be slid out from under the bus without lifting the body if you are
willing to remove the jack from under the engine, many people prefer to
lift the rear of the bus to get the vallance over the engine while it is
on the jack.

OOK!
