Rest of the world was getting dollars rather than tens of dollars. In neither case did I see proof of their cost so I cannot comment on their cost. 

I've found that the prices even varies between dealers in the same city.

Their system provides list and net prices. I believe that last valve adjusting screws I bought were $1.99 net, $3.07 list. Finding a dealer that will sell to you at net price is difficult.
