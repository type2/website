Subject: Re: [T2] another reason to drive old cars

LOL, seems to me all this device will do is give fleeing suspects even more
incentive to put their foot to the floor as hard and recklessly as possible
in order to keep at LEAST a 500 foot leed at all times over pursueing
officers...

I'm sure it's real easy to convince the PD that some cop fried YOUR car that
was parked nearby as he tried to zap a car he was chasing at 70mph.

I'm also not particularly keen on putting a radar gun in cops hands thats
capable of saturating the air up to 300 feet ahead ahead with a conicle
microwave field of "approximately 10 or 15 kilovolts per meter"... may be
you trust your PD to use that type of weapon responsibly, I don't. ;-)
