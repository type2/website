Don't get too excited guys...Diane Sawyer said something to the extent
of, "she and her daughter go camping in their 'Scooby Doo van'..." as
they showed the picture of a late 70's green and white camper with a
straight up pop top. It made me cringe, bad PR!  Nice to see she has a
bus though. Paul

Well, crap. There's another reason to absolutely love Terri Hatcher. Not
only is she fine as all-get-out, but she's in the Bus fraternity.
Snoopy, can I try to get her into the FMBC? I'm willing to do whatever I
can to get her into the.....fold.
