Subject: Re: [T2] High-lift jack?

Okay, folks.. please forgive my ignorance, and especially please forgive that
this is my second "why do you use a jack to do that?" posting within a week.
(The previous one expressed my surprise at the perceived need to jack up one's
Bus to remove an axle.)

So, here goes: how is a jack to lift the rear end of the Bus useful in
dropping an engine?

When removing/reinstalling the engine in my '71, I've always just used a floor
jack to support the weight of the engine (with a wood block between the jack
and bottom of the case to protect the oil pan) and one helper to make sure the
engine doesn't get out of balance and fall off the jack.  I also use a 2x4 and
chains to support the transmission, per Muir.  After separating the engine
from the transmission, it's always been necessary to rotate it about 30
degrees on its vertical axis in order to clear the engine compartment
completely, but it's still a fairly painless proceedure.  Is it this rotating
of the engine that the jacking avoids?  Or is there some other challenge
that's unique to later-model Buses?
