LoL!!!

By "harmony" they must mean that harmony that Primus has reached.

I *do* like and appreciate electronic ignition, fuel injection, and
basic engine management.I think having 3 O2 sensors, 2 head
temperature sensors, oil pressure and temperature sensors, etc, a bit
extreme for a simple 4 cylinder engine however.

The FI installed in the late bays was just fine and I'd love to have
that system on my 73. And I will someday....
