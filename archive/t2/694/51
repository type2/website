Hey Mark

I can figure out how do you feel about to re-doing jobs, but although there 
is always a posibility to install a brand new but bad part the posibilities 
of that part to be in good working order is for far bigger, in the other 
hand IMHO the amount of work to replace a clutch (4 bolts and some elbow 
grease to tak the engine out) do not justifie all the guessing with the 
tranny.

My two cents on it.
