Dave,

Thanks for the reply.  I thought that there might be a EE out there that
could create a small circuit that might be able to do the trick and produce
a digital readout.

Wayne,

That temp sensor pretty much just tells the computer that the engine is 
"warm"...and no more fuel enrichment is necessary.

Here are the curves

Also, you would need a very good multimeter to tap into it without 
upsetting the computer reading.

If it worked that easy, then we would all be doing it instead of expensive
CHT gauges and sensors....but! if you find a good, easy, cheap way to do 
it, we will all be grateful!

Cheers, dave

 I thought I read that on late bays with F/I the F/I computer uses an engine
 temp sensor to help regulate fuel delivery.  If this is true, is there a
way
 to 'tap' into the information provided by this sensor to provide readout on
