Subject: High-lift jack?

Sorry for the simple question (it's Friday, though, right?!)... I need
to pick up a jack today for working on the bus this weekend, and I
forgot to measure this morning before leaving for work. Do I need a
"high-lift" jack, or will a standard jack do the trick? It seems that
16" of lift might not be enough (high-lift gives me 21"). This is for
jacking up the rear end for an engine drop on an '83 Vanagon.

Cheers!
Mike.
(if you don't hear from me on Monday, things didn't go as planned, and
I'm still stuck beneath the engine!)
