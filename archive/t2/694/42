Not for me. I'm living vicariously thru all your questions. You bring up
scenarios that I haven't thought about, and the list comes up with
solutions, which is what the list is all about. And when our buses were
built and sold, they were built to be driven anywhere, and at any time. So
what if a few years have happened since they were built, the dependability
can still be there. Keep the questions and the updates coming, 'cause I'm
sure there's a lot of us contemplating doing just what you're doing.
