Mark,

#1 yes you can leave clutch hardware out.

#2 yes, but why....is this trans a new unknown quanitity?....or are you 
just paranoid?<grin>.  The problem will be how to shift with no shifter 
and how to pull the clutch arm back enough to use it.

I have used a pair of vice grips on the hockey stick in order to shift it, 
but it's rough on scoring the metal.

Make *durn* sure you have everything strapped down and blocked up...yer 
gonna get some serious torque when you shift.

Cheers, dave
