OKay first here Mark. If you run for 20 minutes before you install the 
engine you might be a little too tired to do so. Sit down and have a glass 
of water in between events. ;-)

I don't see why you couldn't do that but why would you want to? No bell 
housing I guess. Just make sure it is in nuetral(states obvious).

This does not sound like a good idea. There wouldn't be any significant 
loads on the tranny and I am not sure that spinning the sh!t out of it and 
changing gears on the ground would benefiet you anyway except that you will 
know clutch sort of works. What will you use to operate the trhow out lever, 
well that is easy. How will you know if the clutch will slip under load?
