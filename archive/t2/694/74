  With all due respect, I have run the Weber center-mounted carb on my
1.8ltr for 45,000 miles without ANY icing, or any other problem for that
matter. And this is a daily driver; rain, shine, snow, sleet, cold, or hot.

I get a solid 15 mpg city and 18 - 20 mpg highway. I've driven 2000 mile
vacation trips and 20 mile commutes with only regular maintenance.

Maybe I'm just lucky.

Regards,
Dave
