OK, this may be a dumb question, but here it goes.  

I thought I read that on late bays with F/I the F/I computer uses an engine
temp sensor to help regulate fuel delivery.  If this is true, is there a way
to 'tap' into the information provided by this sensor to provide readout on
a gauge?  Would this reading be of any use?
TIA
