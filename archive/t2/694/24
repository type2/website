Subject: Bilstein Shocks - Friday non-Bus content

List,

We have a pair of Bilstein HD rear shocks for VW Rabbit 'til 84. They also
fit Scirroco to '84, same vintage Jetta also I think.

These were special ordered by a customer who then backed out of buying them.
I would like to offer them to anyone on the list at our cost. We don't deal
much with early water coolers, so I would like to blow them outta here.

If anyone is interested I can provide details via pmail.

Thanks,

Scott Lyons
