I wouldn't worry too much about radar guns...If On Star and other
new-new systems in cars can open your doors if you've locked
your keys inside, it stands to reason that the same system can
disable your car...The same data base might be made available
to PD's on a "need-to-stop" basis...BTW, some college students
already hacked Ford's (IIRC) chip in the key security system... ;-(
There are already some "black boxes" in some computer controlled
cars that record driving habits...The premise was the same as for
aircraft...The data could be analyzed after a crash to facilitate
improvements in safety equipment...Rent-a-car companies, how-
ever, were using it to ferret out chronic speeders and basing
rate increases on that information... ;-(
