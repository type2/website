Subject: Reburbishing egr filter flange

I have a standard 75-78 exhaust system, with the exhaust elbow 
(021-251-531) between crossover pipe and cat. The egr filter flange on 
the elbow is very soft. When I bolt it up, the bolts tend to distort 
the flange, causing a leak.

The whole elbow is ripe for refurbishing, and this flange especially. 
I'm thinking it might make some sense to fabricate a new flange and get 
it welded up. Because of the clearances involved, an improvement might 
be to use 1/4 mild steel and tap the two holes, or at least the one 
hole where a thicker flange will reduce clearance for the nut behind 
it.

Does anyone else have this problem? Is there an easier/more sensible 
solution to it?

Mark
