Hey Mark Sounds good to me  that is bar harbor but maybe not this time of the 
year better in warmer time of the year. I would have choosen Key West for 
now.  The Allman Brothers are one of my fav road riding groups.  I got to see 
them a bunch , saw them play with the dead and also The Band  later and have fun
