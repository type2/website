Gregory,

You will get many opinions on this....mine is to fix the Fi, I think you 
will have far fewere idling problems with it than the center mount that 
you can't get warm in cold weather.....leads to carb icing...

I doubt that the J tube part has affected anything on the FI.

How much work have you done on the Fi and what kind?

Cheers, dave
