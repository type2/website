I ran the same idea past my father a few years ago -- he *teaches* the EE's 
-- and the short version of the conversation is that while it's certainly a 
feasable idea, it's really not cost-effective to do so.  Cheaper to buy a CHT 
or pyrometer that's already on the market .. unless you're planning to 
"step up" to aircraft-quality gauges.
