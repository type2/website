Subject: Accelerator linkage.

I'm looking for replacement parts for my accelerator pedal Specifcally #17 from http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t206200.gif   (Thanks richard for the great site BTW)

at least that's what was on there. 8 months or so ago I found a similiar part at my VWFLAPS but it was for a bug. I adapted it so it would work (DPO Style :(  ), but the plug weld holding the post on broke and bus no go. I'd rather get the right part this time, and maybe some thing a little more durable.

TIA
