Subject: Too many questions?

I get the sense that maybe I'm asking too many questions.

But consider the aim: I want a bus in my driveway that I could climb 
into on a moment's notice and drive from San Diego to Bar Harbor, Maine 
and back with just an oil change in Bar Harbor. No "can it make it?" No 
calls on AIRS. Just driving, looking at the scenery, and listening to 
Allman Brothers on my iTunes.

And if I can do it, anybody can do it.

Mark
