Looking for old Friend

In Dec 1999 we were transferred overseas and had to sell our old friend "The
School Bus".   She was a Brown and white (picture here -
http://www.aircoolers.org/images/09-14-2004smaller.jpg) 1969, nine passenger
bus that we had been in our family for over 15 years.  We adopted her in
1985 from her first and only owner, a minister, in Visalia, California, and
her California license Number was XML 726.   We had to let her go, she had a
few dings, but was complete and well taken care of.   A Navy Family adopted
her in December 1999.  We have been back in the states (Lemoore) for a year
and have not seen her, so I don't think she is still in the Lemoore,
California area.   I understand the family was going to make her a "Hippy"
or "Flower Child" Bus and paint her with wild colors and flowers, but I'm
not sure if that happened.  

We just want to confirm she is enjoying her new family and maybe see a
current picture.   If any one knows of her current location, it would be
greatly appreciated if you let us know.  If she were looking for a new home,
we would love to have her back.         

Thanks
