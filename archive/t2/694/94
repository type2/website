Too funny!

Someone beat ME to that punch line. The thought of ANYTHING being 
harmonious in the world of Dell/Micro$quish is a RIOT.

On the Mac side, we're planning on "integrating" our trusty old 
PowerBook Lombard that has a DVD player and 14" screen into our 69 Bus.

And by integrating, I mean that there will be a safe/sturdy compartment 
to place it in, and a few charged spare batteries, so that we can have 
an on-the-road entertainment solution for our kids.

Now THAT'S harmony. And if we had a decent mobile wireless solution 
down here in the Lowcountry, I could stream RadioParadise through 
iTunes while on the road as well. I would dig that to no end.
