Mark asked:

 2. Once I've determined that there are no oil leaks (fingers crossed), 
 can I install the clutch hardware (new), bolt the transmission back on, 
 and test the clutch? That is, can I make gear changes and so forth with 
 the transmission out of the bus? And if so, should I test with the 
 engine running? Or would a "static" test be satisfactory?

Wow!!!  How are you going to move that short arm on the bell housing?

I will never want to shake your hand if you can disengage the clutch by hand!!
