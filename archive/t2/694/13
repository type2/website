<I don't know much about Honda dealers, but I can tell you that this is not
the case with VW dealerships>

It has been my experience with 2 different VW dealers that I cannot afford them. $65+ for a set of pushrod seals that the rest of the world sells for $16 (this was 1995), and the clip that holds the timing gear on for $65+ (again!) from another dealer. Rest of the world was getting dollars rather than tens of dollars. In neither case did I see proof of their cost so I cannot comment on their cost. 

The only VW dealers I have had success with were online. 

I so WISH the dealers I deal with had reasonable prices. I remember black plastic center caps (1 piece, only plastic, no emblems beyond what was molded into the plastic) for my Nissan p/u. Size of a dixie cup. $40 (?) each across the counter. 

These days I might check with a dealer but in most cases I do without or buy over the Internet. 

Chris
