Subject: Stock FI to progressive carb, any thoughts or comments?

I am thinking of scrapping my current factory fuel
injection on my 1975 1800 for a progressive 32-36
single carb kit.  Anyone have any experience with
this?  Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated. 
My bus is non-operational right now because I cannot
get the FI to idle, and I am at the end of the road
with that.  So I thinking of alternative solutions.  

As a side questions, does anyone know if removing the
J-tubes, and flapper boxes while leaving the heater
boxes on would affect the FI.  I removed the J-tubes
and flapper boxes because they were rusted and left
the open heater boxes in place until i can replace
them.  I wonder if this screwed up my FI.
