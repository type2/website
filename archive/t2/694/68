Subject: Flywheel bolts

Well, I am depressed....

Our story so far: Barry Burneskis gave me an engine he picked up that is
of unkown quality.  It's your basic long-block with no flywheel included.
I am thinking of it as a base for a rebuild but before I go tearing it
apart I want to check its condition.  If it turns out to be a good used
engine, I might very well do nothing with it other than install it!  In
order to check the condition, I wanted to check compression.  To do that,
yu have to crank the engine which means installing a flywheel.  When I was
down in Salem a couple weeks ago, I asked Mark if he had any spares and he
gave me a flywheel which would be fine for cranking it.  At this point a
"neuron misfire" occurred... I did not think to ask for/get the damned
bolts!

So:  I went down to the hardware store to buy a couple bolts just to hold
it for cranking.  Came back with the bolts and attempted to bolt it up...
Wrong thread pitch!  So I went by VW this morning to (a) find out the
correct pitch and (b) buy some if they had any in stock.  Well, the
correct bolt is a M12x1.5x22.  That's 12mm diameter, 1.5 thread pitch, and
22mm long.  ONE POINT FIVE PITCH!!!!  The standards I am used to for M12
is that 1.75 is standard and 1.25 is fine thread.  My local non-chain
FLAPS has both in the correct lengths.  My local non-chain hadwares tore
has both, again in correct lengths.  Neither had ever heard of 1.5 pitch
in M12!

Thus:  Anyone in the DC area got a spare set of type4 flywheel bolts I
could borrow/buy?  I could order from VW but the parts guy says Wednesday
and I'd like to check this engine this weekend. :-(
