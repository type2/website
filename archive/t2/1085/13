David,
Thanks for your advice about fire extinguishers which I plan to take.

Still wondering what made the accelerator go full-on. If this hadn't 
happened I would not have opened the engine compartment and would have been 
on the freeway possibly fully engulfed in flame at the rear and the Fire 
Dept would have taken forever to access the car. Very fortunate to have 
happened on a City street. Even worse would have been for the fire to have 
occurred in my neighborhood or driveway in Los Gatos which is heavily wooded 
and could have set the whole neighborhood/town on fire.
Phil
