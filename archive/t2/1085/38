well the engine compartment is 15 cu ft, (not counting engine)and
because it is an air cooled car the bottom is sealed pretty well.

so with a 25cu ft system it seems it should be enough to put out the
fire. or at least make it a lot easier to get it knocked down.

would still carry the trusty dry chemical if needed as backup.  have
changed fuel lines etc, but paranoid and would prefer not having to
watch the bus burn.
