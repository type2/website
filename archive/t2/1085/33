I'll again suggest a gasoline rated solenoid valve on the bottom of the 
gas tank. If there is a fire turn the key off and the valve springs 
closed (normally closed, takes electricity to open it).

A valve with it's handle connected to a long, long choke cable might 
also be a good idea.

Turn of fthe gasoline flow and the fire ought to be much, much easier to 
fight.
