Subject: Clutch Pressure Plate

Hey Volks!

So I just bought a used Sachs Pressure Plate; happy to finally have the correct size. The alignment pegs on the Fly Wheel do not easily go through their intended holes on the Plate. How snug should this fit be? I don't yet have the Clutch Disk so I don't want to use a rubber mallet to tap them on for fear of it not coming back off.

Speaking of Clutch Disk - is it possible to use (uh, re-use) the smaller 210mm Disc with a 215mm Plate? Really just curious as I intend to buy a new Disk.

Thanks, as always,
