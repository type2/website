There is always the Corvair and transaxle option... 95HP is the best 
version (low compression, best heat resistance), 110HP is more 
compression, 140 HP is better but much more heat sensitive, and there is 
even a 180HP turbo. Doubt that would last in a heavy vehicle. Might 
always be on boost.

Several of the Corvair guys have fuel injected their engines. Nice 
upgrade. Even a five speed conversion available for the transaxle.

Anyhow engine and tranny is not hard to install. The factory design 
quirks have been worked out and eliminated like the leaky pushrod seals 
and the fan belt that would flip off under spirited driving. The pushrod 
seals are upgraded to Viton - a material not available to the factory 
back when. The fan belt is a cold adjustment situation - don't get it 
too tight when it is cold so when the engine gets warm and expands - the 
belt won't get too tight and flip off.

Virtual Vairs is the name of the list where the Corvair experts talk. 
FastVairs is where the hot rod Corvair guys talk.

Plenty of spare parts still floating around. Some still being produced 
new. My local auto parts store can get fuel pumps and gaskets and tune 
up parts.

LOTS of info here at Type II in the archives about the conversion.
