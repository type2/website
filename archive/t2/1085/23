Halon is a greenhouse gas, subject to the Montreal Protocol, and hasn't 
been produced since 1994. I'd be very surprised to find it being used 
for any new installation.

At least one fire suppression system for service stations uses a dry 
chemical system: http://www.pyrochem.com/html/prodatten.html.

Besides the regular dry chemical extinguisher I carry, I also have a 
few CO2 paintball cylinders, with manual valves, which could be used as 
fire extinguishers.
