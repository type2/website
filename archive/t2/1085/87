Subject: ignition trouble

We are having problems with our 1973 Transporter ignition switch or wiring. 
When we leave it sitting overnite, it starts on the ignition but then after 
a ouple of tries, it no longer works off the key,not even a click. Dash is 
all working,,horn, signal lites, etc,,,just no starter.. We know the starter 
solenoid is good as we can start it no problem at the starter.  We are going 
to check the ignition switch next, by getting into the wiring harness up 
front.  Is there anything we should look for in particular?   Any help is 
appreciated.
