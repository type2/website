I'm all for abandoning 30 y/o technology (where applicable).  If I had 
the time and money, I'd go for the Subaru upgrade.  However, there are 
some significant hurtles in that mod.  The other route to go, albeit 
expensive (well, it's all expensive regardless), is this:

I'm very impressed by the quality of work that comes from Jake.  He 
talks his stuff up a lot (which pisses many people off), but he 
definitely knows his stuff and make a very good effort to back up his 
claims.
