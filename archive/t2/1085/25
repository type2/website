I work in the transit industry and almost all buses (the big ones)
have systems like this in their engine compartments,  I looked into
putting one into my bus but even a small system was a lot of $$$$$
probably more than most buses are worth, several thousands.

am looking for a system from an older fast food joint which are
required to have a CO2 or similar system over the grill and deep
fryers in my state... but I have been considering a system like this
and possibly a nozzel under the bus that will flood the underside of
the bus with CO2 or even just water not because that would put out the
fire but it would cool things down possibly enough for the fire to go
out, especially if I have the fuel system shut down....
