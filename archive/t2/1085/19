Nice! I hadn't seen the vid, but had read this awhile back; apparently
that's really his VW:

"The cover of "Roadsinger" is a cheeky nod to his Cat Stevens era; it
features a snub-nosed 1969 Volkswagen van decorated with the iconic artwork
from the "Tea for the Tillerman" and "Moonshadow" album covers. (Yusuf owns
the van and drives it around London.)"
