I know it's not Friday but you guys will like this.  Today's 'Zits' 
cartoon. 

Teenager thinking out loud to his friend:

'I have my drivers license, a 1962 VW van and a little under 40 bucks in 
my pocket.'

Sigh....

'There is a certain melancholy that comes with achieving all of your 
life goals at such a young age.' 

His buddy's punchline:

'So what are your plans for retirement?'


If only life were so simple. 

Maybe part-time AIRS emergency dispatcher?  ...   :)

Hey, I cleaned out my storage unit today and found something I forgot 
about having:  An instrument panel.  My odometer hasn't worked since I 
got the bus.  So I may try to redo this speedo before I do the paint and 
refurb.

Ciao....KR
