Subject: Bus passed smog!

It's a good day when the bus passes smog.  Granted, it's always passed
for the past 3 times, but I always worry that it won't ;)  I was
especially worried because this time I have new Super Stock heads from
Jake Raby with larger intake and exhaust valves.  Plus, I put in new
pistons and cylinders and only did this rebuild 500 miles ago.  That
said, the bus passed with numbers well below the minimums!

If you want to make sure that your bus passes CA smog, get yourself a
wideband sensor and adjust your mixture so your cruise AFRs land around
14-15:1 and you should pass.  This was with the EGR installed (made a
huge difference in NO) and without a cat.  I *believe* that I do not
need the cat because it's an out-of-state model, but I don't know if
they've even checked anyways.  I'm kinda curious how much of a
difference the cat would make if I installed it.

So, now I might venture out to get a new cam like the one in Raby's
camper special.  I might also look into getting the earlier exhaust (pre
75 or so) as that should help with head temps, but I'm more interested
in the cam.  However, I don't have much reason to tear the engine apart
right now as the new heads seem to be holding very nicely.  At the last
valve change, all the valves were in check, which was a very, very nice
feeling.  I'm sure keeping the head temps consistently under 400 has
helped me in that area.
