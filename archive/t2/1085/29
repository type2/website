Cool article.  As some of you know, I design fire protection systems
for special hazards (power plants, computer rooms, etc) so I've worked
with all the Halogenated hydrocarbons, the inert gases, dry/wet chem,
CO2, etc.

A lot of them are impractical for, especially moving, vehicles.  C02
is used for total flooding applications (impractical for bus) and for
local application, which would still be tough if you were moving.

The halon/inert gas products are just difficult because of cost and
the manufacturers often sell specially certified, UL listed, FM
approved, NFPA blah blah blah systems.  They're not going to sell you
a bunch of parts to cobble together so they can get sued when you burn
down.

Dry chem is pretty accessible though, a good application for the bus,
and any of your local fire protection contractors or fire equipment
(extinguisher) sellers can obtain it.  The controls are often
pneumatic/mechanical (restaraunt systems) often self contained in a
panel sized enclosure with nothing but the control cable and the
supply pipe coming out of it.

Might even be able to find such a thing on ebay, look for
manufacturers like Kidde, Ansul, Chemetron, Figge, etc.
