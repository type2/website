You attempt to seal the hazard when you use a total flood application.
 CO2 is heavier than air and would eventually sink out the bottom of
the compartment.  How fast, I don't know.

When we flood a generator at a power plant, we shoot for about 37%,
and reapply in timed stages to make sure the fire is out.

This is done with fire alarm control panels with programmed logic and
sensors and whatnot.

Gets overly technical for the engine compartment of a T2.
