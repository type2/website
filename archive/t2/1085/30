This guy seems to have the best online price I find actually, doesn't say what
a longer remote cable costs, but probably not too bad.  Could probably do a
5lb system with remote to the front of the van for $400 or so depending on how
much shipping goes for.

Well actually racers do install Halon new still, just like R-12 it still
exists, just is all recylced/reclaimed and you don't want to pay for it.
