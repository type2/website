Good writeup on static timing- yes, when the points open is when the 
field collapses and the spark is induced in the secondary coil. A timing 
light or voltmeter connected to the (-) side of the coil and ground will 
turn ON just when the points open and will turn off when they are 
closed.  You can do this without a light- there will be a small spark at 
the gap if you have points. He points out that the Pertronics Ignitor 
(1) can be static time but one must limit the amount of time current 
flows through it without rinning to less than 3 minutes, and the Ignitor 
2 cannot be static timed.
