And this guy seems to have a 5lb system with a 15 foot remote cable for $350.
 
(Cable is pictured/implied to be the same as their spare 15 foot cable though
doesn't state specifically the cable is that long.)  This price actually
would/does get me thinking about installing one in my '77 at some point.
