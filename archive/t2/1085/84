That's a tough one, especially because 90% of your braking is done on 
the front.  You *could* have an air bubble in that line and that could 
be dangerous if you have slam hard on the brakes and get uneven braking.

I know time's an issue, but if you can get another cylinder on hand and 
then try and loosen the nipple, you at least can do a cylinder swap. 
That should only take about an hour, but I understand how it is when 
you've got a trip coming up :/

good luck!
Mike
