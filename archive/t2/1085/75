Subject: Re: [VB] Installing Brake Drum  - Secrets?  Tips?

The brakes will need to be adjusted again pretty soon after you do the 
brake job since the shoes will wear in to fit the drums in the first few 
miles. I'd expect that to be a few hundred, though, not a drive around 
the block. The pedal should be nice and high with very little "give" to 
it when you put on the brakes. If it changed a lot on the first drive I 
would take a good close look inside the drums before I headed out across 
the country. There must be a reason for that change. Try adjusting them 
again too. Maybe the end of one of the shoes wasn't seated quite right 
and it moved on the test drive. If one side needs a lot of adjustment 
that could be why.

The rear shoes are supposed to be the same size. Some vehicles do use 
different size shoes for the leading and trailing shoe, but not a bus.
