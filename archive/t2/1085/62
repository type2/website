Subject: out to sea...

Hey, Guys.  I'm headed back to sea (Europe) for another six months.  
Thought I'd tell you all how much I enjoyed eavesdropping on the list 
during my vacation.  I'm sorry that I didn't get to the bus myself this 
time but I still learned some things for future reference.   I may 
continue to get the digest, I just don't know.  I have to get with it 
when I get back next time.  Keep those valves adjusted!  Ciao....KR
