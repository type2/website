Subject: Installing Brake Drum  - Secrets?  Tips?

Ok.

Every time I refresh my brake drum pads, I have a devil of a time lining everything
up so that the drum goes on.

It always seems to require cursing, cajoling, beating upon, inadvertently-nicking-
brand-new-pristine-brake-shoes, and generally a lot longer time than I thought
it should have taken.

At three am last night when I was out in the garage trying to perform this, 
what-i-thought-to-be-a-fairly-rudimentary task, I thought to myself:
"Self: There's gotta be a better way to do this.  There's gotta be an easier
way.  I know that mechanics who get paid by the hour aren't sitting there
wasting their time trying to jam drums onto wheels like this.  But I can't
figure it out...what the h*ll am I doing wrong?"

And so while it might have been my sleep-deprived brain that was making me
miss something simple, or perhaps the slight bend in the backing plate that
I had missed when hammering the damn thing out (after the brake drum
failure 2 weeks ago - and yes, I'll be taking it off and hammering at it
again, although if anyone near PGH, PA has a spare left rear backing plate, I'm 
all ears), I thought I would inquire as to what other people do in these
situations.

Do you, oh glorious grease-monkeys and cajolers of VWs, have any secrets in this
realm?  Or you, SOP, WOT drivers, have any amusing tricks of the trade (or just
stories to keep my brain amused after too few hours of sleep) to share?

Help a dubber out...

Cheers,
