Subject: Hello and fuse box picture request

Hello All, I have been reading the list posts for a few months now and the
information I have learned has really been a big help. Now I have a request
I hope someone can help me with. I need a picture of an installed fuse box
from a 1970 EZ camper. More specifically, I need to see the flasher relay
and dimmer relay positions in the fuse box when it's installed. I have
searched the history and archives of the list online and continue to search
the internet, but any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cassi
