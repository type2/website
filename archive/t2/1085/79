Have you completely flushed your brake fluid?  Is it dark or running 
clean?  If it's dark, then keep pumping new fluid through until it runs 
clean - you might also discover some air bubbles in the process.  You 
should flush your brake fluid about every two years to keep the brake 
system healthy.
