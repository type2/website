Robt,

I would trust your intuition on the BW: if you think it isn't leaking
fuel and that it's ok, you should stick with what you know.  If you
trust your mechanic and what he's found, I would consider the Solex.  

I have had some bad experiences with Solex 34 Pict-3's in that I find 
they develop vacuum leaks (generally around the throttle shaft bushing).
This occurs in both the new* (Brazilian or Mexi) ones and 38 year old
German ones.  But if you've got one that works, particularly a German one, I 
would say: use it.  The key thing is that as long as you get a steady
idle, you should be ok.

The follow on question, however, is "what dizzy are you using?"  As
you've heard, an 009 (or any mech-only advance dizzy) won't pair
well with a 34-Pict-3.  That said, if you're not using a vacuum advance
dizzy, I'd suggest picking one up.

Whatever you do: be safe (none of us wants to hear about a fuel leak causing
a burnt bus) and save the BW if you choose to go with the Solex.  Just in
case.

hope this helps.

Cheers,
  tom

* Some people swear by the new Mexi and Brazilian carbs...others swear
at them and have had nothing but issues.  I fall into the latter category
and take some solace in the knowledge that i'm not alone.
