Subject: re ignition 

Thanks for the quick reply.  Is the relay in the engine bay?  near the 
battery?  I do see a relay attached to the right side and ahead of the 
battery.  It has 3 wires,,a live red , a blue and a black .  The black is 
off the solenoid and I am not getting any juice there,,even with the 
ignition on or the starter switch engaged,,,only the red is live.  Or am I 
in the wrong spot for the solenoid relay?
Thanks
Linda
