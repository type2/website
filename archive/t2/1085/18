Subject: Fw: Music Video and VW Bus - Splity with Cat Stevens

Just in case the T2 list did not get this great youtube Video.

This is a geat
video and the bus even looks real with real paint job of old record
decoration.  Tea for the Tillerman.
The license plate even says "CAT" 

He is
one cool Cat.

Cheers,

The former Cat Stevens, now
Yusef, has a new CD calledRoadsinger and it
features a nice bus on the CD
cover as well as in the video.
