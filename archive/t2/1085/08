Subject: Re: [T2] Sad end of one owner 1970 bus

I, too, own a 1970 bus.  Your story brought tears to my eyes.  I'm sure 
cautionary tales of fire extinguishers and fuel lines are not what you need 
to hear when a loved one has passed on.

It makes me think, though, of what happens when you lose a pet.  Though it 
may seem cruel, the best cure is to go out and get a new one.  Fortunately, 
there are a number of 1970 buses still out there at reasonable prices.  And 
with a replacement, all the knowledge and skill and love you developed for 
your original will not go to waste with a new bus to care for.

Peace and solace,

John
