So I'll do what I do when this topic comes up...  Advocate that y'all 
spend a few extra dollars and get a CO2 extinguisher or several.

Why?

1)  It's not powder so it can't pack down over time and fail you when 
you need it most.  My heart drops even contemplating that situation.
2)  It's not powder so it doesn't make a huge mess to clean up.  And you 
can see what's up when you stop squirting.
3)  You can use it MULTIPLE times.  If you just use a little squirt to 
cool off a smoking part (like the seized ac compressor on the plymouth 
awhile back), no problem for future use.  I don't know how useful a 
powder extinguisher is in for this use.
5)  You are more likely to be of service to someone on the side of the 
road with a blaze.
6)  They are refillable and reusable.  Not so with the cheepie $20 
powder extinguishers.

If you call the local folks that do extinguishers for biz - they may 
have a small refurbed C02 for relatively cheap.  Get at least one for 
each of your vehicles, and pester your kids and your spouse in its' 
proper operation.  Oh, ditto in the kitchen and shop.

You've been told.  Don't be stoopid.  This could be the life of your 
house, vehicle, your belongings, or you could be a super hero to someone 
else.

Always carrying an extinguisher in my vehicle has been one of the good 
lessons bussing has taught me.

Rebuttals cheerfully tolerated.  ;-)  Now that I've got a few bux in my 
pocket, I'm gonna shop today for 2 more.

Yours in spontaneous combustion,

Teri
