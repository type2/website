Agreed. Before you install anything, clean the main connections such as
the battery terminals, the earth connections, the point where the
alternator +ve joins into the system, and coat them with terminal
protector. They probably haven't been done in the last 30 years! Also
check carefully the fuses and clean or replace as necessary. I increased
the voltage at the ignition by 1 v through these measures and saved
myself some future headaches by weeding out incorrectly sized fuses and
some that were close to failure by the fusible link cracking through.
