Well actually racers do install Halon new still, just like R-12 it still
exists, just is all recylced/reclaimed and you don't want to pay for it.  Most
have gone to dry chemical or AFFF of some sort, but halon is still prised
because it of course makes no mess, nothing else is like it.  There is still
plenty of it out there, was big for large "minicomputer" room installations in
the 80s and early 90s at large manufacturing plants, so it exists and all gets
recycled and resold.  Hell the library at our med school had a cylinder 6 ft
tall and 2 feet round of it, that got removed during a remodel just in 2004 or
so, I bet it got sold off for 100 times in addition to what they charged the
university to remove and install a new system, which I'm sure was a pretty
penny.   Anyway last I checked a small system with remote handle had gone from
like $100 to nearly $500, the sites below imply still about that.  I guess
those are charged systems, if not,
 probably double the cost I'd bet.  I still have a couple 2.5 lb cylinders I
carry myself, I think they cost all of $40 each when I bought them in like '90
or so.  Any of these products would of course make a very nice bus
installation, but raises the age old question (horrific recent list story
nonwithstanding, and I really feel for the owner) of why do you need it if you
maintain your fuel system correctly.

Halon is a greenhouse gas, subject to the Montreal Protocol, and hasn't been
produced since 1994. I'd be very surprised to find it being used for any new
