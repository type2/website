Subject: Fire extinguishers

I use fire extinguishers I purchased from http://fireade.com

They dont appear to sell from their website any longer, but
a Google search for "fireade 2000" came up with:


http://www.firesupplydepot.com/quick-order-page.html

Mine are several years old, so I plan on getting new ones
and discharging the old ones to see if they still work.
This product does not damage engine parts.
