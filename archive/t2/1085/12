John,

Thanks for making me feel a little better. The fire extinguisher and 
shut-off valve suggestions will hopefully save other buses.

My fuel lines were about 3 years old. They had the gray rather than the 
black cloth covering. I suspect the cloth may have been hiding a defect in 
the hose. I've heard that the cloth covering can do this as it evaporates 
the gas seeping from a faulty hose so it can't be seen. Also heard the gray 
covered hose is inferior? Just the day before the fire I had been through my 
weekly inspection of the engine compartment and below - wiping and checking 
everything ( I was much more attentive to the bus in it's old age than when 
new). Also, I'm embarrassed to say I just changed the same type of fuel hose 
on an old Porsche last week and they were intact and much older (but near 
the gas tank not near the engine).

I have several old cars that require my attention but your suggestion to get 
a new bus reminds me when I sold my 59 VW bug in 1964. It was our first new 
car and unbelievably carried 4 kids for a short time (baby behind the rear 
seat -she's now 50). My wife and I missed the VW so much that I traded 
another car for a 57 oval which I rebuilt and kept til the 70's - the wife 
and I fighting over who drove it until she finally adopted the 70 bus as 
hers.

Thanks again for your kind thoughts.

Phil
