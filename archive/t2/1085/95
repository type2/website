Subject: Brakes and fluid

Just a thought, but after riding Motorcycles...up here in Canada..if the brake
fluid is allowed to .."sit' for a long period without use..(DOT 2,3,4)..there
will develop a thing we call.."spooge"..which due to the nature of the
composition of the brake line material..and changes in ..'heat'..'cold' from
storage..develops,..and 'it' can clog the passage of the fluid..similar to
cholesterol in an artery.. and has enough .."composition" that it can slow the
passage of fluid..further away from the MC.  Now..new "synthetic" fluids..(DOT
5) do not have that problem anymore..but I do not know..if installation of
this .."new" fluid..causes damage to existing brake components..such as rubber
parts..and if not..might be an answer to ..'off season' use of our vans.
JFFT!
