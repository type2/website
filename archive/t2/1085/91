Well, it's a matter of the amount you release.  The problems with this 
class of substance isn't in fire suppression systems, since the product is 
only released in the case of fire.  If this was the only source of CFC 
there would be no "toronto protocal" because the tiny amount relased would 
have no effect at all.

Unfortunately, CFCs were so convenient (nonflammable, low boiling point, 
etc) that they were being freely released in such silly applications as 
aerosol cans and air horns noisemakers for football games.

Banning their use for fire suppression was overkill and probably had more 
to do with DuPont's patents expiring than with environmental effects.

Now, let's return to the topic at hand.  Given the choice between spending 
several hundred dollars on a fire-suppression system or spending the same 
amount on making sure the fuel system doesn't leak wouldn't it be more 
practical to do the latter?  After all, no fire is better than a fire 
quickly extinguished!
