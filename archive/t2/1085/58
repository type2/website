Subject: paper stickers

Hi all,

 

I found an unblemished engine compartment door for my '78 Westy. The only
thing is, is that the old door has the original orange paper warning sticker
on it and the new one doesn't. Has anyone had any luck removing these
stickers in one reusable piece?

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Bob
