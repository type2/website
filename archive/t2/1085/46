Always make sure the adjusters, are just meeting the shoes tang, so there is
no wobble, and slide drum on, then get underneath and keep turning the
adjustment until you get "friction", then adjust up to tighten, spin wheel,
'feel' and listen for contact, do again, until it feels and sounds right to
you, then (presumably, bus is on jacks stands), have a partner, start bus, put
in gear and slowly spin, wheel, then apply brakes..recheck in neutral..if
satisfied, shut motor down, check everything for tightness, and l;eakage, and
go to the other side, ditto.  If you are having problems getting drum over
shoes, 'something' is out of adjustment!  Cheers
Syd
