Phil,

Very sorry to hear about your loss.  From your description, I suspect 
your fuel lines were NOT old, sounds like it might have rather been some 
mechanical failure of the carburator.  If I were in your shoes I would 
have the bus towed to my house, salvage what I could from it and 
transfer the parts onto another early baywindow so that at least some 
parts of your old bus can live on.  Then I would go buy one or two large 
(5lb+) refillable fire extinguishers and mount them securely in your new 
bus with metal brackets.  Don't use plastic brackets, those are NOT for 
use in automobiles and could turn your extinguisher into a deadly 
projectile in an accident.

-David
