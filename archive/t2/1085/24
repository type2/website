Subject: Rear hatch adjustment

We've got a late Bay with the rear window hatch torsion bars
cut...and a spare pair of torsion bars...

Before we really screw things up, are the any online diagrams,
etc. to guide us on the replacement? It's obvious that the bars
are preloaded, but perhaps there's a sequence to their installation
that would make it less trial and error ... ?
