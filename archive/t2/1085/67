Subject: Brazilian Weber v. Solex PICT-34

	I'm in the final stage (I hope) of getting my camper back on 
the road.  The (German) mechanic now tells me the Brazilian Weber 
carb is leaking fuel  -  tho' he says the needle valve on the float 
chamber is OK.
	I'm very reluctant to take off the BW which has worked fine 
till this somewhat mysterious new trouble.  I have a Solex PICT-34 
which the mechanic reckons would be good; but I seem to have gathered 
the impression that this type of carb has generally turned out to be 
a lemon.
	I'd be grateful for informed opinions on my quandary.

thanx
