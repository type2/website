Subject: Re: [T2] re ignition 

the relay can be mounted anywhere.. it should have a wire connected to the
starter tho..
so you might find it in the engine bay, or under near the starter itself.. I
have seen them inside under the folding beds..

sounds like you are looking at a relay..

 there is a great resource online  The Type 2 library
http://type2.com

if you go to the library..

you can look up ------- starter-------  for ie..
