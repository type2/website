another way is put everything together and using the adjusters, make 
sure each shoe's foot is evenly spaced away from the adjuster wheel. 
Try fitting the drum on.  If it's loose and there's no drag, pull the 
drum off and screw the adjusters a few turns until it does drag a little 
bit.  Have someone press on the brake a couple times and recheck.  If 
there's still a little bit of drag, button it up and do the other side.

There's no point in trying to get it picture perfect because once you 
start driving on them, they're already out of adjustment.  The only way 
to keep them in adjustment is to constantly adjust them or get self 
adjusting drum brakes.  I would *highly* recommend the Vanagon drum 
brake swap if you hate adjusting your drum brakes all the time.  That's 
one of the best updates I've made to the bus.
