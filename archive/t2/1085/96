OK, 
Probably what you are looking at is the voltage regulator.  
IF you have a WR-1 relay installed on your bus it will most 
likely be at or near the STARTER (under the bus), at least 
that is where I have always located them.  IF you cannot
locate a relay under there.....then get one and install it.
ANY parts house that has VW or Bosch parts can get you one,
the part number is .....WR-1 Hard Start relay Kit.  Bugpack
also makes one, that is quite a bit cheaper, and I have
ordered one to see if it is a quality part or a don't bother
facsimile.
Since you have solenoid action at times, I believe your problem
is wiring between the front and back.......the kit will eliminate
the distance and reduce the load on the ignition switch.  I have used
these relays for over 25 years, and they work just great at resolving
starter problems on ANY vehicle.  I have even used them on Land Cruisers 
in Haiti (diesel powered).

Larry................back at the barn
When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
