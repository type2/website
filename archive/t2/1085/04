Subject: Sad end of one owner 1970 bus

Last night as I was about go onto the freeway in San Jose, I noticed that my
accelerator seemed stuck on.  I pulled over and opened the hood and saw
flames.
Tried to smother them with blankets and then a tow truck  pulled up behind
with a fire extinguisher. This seemed to put the fire out in the engine
compartment but it continued to burn under the engine. The tow truck driver
then called the fire department and I stood and watched one of the most
intense blazes I've seen.

This was an original paint and upholstery bus that I bought new in San Jose in
November, 1969. Had just over 150,000 miles. I had just  finished renewing the
front suspension. A few years ago I had rebuilt the engine with new block,
updated to doghouse and full flow filter and powder coated sheet metal. Kept
it single port, Just a few thousand miles on the engine since the rebuild. My
kids constantly urged me to sell the bus but I would tell them I would be
buried in it. Had no idea that this might come true.

Got most of the important stuff I was carrying out of the bus with just a
little singeing of my arms and some smoke inhalation. Probably wiser to have
stayed back.

When the Fire Dept arrived they pretty much let it continue to burn and then
used what appeared to be water on the decreasing fire. I was hoping for the
foam they use at race tracks.

Doesn't appear to be much of value left. Maybe one or two new tires/wheels (6
ply), front suspension, front clip and insignia, transmission?, front bumper,
drums (new Brazilian)................

Anyone think there is any salvage value? Best offer so far is free towing from
tow yard to metal recycler.
