	Pretty good; and makes the point that the main objection to 
halons is not their greenhouse accelerant effect but their extremely 
powerful ozone-layer depletion.
	This is no mere pedantry.  The Montreal treaty restricting 
ozone-depleting gases has not come in for anything like the deceitful 
propaganda attacks as the Kyoto treaty purporting to control 
greenhouse gases, so if you exhort people not to use halons on the 
grounds of their ozone depletion you'll be more likely to persuade.
