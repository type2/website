Subject: Lovely bus photos?

I'm going to be redoing a website for a company in Ireland that sells a 
lot of US busses...

I need some images that really pop and show the joy of bussin'.  My 
budget doesn't allow for remuneration in dollars, but if I use a photo 
I'd give you photo credit and a link...  I'd be using them at a fairly 
small resolution.

Any proud photographers willing to point me to some of their shots?  I 
can just pull 'em from a web location, no need to email unless you'd prefer.

Thanks!

Teri
