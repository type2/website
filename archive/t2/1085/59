Wow - congrats on the find...

I've heard of people getting original stickers
off of metal (like this), but after 30 years that paper is going to be dry and
brittle...  And even if you are successful, it may not adhese well...  

What
I would do - is do some really high quality photos of the sticker - best
camera you can get, all kinds of lighting, etc - and reproduce the sticker
from that.  True, it will be a repop sticker...  but it will also leave the
original intact while you look for a way to get it off (or enshrine it
otherwise)...

Saying that - I've done one or 2 (tho not as old) with a
graffiti remover applied before the edge, allowing it to migrate under the
sticker, with little damage (note I did not say *no* damage)...  if the
original glue was water base you can try GENTLE live steam...  

Seriously -
I'd repop it.  Just my 2" on the thought.  I've seen people get original 20's
harley decals that look wonderful only to have a very heartbreaking result as
they were never meant to sit for 40-60 years prior to moving...

Hi
all,



I found an unblemished engine compartment door for my '78 Westy. The
only
thing is, is that the old door has the original orange paper warning
sticker
on it and the new one doesn't. Has anyone had any luck removing these
stickers in one reusable piece?



Thanks in advance.



Bob
