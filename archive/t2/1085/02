	 When the points break, the aforementioned spark transmits 
radio on many many frequencies, and you can hear this pulse of radio: 
slap a battery AM radio nearby, with the volume up somewhat, tuned 
off all stations {yes there are still some parts of the wavebands 
that have no station transmitting on them just now <:-|}.
