Forwarded from the Vanagon list. Reposted here because it's rare enough

It's a 1972 bus with sliding doors on both driver and passenger side. No
side windows in the cargo area. There are pictures.

I though it was interesting enough to post.

It's not mine and I know nothing about it. Just saw it on Los Angeles
craigslist. No price listed :(
