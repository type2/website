Hi George,

I think we need to understand what you mean by the term "eating oil". Is 
the oil leaking out of the engine, or is it burning oil and pumping it 
out the tailpipe? (Blue smoke)

If it's leaking, then it's (usually) easier to fix than if it's burning 
oil. The most common leaks are the valve cover gaskets and the push rod 
tube seals, which are fairly easy to access. Other common leak spots 
include the oil cooler seals, oil pressure sender, and the front and 
rear main seals. These will take more work to get at, usually requiring 
an engine drop or a considerable amount of parts removal.

Burning oil is either valve guides, rings or worn pistons & cylinders or 
all of the above... That will require engine removal to treat.

Last I heard (back in July) GermanSupply was booked up about 3-4 weeks 
ahead, but it couldn't hurt to call and ask.

Happy Trails,
