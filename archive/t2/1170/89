Subject: Re: [T2] engine question

I have a 71 camper  parked 26 yrs ago in the woods when the rear axle 
totally rotted out.  It ran when parked, but the pht....pht...sound told 
me it had a cracked plug hole leak or bypassing a hole insert.  It ran 
fine.  Every year when we hiked by it I'd turn the engine by hand; think 
it sat last few years untouched and lask week I turned it- turned over 
OK, you could feel the compression.  The oil still looks clean. With all 
rotted out, I'd have to jack it up to reach starter and bring a bottle 
with tube or marine tank to run to the fuel pump.  Holly-Weber carb 
likely gunked up too.
