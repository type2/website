Jon -

Where did you get your VDO kit?  

I just bought a 72 bus that has the VDO CHT gauge (and a tach) but the
original engine died and is gone.  

It came with a different engine to install but I don't think the sending
units were saved.  So I probably have some wiring and gauges but nothing
else and I don't know where to mount the engine based hardware.

Thanks

Joe
