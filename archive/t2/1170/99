Subject: gas heater

Now that I replaced the heater boxes, I need to install the gas heater. All
of the wiring is there. Some of it was cut by a former PO. I have the
heater, just need to figure out to install the thing. I looked at the type 2
archives and didn't find too much on the subject. 

 

I'm hoping I can get my hands on or build my own rotisserie so that I can
turn the bus on it's side. Once I do that, I can sand blast the chassis or
strip off the old stuff, replace the tube that the wiring harness goes
through and replace the floor support that I accidently crushed when I tried
to use it as a jack support.
