Hi Bob,
          Once you get down to just the frame and shell there probably isn't
much more than 1000 lbs.  Most stuff you are going to do on a rotisserie is
bare frame and bare shell prep.  The real problem these days is that the piles
of ugly "scrap" steel that used to be lying around, and available for cheap,
or free, has all been policed up and shipped off.   "They" came into our tiny
town and shipped off over 1000 crushed vehicles, plus huge pile of old tanks,
pilings, etc, etc. Spent over a year mining the dump for vehicles and steel.  
Any odds and ends of usable stuff lying around was swept up in the cyclone. 
Now you have to buy all the material and parts instead of finding something
that you could convert.  Harbor Freight (and others) does a good job of
returning the scrap at a minimal up-charge.

Two of those would do the job easily with some geometry (get pivots
horizontal) and stability (bigger wheels and extended width) modifications. As
John said, you need to make carriers to go down and under the bus to get the
pivot point at the rotational CG and to hook on to something safe and solid.

This guy has some good suggestions for an alternative.  Easier with a "flat
car" but still a good idea.

I've read that some DYI'ers have used two engine stands for their
rotisseries, I wonder about the safety as most are only rated for 750 lbs.
