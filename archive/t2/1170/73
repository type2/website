Unless the PO is a good friend, family, or some other connection, you
deserve at least 50% commission for selling the motor. You are essentially
acting as a pick-and-pull yard, but also providing the labor. You took a
rusty old non-running car, presumably removed it from his property, broke
it down, and are doing all the marketing. At this point I'd say he owes
you. Don't be taken advantage of.
