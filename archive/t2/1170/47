Subject: RE: No Heat to the Foot Well Vents

Did you ever figure this out?

 

I meant to post a pic, and forgot. If you need a pic I can post one. On my
'65 and '69 there is a small lever on the driver side of the vertical duct
that goes up to the dash. Flip the lever up, get heat to the feet. Flip the
lever down, get heat to the dash.
