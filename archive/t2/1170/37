March release date.

He sent an email to the funders a couple weeks ago.

We did it! You did it! It's hard to believe, I know, but next month we are 
screening a (nearly) finished film! Hot damn. We're really excited to screen 
our rough cut at the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival, February 23 at 7 pm 
in Missoula, Montana, USA. See http://www.busmovie.com/screenings/ for 
details.

It's been almost 9 months since our Kickstarter Campaign was successfully 
funded and we are as GRATEFUL as ever. THE BUS is virtually complete. We are 
waiting on some footage and music licenses to come in (and the price tags), 
but essentially we have a finished film.

As far as your REWARDS go, we will likely be mailing out everything in 
March. This includes advanced copies of the DVD (official retail DVDs won't 
be for sale until July or August).

The film is currently being entered in many film festivals around the world 
and we'll keep you posted on all further screenings, hopefully there will be 
one near you. THE BUS will be broadcast on the Documentary Channel this 
summer in the U.S. (timed with the official DVD release), then, I guess we 
are finished.

Firewater Film Company has several awesome projects in the works and we hope 
you can be part of them. You are family, and we thank you for your support.

All my best,

Damon Ristau

Hey Volks - what's the status of the movie? A work in progress?

I looked at the website and the status wasn't clear.
