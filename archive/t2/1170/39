Subject: Anyone replaced ALL the brakelines front to back on a Bay?

I'm going to replace all my brakelines this summer (I keep thinking about summer and sunshine to stay sane here in Nanaimo) and am wondering if anyone has done it. I'd like a list of what I need besides the actual hard lines and hoses. I know there are junction blocks too. Was there any part of the job that was difficult, or does anyone have sage advice? I was thinking of this brakeline kit from cip1.ca along with the hoses for the calipers and drums. What else?

Any words of wisdom are much appreciated.
