Here is the key with the seal. It appears as though there is no way to get
the seal around the key, but basically you just jam it over the key. This
give a very tight seal

 

The thing is the seal is so tight.it didn't seem like I would be able to get
the key thru it without tearing the seal, but I called the manuf. (Flaming
river) up and they said-just jam in over the end of the key.
