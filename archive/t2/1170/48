Subject: engine mounting...

Hey guys,

 

I am a bit stumped on this one, and looking for a part or at least a
picture.please bear with me as I explain the situation.

 

My '69 singlecab had one of those aftermarket exhausts on it, and it blew a
big hole in the muffler (due to rust and age). Instead of just replacing the
muffler, I figured I would go back to an original exhaust. So I ordered an
original exhaust.

 

Now the PO had changed the hanger bar and engine mount, I always thought it
was weird, but could never figure out why he did it. Now I think it was
because of the different header/muffler setup.

 

A while ago at a show-someone pointed out to me that I should change the
hanger back to original, as the one installed was a rigid installation, and
it could cause transmission problems. So I bought a moustache hanger bar
thing off the samba, along with the engine carrier mounts. 

 

So I am supposed to get the muffler/exhaust next week. I started getting
ready for it today by taking the old muffler & header off-no problem so far.
Then I supported the engine and took the odd-ball hanger off. Now I look at
the set up, and I think I need one more part-the part that connects the
engine carrier mount to the frame of the bus. I don't know what this is
called, or what it should look like, or even how to find it. I've looked in
Bentley-without any luck.

 

Does anyone know the name of the part, and or have a pic of this area-so I
know what it is supposed to look like?

 

Thanks in advance.
