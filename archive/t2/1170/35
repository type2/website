Subject: RE: battery disconnect

I would have thought switching to ground, but according to list responses,
it looks like switching to positive is more standard, so I went that route.
I might try to fabricate or cut a piece of rubber to cover the back of the
bolts, so I don't ever hit it with a wrench accidentally, and zap myself.

I think you can hook it up to ground or positive.

I think I will probably leave the key in full time during the summer, or
when I am driving it more frequently. The main reason I got the thing it to
be able to quickly disconnect the power if I am going to be  parking it for
an extended time, or whenever I am working on electrical stuff. I kind of
wish I put it in earlier-as it would make electrical work a lot easier than
connecting and disconnecting the battery straps-like I did in the past. I am
pretty sure I'll put one in my '65 as well,  but I may put it in a more
hidden location in my '65. That way it can also act as a security measure.

And yes the seal is to keep the connection clean. I think these are also
used on off-road vehicles a lot, in pretty exposed situations.

I'm not sure which is preferred.  Switching the +12V or switching the ground
(earth).

Most of these switches are for nautical applications.
It's possible that the key stays in the switch full-time.
And the rubber seal is there to keep the water out of the electric switch. ?
