Bob

We built one for a buddies '66 Mustang, that we passed around, I used it
on a Ghia.  We went overkill,
1 1/2" pillow blocks and the whole thing as we
were all engineers.  A lot of people use 2 heavy duty
engine stands for the
basis, but they don't spin well, and usually need the posts mounted at angles
as
the top tubes are usually welded to the posts at a slight angle which makes
the posts in at an angle.
Whatever you do make sure you got enough footprint
on the floor to avoid tipping and consider putting
it on some big HD casters
to roll about (we used ones about 8" diameter good for 2000lb each.)

For the
Mustang/Ghia worked like a charm, I know a lot of people use em for buses, but
would have to
be tall enough/have enough clearance.  And you need good
structure, but short of the frame rails rusted
clean through, you should have
it, and for a '78 you don't have to worry about what to attach too so much
in
the front like a T2a where sometimes there isn't much structure left up
there.  You will need a lot of
structure on the bus on the arms down to where
it mounts from the pivots as they are cantilevered out
from the pivots a
couple of feet. whereas on a car the pivot is much more inline with the center
of the
vehicles height.

Standard problems apply, you will be getting media
(of choice) falling out for years after, so be carefull
what you wish for. 
Does make for a way to get to and scrape of the damn factory undercoating if
you
have it.  But I do swear no many how many times you vacuum sand just keeps
falling out and out and
out.  You also have the usual issue with media
blasting, you need to incrementally get your choice of
etching or epoxy primer
on IMMEDIATELY after blasting, then clean it off where you work it later.

Has anyone had experiences with media blasting and using
a rotisserie? I'm
exploring the idea of building, borrowing a rotisserie to
get under the bus
for derusting , replacing, and rewiring.
