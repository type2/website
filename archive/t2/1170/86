Subject: Re: [T2] RE: No Heat to the Foot Well Vents

Kevin et al,

Sorry for the late reply as I've been out on vacation for
the weekend.
Good to say that the bus still drives well in the snow and ice!
As for the foot well vent, I found the spring-loaded lever on the left side of
the heat riser.  It had been zip-tied open forcing the heat only to the
de-mister vents.
So I removed the zip tie and got heat to the foot well
vents.  I fiddled around with some more zip ties and got it to stay halfway
open to get heat out of the de-mister and foot well vents.
However, splitting
the already weedy airflow between these two just feels pretty poor. 
Especially as my bus is Type-1-engined and airflow is tied to RPM.

My next
jobs are to find the proper cables to restore the heater lever operation. 
Does anyone have any photos of how they are routed for a late bay?  I'm
looking at the relevant microfiche slides from ratwell's site, but more detail
would be helpful.
Kevin, if you have handy the photos you mentioned, then that
sounds like a good starting point.


Then I'm seriously considering fitting a
12V bilge blower up front and underneath to get some reasonable air flow.
Anyone had any good experience with that modification?

Cheers,

Josh
