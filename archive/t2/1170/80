Subject: Exhaust system bolts

Hi all,

 

Now that my shoulder is healing quite nicely, I started to bolt on the new
exhaust headers and muffler. Since I had to cut/break off the old exhaust
bolts, I had to buy new ones. I went to my local home improvement store and
bought the bolts to fit. As I started to tighten down the bolts, they all of
a sudden turned rather easily. I discovered that the threads started to
strip. I went to the local FLAPS store to buy "exhaust' bolts. They told me
that the only ones they carried were the same kind I could buy at the box
store. Does anyone know where I can buy bolts that would stand up to the
temperatures of the exhaust system?

 

Thanks in advance,
