I didn't follow the OP but I would say, I'm not sure an FI bus will start that
far off.  But I'd agree with Mike that if you got it at the correct timing
mark on the pulley and get the #1 mark on the dizzy within a few degrees it
should run.  Maybe not well, but should run.

btw, the car will still start as long as
you're somewhat close (withing 50 degrees, I'd guess).  If you get it to the
correct TDC, have the distributor pointing to the #1 mark on the distributor
(or the #1 plug socket), the car should start without issue.
