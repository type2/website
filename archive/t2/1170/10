It's not a bus but I bought a '65 Beetle that after it arrived on base 
when I was in the Navy in Naples, Italy 91-94. The owner drove the 
Beetle for a few short weeks before it's cheap catalog replacement motor 
started having serious problems. I bought it for a fair price.

Had a great time there by the way. It's been so long that it seems like 
another life... LOL!

Got it home to my rented villa and gave it a first bath. Saw a bumper 
sticker that just about illegible on the rear bumper. I squinted at it, 
used my imagination, looked at it close and then started walking 
backwards. At about 10 feet I could see that it said "Follow me to TN!" 
It was a TN tourist association (?) campaign from the 70s. The kicker 
was that I was living in a foreign country and bought a car original 
sold new in my state!

We named our '78 Westy "Dharma". My wife was a big fan of "Dharma and 
Greg" as we were newly married and my parents were/are challenging in 
many of the same ways that Greg's was. She imagined herself to be 
Dharma. There was nothing special about that bus except that we 
loved/still love it.
