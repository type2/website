Yeah..thanks I just saw the posts on the samba. Those are the tabs that my
bus is missing. Thanks a lot for the pics, I wasn't really sure what I was
looking for. Now I'm not sure what to call them, but I have a picture I can
bring to my local mechanic, to see what he may have. Maybe I can salvage
from one of his-he may be the guy who does the welding for me too.now that I
think about it-getting the tabs in the correct location is probably going to
be tricky.

Are these mounting tabs what you are missing?
