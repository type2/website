Subject: engine compartment seal

Anybody know who is reproducing the seal on the top of the engine 
compartment?  I didn't see it at my usual haunt, Busdepot.  I need one 
bad as I'm getting more fumes than I like.  Or if they are no longer 
available, what is the material and thickness?  I could fabricate 
something that would work but don't want to waste money experimenting.  
Thanks...KR
