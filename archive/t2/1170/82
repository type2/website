Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust system bolts

That sounds like bovine scat to me Bob. BTW, congrats on the retirement; 
I'll join you in June. I would head to the local industrial nut and bolt 
store, and ask for metric 8.8 grade nuts and bolts as a minimum. You can go 
a bit higher; maybe 10.9 but I've used the 8.8 in 13mm for exhausts many 
times with no trouble. Check this out.
