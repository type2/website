well maybe  but by just hand cranking it you cant even tell if it had  a 
bad rod bearing,  what he sjould do is hook the tranny back up and put  fire 
to the starter and coil and start it even if it is just on carb cleaner ,  
then take a hot compression reading. later  mark d

agreed,  if one is trying to assess the condition of the 
pistons, rings &  valves in a quasi-quantitative way.
But finding all 4 cyls  the same, at a readable tho' v low 
figure (20 psi) at hand-cranking speed,  and with no oil mentioned as 
squirted in the plug 'oles, would strongly  encourage me to look 
further into that motor.  The preliminary vague  conclusion is: 
pistons, rings & valves may well be  OK.
