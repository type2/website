Subject: RE:battery disconnect

Thanks for all your responses a few months ago.

 

I finally got around to installing the battery disconnect. I've posted a pic
on thesamba -

In installed it on the positive side of the battery, although I can switch
it if that turns out to not be the best way to go---

 

Thanks for the tips, 

 

I put on in my '69, will try this for a while-and will probably install one
in my '65 as well.

 

Mine came with a red key. There is loose fitting seal that is supposed to
fit around the key hole, but I can't figure out how the key fits through the
seal, so I'm just using it as is right now.
