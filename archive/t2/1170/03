Subject: Re: [T2] Friday is sort of random/OT day, right?

Q1 ,,, cool and desirable?
74Watermelon had no paint on it.. in the northern climate,, this instantly
tells you it is a southern vehicle!
Q2 ,, why the name
It was factory raveena green,, or yosemite yellow.. or chartruese  ... and
it was faded thru to the first coat of primer..
so, it looked like a watermelon.
we had a 72 passenger school bus in the driveway at the time.. and a van..
and a car.. and 3 young kids,, so when we were hustling them out the
door.... we'd yell.... get in the Bus... err... the Van.... er...
both buses were sort of yellow... and one of the kids said... nope.. the VW
looks like watermelon!

I have wanted to paint its native name on the rear deck... "Dances With
Wind" ...  just might do that soon!


Q1 ,,, cool and desirable
74Ground Hog was cheap.. and had all the parts I needed for watermelon.
Q2 ,, why the name.
it was sort of wavy body work.. and was painted brown and was a little
fuzzy,
kids thought it was a ground hog..  sold it to a fellow who restored it to
Raveeena green,,

Q1.. cool and desirable
74Sportsmobile penthouse,, and it came with a brand new basket case 2.3L V6
and adapter..
Q2 why the name
space ship... it was sort of painted like a space ship... silver paint that
never dried..

I bought a truck once by accident.... at the auction,, the floor walker was
using me to up the bid ... and I ended up being high bidder... lol  cause no
one else bid!!   Still driving it today,, FLOORED Exploder is it's name...
and was sacraficed teaching the kids how to drive...  dents are ok on that
one.
