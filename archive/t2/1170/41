Subject: vanagon CHT wire routing

Hi Folks,
         I'm using the cht wires that come with the VDO kit.  Have any of you
Vanagon folks found a way to run these and get good length at the instrument
cluster.  Currently I have mine running up past the plug rubber seal then
forward through the tin.  From there I run it through the hole in the cross
member where most of the wires run going forward.  From there I run it across
the fuel tank via same passage that the heat tube uses, above the spare tire
and behind the grill and up to a grommet/plug next to the speedo cable.  I end
up with barely enough wire to mount it on top of the instrument cluster. Seems
a bit limiting to me.  Any Vanagon owners got a better routing? 

I could gain a couple of inches by running the wire from the spark plug down
inside the tin and out the side past the front (front is front) of the
driver's side heater box.  I chose not to do that to make it a little easier
to put the ring terminal on the plug during replacement.

K wire isn't expensive so it would be simple to make a longer set. However, it
seems that a kit built for a bus should have enough length to make it work in
any air-cooled van.

Anyone have this VDO CHT gauge in their Vanagon?

Thanks. jon
