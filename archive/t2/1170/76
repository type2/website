Subject: Need a picture of the AFM wiper angle at idle and full throttle

I'm trying to figure out how the bus EFI is tuned - or in other words, 
I'm trying to figure out the various injector pulsewidths at various 
engine loads.  To do that, I need some reference points for my testing.

It would be great if you could do this on a 76-78 bus as I'm doing my 
testing on a 76 AFM.

I'm looking to get a picture of the AFM wiper at idle (easy) and a 
picture of the wiper at full-throttle, high load (bit more difficult).

If you're able to do this, please take the picture from directly above 
the AFM so I can easily judge the angles.  For the idle picture, please 
make sure the engine is idling around 900 (which it should anyways). 
For the full-throttle picture, having a friend take a picture while 
accelerating hard from 55-70 in 4th while holding the pedal down fully 
would be perfect.

I would REALLY appreciate the help!!

I would do this, but I can't because my AFM is wired open and possibly 
out of calibration (I'm not actually using the AFM).

Thanks!!
Mike
