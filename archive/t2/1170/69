Subject: Re: [T2] engine question

That is a hard one Jim.  I tend to agree with you, I'm amazed you generated
much compression,
and even at that, by hand, which seems a positive for sure. 
I'm presuming you mean this is a
1.7, 1.8, or a bus 2.0 that found it's way
in.  If a real 2.0 your head cores will go $250-500 each
depending on finding
the right fool.
 
On samba T4's claiming to be RECENT runners tend to ask
$300-500 in general.  Oddly I'd note
that hasn't changed much in 15 years
actually.  Currently an assembled longblock that might or
might not be as good
as yours is asking $75 with no claims and no backstory.  It varies right on
up
to someone I feel to be an idiot dreaming of $500 for one with the exact same
(no) story as yours, 
which in reality is no more than the $75 longblock,
unless one values some rusty tin and intake
runners as valuable.  A $400 one
on there implying known to be run about 6 years ago and with
only 75k miles. 
So for yours, given the optimism that it can generate even compression by
hand, I'd venture in the $200-250 range tops or essentially core value for a
case and 1.7/1.8 crank.
Things that would tip me to more would be clean
appearance, not a lot of grime and oil, and you
pull the valve covers and it
looks optimistic, like clean in the rocker boxes and what you can
see, then
perhaps a bit more.  If you slap a spare tranny on it and get it to pump just
90-100
on all 4 that would swing me to more value as well.
 
You might get
some dreamers telling you more to the $500 range, but I doubt they could sell
it
for that, unless you are sitting somewhere they really don't show up much,
like here in AK.
 
YMMV widely on this one.
John

I offered an engine out of a rusted out
914 to a guy on this list.  He asked
me to test the compression, the engine
was in the 914 for at least five years
without being run.  I tested the
compression, turning it over by hand.  All
four pistons registered close to
the same, at 22 psi.

I was glad that then engine turned over and registered
any compression.

So what do you think the engine is worth?
