Subject: engine question

OK VW gurus, I have a question for you.

I offered an engine out of a rusted out 914 to a guy on this list.  He asked
me to test the compression, the engine was in the 914 for at least five years
without being run.  I tested the compression, turning it over by hand.  All
four pistons registered close to the same, at 22 psi.

I was glad that then engine turned over and registered any compression.

So what do you think the engine is worth?

Jim
