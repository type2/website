The usual culprit for fumes in the bus is engine oil leaking into the
heat exchangers.

Step 1 - eliminate the source of the leak

Step 2 - flush the heat exchangers through the air ducts with a strong
degreaser, allow to soak, and then rinse profusely

Step 3 - drive a couple of weeks to let the residue burn off
