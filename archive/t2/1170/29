on my two liter engine,
I blocked the two small outlets at the bottom of the fan housing.
disconected the thermostat because it never got hot enough and removed all
the lower tin Below the pushrod tubes.
it is important that the small pieces of tin above the pushrod tubes between
the cyl remains, that one is critical.
oh and left the tin in front that directs air to the rear.
in otherwords, if it is screwed in below the pushrod tubes it can probably
be removed. if the screws are above the push rod tubes leave.

also removed all the heater ducts
have driven like this with bare pipes for over ten years now and it seems to
work fine. but like everything else, YMMV
