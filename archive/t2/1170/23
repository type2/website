Nice page that

 > http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/freemefromthishell/vw/T2%20Heating.htm

but as it has the earmarks of being easy to get lost (8 years old,
the only thing in its tree, top domain now owned by someone else)
perhaps mirroring it somewhere at type2.com is indicated.

Of course, if frank(-at-)wognum.org is on this list then (1) Thanks and
(2) ignore me.
