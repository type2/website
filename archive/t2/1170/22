Subject: No Heat to the Foot Well Vents

My '79 bay has heat to the de-mister vents, but not the foot well vents.

The
heat exchanger flaps are fixed to be permanently open.
So the left red lever
does nothing.

The right red lever basically controls flow to the de-mister
vents.
So when it is all the way up, I get no flow from any vents.  When it is
all the way down, I just get full flow from the de-mister vents.

I read the
following to get a better description of the heating system:
http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/freemefromthishell/vw/T2%20Heating.htm

Under Item
5, there is mention of another slider on the heater tube that affects air flow
to the foot well vents.
I took my kick panels off yesterday to find that, but
I'm not sure what I'm looking for.
Could this slider be set to block all air
to the foot well vents?

Does anyone have any more photos or diagrams
regarding this part of the heating system?

Thanks,

Josh
