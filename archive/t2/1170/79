Thanks to all for the great information!! Everyone has given me so much
information that I will have to look through everything to come up with
something I can handle.

Thank you to everyone who took the time to send me web site addresses and
their knowledge.

Bob

Bob,

I've seen em used, the issue is like I mention, you will need a real heavy
structure from the pivot down to the bumper
attachment.  And it will be a bit of a PITA to attach to the front curve. 
In truth I'd take a solid (but shitty) front
bumper, cut the ends off a bit past the outboard mounting bolts, weld a 2"
or so angle or tube heavily to the top
of it reinforced a bit, tack weld the cut ends off to the under crush
structure (grind off later)  I'd then weld my support
structure/box onto that and sacrifice the bumper rather than trying say to
weld a bunch of angled tabs onto a bit of tube.
 
Your main issue is having a nice form of adjustment so that you can manage
getting the centerline of the pivot
more or less in line with the center of the up/down CG which I'd estimate
probably
about the level of the bottom of the front doors or perhaps a bit lower?  To
spin it without great fast (scary
and or dangerous) movement you need that.  Most of a bus weight is down,
particularly with the glass out,
so I'd guess at about that level.  We had a big ole 6' or so arm on ours to
help turn with, but you got to
watch cause if balance isn't good and it goes "over center" things like that
arm could kill you.  Going to take
some tinkering to say the least.  Not that it isn't doable.  In reality ours
ended up a bit over engineered as the
pillow blocks were very rigid of course and needed very good alignment end
to end.

if you haven't seen it gives a nice little set of plans.  I would add some
gussets on the drop arms for the mounting
for bus use, as they are going to be the part I'm talking needs some bulk. 
Bear in mind the the whole shebang
also as I mentioned presumes a rigid frame intact, that is how you can get
around not needing to gusset the
uprights (and I still would a bit) becuase they can't collapse in because
the body keeps the space.  The whole
thing as he has it could still however scissor in a rectangle into
parallelogram manner so I'd gusset a bit against
that.  Anyway if you can weld, and got a ubiquitous 4x6" metal band saw, I'd
bet under $500 into it, and like
he says, paint it up nice and you can probably sell it for $1000 if you want
at the end of the project.

Alternative you might look for on your local craigslist is one of those low
2-3' scissor lifts.  They are self contained,
get you up high enough for convenience, and depending on your state, a lot
of commercial places (Walmart etc)
have to swap them out every 4-5 years or so, so sometimes you find a deal. 
I got one from a Walmart in WV
that needed a bit of repair for $150 about 10 years ago, put a couple
hydraulic lines on and fixed a switch and
eventually sold it for $500 when I bought a real lift.  But you are still on
your back, not nearly as nice for scraping
painting, sandblasting, and doesn't help you with the roof.

I could attach the bus to the bumper bolts. The a single bit of strength
there to hold up the bus.. I've seen pictures of rotisseries with and
counterweights on them but I don't know how to figure in the counterweight
for I am 78 bus that is Unibody. Do you foresee any problems with using a
rotisserie with this vehicle.

Thanks again for the info.


Bob.



We built one for a buddies '66 Mustang, that we passed around, I used it on
a Ghia.  We went overkill,
1 1/2" pillow blocks and the whole thing as we were all engineers.  A lot of
people use 2 heavy duty
engine stands for the basis, but they don't spin well, and usually need the
posts mounted at angles as
the top tubes are usually welded to the posts at a slight angle which makes
the posts in at an angle.
Whatever you do make sure you got enough footprint on the floor to avoid
tipping and consider putting
it on some big HD casters to roll about (we used ones about 8" diameter good
for 2000lb each.)

For the Mustang/Ghia worked like a charm, I know a lot of people use em for
buses, but would have to
be tall enough/have enough clearance.  And you need good structure, but
short of the frame rails rusted
clean through, you should have it, and for a '78 you don't have to worry
about what to attach too so much
in the front like a T2a where sometimes there isn't much structure left up
there.  You will need a lot of
structure on the bus on the arms down to where it mounts from the pivots as
they are cantilevered out
from the pivots a couple of feet. whereas on a car the pivot is much more
inline with the center of the
vehicles height.

Standard problems apply, you will be getting media (of choice) falling out
for years after, so be carefull
what you wish for.  Does make for a way to get to and scrape of the damn
factory undercoating if you
have it.  But I do swear no many how many times you vacuum sand just keeps
falling out and out and
out.  You also have the usual issue with media blasting, you need to
incrementally get your choice of
etching or epoxy primer on IMMEDIATELY after blasting, then clean it off
where you work it later.

Has anyone had experiences with media blasting and using a rotisserie? I'm
exploring the idea of building, borrowing a rotisserie to get under the bus
for derusting , replacing, and rewiring.
