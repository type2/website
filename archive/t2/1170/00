Subject: Friday is sort of random/OT day, right?

Hey all -

I have a few random/ semi-OT questions for the list:

When you bought your bus (previous one, current one, whatever), was there
ever any one random thing about the bus that was just too cool and desirable
to be ignored?  

My current bus (72) is in pretty good condition rust wise for an Ohio bus so
it was pretty much a done deal regardless.  However, the deal sealer so to
speak was the School House Rock bumper sticker that was on the rear bumper
and still had pretty good color.  School House Rock was on Saturday morning
between cartoons when I was a kid in the70's and I'll never forget such
blockbuster hits as "Conjunction Junction, what's your function" and "I'm
just a Bill, sitting on Capitol Hill".  

The old school green and white Recycle sticker on the other side of the rear
bumper was helpful but the School House Rock sticker was too much to pass
up.

On the 75 I had a few years ago, the bus was tolerably good for an Ohio bus
but it also had this really cool keychain with a matching, but older model,
really detailed blue and white metal 1:64 bus.  I bought the keychain and
the bus tagged along.  

To go farther OT, I once bought a Volvo 164 mainly because it had a set of
those white plastic 70's era Advent kitchen speakers in the back window.
I'm an Advent fan and had to have them.

One other question..... I see a lot of listers have named their buses, I saw
the same thing when I had a Vanagon for a while.  What are the stories
behind some of the names?  

My 72 does not yet have a name, I've never named a vehicle other than a MK3
Wolfsburg Jetta with constant electrical issues that was called "that piece
of $#(-at-)!"   Which is probably what my wife calls my 72 when I'm not around.

Happy Friday!

Joe
