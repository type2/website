Josh,
 
Look carefully at the distributor box below of course.  First place
to
rust out and have issues, followed by the rear Y tube, and on
early the front
tube when steel, not when paper obviouslly.  You
may be losing a lot somewhere
under the bus.
 
Front bilge blower, well they move air, but usually it is
just a lot
of cold air, however with a T1 blowing and no aux fan (even though
it's output becomes minimal in comparison at higher revs) you
might have a
good reason for one.
 
To my mind though, better use, particularly as it is
easy enough to
do is simply go recirculating at this point.  2 fans, suck out
of the rear
interior (as I've mentioned like 15 years back, using 2 dash
"eyeball"
vents with their flappers removed for intakes makes a nice trim)
and
blow down into the boxes, block or delete your type 1 shroud
outlets.  They
used to sell the kits for this for T1's, probably still
do but you can roll
something a lot cheaper.  Recirculating heat
gives a major improvement when
combined with a leak free system.
As those bilge blowers only go $18 or so off
*bay, probably the
best fan source though the smallest are 3", so you'd have
to go
up and down in size.
 
Fixing the heater cables is a nice thought but in
reality if you
want heat, nothing wrong with just ziptie em open cause it is a
vary rare occurence where you will have too much, if you do
in the
spring/fall, just blend more cool air from the front 8-)
Finally for heat, if
it's a Westy, jam 4" of old foam from couch
cushions up in the hole for the
winter.

to stay halfway
open to get heat out of the
de-mister and foot well vents.
However, splitting
the already weedy airflow
between these two just feels pretty poor. 
Especially as my bus is
Type-1-engined and airflow is tied to RPM.
