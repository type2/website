Kevin,

I'll take an inspirational role, you don't have to read it all. The photos
are the best part. I try to keep my copy light.

Those corners are indeed specific to '72-'79 Double and Single cabs. Yours
will be squared off without the indents, like all '68-'71 Double and Single
cabs. Good eye!

Thanks for looking. I am in the process of posting another update. This
project has been fun, but extremely challenging to say the least. This is
one rusty truck.
