Subject: [T2] Friday is sort of random/OT day, right?

My 71 Westfalia has a name. It's name is Sami
Our family refers to him as Sami bus.

Sami came with a file when we purchased it that said Sammy file.

They told us that the person they had purchased it from called it Sammy.

I actually tracked down that previous owner who said she named it after the
dog Sammi who she bought the bus from.
She said that when she picked up the bus their dog had climbed in and refused
to get out.
So after she left the name Sammi had been said so many times she said it just
stuck in her mind.

So that is how our bus got the name Sami

Of course the spelling has changed a couple of times.

Sami has a few stickers in the windows that appear to have been there for
years.

One of the stickers is from Hawaii where the bus lived at one time.

We keep them as part of his personality.

We have two Super Beetles with names as well.

They are Rag Doll and Lady Bug
