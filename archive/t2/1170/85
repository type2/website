Subject: Re: [T2] engine compartment seal

Although I agree with the other John (heat system is your likely culprit) the
seal you mean
is just a flat piece I believe?  So something local or certainly
looking online should net a
replacement if you really needed it.  It is real
good dense stuff (or was) though off the
top of my head local I'd come up with
a strip cut down from pickup cab/topper seal if you
have any about, cut to the
right width.  But I bet you can find something closer, a good
place to start
is McMaster-Carr on page 3550-3553 of the current (online) catalog.  Just
pick
your material width and thickness.  I've just realized that might be a great
source for
something for front air flaps as well looking at those pages.

Anybody know who is reproducing the seal on the top of the engine
compartment?  I didn't see it at my usual haunt, Busdepot.  I need one 
bad as
I'm getting more fumes than I like.  Or if they are no longer 
available, what
is the material and thickness?  I could fabricate 
something that would work
but don't want to waste money experimenting.  
Thanks...KR
