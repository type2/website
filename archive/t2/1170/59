The biggest expence seems to be casters, the good 8 inch ones are around $60
each from cp lauman and you may need to be a commercial buyer to purchase from
them, so you could expect to pay more
Get the steel from turner steel, delivery is free and its all 20' lengths, or
you can submit a cut list for the heavy gauge stuff at a cost.
