I wouldn't waste the money getting more thermocouple wire because that 
sensor is not temperature compensated anyways - for that I would 
recommend the Dakota Digital gauge - it gives a much more accurate (and 
trustworthy) display of your CHTs.

When I did have that sensor, I just used some speaker wire and the temps 
seemed to be somewhat close to what they were supposed to be, but that 
gauge never seemed that accurate as is...
