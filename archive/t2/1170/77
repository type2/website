"depending on finding the right fool."  That's usually ME!  Seriously, what would core value be?  I paid $50 for a 2.0 block when my local VW guru went out of business and assumed I'd gotten a good deal.  I planned on building or having it built and ready to drop in when my 1.7 gives up the ghost.  Which it doesn't seem inclined to do for a while.  Now I'm not sure I want the 2.0 after all since I don't have the FI stuff anymore and the 1.7 is supposed to be the most reliable long-term.  What should I ask for it?  Thanks....KR
