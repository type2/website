	agreed, if one is trying to assess the condition of the 
pistons, rings & valves in a quasi-quantitative way.
	But finding all 4 cyls the same, at a readable tho' v low 
figure (20 psi) at hand-cranking speed, and with no oil mentioned as 
squirted in the plug 'oles, would strongly encourage me to look 
further into that motor.  The preliminary vague conclusion is: 
pistons, rings & valves may well be OK.
