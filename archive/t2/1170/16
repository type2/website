What seems to be the accepted best vendor for Hall style points 
replacement module these days for a vacuum advance dizzy?

My spares bus stash is a bunch of vacuum distributors with 10+ years 
old Accufire and Compufire modules.

My main memory loss question here is,
what is the style coil to use with these Hall units?  . . . 
Ballasted, or non-ballasted (?-1)

I think that answer is ballasted style (?-2)
with an approx. 3-4 ohm primary resistance (?-3)
Blue Coil made in Brazil, or (?)

Thanx,
