hmm, I was looking for a bay, preferrably with a 2 liter engine and auto 
transmission,  (had several previous buses) had "Wanted" flyers up here 
and there where bus pilots hung out. pure chance I came accross a flyer 
selling a 78 with auto tranny. called immediately and found the guy 
couldn't sell it and couldn't sell it and was about to part it out. I 
immediately paid a visit and found not only was it an auto tranny but it 
had a dropped floor for wheelchair entry (I use a wheelchair.) that sealed 
the deal instantly.  even better I found out the guy selling it was 
looking for the engine that was in my current ride, a 1970 Mercedes. so it 
didn't take long to work out a swap.  he got my Mercedes 250C and I got 
the bus, as soon as he got it back together and inspected, took about a 
week.   that was 18 years ago and haven't regretted it, have done lots of 
work to keep it running and it still is my daily driver, 200k more miles 
on it too.!  and I've been asked several times, no it is not for sale! 
drove it to the post office about 3hrs ago.
