I pulled that mid-bus distributor box out completely and I also replaced 
all of the pipe from the rear y-tube forward with aluminum stretch-pipe 
covered with foil-covered bubble wrap.  The air coming out of the vents 
is too hot to hold my hands over.

The rear cage blower really does next to nothing... well, at least on a 
type4.  I'm not sure how well it works on a type1.  As for a front 
blower, you gotta be careful because if the heater system is nicely 
insulated, it'll melt the front blower!  Also, another reason I've never 
put a blower up front is because I don't want to suck air forward, and 
possibly suck exhaust fumes in.  I'd much rather push air from the back 
and lose some of that pressurized air instead.
