Subject: RE: [T2] Please Help! Timing a new Distributor

OK she's running smoothly!   WOOO HOOOOO!

Thanks for ALL of the info you guys are great!

I think the issue was the new distributor, the rotor was REALLY REALLY tight
and not seated well.   I tapped it down with a hammer and she started right
up.

Thanks!  Tomorrow I go for a ride!
