Hey Jon,

 

Thanks for posting. I don't have time to read thru every single post/blog of
everyone-but I love seeing bits and pieces here and there.helps keep me
inspired. I'll be checking it out every now and then.

 

One question about the rear corner, it looks like it has a little indent for
the bumper. Did all bay window pickups have this? I have a '69 singlecab,
that does not have it. But I think the PO put new rear corners/lots of bondo
in the rear corners of mine.
