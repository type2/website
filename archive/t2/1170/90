I have seen vw aircooled engines sit for 20 years and still run, as long as 
 they are out of the wheather and not sitting on the ground and it helps if 
 the gas isnt in them.  But doing a comprssion test by HAND is pretty much  
worthless  later  md

I have a  71 camper  parked 26 yrs ago in the woods when the rear axle

fine.  Every year when we hiked by it I'd turn the engine by hand;  think 
it sat last few years untouched and lask week I turned it- turned  over 
OK, you could feel the compression.  The oil still looks clean.  With all 
rotted out, I'd have to jack it up to reach starter and bring a  bottle 
with tube or marine tank to run to the fuel pump.  Holly-Weber  carb 
likely gunked up too.
