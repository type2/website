Subject: shrinkage... length of bead on door track cover

Hey,, I am having shrinkage troubles... sigh...
The sliding door track cover , and the similar tin on the other side,, have
a plastic bead.. I took mine off to store while painting the bus,, and now
they are 2" short!
so, i looked at the other camper I have in the driveway... same thing.. but
they are installed still!

so... can you tell me if yours is longer?

Like,, does the bead go from end to end,, or has it shrunk?   I ass-u-me
that it originally was full length.
