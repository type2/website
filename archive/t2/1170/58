on my 78 they are brackets that are bolted onto both the moustace bar and 
onto the frame, two bolts each place.

When I remove my engine usually I remove one set of bolts from the bar and 
one set from the frame, makes it easier to reinstall.

should be able to get a set from Busted Bus or some other used source
