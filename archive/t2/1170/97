Subject: RE:Radio Static

Well I had some time to try some diagnosing, based on  some listee
suggestions. 

 

This is what I get-The static appears to be independent of the engine
running. 

 

What I did find-the radio has a female plug on it. The actual metal
connection is deep inside the plug end. So when you plug something into it,
it is covered in a plastic cover. (I hope that makes sense). 

 

The antenna wire is male, metal plug. Looks kind of like a banana plug. So
if I put the male plug near the female plug, the reception improves, as soon
as the male end is inside the plastic part of the female plug, reception is
great. If I put the plug all the way in, the static returns and get's worse.

 

I thought a simple fix would be to replace the wire from the antenna to the
radio, but thought I'd throw the question to you guys first.I'm also going
to write to the manufacturer of the radio.
