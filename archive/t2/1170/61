My work bought a rolling scaffold from these folks.  The wheels seem to be of
good quality.

  We have one of these.  The scaffold is nicely made, stable, and fits
together very well.

29" W x 6' L x 6' H ALUMINUM SCAFFOLDING ROLLING  TOWER WITH ALUMINUM FRAME
DECK USD 325.00 Weight 90 Lbs Load Rate 750 Lbs

Customer service is a bit 'unusual' but, they delivered exactly what we asked,
on time and to where we needed it.  When I had some difficulty in assembly,
after we bought some additional kit, they were able to direct me through the
issue smoothly.  Hard to ask for anything more than that.
