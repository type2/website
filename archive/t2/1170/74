Subject: RE: [T2] engine question

LOL Thanks for the support Andy!  But he practically gave me the car!  And I agreed to drop the engine for him, so I am not being taken advantage of.

And thanks Joe, if this sale falls thru I might just fire it up, but how would I secure the engine, its already out of the car?
