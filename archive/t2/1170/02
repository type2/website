Subject: Re: [T2] Please Help! Timing a new Distributor

Rotate your engine to TDC on compression stroke of cylinder #1. It is
possible to be in TDC of exhast stroke and no spark happens then! If
you don't know which, but you are on TDC for #1, I would pop the valve
cover on the right side and see if you can get a .006in feeler guage
under both valves. If you can only get the feeler under one or none,
you are not on the compression stroke.

Rather than a timing light, connect a simple diagnostic lamp between
the #1 (neg) on the coil, the other wire to ground on the case. Slowly
rotate the distributor cap c-clockwise until the lamp flashes on. That
puts you in the ballpark for starting the engine and timing it with a
timing gun.
