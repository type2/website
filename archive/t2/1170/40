I thought that a 3 ohm coil was by definition a non-ballasted coil,
while a 1.5 ohm coil requires an external ballast resistor.

The ballast is necessary on the 1.5 ohm coil because the extra
resistance of the ballast is necessary once the engine gets up to
temperature to prevent the coil from getting overloaded due to the low
ohms. At temperature the ballast resistance plus the internal
resistance should equal 3.

In contrast, the 3 ohm non-ballasted coil might be hard to start on a
very cold morning. But will be just fine once the engine is warmed up.

I recommend the Pertronix, or points and a CDI unit.
