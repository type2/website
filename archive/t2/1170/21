Subject: pic of key

I've posted a pic of the key

What I can't figure out - is there are two seals. Here is a link to
something like what I bought -

You can see the seal hanging off to the side. This makes sense to me, I see
you attach it and use it only when the key is removed.

 

The 2nd one is a seal, that the key is supposed to fit in, so when you have
the key installed, there is no chance of grease, water, or oil getting in
around the key. 

 

If you see where the key is inserted into the disconnect thing, there is a
black plastic thing. This is some sort of seal. I don't see how the key fits
through this. I think it is probably a straightforward stupidly easy thing,
that I just don't see...and as soon as someone shows me-I'll be like, "Damn
I am an idiot".
