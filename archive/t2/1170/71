"YMMV widely on this one.
John"

OK so I hope I don't get flamed for this, but when John used YMMV in his post
I had to look it up, I know I am ignorant. Here is what I found, thought all
might enjoy the laugh! :)

*****	YMMV	Your Mileage May Vary
***	YMMV	Yam Mild Mosaic Virus (virology)
*	YMMV	Your Method May Vary
*	YMMV	Your Market May Vary (advertisements)
*	YMMV	You Make Me Vomit
