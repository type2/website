Subject: RE: [T2] re:Engine mounting

Hey paul,

Yeah, after more searching I am coming to that conclusion-thanks for the
info. I have yet to see a clear picture of this. I may head to a local
mechanic-he always has a few VW' buses in his  yard.

I was wondering - can I use this rigid bar temporarily with a stock exhaust
(if so, I can install the exhaust, and drive the bus somewhere to have the
correct mounts welded back on. I'll see when the muffler arrives...and I try
to put it all back together.

Those are part of the structure of the frame.   Can't imagine why they cut
those off unless damaged in a rear collision or rust. I have heard cases of
those rusting through and the entire engine falls on that side.  Junk yard
find possibly?
