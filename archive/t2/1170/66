Subject: thermostat pulley bolt and special washer

Hi Folks,
          I'm installing a thermostat on my Vanagon engine.  I need the bolt
that the cable pulley rides on (cant find a part number), and the "special
washer for thermostat" (021-119-175). I understand the bolt is not a "standard
bolt",  i.e. has a smooth section for the pulley to ride on. If anyone has
these I would be happy to pay shipping +.  Too small of an order for the big
boys, and they have done well out of me recently.  Thanks to John Anderson for
the pulley.  I'm currently in Northern CA (95694) if that is a help.
