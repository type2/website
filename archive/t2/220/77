Art,

I wonder if the "binding" she is refering to is the normal
dist cam edges moving the points?

We all know how bad some of the points rubbing blocks are holding up 
lately.

Does she have spare points?  Can she put them in?

Supposed to be one of the spares you carry in your emergency kit!

Cheers ,dave
