Subject: Re: [T2] Motor Changes For the Bus

putting a 911 motor in your bus is no big deal.....

many have done it with stock bus tranny and with 911 5 speed

if you have a friend that understands 911s and can point you in the right 
direction....

If you can find a good running but rusty 911 , or a crashed one the parts are 
not that expensive compared to a big Type 4

My friend has one in his car hauler, another friend has one in a single cab, 
I know of another that was bought for about $4000 (1970 bus with 911 motor) 
that is now in Japan and a couple of crazies with big motor 911 motors.....

in the next couple months there will be a story on a split screen bus with 
911 power from Florida , top top notch work (better be for 100 grand )

have fun  if you want to do it, it will be a great drive
