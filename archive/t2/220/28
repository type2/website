FWIW, it may not have even been a straight, complete, or running bus.
It's easy to make a trashed beater look good enough for one or two camera
angles for 3 seconds at 50 feet.  Might've been a rustbucket with bad
rear torsion housing. :-)

I don't mean to excuse 'em for creaming what might have been straight,
torchable body panels -- just that I've seen "how they done it" specials
where you realize how easy it is to make beaters look like good cars just
long enough.
