Diminishing returns. Would the 911 transplant really be any better under a 
bus than a warmed over Bus suspension with sway bars, better bushings, and 
better brake/wheel/tire combo?

I'd guess not but I'd love to see somebody try it and give us a report.

That is why I don't pursue some of the other transplants. I want 
functionality. I don't want to loose any space in my bus to radiators or 
revised engine compartments to stick in a SBC V-8. For the same reasons I 
would not want to dump the camper features of my van to loose some weight.

Seems any bus is going to drive like a bus because of it's shape. The 
suspension fixes would certainly help though.

I like dirt roads and fording creeks too much to give up the bus 
suspension. I used to often wonder about grafting a handmade 4 wheel 
independent suspension based on a hot rod style A-arm setup - upper and 
lower arms. Would work but would it be worth it? At that point - might as 
well graft in a Synchro 4WD system.

Fun to wonder about all this 911/4WD stuff.
