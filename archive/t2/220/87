I just got Tom wilson's book "How to rebuild your volkswagen air cooled =
engine" and man, is that a great book.  I have read about half of it =
already and have added tons of knowledge to my brain.  Chapter one is =
very informative.  If you ask me, it should be required reading for all =
VW owners.
