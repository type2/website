Lack of adequate reserve power to maintain highway speed is a
primary consideration of the engine swap. It is sometimes beneficial
to be able to increase speed quickly to avoid a danger situation,
and to avoid those inevitable tailgaters trapped in your vapor trail.
Underpowerd , at the horsepower peak and too slow for traffic
makes your bus the hazard, not the best situation for traffic flow.
Other drivers are aware of the bus when it's causing the problem.
You must compensate by being more alert and anticipating.
