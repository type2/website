Get excited about this one Billy Bob---     

It is basically a good idea to run one heat range hotter to ward off
fouling of a higher mileage engine--or in the winter months where
enrichment of the fuelling system is the norm----it will be more prone
to firing in sub-zero weather.

I also like NGK platinum tipped plugs--they run longer, and cleaner

Later,

Thanks. 
I hardly ever get excited about what counter guys tell me.

I bumped my 2l FI 78 up a notch to the next level hotter plugs for a 
year or two, didn't notice any difference so I just run the regular spec
plugs
