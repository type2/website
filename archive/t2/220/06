Subject: Re: [T2] Shift Coupler

Hiya Todle,

The shift coupler hooks up your shift rod and the transaxle.  You could think 
of it as a sort-of universal joint between the rod and the transaxle.  It is 
subject to a lot of stress as you run up and down through the gears.  To 
replace one with another from a boneyard is a risky exercise at best.  Who 
knows what you're getting?  And consider this, a brand new one from your 
FLAPS will only run about $7.50.

In addition to the shift coupler, If you are experiencing sloppy shifting do 
know that replacing your shifter bushings will play a big part in bringing 
around a tighter shifting pattern.  The part often referred to as the front 
shifter bushing is located just under the hole in the floor through which 
passes the shift lever.  It is not really the front shifter bushing.  It is, 
rather, the shift rod pivot pin.  90% of the time replacing this will tighten 
up your shift pattern considerably.  The actual two shifter bushings are 
located along the length of the shifter rod.  The front one can be replaced 
by crawling under the bus and separating the shift rod into its component 
pieces.  However, replacing the rear shift bushing usually requires the 
transmission to be moved.
