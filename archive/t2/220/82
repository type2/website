Subject: Buses Of The Corn, Just 2 Weeks to Go!

Hi Volks,

It's just two weeks to go before the gates open on Buses Of the Corn 
2002. We've got a bunch of cool stuff going on and there are dozens of 
buses confirmed to attend.  There's still plenty of room for more 
campers; all I ask is to drop me an email to confirm that you're 
attending.

The gates will be open Friday from Noon. Nothing official is planned for 
Friday, so just arrive, set up and relax. Saturday will start with a 
Burrito Breakfast and end with a Corn Roast and Campfire, and there will 
be plenty of things to do in the meanwhile. We'll have a 9-hole frisbee 
golf course and events to test your skills at driving, camping and 
troubleshooting buses. Sunday morning we'll be packing up for a 9AM 
carabus departure headed to the Great Canadian Bug Show in Mississauga, 
about 75KM to the west.

Here are some more  details for those interested in coming out to join 
us.

COST:
Cost is $15 for two nights prepaid, or $10 prepaid for Saturday night 
only. $5 extra will be charged if you pay on arrival, so save yourself 
some cash and pay early. There are some great door-prizes already, and 
further donations will be gratefully accepted. You can pre-pay with 
paypal to greg-potts(-at-)rogers.com or else email me for my postal address. 
Money left over after the weekend's expenses are paid will go to support 
www.type2.com.

BREAKFAST BURRITOS,
We'll be serving up the Full Moon Bus Club's World Famous Breakfast 
Burritos on Saturday. The Burrito Breakfast still needs lots of 
ingredients, see the list at 
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/VW_type2/BOTC/Burrito.html and let me know 
what you can bring; I'll update the list as often as possible.  Please 
bring your own cutlery and dishes to help reduce the garbage created, 
and we'll provide dishwashing facilities.

KIDS GAMES:
Buses of the Corn is a Family Event, and we expect to have lots of kids 
around.  We'll keep them busy with a  water-balloon toss, a Scavenger 
Hunt, and lots of other activities.

GAMES FOR GROWN UPS:
Bring your favourite flying disk for a round of Frisbee Golf, plus other 
activities like the Bus Driving Competition, Camping Skills Competition 
and the Type Two Troubleshooting Trials.

POT LUCK DINNER AND CORN-ROAST
We'll have plenty of farm-fresh corn, butter and salt on hand to feed 
everyone. The Cornroast will be accompanied by a pot luck dinner, please 
bring a side dish or a dessert to share with the group. As with the 
Burrito Breakfast, please bring your own cutlery and dishes.

T-SHIRTS
T-Shirt orders are still coming in, so I have extended the payment 
deadline until Friday August 9th. Shirts are only $15 for Adults, $10 
for kids. There won't be shirts for sale at the event. If you're 
interested please let me know ASAP!  The shirt design is here:

DIRECTIONS
Exit 401 at Brock St. in Whitby. Go North on Brock to Taunton Rd. Take 
Taunton Rd. LEFT from Brock St. to Country Lane Rd.
Go RIGHT on Country Lane Rd. to the end and turn RIGHT on Lyndebrook 
Rd.   Follow lyndebrook to the end, there's a parking lot there with a 
gate on the right. Follow the gravel road to the end, it's about 1/2 
mile or so.

ANOTHER THING...
If you're arriving after dark, you may find the gate locked. Park policy 
says it has to stay that way. We'll keep the key under a rock next to 
the gate post so you can unlock the gate, drive through, lock it up 
again and put the key back under the rock for the next camper.
If there's a problem at the gate, call my cell: (416) 568-5237.

WHEW!!!
Sure glad that's out of the way. Have a great weekend and hopefully I'll 
see you out at Buses Of the Corn!

Happy trails,
