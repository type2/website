Subject: Busses make it to "real" magazine

 Since it's Friday...                                                 
I was reading through the new issue of Cars & Parts magazine, which   
usually features stuff like 1936 Cadillacs, perfect restorations of   
old American cars, etc- the $30-$50k stock restorations. Anyway, in   
one article, a feature on one of the big classic car auctions, there  
was a picture of a '74 Sportsmobile camper, one owner, going for      
$12.5k...                                                             
Then a few pages later was an article about a Rt. 66 classic car      
cruise-in, which featured our very own Jerry Jess's Bessie, with a    
quote about "deadheads" following the "Grateful Dead" in it (Their    
quotes, not mine)                                                     
  Anyway, I just thought it was funny that some VW's are making it    
into the classic American car circuit...and some for high dollars,    
apparently.
