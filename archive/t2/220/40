Subject: [T2] Oil Everywhere!!!!

Please help!!!!!!!

Two nights ago, I was driving down the road and everything in my bus was
running fine.  I pulled up to a stop sign, and as I pushed down the clutch
to put it in first, there was no resistance at all.  I thought maybe the
clutch cable had snapped but I managed to put it into first.  As I began to
let out the clutch, though, it was a very rough transition.  The whole bus
shook violently.  I managed to ease her home and when I inspected things
last night, I noticed possible problem #2.  There's oil all over the starter
and flex hose coming out of the heat exchanger and really everything on that
side of the engine.  I have no idea where it's coming from.  On top of
things, it started pouring rain on me while I was working on her.

And so there I was, soaking wet and two problems with the bus.  Does anyone
have any insight on either of them?  Thanks.
