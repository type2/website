Suggest you get your fees up front before agreeing to install such a motor. 
If it cost less than $2000 for a reman long block with rebuild and timed 
pump, it's not likely good spec. But this one you day is "new". We talking 
VW Brazil or what?? Pull the valve cover and pan and look things over to 
verify the assembly before testing compression and pump pressures, or you 
could have many hours in the installation with a resulting no start.
