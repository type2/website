Subject: vw pics and vwoa license


I kinda hate to open this can of worms again, but has anyone seen this
yet?

http://vwlicense.ipprotector.com/ent.html

Yes. I know it is on the "evil' website, but after reading
thru it, it looks like it might be "halfway" reasonable.

The part that really bothers me though is this part...

"Licensee is also permitted to display images of Volkswagen Vehicles, 
provided those images were not taken from the official Volkswagen website, 
www.vw.com, or other Volkswagen copyrighted documentation."

So, does this mean that I m not permitted to show pics of any of my
vw vehicles unless I sign this agreement?....I don't think so...I "own"
those cars, I don't license them from vw like software.  And should be 
able to display pics of them anywhere I want ....and give others 
permission to do the same.

Ummm, you two lawyers out there...what think you?

Cheers ,dave
