hey Bob, I do have a garage that I can put stuff in and since I'm a 
bachelor, no one will complain!!!  I've already decided to go out there and 
get as much stuff as I feasibly can.  I'll also take pictures and post the 
inventory to the list to see if anyone wants copies of the pics.  You've 
made a good point, you can't save them all, but I'll at least try to do 
what I can.  Greg
