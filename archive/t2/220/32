Yeah, Baby 8^)
( But at least I'm enjoyin' the ride :)
The 911 remains an excellent choice for a bus engine swap.
( and far cheaper than the new Porsche Ceyenne SUV, another
excellent ( as in "party time , excellent ")  way
( no way ?) ( WAY ! ) to zap VWoA for their failure to
participate in vintage resto support :). I am currently accepting
donations to continue the protest ( buy me the Porsche :).

Engine R+R can be accomplished in a few minutes if you
go with triple Webers ( to virtually eliminate wiring harness )
and notch the engine latch panel like the splits and early bay
to drop the engine on a milk crate without jacking the bus.
