The clutch problem.
I would first pull out the cable and inspect it just to be sure.
If you take off the wingnut you can pull it out through the front without
taking it off the pedal. If its ok just regrease it and push it back in.
If the cable is bad, thats good. If its good thats not so good as it will
probably be the throwout arm or the pressure plate and either is going to
require an engine pull. Wghen you get the engine out it should be pretty
 easy to see  what has gone wrong.

The oil leak.
Could be a valve cover gasket. real easy.
Could be push rod tube seals. not so easy.
Might just be from the road draft tube which is on that side.
Clean it up as good as you can and hopefully you will be able to see the
leak source.

I might do it before I pulled the engine so if its tube seals or even a
push rod tube itself you could do it while the engine is out.

good luck
