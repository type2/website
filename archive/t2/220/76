Subject: Re: [T2] parts place auto parts



I have received their catalog for years, and they contain testimonials from 
satisfied customers.  I actually have a catalog coming in the mail as we 
speak.  Most recyclers are 'required' to charge for the core.  I think some 
states require that recyclers at least attempt to recover the used parts 
that people will likely throw into landfills, should the business fail to 
acquire them.  As-is just means it comes without any kind of warranty.
