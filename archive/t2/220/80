By all means, save what you can.  I urge anyone with the means and the
opportunity to save whatever is possible from sales like this, because once it
is gone, IT IS GONE.

And that's something that irks me about businesses going out of business.  The
customers are good enough to be soaked big time for the "rare and valuable"
parts out back, but when time to dispose, we aren't good enough to have any of
that "junk."  Something else that burns my hide is when a place has a fire
sale like that, the prices are so high, no one buys the stuff, but when the
stuff goes to scrap, the business doesn't get any money anyway, so what's the
point of the sale?  I went to a junkyard where the guy crushed cars just to be
doing something, and my friend wanted something off a Firebird, but the price
was so high he didn't buy it, then the car was crushed and everything wasted. 
Scrap around here is about .01 per 100 lbs.  Done venting.

I may take a ride down there, if I haven't deleted the name of the place(did
anyone ever say?) since it isn't too far from Atlanta.

Hope everyone has a nice weekend.
