Why does this help?

What else can I do?

Thanks in advance,

This helps because you are matching the engine revs to the revs of the 
transmission. Blipping the throttle on downshifts brings the engine up
to the higher speed of the lower gear. Matched correctly, and the clutch
isn't needed at all  8-)  except for dead starts...The sad first guess of why 
it's grinding is worn synchros, although it "could" just be slightly out of
shifting alignment...
