if desperate, take the pin out of the bottom of the dizzy, MARK WHICH WAY
IT GOES. then pull the shaft out.  clean it up real good in there and soak
it in heavy gear oil-steal some from tranny if you have to this is just to
get one off the side of the road.  carefully put it back together and
hopefully the heavy weight of the oil will help it run true for a few
dozen miles.
