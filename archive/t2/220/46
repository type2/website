Didn't mean to say that anything was interchangeable like some Rolex watch 
versus a fake Rolex - just that at some point long ago the designs - 
Porsche and VW four bangers - were similar and then the engineers took the 
Porsche version to the moon while the VW version continued to putter along 
as the same old design with minor improvements.
