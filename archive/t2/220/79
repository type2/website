not bad for just making it legal (in vw's eyes) to have enthusiasts
allowed to use TM's of VW

Naturally IANAL, but I'm guessing this phrase is in there simply to
allow people to use images of VW's specifically while not allowing
taking the images from VW itself.[0] But one other problem w/ this is
what about old sales literature? Isn't this copyrighted? Would rob
have to take down his usefull & (usually) humorous flyers from old VW?
This should be something they address. But like most legalese that
phrase could be turned around w/ a good forked tounge lawyer. :)


[0] I can understand that, it costs a lot for comercial artists & web
designers.
