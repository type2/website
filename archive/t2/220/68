Subject: Front Shift Bushing (was "Shift Coupler")

Hello All:
All this talk about shift couplers and bushings and such has my mind on one
of my ongoing issues:  ultra-sloppy shifting due to a worn-out and mangled
front shift bushing (the circular rubber thing).  Anyway, I remember reading
here once where someone was able to replace this bushing without having to
mess with also removing the shifter apparatus from the floor above; he said
he was able to move the front section of the shift rod (separated from the
rear section) far enough back to slip the bushing into housing at the front
of the rod.  I got under and cuss and try as I might, I could not make it
happen.  I cannot move the front section of the rod far enough back, and I
don't want to force anything.  Is there anyone else out there who has been
able to do it this way without removing the shifter and if so, what is the
secret?  I just don't want to remove the whole shifter assembly, go through
the mysteries of getting it all back together right, then have my shifting
end up being even worse (which is what I keep reading here).  Thanks for any
contributons!
