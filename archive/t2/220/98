Howdy ya all from Canada.
i just bought the old 72 and yeally love it.only thing is 1st and second
gear are 
hard to find, 3rd and 4th no problem.could this be the dreaded sincro i've
heard 
about or should i check the clutch cable and assorted items related to this?
The other thing is the oil leakage, its just dripping,not gushing and have
been trying to
figure out the location. looks like right under where the push rods are
located,
can anyone confirm that changing the push rod seals will solve such a leak.
thanks,
the new guy
