Bob, 

Thanks for the help. I think those are just a bit too far away for me. Jay said he spoke to the guy down here, Joe Cooper and he'd be willing to do a bit of side stuff, I just lost his info. (dummy)
The 71 isnt bad, you're right. Actually, mine is running great and am having no problems. New carb and new brakes make it darn close to perfect! I'm trying to restore my 67 ghia, and have had all the rust cut and welded, but am going to start sanding and painting the interior and wanted to have someone pull the engine and get it tip top so i can put it right back in when its all done. I just dont have the time to do the engine stuff and the body stuff right now. Full time job, part time school and all that. Guess I am just trying to expedite the job a bit. I guess is I have to, I'll mess with it too, guess it couldnt hurt me!

Thanks again, 
Melissa
