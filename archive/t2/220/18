Subject: full gas tank = gas leak 


hello list,

this morning i filled my gas tank all the way up for the 1st time.  
suddenly, after finishing i heard a dripping sound. well, on the driver's 
side at the back of the bus, gas was leaking down.  it looked like there was 
a screw or something, and that's where it was leaking from. i used a rag but 
this agrevated the issue further.  after about 500 ml of gas, while laying 
on the ground looking at this, it stopped.

WHAT IS GOING ON?

tia
luis
ps: i'am a newbie
