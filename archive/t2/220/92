If the cable is not the problem, just check the lever on the transmission
the cable attaches to before pulling the engine.
I had this on my bus a while ago, the cable was fine, but there was a hair
line fracture in the lever, so it was slipping on the spline rather than
turning the shaft the throw out bearing sits on. I was very difficult to
see, and I unfortunately pulled the engine to discover this.
