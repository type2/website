Since it's Friday...
I was reading through the new issue of Cars & Parts magazine, which
usually features stuff like 1936 Cadillacs, perfect restorations of
old American cars, etc- the $30-$50k stock restorations. Anyway, in
one article, a feature on one of the big classic car auctions, there
was a picture of a '74 Sportsmobile camper, one owner, going for
$12.5k...
Then a few pages later was an article about a Rt. 66 classic car
cruise-in, which featured our very own Jerry Jess's Bessie, with a
quote about "deadheads" following the "Grateful Dead" in it (Their
quotes, not mine)
  Anyway, I just thought it was funny that some VW's are making it
into the classic American car circuit...and some for high dollars,
apparently.
