The parts for the Porsche engine are about 5 times the price of the same
parts for the Type IV. How about $50 for a distributor cap, $16 for a
rotor?

I know a running, no papers 3.0 or 3.2 from an SC or a Carrera is worth
$5000. A papered (maintenance records) engine is worth another $2500. I
don't know about the 2.4 or 2.7 litre engines, but I'm sure they are
similar. A word of advice: if the CIS or Bosch EFI aren't working right,
replace them with carbs. Check out prices on parts at PelicanParts.com as
well as info.

BTW, the 1976 912E had the same T4 engine as the 914. And the 914-6 is a
real rarity. The engines are like gold - actually gold prices are a little
low right now...

On the positive side, the Porsche 6 engines are actually more reliable
than VW engines because of the materials used and the tighter tolerances.
