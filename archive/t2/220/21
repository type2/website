Against my better judgement I'll chime in here.

Im not a cooling guy, the company I work for designs
radiant floor heating systems for residential and
commercial use.

In northern canada the heat load for a building is
never worse than 50 btus/square foot.  Most new homes
are no worse that 35 btu/square foot. Cooling loads run
in that range also.

When we do a snow melted side walk or driveway systems
we size it at around 150 btu/square foot.  Its the
highest energy output panel we do!

Bringing this into my world, if you figure the bus to
14' by 4' internal horizontal space and gosinta 5100
btu output, thats around 91 btus per square foot! This
is a lot of energy for heating or cooling!

Please dont forget that its 5100 btus output as long as
it is on. For an analogy; its not like spending $5100
at one time, its $5100 every month for the rest of your
life!

Trust me 5100 btus is A LOT of energy taken at a
constant rate
