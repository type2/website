If you are turning it over with the starter motor, recommended procedure, and
you haven't seen oil pressure at the sensor within 15-20 seconds, something is
really wrong.

I finally am putting the long block I got from aircooled.net tonite.
It's all in & ready. I'm going through John's procedure for first
start & break in. I am turning the engine over w/ spark plugs removed
and the oil pressure sensor removed trying to get oil throughout the
engine. How long could it take to produce some oil at the oil pressure
sensor hole? It seems to have already been a while. Thanks for any
indication on this. I'm trying to get the thing running for work
monday.
