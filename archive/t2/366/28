This is going to sound daft, but if you turn glass bodied GBC fuses so that
the broad side of the fuse element faces back in the direction that you view
them from, you can easily see if they're intact or not.  Especially if you
use a flashlight to see up under the dash.

Then again, I don't have the clear cover on mine.  Someone thinks that they
have one somewhere, and if they find it, they'll be sending it my way for
repro'ing.
