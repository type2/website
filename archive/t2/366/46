Well I adjusted mine this weekend. I have 40k on a rebuild. I followed the
last steps in Boston Bobs article. I warmed up the engine and then let it
cool enough to work on it. Screwed the adjusters out until there was play in
the rockers then screwed them back in until they were just contacting the
valve. Then turned them in another 1/2 turn to put some preload on the
lifters.

The result was a smoother idle and smoother acceleration through all gears.
Maybe it was just my imagination but it seems to have helped a little. I did
not do a compression test to see if there was any difference.
