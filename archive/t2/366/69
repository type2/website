Subject: Re: [T2] poptop doesn't latch down tightly?

One of them did not work, the wire that wraps around that bend was missing. 
I replaced it though, and it still does the same thing. Maybe I should just 
take both of the braces off and see if I can latch it down tight without 
them in place once. From what I remember, they were a real B8tch to remove 
though. I don't remeber why, but im sure I will soon enougn.

Yes, mine just latches in the center, and that is all.
