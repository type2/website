Subject: Re: [T2] Fuses

 On glass body fuses, even if the conductor looks perfect the fuse can be
bad.  I had a Honda 400F motorcycle that gave me fits with lights not
working and trouble was a fuse that looked good but showed infinite
resistance on volt/ohm meter.  Happened at least 3 times.  I think it got
too warm and lost its connection with one of the end caps.
