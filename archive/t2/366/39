Subject: 76 westy FS in New Orleans

This is my friends bus, and when you email me I will forward to him. I've
ridden in it and its nice inside, though that was when it was runnning. I
hope it can go to a good home! - wink

It's a '76 westy with all the regular original stuff- sink, stove,
fridge,etc.
It's been sitting for almost 3 years- but I'm sure it wouldn't take much to
make her a driver again, except the through-out bearing is messed up- hence
the clutch wasn't working- hence she sat and sat.
Over all it's solid, but it's starting to show some rust; but nothing
through and the underside is totally solid.
So what's she worth?  I wanted $1976.00 (same price as year) but as is, if
someone would just come and get it. $1500.
