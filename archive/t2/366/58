Subject: Reduced power after tune-up

I'm not sure where to start but I am completely confused. I (VW novice)
finished a tune-up and repair work on my '72 bus (type 4 engine) the
other day. I replaced my alternator and voltage regulator which
satisifed my little red light on the dashboard(doesn't come on any more)
and then proceeded to do a tune-up. I replaced the points, condenser,
cap, rotor, spark plugs and wires, in an attempt to get better
performance from my newly purchased bus. After all this work I read that
it is good to check the timing as well, so I did. It was way off, so I
made the necessary adjustments. My thoughts at this point were that
everything I have done should enhance my engine performance (I am having
problems with dieseling after I turn off the engine). But to my dismay,
my engine performance was worse than before I made the changes (no weird
noises). When I step on the accelerator it hesitates until I pull back
and step on the accelerator even slower. I'm not getting the pick up I
used to get in first and second gear and I'm still diesling after I turn
off the engine. Any suggestions??
