Stafford Nut and Bolt (though they may have renamed).  Take riverwatch
downtown and onto Jones, pass Redmond's upolstery on your right, then
Slim's shop on your left.  You'll then see an assortment of large
warehousy buildings on your left. (the store fronts are on Reynolds).
You should see signs for Staffords Paint and Body supply store.  The nut
and bolt warehouse is right next door.

Both are open to the public and staffed by great folks.  The bolthouse
usually has a $10 minimum so buy something. :)

There is also a Fastenal store on Commerical Blvd in Martinez, another in
Aiken...my experience with fastenal though is that they prefer larger
purchases...though sometimes they can get more obscure things that
stafford cannot.
