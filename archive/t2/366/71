Subject: another 2.0 l engine teardown query

I'm now in the process of removing the heads to inspect and replace the seals
(obvious leaks on both heads) but it seems that there is not enough room to
get either the correct socket or a box end wrench in to loosen two of the four
nuts without rubbing up against the rocker shaft. The Bentley says not to
disassemble the rocker shaft and to remove the heads with them in place. Am I
missing something? Does the rocker shaft need to be removed to get to those
two bolts? Thanks again for all the help. The engine would still be sitting
under the bus in my driveway had it not been for all the good advice I
received on my first engine pull.
Also, I'm feeling a little wary about reinstallation....do I want to replace
the clutch plate while the engine is out? How do you check it? Do the
pushrods, tubes and seals need to be replaced? What else should I look into
replacing/checking before reinstallation? If this all goes well, I hope to
fully rebuild a 2.0 liter air cooled engine from scratch (famous last words).
