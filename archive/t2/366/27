Subject: 9 pin flasher pics

Andy,

Wen't out to the bone yard and took a couple of pics of that 9 pin flasher and 
one of the bus itself but couldn't find a VIN# on the bus. The VIN from up 
front on the dash was removed. Didn't buy the flasher but the guys at flaps are 
going to hold it for me if I or anybody else wants it.
