For some reason this was returned undelivered to Beth so I'm posting to the 
list and hope she sees it.

Follow steps thus:

Verify rest voltage of battery. If not at least 12.5volts, charge it. If it 
won't hold, replace it.
Verify battery case and cables are clean and tight, both ends. Same for the 
ground strap at the front of the trans.
Verify 12 volt feeds to the double relay. See the fuel injection section in 
the Bentley.
Verify 12v at the fuel pump.

Do that much then let me know what's up. Your issue could be any of many 
things and we must rule them out one by one to find the culprit.

Are you talking about a little 2" cube called a relay??? or the many wires 
hooked to the solinoid?? It would be helpfull to know the year of this 
T-II. I'm assuming fuel injected???
