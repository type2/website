Beth,

I may be missing it, but looking at the schematic, I can't find any fuse 
that would keep your van from starting. If anyone knows of one let me know.

You can test fuses by measuring the resistance with a VOM (volt ohm meter). 
It is a simple test and should be described in the operation instructions 
that come with the meter.

Low cost VOMs (less than $20) work just fine for this and many other 
troubleshooting measurements on your van.
