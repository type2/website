I have a stock vacuum advance distributor model #231-168-005. I threw away
the box for the Pertronix but the number on the module itself is 02X-V4. I
bought it from an import parts store and it was for a stock dizzy. Since the
dwell reading is within spec do I really have anything to worry about?

Thanks
Jasan C.
