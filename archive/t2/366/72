Paul,

Wouldn't it be convenient that my Ignitor 1 came today and the
instructions are right in front of me!

The black wire goes to the negative side of the coil.  The red wire goes
to the positive side of the coil.  Except! if you have a resistor on the
positive side (do any 12 VW's use a resistor?), then the red wire goes
on the feed side of the resistor (the side fed from the ignition switch
and opposite side of the resistor from the coil.

The blue coil should be correct if you have a Ignitor 1 (the original). 
It needs to be at least 3 ohm, measured from the positive side to
negative side.

Also check to see what part number you have.  
	Ignitor 1 for vacuum advance or SVDA or DVDA : 1847V
	Ignitor 1 for mechanical advance (009 or 050): 1847A
	Ignitor II for mechanical advance (009 or 050): 91847A

Note: the Ignitor II (self adjusting dwell amongst other features) will
most likely not ever be available for the vacuum advance dizzies as
Pertronix isn't able to make it in a package small enough to fit inside
the dizzy.  This is right out of the "horses mouth" from a phone
conversation with the people the factory.

I haven't got quick access to a list (can find it at the Pertronix site)
but the markings on my 1847V are:
	Outside with "Ignitor by Pertronix" lable: CARB E. O. D-57 2
	Inside: 15X-V4


Hope this helps,

I found a unit in a box of stuff that came with some carbs i bought for my '75 bmw 2002.  It fits the bosch breaker plate and says 24P-S on the module.  Although I thought all vw's used the 1847 series? Paul.
