I wouldn't tee the return line into the vent line unless you isolate
one of the vent fittings and use it exclusively for return.

Another idea is to make a custom outlet fitting with two tubes instead of
one.  Make one tube "L" shaped to put the return near the bottom of the
tank but about 10cm from the outlet.
