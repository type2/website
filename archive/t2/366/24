I see Fluke 73 models go for $50 on eBaaay. Doubt if they would be priced 
that low in any pawn shop as list is over $200 new. Other quality 
instrument names are Beckman and Tektronics. Snap On and Mac contract these 
manufactures for their instruments as well. KD Tools in their Professional 
series has good instruments.

Any FLAPS will have several to choose from.

>grease gun

Any FLAPS or garage sale. Don't go for the Chinese at $7.95. Get a Lincoln 
or other USA made item for $12.95.
