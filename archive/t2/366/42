That damn wheel LOOKS JUST LIKE a replacement Mercedes wheel for a 90's 
Mercedes - maybe one of mid-size cars. I have a coworker here in TN that 
has this very set of wheels on her factory original Mercedes 4 door sedan. 
(Oh - they tell you that later in the article!) Oops!

The Tire Rack and Discount Tires websites offer these wheels at a great 
discount as does many other places. Wish I was richer so I could buy a set 
to tell the list about.

And yes I am following the list discussion closely about load ranges and 
such. This is a very important topic. Several FLATS have misadvised me on 
which tires to buy for my cars over the years - our bus included. I prefer 
to educate myself properly (with your help) and make my (our) own decision.

May the discussions continue!!! THANK YOU!
