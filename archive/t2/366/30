Subject: Re: [T2] re help adjusting the hydraulic valves-BostonBob's

All this talk about adjusting hyd valves is getting me worried.
I have one of those engines and my compression is good
and equal to each cylinder.  It seems to run good.
should i worry or not fix it if it ain't broke?
thanks

Too many turns is dangerous (first symptom - low compression or burned valve)
Too few turns is safe (first symptom - valvetrain noise)
