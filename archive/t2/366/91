Absolutely the same wheel.

I've got another question - where the steel wheels are concerned - somebody 
mentioned that they were stock Bus wheels welded to a new 15" rim. I know 
this is possible but if that were true then wouldn't a stock hubcap fit 
just dandy??? (Somebody else mentioned the stock hubcap wouldn't fit).

The stock transporter hubcap uses the center of the wheel for grip, not the 
outside edges like a full covering hubcap (aka the plastic covers found at 
K-mart and Wal-mart).

I'm a "deal-hunter" not picking on GoWesty - as long as they aren't taking 
advantage of us.
