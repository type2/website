Ben,

Get the tank...it will be easier and better.  Can't imagine the t working 
well at all.

Only thing on going to FI would be that you will want the front top engine 
cover plate as it already has a hole in the right place for the pressure
regulator return.

Do you have a cutout where the ecu connects to the wiring harness and 
hides behind a panel?

1.7 heads may have different valve sizes than the 2.0l heads that were 
designed for FI.

Probably a few other gotchas, bu probably not too bad.

Cheers and good luck, dave
