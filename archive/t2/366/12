Subject: avp longblock..heat tabs

One of the listees pointed out that in the pics of this engine

#4 near the left plug hole
#5 same, but 1/2 cyl side
#11 next to the "S1 12" lettering

There are "heat tabs" that turn black in the middle if a certain
heat is exceeded.

This site says 260 degrees   
http://www.brocksupply.com/html/products/Heattabs.htm

I wonder what they are really set for?...  260 seems a little
low for t4 heads.

Cheers, dave
