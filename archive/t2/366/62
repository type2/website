Quick guess: the PO had the thing way advanced at idle so that it sort-of
compensated for the dizzy not advancing.  Hence, when you timed it correctly
at idle, your driving performance sucked.  Solution: get a functional dizzy
and all should be well.  I've had a similar situation, and a new dizzy cured
it perfectly.  Good luck, and happy wrenching!
