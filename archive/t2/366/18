What??  There will be no slapping going on if there is zero preload.  My take on it is as follows:

Too many turns is dangerous (first symptom - low compression or burned valve)
Too few turns is safe (first symptom - valvetrain noise)

I keep mine turned in about 1/2 turn because I want to be on the SAFE side.
