Well Dave & George, it's nearly impossible to get a 2.0L tank here 
(Montreal), i will have to deal with mine! I've search before!
Unless there is a giver on the list? (but my tank is in real good shape)

I don't care about fitting everything (ECU, AFM/air filter housing...) 
in the Bus, I have an "MIG" welder and i will have a donnor for the 
holder/bracket. I did some miracle saving my heater box so i guess i can 
do other dificult welding and modification.

The question is: if only 1 vetilation tube is enough if i use the other 
one only for the return FI line? (my tank is full of fuel now, that is 
somewhat a small problem!!!!

I could also remove the fuel sender and make a hole in/beside this 
one???? the PO did cut the metal (body) to replace the sender so i have 
a lots of place to work from the top!!!! (Sadly)

I need to know if someone tried that before!

Thanks guys!
Ben
