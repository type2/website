Tor said: (regarding allen bit for tranny oil change)


I, being cheap/poor, and finding that my local FLAPS wanted like $20 for
this allen bit, just bought a bolt with a 17mm head and grabbed it with
Vice-Grips.  $.93 later, I had my tranny tool.  Enjoy!


I use a 17MM allen wrenc and use a 2' piece of pipe as a cheater. the pipe
is something like 1/2" ...I forget, I took the wrench to the hardware store
annd got 2' of whatever fit over the wrench. It works for me.

BTW:
Any one know where the cheapest place to get the following tools in the
Portland Oregon Area (I gave my set away with the last bus, as I was never
ever goig to own another VW....)

tach/dwell meter (shucks had one...for $50!!!!)
timing gun
grease gun
