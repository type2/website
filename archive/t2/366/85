Subject: curious, what is it?

On the dash of my 80 Vanagon Campmobile there is a bezel about one inch 
to the left of the heater and ventilation controls and about an inch and 
1/4 above the aux. heater temp/timer control knob. It looks like there 
is a copper or brass fitting in the hole in the middle that could hold a 
very small light bulb but there is no lens over the hole. The bezel is 
polished aluminum or a similar metal about 5/8 in diameter o.d.. the 
hole in the middle is approx. 1/2 inch dia. My first impression led me 
to think there should have been a control knob of some sort sticking out 
the middle of the bezel until i looked closer and saw the copper fitting 
in the hole. I looked under the dash to check out any wiring connected 
to it thinking I might identify it by wire color coding but there is too 
much in the way, and there is not as much room to get your head back 
there as my 75 bay bus. Any one have a clue?
All the accessories I know of on this vanagon are working . I have 
looked at every page in the original owners manual and the campmobile 
supplement I found in the cabinet and have found nothing to give me a 
clue. Maybe it's something the P.O. installed but it looks too factory 
for his skill level as indicated by other mods he did.
Thanks,
Tom

Summers coming I gotta get the turtlebus or this vanagon running soon!
