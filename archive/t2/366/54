Subject: poptop doesn't latch down tightly? 

Anyone else have this issue?

Mine just doesn't seal right on the passenger side. It kinda sticks up a 
little bit. You can push hard down on it to make it seal right, or pull on 
the handle downward to seal it tight, but it doesnt stay. I removed the 
matress completely and it does the same thing. Something is off, but what 
can be adjusted to correct it?

I know on a 74 westy I saw once, they had these two straps along the inside 
that pulled it down even tighter, but I shouldn't have to do that if it was 
setup correctly. Is there something with the rear hinges that I can adjust 
to allign it correctly again?

Maybe the whole poptop is angled towards the drivers side, so it never pulls 
down tight on the passenger side, but how can I correct it if it's that? 
Maybe just get a friend and pull it really hard over to the passenger side? 
ha! I can just see it breaking somewhere if I tried that.
