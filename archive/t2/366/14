Subject: Accelerator cable part #

Hi I found a new accelerator cable with part #430 991 w germany on it 
in my 71 bus while cleaning it out.  I've measured it to be 3676.65 mm, 
which is 3.35 mm shorter than the replacement one listed in catalogs at 
3680.   I need to put this in, just curious if anyone knows if it is 
the part I need.  Google search didn't reveal much for me.

Thanks,
Don
