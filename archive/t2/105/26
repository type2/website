Thanks to all, I'm now in the know.

Well I do admit I think Dolan paid quite a bit more in DC to have
his '67 tank boiled out.  So are the advantages of living in BFN
west by god virginia.  I haven't had one done in two years either
but $70-$90 was the going rate to boil out and coat at that time,
depending on size and who you had do it, there are about 4 shops
around me the one I went with for $90 I had had good luck with
before so I went with them again.  Sometimes big cities are actually
cheaper though, all depends, call around.
