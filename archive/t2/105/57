Subject: Re: [T2] front glass seal

I think the seam is mostly just to help you get it centered. It there is a
top or bottom I didn't know it.   :)

I found that taping the seal once you got it started helped keep it in
place. Then just pull your string through the tape as you go. The tape
pulled out easily after the window was installed. Here are some pics:

Good luck!
