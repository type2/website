Subject: In need of 74 Westy camper parts

Great and Powerful list,

I am missing a few parts off of the range/fridge unit in my '74. These
being.....

A) The lid that folds down over the range
B) The black pot risers that sit over the burners and
C) The drawer that slides in under the range

If anyone has these lying about and would like to part with them I would
much appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.....Dana

PS....(I believe that the 74 and 75 had the same Westy interior)
