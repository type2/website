Subject: Re: [T2] 78' Westy Stool Wanted


My '79 has the stool, it is just a wooden box with a fabric-covered hinged
lid.  You could use it for a trash can, I do.  Also helps getting into the
pop-top.

The two plastic buckles are the tie-downs for the stool so that it is
secured while driving.  See the '78 camper manual I have up at
