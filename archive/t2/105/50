I have the same carb with the same problem--do you
have a type 4 or a 1600?

If its a type 4:
I recently installed a haltech oxygen sensor and the mixture is often pegged 
on the maximum richness.  Once I get my gas tank cleaned out
I WILL figure this problem out with the help of my exhaust analyzer.
Calimports up here sells a complete jet kit for this carb, although they
are now out of stock and the price seems a little on the high side
They advertise a DFEV "jetted for type 4"..one might ask them
what this means.  Busdepot may know as well.
Will let you know what jet combo works for me
