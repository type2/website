WOW!

Even an old dog can learn new tricks.  Now I am looking forward to doing
my 78 instead of dreading it.  I'm sure gonna have to read the manual
first as I've never seen this one done!

I've got all my parts ready for this job also, but have been putting it
off as a possible pita.

Now I am stoked to get it done since I got the windshield back in last
night.

Cheers(and thanks!), dave
