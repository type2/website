Hi all,

     I am going to look at a 71 camper tonight.  I am not sure if it is =
westy or not.  It is not a poptop.  It supposedly has a new Mexican =
longblock installed.  Anyone have recent experience with the new =
engines?  Since most of my buses have been type 4 engines this will be a =
little of a re-education for me.  I am not sure if I want a non-poptop =
but the price my be in my ballpark.
