Kelly,

Not to hurt your feelings or somethin like that--but 90% of all late
mdel automobies are glued together-----Geez--I bet you didn't know
that----

I been using the 3-M body panel adhesive on the reconstruction of Mack
Truck body panels for at least 12 years now, ( or since I discovered the
body panel adhesive, been doing semis for 22 years ) with zero
failure----
Now if you talking about rivited rats--that's another story--they never
had any welds from the get go-----( Peterbuilt, Kenworth, etc)
So why in the heck woud one want to be gluing a rivited truck in the
first place?

The rivits are an integral part of the vehicles monocoque construction
parameter's

Nuts----

Later,


Terry

Tech and Tips 
And i quote<<<<Did you know----- 
That 3-M has a body panel adhesive that is as strong, if not stronger
than a weld, and the compound displaces moisture in the area that has
been repaired? 
Easy to use, no warpage, no burn through on the surrounding panel, ad no
welding equipment or skills required---- 
Wam, Bam, thak you Mam----->>>>>> 
Sheezz i'm expecting a its only $19.95!!!!!! I have found nothing that
damn easy, A large company we used to work for has tried all types of
adhesives to hold the skins on thier cargo vans instead of brad rivets,
guess what their using rivets again, and yes 3m was in on thier project
and it failed miserably. If it ain't steel it ain't real. I mean geez
fiberglass was to be the savior of auto body, as also was the
introduction of the rubber plastic bumper crap....too each his own .
I'll take steel in my rides thank you. Thats my .02 cents worth.
