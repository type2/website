longblock installed.  Anyone have recent experience with the new engines?
Since most of my buses have been type 4 engines this will be a little of
a re-education for me.  I am not sure if I want a non-poptop but the
price my be in my ballpark.

I'm happy with my Mexiengine, but the installation is the important thing.
All the usual about having all the tin and seals present and in place.
Did they replace the stud where the dual=port manifold bolts to the case,
or just leave the nut off?  Did they bother putting the thermostat on?
Where did they get the engine?  I hear tell that there are various sources
for Mexican engines.  I got mine from Ronnie, so no worries, but GEX was
also selling 'em!
