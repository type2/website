Subject: Ball joint replacement

Hi all,

I appear to have a bad ball joint, so it looks like it will have to be 
replaced.  I've heard its a burly job...I have a machinist who can press the 
old ones out and new ones in.  Any advice about how to approach this job?  
Should I be aware of any "tricks"?  Any info would be helpful.
