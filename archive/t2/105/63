Subject: Parts and 58 SC For Sale

I've got a few things I'm never going to use for sale in Colorado Springs, CO.  
Shipping is possible on any of the items - buyer pays actual shipping cost.  
Here's what I've got:

4-sp tranny from my 73 Westy (removed for 5sp conversion).  About 170k miles.  
Perfectly good, usable tranny.  $125

Rear tranny mount for above.  $10

Gas tank (non-FI) from my 73 Westy.  Very clean, no rust, ready to use.  $20 
(shipping may make this not worth the money).

Gas tank sending unit from above - good, but not perfect.  $5

Starter from my 73 Westy (doesn't fit my 5sp tranny).  Bosch reman.  Works 
perfect.  Approx 4 years use on it, very easy starting with minimal draw.  $15

Aux. heater blower motor from my 73 Westy.  Works fine.  $15

Eberspacher BN-4 heater.  12v unit.  Early model (from 71 Westy I was told).  
NO ducting or cables - only the main unit itself with the pump and all the 
stuff that is attached to the top.  No rust, looks like a nice unit, but 
working condition completely unknown.  I paid $70 for it on eBay last year and 
am not going to use it.  Buy at your own risk.  $50?

58 Single Cab.  European model (nice working semaphores included, but not 
hooked up due to 12v conversion), 5 new Goodyear LT tires on 15" bus rims, 66 
tranny rebuilt box-to-box by excellent VW tranny mechanic, completely rebuilt 
1776 dual port motor (from 74 bug) with dual Weber 40 carbs (this is not your 
grandfather's VW!), full flow oil filtration, decent gates, all latches 
(including engine and treasure chest) good, includes mph and kph speedos, cab 
painted but rest of truck in old primer, rust in rear corners and some in 
belly, uncut dash with radio block-off plate, good solid, dependable, drivable 
truck.  $3750 OBO.  I don't have any pictures yet, but am working on it.  If 
you're at all interested, let me know.

All prices subject to negotiation.  If you want any of this stuff, talk to me 
and we can work it out.  If it doesn't sell here, it'll go on eBay next week.
