Subject: Brakes!!  Pad, Shoes, Wheel Cylinders

Hey Everybody,

The bus runs great, has plenty of power.  After
troubleshooting and fixing FI, I am now a believer in
it's superiority over carbs.  I also got a reman
alternator from a local rebuilder - $57 w/ a
warranty!!

Anyways,  The rear right wheel cylinder leaks pretty
bad, a quart in a week and a half.  I am going to
replace it tonight.  Since I see brake fluid on the
front of the wheel and tire (facing out) I am sure
that the shoes are ruined too.  Here is my question,
while I have done rears and cylinders on my other cars
(brat, F.O.R.D. etc) I have never done it on the 78
Bus.  Any secrets, or straight forward?  Bleeding
secrets?  Oh Yeah, gonna replace front pads while I am
at it too. (sat for 6 years)  Secrets for that?
Anything to look out for?

Thanks everybody for all the great advice.

Kindest Regards,

Mark
