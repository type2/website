Sean,

Sorry to post at the last minute in your decision making process.  Last =
year I put 4 Cooper SRM II tires on my bus.  Load rating D, (1845 lb =
load), 8-ply, etc.  185 14 size.  I'm happy with them, but they're =
definitely highway tread tires.  I have not had any problems, but also =
haven't put that many miles on them (maybe 3000).  I did notice a =
tremendous improvement over the too small passenger tires I was using.  =
Nice stiff sidewalls and tall enough.  I think I paid about $75 each, =
just over $320 for mounted/balanced, etc. (but no sales tax here in =
MT...gotta love that - so remembe to add your state's X.X%).  I'd say =
give 'em a look, the load rating and price are right.

If $$$ was no object, I'd probably put the Agilis on my bus, but I =
couldn't justify an extra $30 per tire.

Good luck,

Markus Bahnemann
