The sliders that GoWesty sells are the right ones. They work good in my
camper with my new curtains. I actually sewed the sliders to my curtain.
Just kind of space them out so it works good.

I have to say though if you go camping a lot I would consider retrofitting a
curtain rod directly on the sliding door. It isn't as easy to pull those
little sliders. There are some pics of my sliding door curtain at the bottom
of this page:

Good luck!
