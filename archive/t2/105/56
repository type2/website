Subject: front glass seal

Folks,

Does the seam on new front glass rubber go on the top or bottom of the
window?

My old seal was so bad, I couldn't tell.
BTW, this looks to be a serious job to just get the rubber on the window.
I've got it "stretching" right now as it was just incredibly hard to get
on the glass.  I've done bug front windows, no problem, but this one
requires some *serious* effort!


Cheers, dave
