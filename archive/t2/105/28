Subject: cheap 21" + up jacks

Hello,

A while back someone said the best at home bus jack you could get would
probably be the special SUV one that WalMart apparently sold some time back.
Long story short, I got one, and love it, and just saw them on sale at Sears
for $49.95.

That is a prety sweet deal, I think I paid at least $60 for mine. It is an
especially nice jack as you can get the bus off of the ground in little to
no time flat, and raise it high enough besides. (most jacks top out around
18")

fwiw

Christopher

PS. I am in san frandisco, they may not be on sale or in stock everywhere.
If you love nearby and want me to pick one up for you, to pick up from me at
a later date, you can paypal me the green and ill grab one for ya.
