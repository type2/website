 dont know what I did or bus did itself coincidentally but my 68 / =
1600SP
/ 30pict1 / 009 (shhh) has decided to stop all decent acceleraqting and
has no low end power and no top end.
It ran fine last week.


     Sounds like a vacuum leak to me. Had this prob with a loose =
manifold stud . It was slow to accelerate, then would catch up. A =
retorque of the intake manifold stud nuts fixed it.
