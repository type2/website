Subject: Breather Box Install

I'm in the process of installing a breather box on my T1 bay w/KDogs,
009, j-tubes and a Bugpack extractor/dual QP's. I've vented a set of
aluminum valve covers, and the box itself is prepped & ready. Now, where
do I mount it? I've seen sedans mount them on the firewall, but I don't
really have that option. I'm leaning towards mounting it on the uppermost
part of the fan shroud.
Any suggestions?

L8,
