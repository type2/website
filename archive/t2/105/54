Subject: Selling one of my Westfalias (82 Diesel)

This 1982 (browny van) has 94.5 K original miles.  It
has been garaged or under cover most of its life.  A
great sounding diesel with a custom sub-woofer stereo.
 It gets the EPA 29/29 mpg on the flat or in local
driving.  I'm in Northern Virginia.  $6900.
