Volks:

I finally got a web page up with pictures of my 71 Westy that is for
sale. I'm in Jackson, Mississippi.

http://www2.nexband.com/~firefly1/71Westy.html

I'm asking $2750, but I'll negotiate with a list member.

Particulars:

71 Westfalia
~103,000 miles
Rebuilt 1600DP 
New Case, Heads, Crank, and Rods
Full Flow Oil Filter
CIS Fuel Injection
BN4
MINIMAL Rust.  Just under the windshield and in the rockers in the
middle of the bus.  Wheel wells, etc. are solid.
Load D tires with about 4000 miles on them.
Lots of Extras.
Excellent interior.
New Pop Top Canvas.

Great bus.  Just needs some minor body work and a paint job.

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks
