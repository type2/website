John gets it in one! This one has a vernier scale etched in as well!

yeah, I guess...  but that is the old slide rule/calculator thing.  I have
a calculator!  I see no virtue in doing it the hard way if I don't have
to.  At this point, I have one of each, a plastic vernier, a dial and the
electronic.  Plastic vernier is for junkyarding... are those pistons 83.5
or 85?  slap the cheap plastic mic on it!  If I lose it or break it, I am
out a whole $4.95! The electronic is for the shop, the dial is for backup.

One additional benefit to this mic is that it comes with a  button marked
"mm/in"  Push the button and you are in metric, push it again and you are
in the arcane Ugandan/US system (I should be fair to Uganda, tho...  I
think they are changing over)
