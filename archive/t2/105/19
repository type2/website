- I don't think it is as strong as a weld or 3M wouldn't recommend it for
non-structural uses only. You simply cannot butt weld with it.
- Maybe no welding skills are required but a whole different set of skills
is.
- With real welding you don't need several hours for your "weld" to set up.
You can tack something and in a few seconds it is as strong as it's ever
going to be.
- The material cost involved in a real welded repair is still cheaper. This
is particularly true for an amateur or hobbyist.

I'm sure body panel adhesive has it uses but it doesn't replace welding.
