Greetings, all!

We've had the Cooper SRMII's on our 76 Hightop (aftermarket) Westy for two
trips from Wisconsin to Yellowstone and back. The stability seems to be
good, and the ride is not harsh. We haven't gone off road, but in the wet
dirt/clay roads of the Black Hills they handled well (while making a mess of
the bus!). The stable ride is especially noticable descending the mountain
passes, including Powder River/Tensleep in the Bighorns in thick fog and
rain and Dead Indian north of Yellowstone in a June snow storm last year.

We don't put many miles on them other than camping, but they have about 6000
miles on them so far with no undue wear. I'd buy them again, based on my
experience with them so far. The price I paid was similar to that of Markus,
with the sales tax of Wisconsin added on.

YMMV,
