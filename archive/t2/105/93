Agreed on the pricing issues here. $110 each for seat belts???, not alloy
rims here we're talking about seatbelts!!    I have personally found
Go-Westy to be incredibly high. They want $170 for a  rear table for the
78' Westy, I paid $10, but I still need the leg. Pretty much everything I
have seen on their site is over priced. I suppose if you are in a hurry
they might be good. They don't have that 78' stool I'm looking for
either...

           Got mine at www.gowesty.com part# GVW-211-707 for 68-79 type II.
This =
           was a true bolt-in installation, with all necessary hardware
supplied. =
           Looks like NOS VW parts (mine is dated 1985) that have been
modified
=
           with correct spacers, etc. The salesman said that they do a lot
of =
           replacement belts for Porsches, which is another part of their
business. =
           Everything looks more than strong enough, and it only took 10
minutes to =
           install. At $110., it's not cheap.

According to the site that $110 EACH.  That's more than I paid for my Bus!
(Of course I've put a few more clams into getting it roadworthy.)  I got
seat belts for all 7 passengers at my Pick-n-Pull for less than $100.  And,
if you're worried about the strength of those old belts you can go down to
your local upholstery guy and get new straps sewn up onto your hardware and
still not pay $110 each.
