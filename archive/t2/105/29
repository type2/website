And i quote<<<<Did you know-----

That 3-M has a body panel adhesive that is as strong, if not stronger
than a weld, and the compound displaces moisture in the area that has
been repaired?

Easy to use, no warpage, no burn through on the surrounding panel, ad no
welding equipment or skills required----

Wam, Bam, thak you Mam----->>>>>>

Sheezz  i'm expecting  a its only $19.95!!!!!!
I have found nothing  that damn easy, A large company we used to work for
has tried all types of adhesives to hold the skins on thier  cargo vans
instead of brad rivets, guess what their using rivets again, and yes 3m was
in on thier project and it failed miserably. If it ain't steel it ain't
real. I mean geez fiberglass was to be the savior of auto body, as also was
the introduction of the rubber plastic bumper crap....too each his own .
I'll take steel in my rides thank you. Thats my .02 cents worth.
