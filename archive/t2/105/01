Billy,

Go look on the por-15 site or just give them a call.  I *think* I remember
that both are relative benign to the environment.  i live in the country
and end up drinking what goes in the ground....makes you think twice about
what you do with dangerous/toxic stuff out of your cars.

I think the insulation is fiberglass with an "aluminum" cover.

I don't remember what year your bus was, but i decided *not* to seal mine
because I couldn't figure out how the "bowl" around my fi inlet and
outlet pipes would get covered correctly....

If it's been xx years and still looks good inside then why seal?.....


Cheers, dave
