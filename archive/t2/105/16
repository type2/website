i purchased the Y356 in C load range less than a year ago from
http://www.tirerack.com.  the price was $50 each.  the D load range was
about $8 more per tire IIRC.

keep in mind this is a highway tire. not designed for mud + snow.

the Michelin tires i have had on other vehicles have always held up great &
performed nicely, but $40 extra per tire is alot of dough!

HTH.
