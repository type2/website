Subject: 0-|--<|: Thanks guys...

Hey I just want to say thanks to everybody on helping me out with info on 
bodywork...that Metwiz site really helped and all of your letters were very 
informative, I can't wait to get to work on my baby...

...which, by the way, my girlfriend calls Jezebel.

thanks again everybody and I'll try to get some pics in for my own record 
and for those who are interested.

Later all,

-Aaron
