Subject: Re:Curtain over sliding door 

Matt, and Listees,
    A little less than a year ago I made new curtains for our '71, so I can
tell you how I addressed these issues.
1.  "How on earth do I use the pre-existing track over the sliding
door?".....
       That track should have small plastic sliders in it.  I don't know if
it is the ones sold by GoWesty or not.  I put small grommets in the top of
the curtain, one grommet for each slider.  I put a grommet at each end and
then equally spaced out the rest.  You can get theses small grommets and the
pliers to set them at fabric shops.  Then I used a piece of string to tie
the curtain through the grommet to the slider.
2    "Does the Cab curtain need elastic on the top of the curtain to keep
       it from sagging? And are there only 4 snaps (A & B pillars) or should
there
       be one under the rearview mirror?".......
The stock set up is 4 snaps like you mentioned and the curtain had a draw
string in the top of it to take up any slack.   When I made our new curtains
I used 2 additional snaps, one behind each end of the rearview mirror,
instead of the draw string.  That works good to hold up the middle of that
front curtain and maintain privacy.
    For me the hardest part of the curtain project was deciding on what
material to use.  The possibilites are endless, ranging from wild to mild.
