Dave and Karl,

I just got back from 3 weeks of vacation and went out and had a look
at my bus.  I went out tonight and verified the relationship to #1 at
TDC by turning the engine over, watching the valves, and with a
pencil down the spark plug hole noting the position of the piston.

The good news is that it looks like my distributor is lined up
correctly.

The bad news is that I think my cam timing is off.

When I turn the crank in the direction of firing (clockwise) and
watch the valves open and close on the #3 valve, the exhaust closes
and the intakes starts to open about 90deg BTDC.  As such, when the
crank is at TDC #1, the intake valve on #3 is just hitting fully open
and starts to close as I pass TDC.

I'm not sure HOW I could have mis-aligned the cam and the crank - i
mean, the 2 dots, one dot thing is fairly straightforward - but I
guess I must have?

Or am I missing something?

Not looking forward to splitting the case, but if it's what I have to
do...


Any thoughts?

THANKS,
      Tom
