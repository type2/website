Subject: CV joints: Country of Origin?

Anyone know the Country of Origin of the ball joints that come in the Bus 
Boy rebuilt arms? On the bottom they have a small triangle and below this 
the number 216.

The rubber boot is held in place at the top by a blue spring wire clip and 
at the bottom by a green spring wire clip.
