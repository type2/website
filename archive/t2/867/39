Subject: Idiot lights and other assorted questions

75 riviera (type II)   Somewhat of a performance engine as the PO put 110
porsche pistons in, 77 2 ltr bosch EFI, mark stephens phase 1 heads etc.

When its cold in the morning and I turn the key to the first position,
both lights come on(oil press and battery) as they should.   However if I
have driven to the store or some other destination where I will be
returning from shortly, the oil pressure light does not come on when I
turn to the first position.  It turns on for a split second when I am
starting the engine but thats it.  Is this something I should be alarmed
by?

Also she idles rough and often almost dies before she gets warmed up.  Is
this normal or does it mean that her engine needs a little tune up?

I am new to Type2 ownership and love my bus.  Getting her back on the road
after having her sit for four months was a great feeling (new alternator
and VR)

and lastly, I noticed some front left bearing noise last night and this
morning using the muir book (best 25 bucks I ever spent) tighened the
bearing up a little(solved the problem right away).  Couple questions on
that.  there was rusty grease in there...I know thats not good, but how
bad is it?  The PO left alot of parts (full set of plugs, two new
distributor caps, a distributor rotor, new (used) EFI computer, etc)  To
my pleasure two inner bearing seals and a new set of inner and outer
bearings for the front wheels.  So I have most of the parts to DIY but
after tightening them I am not sure I need to(aside from the rust thing). 
Should I greasgun the bearings and see what the grease coming out looks
like? or should I not chance it and just replace them ASAP?

Thanks in advance....I love you guys!
