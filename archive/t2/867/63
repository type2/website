Subject: 78 Bay Max Tow Weight

After the recent Every "wet" Bus event ( not complaining cause I
loved it ), I've decided to get rid of the tent and get a sleepable
trailer.

So, Im trying to find the max tow and tongue weight that I can haul
with my 78 Bay.  Some specs on the bus:

 1978 7 pass transporter (not westy)
 2" receiver
 2 liter EFI with 4500 miles
 mostly stock

Im looking at the obvious Scamp, Casitas and Burros but I'd like
something with a toilet and some kind of shower.  It doesnt have to
be big cause its just for me and my daughter and we cook and "live"
in the screen room anyway.

Thanks in advance,

Dave.
