Subject: Interesting brake pedal question.

My 70 bug brakes (I own 2 bugs as well as my Westy) work fine, all redone with
new hoses etc., except for one thing. I did not replace the master cylinder.
Now when I use them, the car will have brake drag unless I reach down with my
foot and lift the brake pedal up the last 1". Then there is no drag. The pedal
does not appear to be returning that last 1" of travel to the top. If I do it
manually, it will work fine. I would appreciate any clues on this? Is there a
return spring in the MC that is tired and needs to be replaced? This is what
it seems like.
Thanks for any help on this, it's weird. The brakes work great other than my
"built in" hill holder. :-)
