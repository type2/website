Essentially, "they" are using a fake address to phish
for anything...Your Paypal account #, Social Security

Same reason when I buy something and the clerk asks
for my tel. #, I tell 'im 555-1212... (Unless they offer
20% off if I give 'em my #... ;-)

  hey tony is this why when you buy something at advance auto parts they always ask for your tele number? etc etc.....
  i always thought that was ridiculous... and it never seems to stay in there pc....
  buy a fuel filter and give them name address telephone number, date of marriage,race,sex, etc etc... 
  i quit giving them my number cause it seems i started getting odd sales phone calls....
  even though the clerk told me we WONT GiVE OUT YOUR INFO ITS FOR OUR PERSONAL records only./.. yeah BS is what it is..
   
  so for now on i give them any phone number but my own and even give them a fake name....
  see no sense them having all that info for there personal reasons when all i bought was a fuel filter to begin with LOL...
   
  phish N ... wooosh that used to be something that you did by the lake....or river or pond...... or just favorite watering hole... now its something associated with wrong doing.... what is the world coming to...
   
  nothing like loading up the bus with tackle and rods and heading out to do some phish N
