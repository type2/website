Subject: engine wiring harness wanted

the engine wiring harness has so many splices in it
from whomever worked on it in the past it is a
nightmare, anyone have one for a 1977 2.0 FI? Maybe
this is why my van stalls once in a blue moon, maybe
not, but I just want to make it stock looking, so its
easier to work on, and will look alot cleaner in
there.
