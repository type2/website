  hello, again,

took goethe the two tone bullet on a four hour round trip drive this
weekend. i have for some time heard a gentle knocking sound coming from the
front end. thought it was perhaps the swing lever shaft. replaced it. it
was not the swing lever shaft. i still have the sound and it seems to get
faster and slower proportionate to the tire rotation. when i put my ever so
sensitive hand on the e-brake lever i can feel the knocking. now, i have
crawled under the beautiful body of this 1977 kombi and i can see no
markings that would indicate parts knocking together. i have pulled metal
cover that shields the brake, accelerator linkage and e-brake assembly.
nothing rubbing or knocking that i can see. i am at a loss. any ideas?
any prophetic visions? any almost educated guesses?

TIA,


jeremiah
