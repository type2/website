Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap door seals from CIP

<<My old seals were shot so these will be better no matter what. There
were a few possible ways to deal with the top corners. -stay on the
round part and glue 
-cut and bevel the top corners and stay at the edge (best I think)
-stretch and glue around the top corners (what i did)>>

There is no way I'd be cutting the new door seals.

I would however heat them up using a  heat gun to help them conform to
the radius of the corner's of the doors.
Then quickly glue them down.

Hacking up new rubber seals to fit is not a good idea at all.

They'll be leaker's in no time.
