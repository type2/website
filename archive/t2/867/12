Hmmm, don't know if it's related, but my Norinco SKS rifle has a triangle 
with the no. 56 inside of it. That means factory 56 in China apparently.
Don't know if that helps or confuses??

 Anyone know the Country of Origin of the ball joints that come in the Bus
Boy rebuilt arms? On the bottom they have a small triangle and below this
 the number 216.
