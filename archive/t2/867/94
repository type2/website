Mine takes no more than 10-15 seconds for the light to come on after
shutdown, and it's a pretty tight engine (new, not rebuilt, in 2002).  I'd
expect that it's a heat-related failure if the light still doesn't come on
after it's been sitting for many minutes.  Marginal electrical connections
tend to get worse when they're hot, so I think it's a bad connection to the
wire at the sender, or, failing that, a bad sender.

I could be wrong.  Your engine is not identical to mine.
