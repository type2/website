Dave, I've pulled our overloaded 13" Scamp with our '76 westy for 6 
years now.  The westy is yellow and the Scamp it white, so my 
daughter nicknamed the pair "Big Bird and the egg".  We have pulled 
the Scamp to Cali from KS and over the continental divide at least a 
half dozen times.  With the westy package, it's all my 2 liter wants 
to handle, but with a stock bus and maybe not adding all the 
"goodies" to the Scamp, you should do pretty well.

Some of the extra weight I have put on my Scamp include hanging a 
heavy steel Buskatiers firepit/BBQ  off the back, installing an AC 
unit, putting a 6 gallon RV water heater under a rear seat and 
modifying the floor and frame for a drop in shower pan.

If someone wanted to duplicate my efforts, I would suggest buying a 
light weight shower tent and a Zodi water heater.  By doing so, you 
will save many, many hours of fabricating and a few hundred dollars. 
I would still recommend the AC unit, you can't believe how nice it 
makes sleeping on hot humid nights.

A word of caution, before towing anything with your bus, put on a 
good hitch and beef up the rear bumper bracket mounting hole, it is 
just sheet metal and will not carry any hitch weight.
