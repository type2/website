Subject: Pesky heater cables.

I bought new cables, the long ones for my 77 Riviera.  I was hoping to 
get them installed today.  The installation looks easy, you pull the 
old cables out, and feed the new ones in.

  I disconnected everything in the back, fed the cables down under the 
front of the van, attached a pair of vice grips to the front end and 
pulled.  The cable housing stretched about three feet, but everything 
else stayed inside.

I tried pulling on the cable to the other side, it isn't budging.

So... what's the trick to get the old cables out.  I'm assuming when I 
get them out, I should oil the outside of the new cable housings to 
make them slide in easier.

But I have to get the old ones out first.

Thanks in advance for the tips!
