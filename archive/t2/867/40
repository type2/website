Jeff,

The 70 main jet is too rich. I had a progressive with 60 primary, 50 
2ndry on a 2l and it ran ok. I wonder if your unscrewing the idle jet 
screw is allowing some air in hence leaning out the mixture?

Cheers,

Martin

 >Hey All,
Can some one give me an idea of where I am as far as jetting on my
progressive carb? I have pretty major hesitation starting away from a stop.
Timing is good, 009 distributor, points are good. Idle is a bit rough but
that may be another story. Anyhoo, back to the jets. primary idle is a 70,
secondary is a 50. Once warmed up, power is good and lively (for a bus). Any
ideas or opinions??
Thanks,
Jeff
