Two years is hardly a long term test.  I hope that they are just as good
after 10 years.  Otherwise, you could have the GEX of CVs!

I agree about the boots.  German rubber has never impressed me with its
longevity.  I use nothing but Rockford (US made) boots now

True, but there is also an outpouring of poorly made products.  Seems that
there needs to be a non-Chinese company hovering over the quality control
to make sure that the Chinese factory maintains standards.

Even if a "name" manufacturer is buying product from a Chinese company it
doesn't mean that the company is maintaining quality on other products.
