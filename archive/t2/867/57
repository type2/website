Telephone numbers have become move valuable since the "Do not call" list
went into effect.  Once you conduct business with someone they are then
legally entitled to call you.  Otherwise they can't.  Having a "business
relationship" is a rather nebulous thing from the telemarketer's point of
view.  It could be argued that anyone with a "strategic relationship" with
the outfit that you did business with is entitled to call you.
