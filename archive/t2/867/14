Subject: timing a type 4

<sigh>
Ok, I thought heck!
I will do it myself this time.
1700 FI automatic tranny.
it's either 5 BTDC or 7.5 <I think>

So I hook up my timing light and everything seems to jump
all over. Set it to where I though was right then next thing I know
Pinging, tinging etc.. I pull over and redo it.

My idle is set at 950ish
Im looking at both the green book and the funny purple book.
The bus just doesn't seem to sit at any one place. I recheck it
and it's somewhere else.
I think right now it's at 950rpm, 5 degrees BTDC (thats on the plastic
curve thingee, number 5 to the right of the 0)

Anyone have some words of encouragement and easy techniques
for ensuring I don't burn out something?

James
