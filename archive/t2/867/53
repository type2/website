Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap door seals from CIP

They sound just like the ones I got from Bus Depot in the "complete 
front door seal kit" parts numbered 82000 and 82001. Although they fit 
great and the quality appears to be good, the lack of a molded corner 
leaves a gap that allows the wind to make a _lot_ of noise at the top 
front corner. I will have to replace these with the better quality seal 
later.

All the other rubber was great, vent wing, inner/outer scrapers.
