Oh, I click on those links every time I get one of those emails.   And 
feed it bogus, obscenity-laced information and garbage numbers.  Then I 
try and find the ISP or hosting company that the phishing site is being 
run on and report it to them.  Then I report it to Paypal.   And 
finally, for the ones that came directly to me and not across a 
listserv (like this one), I try and figure out how it snuck past my 
spam filter.

Being proactive makes it harder for the phishing lusers to run their 
scams.  It may not be much, but every little bit helps.  If *everyone* 
ignores those emails, nothing gets done to put a stop to it.
