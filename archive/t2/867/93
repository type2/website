Don,

I don't think Poncho Villa Gaucamole Mobile will save youa nickel in
transportation fee's..

With gas at 3 bucks plus a gallon, and not considering any mishaps on
the road, and the time it's gonna take to drive, you'd be better off
whipping out the plastic, and heading west with the whole Fan Damily via
the big silver bird.

You do have large gallune's ----that's for sure.

However you get there good luck--
