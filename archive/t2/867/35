Take it to a mechanic to have them check it out. The $75- $100 they may  
charge is nothing compared to what could happen if you don't. Whether it's a  1960 
or a 1999 year model if you are not familiar with the vehicles take  them to 
a VW shop to be checked out. It will be the best money you ever spend.  Have 
an oil pressure test done. A compression test done on all cylinders. Have  them 
check for coolant leaks. Make sure all the Westy items are checked out.  
(fridge, stove ect...) IF the guy will not let you take it to a VW shop or him  
have it taken to a shop of your choice you might just keep looking. Even if he  
has a VW shop a second opinion is always best. Good luck.
