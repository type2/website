Subject: oil temps

Hey, Greg and all just back from Everybus.  Missed you guys on the list.  
  
  Greg, what kind of oil temps did you see with that VDO (I think) guage  with the taco plate sender?  (Sorry I couldn't find your email  address.)  I got mine in today and the temps I'm seeing are  hellish.  85 or so degree weather and after a long run on the  freeway, I'm touching 300.  But back at home I hopped out and  checked the engine compartment  - quite cool.  And I did that  poor man's temp check - the oil is warm on the dipstick but doesn't  burn my hand.  So I'm thinking these guages are crap.  Next  up for me is a Dakota Digital head temp set up.  
  
  I am going to spend the next couple of days completely sealing up the  engine compartment.  Have to pull the battery and check out the  tray.  I know it's rusted because the battery doesn't set in there  straight.  Then lots of aluminum tape over rust holes.  And  new engine door seal.  I'll let you know if I see temps go down  but I'm not expecting much.  If they're that high I should have  warped the heads years ago.  
  
  Cheers....KR
