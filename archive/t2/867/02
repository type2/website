Subject: Buying tips? (vanagon)

So the issues with my 71 have led me to the conclusion that I need to
upgrade and buy a more family friendly vehicle, of a course a Vanagon
Westy.
I've begun looking around and there really isn't anything locally, (PA)
but I did find an 85 about 4 hours away.  I was calling mechanics from the
state that dealt with vanagons asking if they knew of any for sale.  So
this 85 sounds pretty straight and a followup call to the mechanic
confirmed this.  The mileage is 136k with a rebuild at 106k, I have yet to
see the van in person.  When I do I want to be prepared to do a thorough
inspection.  My problem is that I am not familiar with the water boxer at
all.  I've read the article on vanagon.com concerning coolant leakage. 
Aside from that what all should I check?  The owner states there is some
seam rust, but I can't really make it out on the pics he sent.  So the
questions;

1.  Should I do a compression check?  What is normal? (assume the stock 1.9)
2.  Any more detailed instructions to look for coolant issues?
3.  What are some rust prone areas that may not be evident on a quick
external exam?
4.  I wanna make a good informed decision and possible purchase, what else
should I know?

Again I thank all of you in advance for any repsonses.  I will post his to
the Vanagon list once they activate it...
