Hi Courtney,

    Sounds like the peddle assembly is starting to freeze up from junk in
it! Or the return spring may be broken, which is a little unusual.
    If the spring is ok, then check for trash in and around the peddle cross
bar, return spring, and stop plate. A lot of trash and junk seems to collect
there under your feet.
    Blow it out with air, vacuum that area good, and wash it down with a
rust removal lube ( a WD-40 type lube ) to free it up. Then in a few days
when the WD-40 is dry, lube it with some spray grease or light oil. Don't
flood it as this will collect more trash.
    Also some times the brake peddle to master cylinder push rod will freeze
at it's pivot, so make sure to lube that as well.
    Now the worst case scenario here is that the peddle cross shaft is
frozen internally. That would require removal of the peddle assemble and
disassemble to free up. If the external lube trick doesn't help, let me know
and I'll walk you through the peddle assemble removal and dissemble.
    It's a good idea to clean your feet as best you can before entering the
car, especially on rainy days, to help prevent this.

Regards,

Howard
