Subject: So I asked my bus today...

"Do you feel like driving to California tomorrow?"

I think he grinned. lol

My grandmother died last night, so as soon as I find out when the service
will be (and I get the $$), I'm leaving for California. What is really
frustrating is I already have a flight booked this coming Sunday for a trip
out there for work. But I can't afford to buy tickets for the whole family.

So this is gonna be the warm up trip for the Guac in preparation for the
Arctic Circle trip in 07. =)
