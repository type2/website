Subject: Re: [T2] Front Sway Bar Mounting Kits

Well, I found out the clamps I had REALLY wouldn't work, as they were for a pre-68 Bus.

So now I have the correct kits, and I can see the issues that others have talked about (arched
shape, etc.).  Now my question is: has anyone had luck with them?  I was able to get one on the
driver's side (after much frustration, two c-clamps, and a four pound sledge), but all I've been
able to do on the passenger side is bend the heck out of the clamp.  I don't see how it will fit
as the closest I can get the ends to touching is about 1/4", which won't work with the tabs.

If the purpose of the clamp is just to hold the sway bar to the torsion arm, can any kind of clamp
work?  I was thinking about getting some hose clamps for the time being until I can find another
clamp or beat this one into submission.
