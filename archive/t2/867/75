This is kind of what I was thinking the "problem" is.  I would think the
system shouldn't lose pressure that quickly but I figured I would ask the
experts since the light does seem to work just fine and comes on in the
first position if shes been sitting a while.

Anyone know how quickly the oil system should depressurize?
