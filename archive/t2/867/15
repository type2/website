Subject: Re: [T2] timing a type 4

From James Jackson:

 <sigh>
 Ok, I thought heck!
 I will do it myself this time.
 1700 FI automatic tranny.
 it's either 5 BTDC or 7.5 <I think>

 So I hook up my timing light and everything seems to jump
all over. Set it to where I though was right then next thing I know
pinging, tinging etc.. I pull over and redo it.

 My idle is set at 950ish
Im looking at both the green book and the funny purple book.
The bus just doesn't seem to sit at any one place. I recheck it
and it's somewhere else.
I think right now it's at 950rpm, 5 degrees BTDC (thats on the plastic
curve thingee, number 5 to the right of the 0)

 Anyone have some words of encouragement and easy techniques
for ensuring I don't burn out something?

To the right of 0 [zero] is AFTER.
To the left of 0 [zero] is BEFORE.

Since you did not give your year or dist number, then you should have one of these 2:
Bus 1973 * 1700 Auto Trans

Distributor: VW 021-905-205F, Bosch 0231 173 007 > 021-905-205Q, 0231 173 008
Vacuum Can: 07 101
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-14deg Ret; Centrifugal: 14deg (-at-) 1700 rpm, 15-19deg (-at-) 2400 rpm,
21-25deg (-at-) 3400rpm


or

Bus 1974 * 1700 Auto Trans Dual Carbs

Distributor: VW 021-905-205S, Bosch 0231 181 003
Vacuum Can: 07 116
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 9-12deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; Centrifugal: 9-14deg (-at-) 2000rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm
The key to both of them is IF you are setting the timing at 5 AFTER, you MUST have manifold vacuum going to
the retard side and it has to work. The retard side is the inboard flat side. Leave that hose off and cap it
the hose. Set your timing at 7.5 before [to the left, VOR]. Now connect the hose and look at your timing. The
idle should have slowed and the timing should have gone to 5 after. If it did not, then the vacuum is not
enough or the vacuum unit is bad or the advance plate it frozen.
