Subject: Power/torque figures for stock 2l dual carbs

I just took Sally for a rolling road test and got some good figures - 82 bhp
and 120 lb.ft.  I rebuilt the engine last year and it's a stock Euro spec CJ
unit with dual carbs.  The only thing I did that was 'better than factory
spec' performance wise was have the crank assembly and rods balanced to 1g.

Do these figures tally with what other people get?  The bus runs very well
now.
