Subject: Resurrected 82'

Next Monday I get to pick up my 82' bus from George, the local engine Guru,
up in Berrysburg and for the first time in 15 months I am going to go for a
long, long bus ride.  I plan on packing a lunch, bringing my dog and a big
stack of cassette tapes.
With a big smile on my face and of course my tool kit and Chilton book I'll
be driving come Monday afternoon.
