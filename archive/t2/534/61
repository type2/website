I saw the 'flip it over' reply but actually, that lock
is for type 1's. The different sides are for 12V and
6V. Not T1 and T4!!

That lock sorta works on the 210 and 215 type IV
flywheels, but it is worthless on the 228.
I have not seen a real 228 lock.....

 Has anyone found a decent flywheel lock? The type I
 lock doesn't fit the type 4 engine:

 The tines that engage the flywheel teeth aren't even
 well shaped. Do I need to drill a metal bar to use
 as a lock between the flywheel bolt holes and the
 lower studs to improve on this crummy design?
