Hi All
well the punk kids broke 3 of my bus windshields
the split screen ones can be cut  at the glass shop, so thats only a $$
problem

But I need a  decent used bay window windshield

Anyone have one  ????
anyone see one in L.A - Orange county Pick-a-parts

thanks for your help




        I am not in the LA area or have a used Bay Window. But I did just 
two weeks ago pick up a brand spanking new one. National Chain $140.00 in 
Charlotte, NC. If anybody is interested I let me know I can give you the 
info.
