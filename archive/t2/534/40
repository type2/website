Subject: looking for a picture...

Hey Y'all,
I am looking for a good, clear picture or a diagram of
a COMPLETE 2.0 liter fuel injection bus engine to use
for reference. Me and a friend plan on installing a
2.0 liter into a 78 bus, but all the hoses, vac lines,
etc are not now connected (the engine was bought
separately) I checked the Bentley which provided me
with the electrical connections, but I could not find
a good pic of where all the hoses and other stuff go.
