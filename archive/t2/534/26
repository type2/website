Subject: [T2] 76 bay reccomended battery/problems

ok so i have two batterys ... the one that came in the bus is a marine battery and is 650 525 140..............
 the one that i was given twice at advance is 531 75 421
ok problem ...
same battery went dead on me with a bad cell from advance....
well took it back and swaped it....and now few weeks later same thing....
its like its trickleing down over a period of time..?
what could cause this...?
what is the reccomeded battery for a 76 bus?
anyone know..?
so i am thinking maybe the other battery is dead...
had a friend tell me that he has taken i think it was three back in a row before fom advance that were bad...
now my marine battery i am not sure of...? i keep it in there just in case...
course i just got the bus depot relay so was going to try to hook that up sometime today...? that way they both charge and i could use the marine battery for camping and radio and such...? in question now since i noticed the past few days that it has been getting harder to crank but i thought it was because i had the valves looser than a goose on her...?
well they are adjusted right now and this morning she just said unnnn unnn unnnn huh....
thats it///... i jumperd out hooked the jumper to it and fired right up like she was full of energy...
left in confusion.....
the only thing i have hooked to it is my amp that runs through my radio and shuts off when the radio does with the switch or at least the red light is going off..?
could that amp be taking power from my battery over a period of time..?
everything else is ran with toggle switches license plate light  extra back light and my interior lights all run off lighted toggles so i will know if one is left on or not..
thanks...
i probadly just confused you as much as i am..
guess i will stop by later and see if advance can test the regulator also... and i think .. i will rewire the radio and loose the amp doesnt mean that much but was free..
peace
Chris
