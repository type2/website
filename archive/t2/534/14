Subject: blocked off brake booster vacuum lines

I drove for years with the brake booster lines blocked off with no problems.

However, you have to push much much harder on the pedal to get braking. You
have to push much harder than with original non-boosted brakes. You will get
a lopsided bulky left leg. You cannot loan the vehicle to someone who is
used to full power brakes without warning them that they have to push very
very hard on the brake pedal.

You must block off     ALL the ends of the brake vacuum lines, not just the
one going into the engine. You want to keep the vacuum lines clean and to
keep all the (-at-)#(-at-)$# mud dobbers and other mud bugs from invading the vacuum
lines.

I admit I stole the following ascii art from someone with much more artistic
ability than I have
