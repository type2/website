Not wanting to dispute the masters here, but my CA spec 80 Westy never 
had an EGR valve, and I believe that Bently confirms it (it's out on 
loan right now so I'm going from memory here).  The little arm adaptor 
on the throttle and the hole in the plenium does not exist, and appears 
to never have existed.  I also have an 81 parts vanagon that did have an 
EGR valve at one time to compare to.
