Well, you can't miss what you never had.  Perhaps some more background on my
'72 bus project is in order.  I bought it without a motor or interior,
basically a shell with a tranny.  So, I have this really sweet 1600 in my '69,
balanced, dual Kads, Pertronix, 110 cam (I know the 100 would have been better
for a bus) with less than 20K miles on it.  It runs beautifully!  So, the
quicker (cheaper) route to getting the '72 on the road is to put in the 1600.
The parts for the conversion were far cheaper than buying/building a 2.0L type
4, especially since I do not have any of the tin, exhaust, etc. nada, nothing
at all for the type 4 motor.  So when you include all the parts outside of the
long block, the price goes up dramatically.

This bus is not a vehicle that I use on a daily basis.  It is basically my
"hobby car" and we like to go camping in it with our fellow bus friends.  I
don't put a lot of miles on it, maybe 5K a year, so longevity in years will
still be a long time.  I appreciate your thoughts, but everyone's situation is
different.

Peace and Love

Rob
