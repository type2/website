I don't want this to become a political thread about the war being right or
not, everyone has an opinion.  I believe everyone is entitled to it.  Let
say, for those who do not know me.  I spent 20+ years in the Air Force and
thw last 4+ working with Army, Navy and AF Special Forces so I'm a little
closer to the folks fighting.


These folks that were killed were Security personnel. One of there jobs was
to provide security to food shipments to the Irag people. Yes they may have
been working on other missions.

But the point remains that were killed in a hostile enviroment and were not
really combatants.  After killing them they should NOT have been treated in
that fashion.  I, and US Soldiers would not have treated an emeny dead that
way.  What the towns people done after the fact was wrong.
