Mike,

If your going to use a Dupont fnish go for the Chroma Base.--better
paint than the econo Nason--

You can urethane clear over One Shot--the lettering paint, and it will
flow out pretty good---

If they lay enough of the clear over the hand painted area's--it can be
wet sanded with 1500--2000 and buffed to a smooth, unlumpy finish--

Another suggestion.
Find a Dupont dealer--and for the final primer coat use Duponts Uro
Prime--
It's a 3 part urethane primer--add a shot of flex agent to it--

It's super easy to sand-won't attract moisture--and makes for a super
base for any finish coat--


Also--heave the painter add a shot of flex agent to the clear coat--it
repels chips , dents, and solvents real good--it makes the finish coat
almpost bullet proof--

Hope ths answer's your question---

Take Care--

Terry--

Hi, Terry and paint savvy list- you may remember our emails regarding my
daughter's 75 bus she wants to cover with anime art.
          Well, after sandblasting the roof/rockers
we have primed with DuPont Variprime, filled rust pits, and are sanding
the good areas of the old paint so it can be primed and base coated
before my daughter paints her anime on her 75 bus. We have extra
variprime and are using it as a protective primer without it seeming to
affect the old paint. The bus has been garaged since we started this,
and I don't trust myself not to get runs in the final coat, so I checked
with a local VW restoration place, and they use a nearby Maaco for their
painting- So I called them- said it would take about 6 days-they use as
their best Isocyanurate hardened paint DuPont Chromabase, and the next
best is called Nason...both to be covered by clearcoat.   It will be
about $1500 to $2000 depending on which paint- we will sand to 320 grit,
and they will do the primer to even out the surface and then the final
base color (white) and clearcoat.   They claim to use a masking with a
metal edge that is tucked under the rubber to allow smooth painted to
window trim. They do a lot of Motorcycles, and said the artists do their
airbrushing before clearcoating, but one can paint over the clearcoat
with urethane paints- do you concur? If she handpaints, it will be
rougher than airbrushing and to clearcoat after that I am not so sure
about. Thanks for any input.....
