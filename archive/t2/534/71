Subject: Re: [T2] EGR Parts for 81 Aircooled Vanagon

How can NY State expect vehicles that were sold federally under
a completely different set of rules to meet California rules from 81
retroactively? How many years does that NYS law go back? I can see them
applying it to new vehicles, but California rules? Only California vehicles
had all the gizmos to meet their very restrictive pollution laws.
