do any of our beloved parts hounds want to trade? i am installing my
rebuilt engine in the morning anticipating, well, that it runs. in the
event that it does i need one thing i've been unable to get locally: a
68-79 bus sunroof crank! anyone having a v.g./ nos specimen, i may have
something you kneed, or knot.   - steve
