Subject: Re dies when reversing

I think I've heard this one before. The backup light wire plugs on to the
coil, I think to the + terminal(same side as the power wire to the coil). If
it is plugged on to the negative side(along with the condenser wire) it will
kill the engine like this when shifted into reverse.
