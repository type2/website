 To call him a mercenary is a one sided view. You're cruising around with
cheap gas and in  freedom because he's willing to go die for you. Geez, I'm
not even an American and your comment p***ed me off. What do you mean by -
next stop --- willoughby??? To go and give your condolences to the family I
