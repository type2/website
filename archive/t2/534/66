Subject: No highbeams

State inspection is coming up and my high beams won't go off.  I looked at
the turn signal switch and saw that two brown wires have pulled off the
switch.  This is on a '71 bus.  I looked at the wire diagram and it looks
like  a single wire goes to the high-low beam relay.  Is there any way I can
bypass the switching of high to low from the turn signal switch?
 
Joy thru air,
