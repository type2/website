One thing you could try is to hook up the gage to a temp sensor in boiling 
water on the various terminals. that way, you could try which one works. 
Maybe they both work? is there some sort of switch anywhere?

Another possiblity, depending on how new the GTI was, is that the gage is 
digital, and so needs a lower noise ground connection. (that last one is a 
wild guess). OOR! wait, if it's digital, it needs to be powered as well, so 
it needs a light, which goes on when you turn on the headlights (light 
connection), Ground, Signal (from temp sender), and 12Volt to amplify the 
signal. Maybe that needs to be there for an analog gage too? , maybe others 
know?
