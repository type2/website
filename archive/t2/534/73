Not true. While California laws were stricter, even later model
Federal-emissions busses, as well as all aircooled Vanagons, were
required to have EGR filters and cat converters. However, in many
states, this is no longer enforced. 

Here in PA, enforcement varies dramatically from one independent
licensed inspection station to the next. I've learned to get my busses
inspected by tire or muffler chain stores with junior mechanics who know
nothing about old VW's, so they don't look for things like EGR filters.
Once I get my sticker I'll worry about which repairs I may need for
safety. My local VW specialist knows enough about busses to fail one for
not having sidewall-reinforced tires (which I do have, by the way, so no
flames. ;-). By comparison, I once watched a mechanic at an NTW tire
center test my bus's emissions by putting the test wand in the exhaust
pipe of my gas heater. Since the gas heater was off at the time, my bus
passed with flying colors!  Talk about a zero-emissions vehicle! :-)
