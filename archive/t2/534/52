Subject: Was gonna flame but now I say good job BUS DEPOT

On Monday ( March 29 ) at 11:45 I called BUS DEPOT (the phone number you can
ask questions on, so on my dime) and after asking a couple of questions I
figured out what I needed and ordered 2 items:

1) Complete OEM Sachs kit (disc, pressure plate, throwout bearing)
2) Flywheel Lock

I wanted these prity fast so I asked what estimated shiping time would be to
Toledo Ohio. Not being a gambaling man, and wanting it here THIS WEEK, I
decided to pay the the extra $$ for 2-3 day shipping and was assured that
I'd have it "....by Thursday at the latest...".

So out to the garage I go, finised wiring up the power, cleaned out space
for the engine drop, and hit the "SUPER 4 DAY TRUCK LOAD TOOL SALE" that is
in town, and picked up an "ATV LIFT" to help me drop "DA'BUS's"  2 liter
engine.

Well Thursday rolls around and I get a UPS e-mail with the tracking number
and stating: "Scheduled Delivery: 05-April-2004"

Not wanting to "FLY OF THE HANDEL" I checked the tracking number "Detail"
and found
That the item did't even ship till "Mar 31, 2004", Vary P*#(-at-)$D OFF by this
point I called BUS DEPOT to find out what was going on... the person I
talked to was vary cool about the whole thing and quickly defused me, and
let me me know it should be here by Friday, "..unless UPS is really backed
up..."

So I figured if the stuff was not here my like 7:00pm today it was gonna be
"FLAME TIME" Well it got here (-at-) 2:22 P.M, so feeling gulty..I figured I'd
just drop a note saying,

     GOOD JOB BUS DEPOTE

Thanks again
