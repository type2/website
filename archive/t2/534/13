Stainless Steel, magnetic or not magnetic, that is the question

Stainless steel is mostly iron plus varying amounts of nickel and chrome
plus other elements

some stainless steel is non-magnetic, some stainless steel is magnetic

really high quality stainless steel pots and pans are NON-magnetic

really high qualitystainless steel rifle barrels are magnetic

the magnetic vs non-magnetic depends on the alloy and the intended use with
cost vs need for strenght vs need for corrosion resistance vs advertising
hype

really good quality, long lasting mufflers and exhuast parts can be made of
cheap Aluminumized Steel

It all depends on the material, the gauge of the material and the quality of
the engineering and the quality of the assembly of the unit

I have never ever been satisfied with any Air Cooled VW muffler, It seems
that all my water cooled "american" vehicle muffler and exhaust parts last
forever compared to the VW stuff. Although I admit I have never tried the
"dansk" stainless steel muffler

I admit I stole the following ascii art from someone with much more artistic
ability than I have
