Hi Thom,

I contacted you about two weeks back in regards to the first year Westfalia Campers were produced.  You kindly replied, thanks...

I am on assignment for the LA Times Outdoor Section and am writing an article on Westfalias and their owners. We are looking for owners that do the "extreme" in their buses and related in some way to the outdoors whether it be biking, climbing, skiing, surfing etc.  I especially want people who outfit their vehicles to suit their particular area of interest. I would especially like to have an example of a vintage bus that is taken to the extremes just to demonstrate the longevity and usefulness of these "little bulls."  Any help you can provide, whether through personal contacts or getting the word out will be extremely helpful.

Thank you,
Margaret Aston
