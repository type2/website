If evreything is hooked up, working right and in good condition it should be fine,
though there's always going to be a certain amount of "creativity" involved in
adapting systems to engines that they weren't designed for.  The biggest
hassle, as well as the biggest potential for problems that come back and bite
you in the butt, is the wiring harness.  The early 80's Volvo injection harnesses
are known as notoriously bad among Volvo people, and in addition mine was 
butchered, so it has repairs as well as adaptations .. and it came back and bit 
me in the butt.   On that 800 mile test drive to Idaho?  That was 800 miles 
one-way.  I had to make the drive back home to California with carbs. 

Aside from the wiring, other considerations are temperature sensor calibrations
(most EFI has a different resistance range than T1/2/3 heat temp sensors), 
O2 sensor location (does it wind up placed where you need a heated 3-wire 
sensor?), where to put the brainbox (needs to be dry) and other FI components, 
and making/modifying fuel rails (most injectors have a clip-on mount).  One 
place where we've got it easy is that most EFI injectors are Bosch-based, so 
the ends physically fit and seal to our injection intake runners .. and Bus FI
intake parts are usually dirt cheap at the swapmeets. =)
