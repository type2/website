Alan,

Gasoline is composed of (mostly) hydrogen and carbon.  Thus the name
"hydrocarbon".  When you burn gasoline (by adding oxygen), the carbon and
oxygen get together (in a perfect world [1]) to make carbon dioxide (CO2)
and the hydrogen and oxygewn get together to make water (H2O)  No matter
how tight your engine, some of this leaks past the rings and valve guides.
That is why you need crankase ventilation, to relieve the excess pressure
in the case.

If your engine is below 100C, then the water in any blow-by is going to
condense into the oil.  As the water/oil mix gets beaten up by the crank,
it turns into the "mayonaisse" we all know and loath. Once the temp gets
over 100C, that water goes away in pretty short order.

The causes of mayo are:

A type4 engine            (more HP means it does less work/generates
                           less heat)
with high milage          (and lots of blow-by)
run for many short trips  (never gets a chance to warm up)
or without a thermostat   (*never* warms up!)
in a cool/cold climate.   (*reallY* *never* warms up!!!)

Even two or three of these factors will get you some mayo, combine them
and you will see a lot of it!

[1] note that in a less than perfect world (ask me about abelian
teleology!), the Nitrogen in the air also gets involved.  If it combines
with:                you  get:      Resulting in
Oxygen               NOx            pollution
Hydrogen and Oxygen  HNO3           Nitric Acid!
Carbon               CN             Cyanide[2]

If you are lucky, this exits to pollute the atmosphere. If you are not, it
winds up in the crankcase and at least the HNO3 (nitric acid) is a BAD
THING when combined with your metal parts.

[2] My gut tells me this should happen, but I have never heard about it,
and you would think this would be NEWS if it were happening at a
detectable level.  Maybe it is not stable?  or requires more heat than is
readily available?  I dunno, I am not more than an armchair chemist.
