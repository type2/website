Mike,

I have had some luck with good used ones. Sorry currently out. These where
on 1968-1971 to control the air intake diverter from the manifold area to
the normal above engine ambient air temp. In 1971 This was controlled by
another thermostat attached directly to the oil bath air cleaner. Here are a
couple options.

1. The cable housing is very similar to a bicycle cable hosing (I recommend
derailleur cable housing, about $1.50 /foot) this cable housing is 750 mm
(29 1/32 inches). The cable is more like a stiff steel wire (stainless
preferred) in 1968 this cable is 815mm (32 1/32 inches) in 1969 and 1970 it
was 800 mm (31 1/2 inches) The end of this cable that attaches to the air
cleaner has about 6 coils to simulate a spring. I rap the steel cable around
a screw driver5 or 6 times then bend a loop at the end. Then cut it to
length. I can make you one of these for about $10.00 or do it yourself for
about $5.00 and some leg work.

2. Convert to the 1971 air cleaner. This has a small port that is not used
in '68-'70 but everything else is the same. We sell these used for $75.00

By the looks of the lengths of the two options one is cheaper but harder,
while the other is more expensive but simple. Once again another BUStedBUS
solution.

Hiya All!

I'm looking for the sheathed cable which connected the thermostat (via an
arm
located at the lower right of the fan shroud) to the air filter preheater
flap on the stock set-up for a 1970 Bus.  I'm not sure (VW seemed to tinker
with this set-up a lot) but I believe this was also stock in 69 and 71.

I've looked all over to no avail.  Perhaps you guys who are really into
parts
have seen one or two of these around?  I'm at the point where any (well,
almost any) suggestion, idea, or comment would be appreciated.

Mike
