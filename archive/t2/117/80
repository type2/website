how deep to dig the thing or have any other input?

Scout the local want ads...Ask at the gas stations if anyone is up grading
their lift...But try and avoid a "pit". They collect oil, debris, water, and 
ex-
haust gases...Need steps (A ladder? C'mon), a lighting system and only al-
low working on the center area underneath a vehicle...No suspension work
without a jack or jacks. etc. An electric lift is the way to go and locked up;
leaves another space for a car underneath...
