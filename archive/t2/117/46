Subject: Thanks and Solid Lifter Question  Insight wanted

Hello list,

   I want to thank everyone who responded to my 911 5
spd tranny question. I had come across one of these
transmissions for cheep and just wanted to see if it
was worth bothering with. Unfortunately, I missed the
opportunity to get it. Oh Well. 

   I wanted to ask a question for those of you who
have bought new lifters before. I just received a set
of Type IV Solid lifters that were suppose to be new
but the tops of them are smooth and show a hour glass
shape discoloration. This must mean that they were
used at some point, right? I was reading in Tom
Wilson's How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen book and
according to it, I should be able to butt them
together and rock them slightly. Mine don't seem to
rock at all and when I try to pass Light between them
I see no convex area. Is this normal for new solid
type IV lifters or did I buy someone else's junk???I
just wanted to get my facts straight before I asked
the seller about them.
The title of the lifters was:
"NEW VW Type 4 BUS Porsche 914 Solid Lifters"

The description was:
"This complete set of solid type 4 flat lifters (fits
all type 4 motors and are of the original style VW
used) - came with a parts lot I purchased. Style of
which was originally sold by Mark Stevens and used by
OEM."

Is this description acurate or is it bolony?

Any help or insight would be appreciated. Thanks!
