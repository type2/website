My guages were delivered today! I bought oil temp and pressure, volts, =
and
cylinder head temp guages and the dash-top pods to put them in. I am
installing them onto a 1974 , 1800, manual trans bus and I'm looking for
experienced advice. Has anyone done a similar installation? Any pitfalls =
to
watch for, hidden trouble spots, etc? Also, does anyone know if the temp
sensor will fit under my #3 spark plug, or will I have to find an =
alternate
mounting point?

Thanks in advance.
