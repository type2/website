Hi guys,

Recently I bought a load of spares from a guy who was clearing out his garage & among it was some inertia reel seatbelts that he'd fitted new to his bus before it'd succumbed to windscreen rust about a year later.

It wasn't in an accident during that time so the belts are a good score.

Thing is, they're a pain to fit.

Is there a trick?

I took off the standard belts and tried to wind out enough of the belt so I could fit one but it kept locking so I was forced to re-fit the standard belts until I can work out how to put the inertia reels on.

Any clues?



Cheers
