I have some stuff my wife and I have put together to sell at shows. We 
have a hundred or so of the
Pez split window buses for sale in all three styles at $6.00 each. I 
also have some baywindow Brekina's and split window high tops for $10.00 
and I have some reinz(sp) engine gasket kits for sale
at $20.00 each for 76-79 2.0. May fit other years. I also have little 
pull back BUG keychains coming out my ears for a $1.00 each. Let me know
