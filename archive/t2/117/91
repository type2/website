Several friends of mine had pits in England.
You have top be careful to make sure that CO does not collect in the pit.
The generally are about 5 feet deep, have duck board (boat slats on the 
floor) and can be covered by using 2X4's.
I sort of remember that you have a hillside with the Tennessee fainting 
goats, so you can build it into the hill & not gas yourself.

Have fun & hope to see you all in early October
