Subject: Painting the bus myself...

Hi,

I'm going to paint my '69 bus and after asking around at body shops in the 
Boston area, I decided to
do it myself. (the shops that would take the job were asking over $3000, 
way over my budget)
I have some questions:

1) Where can I buy the paint. I'm looking for the '69-'70 Montana Red 
(L30H), the '68 Titian Red (L555) or the '71
Chianti Red (L31H). The bus was originally Lotus White (L282) but it has 
been red for as long as I remember
  (the bus has been in the familly for the past 25 years).

2) I'm planning on stripping the old paint, then use POR-15 directly on the 
bare metal, followed by primer, sealer and
topcoat, with appropriate sanding in between. How much paint would I need 
for the whole bus? Should I use single or
double stage paint for the topcoat? Should I use a conventional or a HVLP 
spray gun?

4) Does anyone knows if there is a place in the Boston, New England or New 
York area where I could
rent a spay booth to apply the topcoat? (Like they have in CA) I have 
access to a small garage at a friend's house,
but I'm concerned about the ventilation, temperature, humidity, etc, etc...

5) Regarding alternatives to spraying, has anybody heard of using (or used) 
foam rollers to apply the paint? Long
time ago, when we wanted to achieve a really shiny finish on furniture, we 
would use cloth to apply abound 10
coats of varnish and the surface would be almost glass like, and we only 
used 220grit sand paper....

Any comments, advice and information is very welcomed. Thanks a lot

Rogelio
