Glen,
I'd thought about doing that myself, but for the opposite reason.  I
want to be able to mount lower profile tires on 15" steel wheels, and
lose less gearing than doing the same on a 14" wheel.  Living In SoCal,
I rarely see dirt roads, except for the 2-3 times a year for camping.

I would think there might be some rubbing on the inner fenders, depending
on how big of a tire you chose.  You would definitely see more sky underneath,
but your center of gravity moves up as well.  

L8,
