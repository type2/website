Subject: Re: [T2] 78 brake question

few weeks ago I put a new front beam on my 78, all went well,

BUT the brakes have not been "right" ever since, now I know you are
supposed to readjust the brake pedal rod after removal and I did it by the
book, BUT  the first time I pushed on the brake pedal the pedal would go
2/3 the way down and sort of get firm but not really apply the brakes very
hard, pump once and the brakes worked fine???? bled em and flushed the
lines, put new calipers on the front along with new pads.  same problem.
  now if I tighten the push rod a little bit, the brakes work by the book
but they aren't adjusted the way Bentley says to do it??????

  ????????  comments, what's that is obvious that I am missing??

thanks
Bob
