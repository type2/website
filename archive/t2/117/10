Subject: Spark Plug Wires

'70 Bus ............

Is the nominal OD of the stock spark plug wires 7mm or 8 mm. ??

They need to fit inside those plastic clips without being skinned, yet 
still stay put when snapped into place,
so proper dim is important.

Also, can wire be ordered by itself, or must one buy a kit of everything ??
