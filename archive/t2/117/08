Subject: Brake Caliper Kits

I waited till friday, since this is borderline OT. I have two new
Bendix brake caliper rebuild kits for an 81 M-B 300TD that i never
used. I know that some people on the list also own M-B's. I need to
get rid of them since i waited too long to return them. Does anyone
need these? I would be happy for a trade for something (here's what
makes it back to on-topic) for my 79 7-pass bus. I was hoping someone
had some expendable parts (filters, brake parts, etc). TIA p-mail me
if this is useful to anyone.
