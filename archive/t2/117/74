Tim,

I'm going to assume you have the Weber 2 barrel progressive carb setup.  If
that's the case, you should lose the regulator, that was left over from the
FI system and is inappropriate for the carb setup.  Of course the carb may
be problematic but I would be surprised to learn that the carb was so bad
off the vehicle wouldn't run.  More typically it won't hold an idle nicely
when the jets start to get worn and/or contaminated.
