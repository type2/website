Not sure about your question.
Are you asking if the 210mm clutch assembly will work on a 73 1700?
If yes: Yes it will work providing you also use the 73 210mm flywheel.
You cannot bolt a 210mm clutch cover on a 228mm flywheel.

[I do have a 215 flywheel that has 2 sets of bolt holes: 8mm for a 210 clutch
and 7mm for a 215 clutch]
