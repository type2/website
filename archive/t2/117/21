Subject: new main wire harness available for '73-'78 buses

Hey folks,

As promised we have started working on new wire harnesses for our late model
buses. Presently Bob at Wire Works makes '68-'72 main wire harnesses which
we have available.

We have finished cataloging and blue printing our first wire sets, the 1973
and 1978 main wire harnesses. These are all the wires rear of the cab. Which
run from the fuse box to the engine compartment. This includes all wires to
the starter, fuel tank sending unit. heating fan, coil, tail lights, side
marker and license plate light. Over 298 feet of wire per set. All
connectors, wires, gauges, and color codes are "like" original. The only
other wires that run out of the cab are the horn and brake switch at the
master cylinder, this as well as the complete harnesses are soon to be
available. As well we are working on FI harnesses. It is our goal to have
every harness for all years available. Please let us know what you are
looking for.

We are currently sourcing wire and connectors. It is our intent to provide a
replica. i.e. with the performance, look and feel of OEM. The performance
can be increased with the same  look and feel and we have consider this.
Performance issue are strand count, temperature rating and other material
properties. Proper color coding will require some custom dieing and
stripping. With these considerations and others such as demand (from you),
the cost for these products can very.

BUStedBUS.com only sells 1968-1979 bus parts. We do not and will not sell
bug, ghia or other vw parts. This helps you, by providing a great source
that specializes in your bus and this community. This doesn't help in our
ability to buy and sell whole sale "low price high quantity". While our
prices may be higher we don't profit like the folks that have lower prices
and sell to a wider market. We will not give into the call for parts for
other cars and see our business trend to a limited selection of "new only"
products for a wider market. We just don't see the community in that. While
from a business profitability stand point this makes perfect sense it goes
against our philosophy.
