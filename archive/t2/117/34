I replaced the 1800 in my 75 with a 2000 from a 78. I simply used the clutch
assembly from the 1800  and bolted it to the crank of the 2000. Sure some will
say I need the larger disk that normally goes with the 2000, but with my
experience hotrodding cars from fraud pintos to hand  built  drag racing
machines, I have seen smaller disks on more powerful engines. If I was taking my
bus down the drag strip I might be concerned, but as a daily driver I don't
think I should have any problems. I believe the flywheels from any of the
pancake engines are interchangeable. Wont swear that the 1700 is though so
please put that question to the list. I'm sure if its possible someone has done
it before. Also consider all those 300 hp type 1s that get all the hype in the
magazines. I'll bet their clutch assemblies are smaller than the one on your
1700.
