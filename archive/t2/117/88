Second thoughts on a "pit": If you're working on VW's primarily, drop-
ping the engine would be at least as difficult as on level ground. You'd
only have a hole slightly less in width as the inner wheel spacing and
a transmission-type jack would be required to let it down. Then move
the bus to get it out of the pit...repair the engine...load it back on
the jack...drop it into the pit...roll the bus back over the pit...lift
and install engine...Nah...Not worth the effort to put the pit in. Save
that money and put it towards an electric lift...
