I think we should ask Rob Henley about the 210 / 228 on a 2 liter! I'm sure 
he would chime in on this, but he's at Paddy's Wagens this weekend. 

The stock '73 flywheel will bolt up with the 210mm clutch and that will all 
bolt up to a 2.0 - and if it is a '73 that you are putting it in, you will 
have to do it. The 228 is too big and will bind up on the starter. You would 
need a new bellhousing AND starter.
