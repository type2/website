Hiya All!

I'm looking for the sheathed cable which connected the thermostat (via an arm 
located at the lower right of the fan shroud) to the air filter preheater 
flap on the stock set-up for a 1970 Bus.  I'm not sure (VW seemed to tinker 
with this set-up a lot) but I believe this was also stock in 69 and 71.

I've looked all over to no avail.  Perhaps you guys who are really into parts 
have seen one or two of these around?  I'm at the point where any (well, 
almost any) suggestion, idea, or comment would be appreciated.

Mike
