What I can tell you from doing fire protection for a living is that flame detectors are used in very sensitive situations (around generators/open flame) and are high speed detectors.

actually I think the heaters use a thermal switch, the flame switch would
be an upgrade to a more sensitive device, therefore in theory more safe
