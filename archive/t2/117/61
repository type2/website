Even in warmer climes if you just take a lot of short
trips you can end up with the white gunk in the oil
filler neck. I suspect everyone (in the mild to cold
areas) Has observed this. It's my understanding that
this will happen if your oil never gets hot enough to
evaporate the water. I've seen it on my bus now and
then. Is your thermostat working? As cold as it is
where you are at that would be an important part of
the
system I would think.
  What I havent seen is the oil itself discoloring as
you described. I would change the oil and quit useing
the fuel additives and see if the situation changes.

How can I have moisture in my oil at -30 to -
20 C. In an aircooled engine?
It is brown and milky, looks like I have to 
change it.
