Slightly off topic here, but it's Friday, right?

My boss has horses. He finally finished the horse pasture outside his house
and needed something to tow a horse trailer (he was boarding them before),
so he went out and bought a brand-new Ford F250 pickup.

This 3/4-ton truck has passenger car-rated tires on it! From the factory!
P235/something-16 that are quite clearly truck tires--our 16-foot Isuzu cube
van doesn't have tread this deep on its tires, and the tires on the Isuzu
are new. We checked the load rating on the Ford's tires and it's fine for
the vehicle.

Moral to this story: load rating may be more important than "P" or "LT."
