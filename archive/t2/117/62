Volks,
Thanks for your responses to my question.  To any of you who's =
interested in my spec.... just don't forget to install bronze valve =
seats, they will seat tight and so flexible so not to crack easily.....  =
and use only racing engine oil such as RS Castrol.... it has been proven =
to be very reliable.....  lubricates so beautifully that amazed my =
mechanic when he torn the engine apart......  every inner part looked so =
shiny as if they had been polished !....... I will try to keep my engine =
alive and let you know if I'm done with my other engine specially built =
for drag racing......

Torry
