RE
I do a lot of dirt road driving in the desert. (4wd
isn't as necessary as ground clearance.) 

What would the complications be to putting 15" wheels
on my '68 bus? I'm half-serious. Besides the speedo
issue, would they fit under there? Would it affect
stability or handling? How much ground clearance would
I gain?
Most after-market wheels for the type two are 15inch. I am running 16inch 
wheels that are  7inch wide. The tyres are 205 mm wide and cause no problems 
rubbing Except on full lock but this is adjustable. The only clearance 
problems I think are with 1971 models which might need a little persuasion.
