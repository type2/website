The 2.0 will bolt in if you use the 73 flywheel and clutch.
I am assuming you will be using the 73 carbs? If yes, then you will need a
small electric fuel pump. The 2.0L has no provisions for a mechanical pump [in
the USA].
Use all the engine tin from the 1700, along with all the exhaust from the 73.
And the 73 alternator support.
One thing I would do is find bigger jets for the carbs. They went bigger from
1700 to 1800. Now you are going 200 cc larger. Got a 68-79 Bentley? If yes, go
to section 3, page 30. That page shows all the differences between the carbs
for 72 to 74.
