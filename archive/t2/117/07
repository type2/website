Subject: 15" wheels (fri. musing)

I do a lot of dirt road driving in the desert. (4wd
isn't as necessary as ground clearance.) 

What would the complications be to putting 15" wheels
on my '68 bus? I'm half-serious. Besides the speedo
issue, would they fit under there? Would it affect
stability or handling? How much ground clearance would
I gain?
