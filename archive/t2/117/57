Subject: Corvair Engine for bus wanted

I am in need of a Corvair engine, standard rotation, for my Transvair VW bus
conversion.  I just bought it last week and it has had a major difficulty
this morning.  Someone vandalized it back there and I did not realize it.
The hot smell was no different than an old Beetle I had did all the time
until it was too late. An incompetent shop had just worked on the electrical
system and brakes, fixing the ignition and headlights but breaking the horn,
wiper switch and half the parking brake so the generator light did not ring
the usual bell since I figured they'd just failed to fix the electrical
right.   Does anybody know how to subscribe to the corvair list?  Glen Ward
