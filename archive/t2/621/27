MOLD & MILDEW STAIN REMOVER: Codes 250 - 710 ml & Code 251 - 4 L. - which
contain a mild bleaching agent as well as an effective blend of detergents
and surfactants. Strong chlorine is not present to avoid color removal and
fiber damage in stitching.

MOLD & MILDEW PREVENTATIVE: Code 422 - 710 ml. An enzyme/bacteria mixture
that fits the action described earlier. It can prevent growth as well as
stop growth already in progress.
