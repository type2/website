If you were closer Don, I would give you the 78 Westy interior I have in the garage. It is very similar to the kitchen you got for free. If anyone else has an interest in the whole cabinet deal $50.00 you pick up. Mostly complete. In Mystic,CT. Make sure you advertise that kitchen set up you have Don. We used one in our fiber van at work. The fridge and stove been great. Nothing like being able to make coffee on the spot when fixng a fiber break at 3 in the morning. It's the only time the guys at work have had any good things to say about my VW addiction.
