Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

Thanks for the notes guys. 

I agree the original "kitchen" for my 73 was pretty useless. Hence the
second jump seat. Then my bus seats six. I may consider installing the
brackets for a middle seat sometime in the future, then I can swap the
jumps out and the middle seat in when I want. I'll think about that
for a while...

This kitchen setting on my patio is from an 87-ish Vanagon Westy. It's
a sweet piece of equipment, but pretty useless to me. I did the
measurements and it would leave like 1" between the zbed and the
kitchen. Sigh. Combine that with the installation hassles, and I'm
just skipping it. I'll figure out something to do with it. And yes, it
would be MUCH happier in a trailer I think.

I always thought the cabinet covering the window was pretty stupid
too. That was one thing the DPO did right. He/she cut into the cabinet
to expose the window. So now the top of the cabinet is like a high
armrest. I'm going to stick with that basic design, adding some
cupholders. heh

I like the table where it is right now. Folks sitting on the back seat
and the jumpseat behind the driver's seat can use it as a dining
table. Perfect. I don't think there's any modification needed, except
to replace the warped wood with some butcher block or something.

I'll probably give up the walkthrough capabilities and get one of the
electric refridgerator/console units I see every so often. Not much
space, but enough for milk for the wife and kids cereal. ;)
