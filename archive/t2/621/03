Subject: Engine build time

Hello, It is time to tear my motor down in my 79 bus,
the motor developed a vibration in it at high rpm's,
so I need to find out why. Anyways I was wondering if
their is a bigger hydraulic cam available for the
2000cc FI. motors. I don't want to big just something
for a little more power, where I can still use my FI.
Any idea's or suggestions would be great.

Thanks,
