CHeck that your Float isn't stuck in the carb. This could be one 
culprit. If the Float doesn't stop the flow of fuel into the carb I 
would imagine it would just keep'a'coming and this could be a symptom 
when the pump starts pumping.

Just a thought. This happened on my '65 Moped when I rebuilt it, never 
had it happen on my bus so it is a bit of a shot.
