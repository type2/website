Wow you have a problem with people expressing their feelings in public. Yes 
and I have had worse too. Venting is ok if you don't you will explode or 
implode. As far as helping people I try to help every thread that runs 
across my screen if I can. Sorry my venting has cause your "b*tching and 
"commenting" to start ironically about the very thing you are doing.


I agree too some things are better left in private. That is why I did not 
blow in the List member who I bought them from and I have had many emails 
asking who it is. I will not tell. It might just be the fault of the 
carrier, I presume it is for now. It is just another bus experience as far 
as I am concerned. I was just having another Type II frustration. I wanted 
to have it all ready for this weekend and to get this engine back together. 
As soon as I get it done, I will have the cash to get my bus on the road. I 
don't like all the airing of laundry that I have seen here, but this is a 
public forum so to say and people are entitled to there opinions, with bus 
content of course. Which this is all about. I like to post a lot of my 
experiences with buses whether good, bad or indifferent. If I had said I had 
a bad day and went to change my spark plugs and stripped out the threads 
would have made it more appropriate? You are right there is nothing you 
could do about it it is called a PITA. As for bus content:

Gypsy has her ass in the air waiting for anew heart, el Verde has her tail 
down and begging for attention.
