thanks phil yup someone taught me a thing or 2 about a thing or 2 but i just wanted to make sure....never can be to careful and last thing i want/need is to be down for the count...i am always checking behind myself... made way to many mistakes costly ones..LOL 
just because the jets and mixture are screwed up or not set right..dont need that to be the cause of a foul up...
the choke does indeed open up after warm on both carbs but however the right hand side carb i notice if even cold isnt all the way shut...
it its part the way open and if you take off the linkage and hit the accelerator you barely here it click and it will close.. the falp that is...
so something i am sure on the carb is keeping it from shutting...?
like i say you have to take the linakge off to get it to shut..
the bus is cold still so i may go see if i can get a pic of the flap inside before i crank today....?
peace
chris
thanks

Yup, they do look a little(lot) rich, and you are
right it could be the mixture, jets, and choke, one
you can mark off is the choke, take the breathers off
and watch them to make sure they open when warmed up.
after that make sure the mixture control screw is set
right, I believe it's in till it drops then back out a
1/2 turn? (both sides) After that, it's down to
changing the main jet sizes till the plugs clear up.
you were right, better rich than lean. If you change
the jets be sure to put the same size on both carbs.
Good luck with it, maybe someone else has a better
idea. Phil
