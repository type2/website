Water System Operator?  I'm taking the license test in November.  I've been
an operator under another certified operator for about 6 years.  Time to get
my own license and add to my income.

I can verify the chlorine gas thing.  I was exposed to a low amount of the
gas every day over several months (ventilation system problem in the pump
house).  Screwed up my lungs and the lack of oxygen messed with my mind.
NOT good.

In a worse case scenario, something like John's, you usually don't get a
second chance.  If there's not someone to pull you out, you're a deader.

That aside, I'm interested in Scott's "Captain PHAB" mold and mildew
remover".  Time to Google...
