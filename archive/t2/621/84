Subject: Zero compression # 1, replace head?

Sweaty Betty finally got some relief from the Phoenix temps last night
after the cooling rains, but I wouldn't let up on her. Instead I took her
on a 65 mph hiway run and on my return leg she was getting sluggish.

This morning I do a compression test ( cold engine ) and get these results:
               #1   Zero    black dry plug
               #2   97        good plug
               #3   100      good plug
               #4    85        good plug

Bentley, Muir, Haynes, archives and web articles have, together got  me
confused.  Should I pull the valve cover and inspect?

Could the cause of this poor cylinder lie deeper than the head itself?

Thanks in advance, Craig
