Subject: Bay ignition switch problem

Hi list!

I recently had to replace the ignition lockset in my 73 bus.  Thanks 
very much to Mike Howles in the Type2 archive for a very helpful and 
informative "how to" article.  I am sure I could not have accomplished 
the task without his really detailed guide.  Thanks!

Anyway, subsequently due to the theft of my daily driver (which had the 
keys to the bus in the console), I had to change the lock cylinder 
again (it is not a lot easier the second time, by the way).  At this 
point, I decided to change the electrical side as well, because mine 
was very worn.  My problem is that now, the key (lock cylinder) will 
not turn far enough to engage the starter.  Everything works 
electrically just fine (using a screw driver with the electrical "plug" 
removed causes the starter to turn).  But when installed, turning the 
key will only turn far enough to energize the ignition, not the starter.

I read in Jim Thompson's note in the archives about the newer 
electrical parts being 4 position switches, and to verify that before 
installation.  Mine seems to be only a three position switch (not 
really sure), but it seems to require about 110 to 120 degrees of turn 
to get to the starter postion.  Jim suggests realigning the switch so 
that the appropriate switches are in use.  What I can't figure out is 
how to have the electrical switch in anything but a straight up and 
down position (aligned with the pin hole and slot in the lock cylinder 
case) upon installation.

Help?
