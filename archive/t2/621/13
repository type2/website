I agree and I don't think this is the place to "vent" stuff like that...we've all had much worse...suck it up and keep it to yourself!  It doesn't help us and we can't help you with it.
Sorry for the lack of bus content..I'm just sick of this being a place for b*tching and "commenting" and not for actual help.  Don't forget over a thousand people all over the world get your message.
