With so many milage numbers from "engine", "last rebuild", "vehicle",
and mine: "when the odometer was stopped for some reason", the only
real mileage that seems relevant is: Estimated maintenance free miles
before breakdown.  ..wonder how that compares to "Miles and years
since last tune-up"?

Gullible purchaser of "2 years, 200 miles since rebuilt"..."Porsche
engine, ya know"*..."Holley's more powerful and dependable than the
old fuel injection", and "Front brake sticks a little"** ,20 miles
from home, and magic $1500 price tag, and <snip/> tires,.`ly yours,

If it weren't for this list and related community, it'd be dumped at
that garage sale where 4 different folks asked me if I was selling it.
:-P

Thanks for the muffler thread, btw.  I thought just becuase my muffler
was "burnt orange" ;-) I was due for a replacement.  It's not quiet
like modern cars, but you can easily hold a conversation while
watching it idle. :D

*Nope
**Translation: $500 job for the works up front. Stupid me: No estimate
or contract up front.  I don't think the number was horribly off, I
did get new parts and lines, but sure felt greased over...especially
when I found they didn't include emergency brake verification and fix.
