Thanks everyone for the mildew advice.

Captain PHAB would do the trick, I suppose, but I was really hoping not 
to spend any time at all inside the bus until I'd beaten back the 
mildew a bit. The stink really is atrocious. I thought someone might 
have heard of an anti-mildew agent that works sort of like a flea bomb. 
Oh well...
