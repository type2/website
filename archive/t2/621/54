Back when my bus had to be smogged, they checked for the charcoal
canister, the 34PICT-3 carb with the vacuum-operated throttle opener and
associated hoses, the stock air filter and heat riser, and the little
rubber boot on the road draft tube.

The really annoying thing about the legislators is that they voted
themselves a 3-4 year exemption on getting their new cars smogged.
