Subject: RE: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

Someone I met on thesamba.com came over and took out all my furniture for me 
- and paneling - all but the floor (oh yeah - I already told you guys this 
in my state of excitement).  I know, I'm a sissy but really I just didn't 
have the time to do it myself and considered it worth it as he was really 
reasonable.  We/he had a tough time with the floor though.  It's still in 
cause there are some old rusty-looking nails pretty deeply embedded.  I need 
to get that floor out though cause I know for sure there are two holes which 
eat straight up from the bottom, near the side/sliding door (though the 
undercoating's still there and in tact on the rest of it - just not the 
side).  How the heck do I get those screws out and try saving the floor?  
Anyone know?  He found very little rust inside so far but after reading 
Don's story about his floor I want more than ever to pull it out (trying to 
keep it in one piece in order to keep the whole interior original)!  I'm 
sure if the wood's rotten - which it very well may be - I can't save the 
floor )-:

I scrubbed that inerior out too, Don - but again, still don't know what's 
under that flooring!  So after we treat the rust we've found, the furniture 
will go back in.

Thanks -
