Hi Don,

Allow me to play Devil's Advocate for a moment. Please understand that 
these are my opinions about westy's *I* have owned, and if people are 
happy with their bus then I'm happy for them.

The standard 196x-73 westy interior is the worst use of space possible 
for a daily driver. The icebox won't hold a six-pack and the sink won't 
hold enough wash water to properly wash a dinner plate. The water that 
comes out of the tap usually tastes flat and plastic, and if you forget 
to drain the dregs in the fall it will freeze over the winter and crack 
the tank. (OK, I guess that's not a problem in SoCal.)  My biggest 
complaint about that cabinet is that it blocks the first 24" of travel 
in the sliding door. EVERY single time you use that door you have to 
slide it that much extra to get past the cabinet. And it makes opening 
the door from inside the bus a lot harder than it should be. I get 
better use of space from a cooler placed just inside the sliding door 
during camping trips, and I get a lot of use from that space when not 
camping.

I like the rear facing seat. I like the Z-Bed. I don't like having the 
passenger side window blocked by a cabinet that I don't find very 
useful. But when that cabinet is cut down to window height it is a lot 
better and when it's removed altogether you gain a LOT of width in the 
rear bed. So I widened my Z-Bed and ditched the rear cabinet.

Suggestion:

Repaint the floor, and lay down a sheet of eighth-inch masonite board, 
recessed to the contour of the sliding door track. Then lay in the 
floor of your choice: carpet, linoleum, hardwood or laminate. Then 
install the Z-Bed and rear-facing seat. Take the flip-down table off 
the side of the original cupboard and mount it to the rear of the 
passenger seat bulkhead just inside the sliding door. This will give 
you a great compromise between camping and daily driver use, and it'll 
look good too. Use a cooler for the stuff you need to keep cold. Bring 
a basin to wash dishes in.

Or build a westrailer to haul the kitchen gear. ;-)


Happy trails,
