need advice
i changed the plug and put new ones in after installing new dual carbs cause i just wanted to see how things were going and how i had the mixture set...
so by looking at the pics that are numbered and untouched since i took them out to take pics..... how do they look.????.
to me ... numbers 4 looks really black compared to the other three....>?
i dont want to burn nothing up here valve or worse a piston...
 good thing they all look rich not lean to me..? may be right or wrong not sure..
thats the reason for my post to make things right and keep a heads up on things so that maybe if wrong i will have time to change something..
those experienced mechanically holler back please...
i also looked in the haynes and it has the color chart in there and the ones it looked closest to says it could be from jets,mixture,or choke..? i only compared the pics to number 4 plug though...which i thought was nastier than the others,.,.
really appreciate the help./../
and the time it will take to look at the pics....
they are all named for which ever plug they are number 1-4.....
there is 360 miles on these plugs till there pull. and picture show. walla go...~!~
hope the pics are good enough for the experienced eye....///?
peace
chris
