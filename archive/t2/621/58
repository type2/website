Subject: CV joint hell

I spent the day with Lurch today.

I needed to swap out trannies.

Well, it seems the old tranny  had been leaking into the left CV joint 
and so when I undid it, the innards came pouring out - time to re-pack 
it.  The boot on the right inner CV joint had a hole in it too.  I sure 
learned a lot about CV joints, which is a kind way of saying I spent 
five #(-at-)$%* hours on them.

Although I did manage to get the new tranny in (I cleaned and lubed the 
entire shift linkage while I had the tranny out), I called it quits 
before putting the engine back in.  I'll pull all the tin off and 
torque things down before I put it back in.

Although the day was frustrating as hell, I still love my bus.
