Subject: Re: [T2] I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

Around a 74-75 Westy,
I have a one for sale right now but am too far for you (South Carolina and 
shipping would be unreal as it is quite heavy)

But if anyone is intersted let me know and I'll send pics. I'm asking $75.

Delivery could be arranged to a campout.
