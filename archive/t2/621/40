Subject: Re: [T2] Rust question

Has anybody done a comparison of POR-15 and Master Series?

The guy's been advertising on The Samba for a while, but I haven't
heard anybody use it.

I just pulled the interior out of my bus. So much for the rust-free
floor. :( None of the rust seems to penetrate through the metal, but
30 years of sodas and leaks and such has definitely taken its toll...
