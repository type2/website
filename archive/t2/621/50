Unless the flooring itself is a masterpiece, you can do better. For 
Peregrine, I used a sandwich of plywood, high-density fiberboard, and 
composition asphalt tiles. The tiles are very cheap (about sixty cents 
per square foot) at Home Depot, and come in many colors. They can be 
cut with a knife to get interesting geometric designs. The floor does 
have to be carefully sealed before using. Once in place, it will last 
forever.
