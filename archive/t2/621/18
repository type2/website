I think it is either a 32mm or 36mm. I can't remember off hand. But I can 
let you know soon.

>2.  Will getting that screw/bolt off enable me to get the generator out?

Yes.

3.  Are there any other things I need to know about on this project?

Make sure you have the piece of tin cover plate that bolts to the shroud 
oriented correctly when you reinstall it on the Gen.

Good Luck,
