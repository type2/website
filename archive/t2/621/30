I did some searching before, and again just now. The consensus on mold
in foam is:

"If the mold is growing deep in the padding of an
upholstered piece or mattress, nothing will eliminate
the mold or odor except renovation by a
trained upholsterer or replacement of the item."

From:
http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/library/HOUS2/MF2141.PDF

The hazards of mold are well documented and, to me, not worth the risk
of trying a "snake oil" product to remove the mold.
