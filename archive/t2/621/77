Subject: Wiring

I have looked and pondered over the wiring diagrams, but to no avail.  I can't seem to identify which wires go where.  I pulled the engine and did not document wiring.  (I know bad VW owner!!)  Anyway I'm trying to hook up the coil and I'm not sure what goes where.  I have the distributer and chokes hooked up.  Is there documentation on how to read the wiring diagrams?  I also stare at the tranny with blank recollection. I have four connections on the transmission.  Two of which go to the reverse lights the other two on the nose cone I have no idea what they are or where they go.  I can't remember. Arg!!!
