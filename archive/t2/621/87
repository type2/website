Subject: Re: [T2] Zero compression # 1, replace head?

Well now what is Sweaty Betty, 1.7L, 1.8L, 2.0L and if
possible what year. compression missing could be a
burnt valve, hole in the piston, chunk of the head
missing. You have done the dry compression test, now
do one after squirting some oil into the spark plug
hole(Wet test). If it's not a hole in the piston and
the compression stays the same it's a valve that is
bad, if the pressure comes up its bad rings(gauled
piston) but the engine must come out and the heads
pulled and then you can see what is the problem,
Sweaty Betty is down for the count..The pressures are
uneven both heads could be bad..  Phil
