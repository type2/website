I found the following link which has interesting photos of the durability of 
the various rust prevention systems, including the one described below.

surfacer, bc, cc - the best way.  Rustoleum alone will not last.  Transtar
has the zinc chromate in a rattle can.  The ospho is sometimes available at
Home Depot.  Ospho and naval jelly both use phosphoric acid as the active
ingredient.  Phosphoric acid converts rust (iron oxide), which flakes off,
to iron phosphate, which does not flake off and helps stop the rust process.
Ospho followed by the POR product may be a good inexpensive way.  POR, best
as I can tell is basically a really good epoxy primer.  I do not know if it
has zinc or chrom for chemical rust prevention.
