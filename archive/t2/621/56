Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rust Question 

folks,

piling on to this question, my floor is perforated
here and there so I used epoxy putty as a stop-gap
two years ago and, for what it is worth, that seems
to have held.  i did do some prep -- sandblast,
phosphoric acid, por15, and finally putty.

on the other hand, rust is going to take my bus
eventually, there are just too many places where it
has the upper hand though i'm postponing that day
by spraying everything underneath that i can twice
a year with used motor oil and putting it away
for the winter (salt avoidance).
