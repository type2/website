Regarding "rust converter" products: About 1995 I bought some stuff 
called "MarHyde One Coat" and used it on my floorpan where I had rusted 
out spots, some really big holes and the metal was very crumbly. After 
brushing this product on the metal it transformed it into a non brittle 
surface and also coated and stopped the rust from progressing.

Hiya Marya,

Any of the "rust converter" products may be worth taking a gander at.
