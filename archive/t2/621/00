Subject: Re: [T2] Travel to Buy Bus

One of my most memorable (and enjoyable) trips was to pick up my '84 Vanagon I
bought on eBay. Had to catch the train from Harper's Ferry W. Virginia to
Cleveland, then take a Greyhound to Columbus, where the seller met me. The
drive home, straight through on Rte 50 from Ohio then W. Virginia was
beautiful. The trip was much more fun than Vanagon ownership-which is why I'm
now back on the air-cooled list!     Jeff
