Subject: '79 Dashboard Brake Light

When attempting to change the dash brake light bulb, the holder broke in my
hands and the wires came off of it.  (This holder has some semiconductors in
it - resistors, diodes and transistor)

Two questions:

What wires go on which posts?
Where can I get a new holder?

Thanks,

Wayne
