Subject: Re: [T2] How do you use fire extinguisher?

Hello Mike and the list

I was involved in the past with a fire extinguisher company that used to
have halon ones before they were banned, and as far I can remenber (please
the chemistry guys helps us) one of the gratest pro of the halon ext was
that they act over the fire in a chemical way, reacting with the flame 1000
time quickest and efective than the ABC powder ones that kill the fire by
sofocating and cooling the area.
Anothe caracteristic of the halon was because it gas nature they spray very
easy so you do not need a house or nozzle, in an ameriacan car you can kill
an engine fire even with out open the hatch, just discharching the gas true
the radiatior, so if you have a halon ext, I think you can kill a engine
fire sparying the gas true the vent wings, as the matter of fact, I was
thinking on find a halon ext and intall it in the back of the bus and
running a house to the engine bay, so I can release the gas form the inside
the bus just in case of fire.
I never try this and as I allready told that was so long ago when I worked
for that company so if somebody in the list can veryfi or valid this info
would be nice.
