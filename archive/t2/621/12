Sorry. There is no way that I found that will kill the mildew in the
upholstery and padding that won't destroy it first.

Soaking the wood in bleach, sun drying it for a few days, then
painting it, will work for the wood. I did an experiment on the jump
seat bottom cushion (see my site) with just that method. Even my wife
allowed it in the house. At the moment it is my kids favorite TV seat.
