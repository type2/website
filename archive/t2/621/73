They need to have a better description of the test procedures and what 
they actually did to each piece of metal.

In the "real" scientific world this study would get an "F".

Pretty sure I've seen this "test" before...They took a piece

scratched an X into the surface and left it out for 500 hours.
Now whether they started with clean sheet metal or a rusted
