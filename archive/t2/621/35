Hiya Marya,

Any of the "rust converter" products may be worth taking a gander at.  These 
products are usually a liquid or jelly-like compound which will chemically 
change existing rust into an inert material.  Most feature phosphoric acid as a 
working ingredient.  Pretty good way to go with minor surface rust (after 
sanding). 
Then too, before doing any painting you might want to investigate using a 
zinc-rich primer.  The zinc will help protect the metal from "atmospheric 
effects".  Besides, zinc was used in the original construction process/painting.  
That's a fair recommendation in itself.
