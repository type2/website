Subject: Re: [T2] Rap on distributors / overheating

Thanks for the plethora of information and advice.

Seems that many different distributors should work on this engine (1600 SP)
as long as the vacuum is correct and timing is set correctly for that
distributor. I need to check some things.

Jason e-mailed me today with some information that I had forgotten. I wonder
if this clues anyone on my heating problem. Jason was in the carabus to EB
2002 with our 9-bus group. Several of us were gauged for oil temperature.
In the mountains in up and down driving, I was too warm but  OK. When I hit
the interstate, I really got hot. This is repeatable around here.

Anyway, running at 50 mph I was at 250 on a very hot day. Everyone else was
doing fine. Is soon as we hit the traffic and went to a near standstill, the
cool running busses temperatures went up, but mine went down. Does that
bring up a new list of differentials for anyone?
Thanks. You guys are great
