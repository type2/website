Hi Sherri,

	There are two really nice aftermarket camper setups available from
justkampers.com, here's a link:
http://www.justkampers.co.uk/news.shtml#1012327572 they are about halfway
down the page.  I beleive that Ron (-at-) The Bus Depot is importing these to PA,
which will help a bunch with shipping cost.  These are the nicest looking
kits I have seen available anywhere.

							Hope this helps,

Hi guys,
I'm planning on turning my '78 Bus into a camper and I was wondering if 
there are any reference materials, books, magazines on the types of 
options available? Can I buy after-market option or do I just 
cannibalize old buses and make it fit?

Thanks in advance!

Sherri
