O.K. I've grown to HATE carburetors. My 2.0L type IV with a "3/4 grind" =
cam...whatever that means... has been a carb nightmare from the start.=20
Carb#1: 34ICT setup...ran great...bought used.. and lasted 3 months =
until the throttle bushings got too loose. Not tunable anymore. MPG 20 =
combined with great power. SO........................
Carb #2: Bought used 40IDF set. Had problems tuning and the right one =
seemed to run rich all the time. Tried and tried and tried to get it =
better. Just figured I was talentless. Sold'em to Rob and he found out =
there were some internal problems with the things. Sorry.On advice of a =
few folks I bought a NEW carb.
Carb #3: Just got a 32/36 DFEV from Redline. Won't idle. Never had an =
idle problem before with the duals. Idle jet is a 60. If I turn the =
speed screw in enough to engage the transition holes it will idle =
...fast. Weber says it needs a 70 idle jet. 70 seems too rich and it =
still won't idle properly...loads up and dies. Checked vacuum, all =
ignition parts, compression is 100 even all 4 cylinders. Tried to set =
idle mixture the way the weber tech says but still no help.Engine has =
about 5000 miles on it. I can't imagine what the problem is. I'm not in =
a position to install fuel injection...not practical now.  Just want a =
daily driver. Any ideas out there? All the obvious has been checked. =
Does this engine need duals? If so 34 or 40. Maybe Speedy doesn't like =
me. HELP!!!
Dave
