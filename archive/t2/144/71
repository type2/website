oddly enough I was working on the wife's Honda, starter prob... crossed the
starter with a screw driver .. ohh it started alright and then somehow
jumped in gear(its an automatic) and drove down a hill with me in front of
it for 30+ ft, until it was stopped by a big ol tree, If it had missed that
tree the next one that it would have hit was gonna have me between the two!
I am thankful to be here and sorry to hear about glen.
