Subject: RE: [T2] shift lever springs(was tranny bushings etc.)

Hi Billy,

The spring sits around the shaft of the pin between the head of the pin and
the recess in the ball through which the pin fits.

From memory the pin protrudes about 12-15mm through the ball i.e. much
closer to a half inch than an inch.

At one time I lost both pin and spring and made a new pin by taking a bolt
of the appropriate diameter and length and ground the hexagonal head down to
be circular and of a size to fit into the recess in the ball. It was like
this for around two years before that van hit the scrap yard with no
problems changing gear. So I would say don't worry too much if you don't
have the spring; however without the pin gear changing will be near
impossible!

Good luck

Dave W, Dave B, Steve D, and Bill H., See below for reference:

Okay, so the pin that points forward (f is f) of the shift lever ball should
be about an inch/12 mm long...

Mine is obviously broken off.

There should be a spring (not the large conical one around the shift lever
itself, that tensions the shift lever ball in a front to rear direction.
Does this spring go in front of the shifter (around the pin) and against the
inside front of the cup (pushing back), or behind the lever (pushing
forward)? I assume forward since Dave(?) says the pin must remain forward,
thru the slot in front of the cup.

Is this part available?

thanks everybody,

Billy (no spring in the 76 or the 79!)
