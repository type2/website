ok.  problem.  the engine will start, rev for about one second, then =
immediately stop.  no matter how many time i turn the key, same thing =
every time.  if i put my put on the gas pedal and then start it, it revs =
high, but the moment i take my foot off the gas pedal, it stops.  i have =
a 77, 2.0 liter, fuel injected.

any ideas?

Ben
