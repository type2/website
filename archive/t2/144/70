Subject: [T2] re: timing 

>>I have an 009 in my 74 single cab
with type IV and dual weber ICT's.  Is the
desired 25 degrees of advance supposed to be set
from the reference point of the factory 7.5 ATDC
idle timing OR from TDC?  

I just noticed, I didn't answer the question. 
The desired 25 degrees of advance is total
advance at WOT and it means 25 degrees BTDC. 
(I'm putting WOT, but there is an rpm in Bentley.
 Look it up because my memory....)  In other
words it is 25 degrees of total advance and not
25 degrees to the left of 7.5 ATDC.   

Your 009 has no vacuum retard, obviously, so I'd
time it 7.5 BTDC. 

Note that 7.5 ATDC is wrong by the way.  I'm not
sure if that was a typo or not.  

The type IV dizzies were either 7.5 BTDC (late
single vacuum dual advance dizzies), and 5 or 10
ATDC (earlier dual vacuum dual advance dizzies),
I think.  The ATDC dizzies were the dual vacuum
models with retard and advance.  The only reason
for the retard is to reach certain emissions
levels by forcing the engine to run hotter at
idle.  (And the 5 or 10 ATDC timing reflects
approximately that much retard from the 7.5 BTDC.
 That is the dizzy has approx 12-15 retard so
that if you properly timed your early dual vacuum
dizzy to 5 or 10 ATDC then capped off the retard,
you'd be back at 7.5 BTDC.  Moreover, the
nanosecond you put your foot on the throttle,
your dizzy switches from retard to advance and
you begin at approx 7.5 BTDC-- with vac advance
and centrifugal advance taking over from there.)

Clear as mud?
