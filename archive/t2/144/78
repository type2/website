Billy,

I didn't make the translation from 12mm to 1 inch in my head when i saw 
those numbers on the list, but mine is *not* that long(this is from 
memory 2 months ago)...but it seems that it was only about 1/4-1/2" long.


Doesn't anyone have one of these siting out of their bus right 
now?.....Joe Mitchel?

Cheers ,dave

Does this spring go in front of the shifter (around the pin) and against the inside front of the cup (pushing back), or behind the lever (pushing forward)? I assume forward since Dave(?) says the pin must remain forward, thru the slot in front of the cup.
