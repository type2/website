Subject: dizzy question

All Knowing List,
I'm very late to jump in on the distributor thread of late, but I have 
concerns about my current setup.  I've got a 70 Westy with a 1600dp, a 16 
year old Brazilian Solex 30/31 replacement carb and original vacuum advance 
dizzy, (about the last original part left on the bus).

The motor was replaced four years/25K miles ago. I have noticed that the 
vacuum line from dizzy to carb is connected to a port facing the rear of the 
bus where the throttle positioner used to be.  The other unused ports are 
plugged.  The positioner was removed when the engine was replaced.  Why?  I 
don't know.  I have noticed that most other early bay's that still have a 
vacuum advance dizzy run the vacuum hose to a port on the left side of the 
stock solex carb just above the mixture and idle adjustment screws.  This 
port on my carb is also plugged.  I checked a picture of the dizzy to carb 
set up on Bob Perring's NewBus and sure enough it seems to connect on the 
left side of the carb.  NewBus is the most original and unmolested bay I've 
every seen. The original owners manual also shows a picture of this exact 
hose connection.  I don't have a Bentley Manual yet, but will get one soon 
to check what they show.

The bus runs great, and I've had no engine problems at all.  The shop that 
replaced the motor is no longer in buisness to ask questions. Not a good 
sign, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I time it as I always have at 0 
degrees TDC.  I don't have an advance timing light but it seems to advance 
correctly and does not ping or over heat.

Can anyone tell me if this is the right hose connection?  Should I 
experiment by connection to the left carb port or leave it alone?

Thanks for any and all input.
