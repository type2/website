	I do indeed, or...errrr, I have reformated twice since then so I
may have them on disk.  If not, my bus is running now so I don't see why
I could not take some pics of my own if needed.  Will do this first
thing when I get home.  In the mean time there are the usual pics at my
site which may show something already.  I will email you (Chris) when I
get this done for you.

Chris,

>From memory(I'm at work right now)...   3 relay's

Troy Wicals should have several rear of fuse box shots i did for him
that 
show all colors and placement.

I have 78 champagne with defroster(not working) :-((

Intermittent wipers...etc

Chris, intermittent wipers all use the same idea...count off seconds
based 
on some control setting and then send one shot of juice the the wiper to

get it started....wait x seconds and do it again.

Lots of other folks sell these also, including kit versions that you put

together yourself...

Cheers ,dave
