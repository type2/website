Subject: EB 2002 Mystery parts gift

I wasn't sure waht to put in the subject line here. I wanted to thank
the generous person that secretly replaced my broken rear side marker
light on my bus while I was at EB 2002. I was part way home when I went
to show one of my fellow canadian travelers where a woman had clipped my
rear bumper and broke my marker light when to my surprise it was no
longer broken. So whoever did it , my thanks go out to you!
