Hey,
 i posted this message before, im not sure if anyone saw it or not but, i 
live in new york and i just got my first bus that was just shipped from 
arizona. its rust free and in great shape. since i live in N.Y. theres a 
better chance for rust to form. i dont have a garage, so what do you think i 
can do to prevent rust formation (especially the under carriage)??? i was 
thinking about a bus covor but thats not gonna help the under carriage from 
driving in pretty bad weather conditions with the salty roads and such. if 
anybody lives in the new york area or anyone that knows something can can 
prevent this it would be a HUGE help!/ thanks alot
