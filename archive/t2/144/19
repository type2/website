Richard,

I don't have the ID of the hose, but the OD of the barb it fits on is 22mm
(~.87 in.)  OK,  my micrometer actually reports 22.14, but there is  bit
of rust.  *IF* (at that is a big one) you could find 21mm hose it would be
perfect.  20mm is probably the OEM spec and it woudl be a tight fit.
