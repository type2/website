Can't you get it above the upper engine access hatch to hear the alarm
while driving?  Ideally, get a mini-mini plug (maler and female), some
wiring (phone wireing is OK) and make an extension wire- I actually
soldered mine, ran it through the spare tire well in the closet, behind
the Westy cabinet, through the wall behind the driver seat, run it under
the rubber carpet of the seat-well, and then under the front mat to your
dash.  The other 2 phone wires I used for the electric vdo oil pressure
gauge.
