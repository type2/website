Subject: Bus-boys ball joints

Dear List,

I'm starting a full body transplant and the new body needs, among a hundred 
other things, all four ball joints replaced. I noticed bus-boys have ready 
to go joints and torsion arms pre-pressed.

211-498-101BX  Torsion Arm Set (4) Bus/Pickup 1970 to 1979  $174.95 set PLUS 
$50.00 Core Charge

Far less expensive than my outstanding local shop. Plus, I get to do the 
work. Has anyone used these and is this a good idea? Any thoughts? Is there 
another way without using a press? Heat maybe? Any thoughts appreciated.

Thank you,
Brandt
