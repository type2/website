About 20 years ago I remember reading that the Playmate of the month claimed the same thing
happened to her as she was fixing to go to the photo shoot.  The implication was that the
extra chest padding saved her life.  Personally, I hope if I'm ever too drunk to forget to put
the vehicle in neutral before crawling underneath someone will take the keys away from me
first.
