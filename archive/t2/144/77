Subject: shift lever springs(was tranny bushings etc.)

Dave W, Dave B, Steve D, and Bill H., See below for reference:

Okay, so the pin that points forward (f is f) of the shift lever ball should be about an inch/12 mm long...

Mine is obviously broken off.

There should be a spring (not the large conical one around the shift lever itself, that tensions the shift lever ball in a front to rear direction. Does this spring go in front of the shifter (around the pin) and against the inside front of the cup (pushing back), or behind the lever (pushing forward)? I assume forward since Dave(?) says the pin must remain forward, thru the slot in front of the cup.

Is this part available?

thanks everybody,

Billy (no spring in the 76 or the 79!)
