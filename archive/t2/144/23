Bill,

The tube is about an inch in diameter and about four feet long.  the
purpose of the grease is to lube the nylon "shuttlecock" bushings against
the walls of the tube.  A thin coating on the walls is all you want.  You
really wouldn't *want* to fill the tube and if you did, it would be easy
enough to shove it in from the end.  There is a price to pay for
over-greasing, tho...  Water trapped between the wall and the grease
cannot evaporate.  It just stays there and rusts the tube.

As the conversation continues on replacing the bushings, I think it
important to ask... you all *have* crawled under there and made sure there
is a tube for the bushings to ride in, right?  I have seen some of these
tubes in *very* sad shape, such that replacing the bushing is easy... it's
hanging out in the open with shreds of rusty tube hanging from it!
