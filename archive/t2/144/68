I just got off the phone with Ron at Old Volks. Great Guy. He took time =
to talk about my idle problem and I didn't even buy   the parts from =
him. Lots of good knowledge. He thought it must be a vacuum leak but =
alas even with plugging up the vac ports the idle was marginal at best. =
I even sprayed WD40 around the manifold, connectors and carb base =
without any change. Thanks Ron for your time and advice. Maybe the dual =
Kadrons are the way to go. Maybe a new passat is an even better way to =
go.=20
Frustrated,
Dave
