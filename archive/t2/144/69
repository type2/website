Hello all,
            At EB I saw a lot of people that had made a bed that layed
on top of the dashboard and hung off the seatbelt connectors for the
back.  As I plan on doing the camping thing a lot more, I would like to
make one of these.  Unfortunatley I was unable to get any pictures of
those that I saw at EB and am not sure exactly how to rig something like
this.  Any help?
