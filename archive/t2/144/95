Well, success has been marked on Troy's first electrical excursion.  :)
I got the radio to work.  Sorry to hinder the list with such small
problems.  Thanks again to Jason, and everyone else.  Good night.

Troy,
	Here is not what I have already done, but what I plan on doing.
Since there are several accessories I might like to add later I
started thinking that the way to do it is to buy an additional fuse
block. Mount it under the dash & run all accessories off it. I am not
sure if I will run a larger wire back to the engine or just take off
one unused terminal on my fuse block. But on my fuse block there was
one unused fuse/terminal. I used this to connect my CB & Radio. To get
to the terminals unhook the batter & then unscrew the 2 (i think)
screws holding the fuse block on the metal. There was one of mine
which had nothing comming off the top end. I used a spade connector to
get power +12v off this. & used the existing ground on the frame for
the ground side of my electronics. Hope this helps.
