I have a complete original.  I'm not interested in shipping it but I could
probably be pursuaded to sell it.  Not sure if the fridge works.  When I say
complete, I mean COMPLETE.  Even the battery charger.  Keeping the front
table.  I'm in southern AZ.  Most of the furniture has delamination issues.
If I were interested, I'd relaminate everything.
