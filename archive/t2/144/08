If it is a FI bus, one of the wires will be to activate the solenoid and
the other for the Fuel injection system, if they are reversed nothing
will happen.

Troy,
	If I recall, your solenoid has two spade connections. One on the
top & one on the bottom the larger of the two wires went to the top one
& the smaller went to the bottom. Did you ever pick up a VOM? This would
be handy to check if there is any juice going to these connections.
Since you have moved these wires some now, & even that seems to effect
when your bus starts, there could be a short in any of the wires that we
worked on. this could cause this problem. This is one area you really
need a VOM.
