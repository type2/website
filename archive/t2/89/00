Subject: Re: [T2] GA cops and buses

I got searched 3 times last year. None with my consent. Once in Maryland when I was broken down on the side of the road (state police). I was under the vehicle when the officer decided to do a "walk through". Once just south of Boston when I was broken down on the side of the road and GOT HIT while working on the engine. I was laying on the side of the road and 5 or 6 state police made fun of me (long hair, String Cheese Incident T-shirt and "hippie van"). While a couple went through the bus the others teased me about getting medicinal marijuana for my pain while I waited for an ambulance.  And once in Virginia at a secure job site because I didn't have their company pass on my dash. This time they didn't tell me about the search until several hours afterwards.  Cops are cops and will generally search when and where they wish and make up a plausable excuse later. I did refuse a search one time and was kept on the side of the road for almost an hour while they played good cop/bad cop with me. I was pulled over for an almost flat tire. I smelled of beer but passed the sobriety tests, as I was totally sober. Eventually the remaining cop forced my license at me and told me "to get the xxxx out of here" (Washington, DC). Don't think it is just Georgia.
