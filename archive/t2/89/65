There is no easy way to do this (and, for the most part, no way at all to
keep the message threaded correctly for the archives..a: our current
archives dont thread, b: you'd have to retain the message-id: header from
the original email, which is lost in the digest. some threaders will /try/
to add to the threads based on subject line alone, but this is by no means
perfect.  the message-id: would be the correct way to do it.

(wait. I see the Message-ID: IS included in the digests, at least in the
cases that the mailer that send the message included it). You'd need to
add the contents of this into the Message-ID: header of the new mail you
are sending...some MUAs make it easy with a few advanced config
settings..but with others it is impossible.  Feel free to try.

As for replying...you'll need to copy the subject line from the message
into your new subject line. be sure to add a Re: if one is not already
there.

Now, if you so choose, past the apropriate parts of the email you are
replying to into the body of your message...please only quote what is
needed to show context, and not the entire message!  Use some form of
formating to show seperating between your quoted sections and your new
message.

Enter your message.

now send that whole thing to type2(-at-)type2.com or vintagebus(-at-)type2.com,
depending on which digest you are replying to.

Or just hit reply, dont include the previous message, and enter your
reply...thats the most common form of reply.  Whatever you do DO NOT send
the entire digest contents back to the list. :)
