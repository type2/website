Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Windshield in Northern VA?


I live in Arlington, VA and have yet to find a decent FLAPS in the area. I
have been to a place in Jessup, MD called Crazy Rays they had 2 or 3 fairly
well picked vanagons, but I think they still had all glass. Crazy Rays is
also located in Baltimore on Erdman ave. They run a bring your own tools
joint. Absolutely the best prices I've ever seen, if they have you need.

I also know a guy on the eastern shore Dick Potter he has loads of bays,  a
few vanagons, and lots of aircooled stuff. I'm certain he would have the
glass but you have to go out there on a weekday as he is not open on
weekends. Try calling 410-827-6501 ask for Dick.

Volks,

Does anyone know any junkyards in northern Virginia that have a Vanagon
windshield?  Ran into a vanagon owner last night that needs one.
