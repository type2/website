Interesting about the hogs not attracting cops, since
my crotch rockets always have been a magnet. Got
pulled over doing a buck-twenty on my EX down on I-16
in South Georgia. Honestly, I thought the cop was
going to just shoot me and toss my body into the
swamp, as I had just moved here, still had Maine
plates on my bike and a Maine license, and let's just
say that my accent wasn't quite southern. 

I have to admit, this was the one good encounter with
southern cops I've had, as I was told that I better
not get caught further up the interstate doing any
more than 55, or I was going to get jailed for 120,
and sent on my way.
