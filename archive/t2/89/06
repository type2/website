Chris,

I used to live close to a fraternity house and they solved that problem
very easily.

They *always* notified the neighbors that they were going to have a
party and put flyers with their phone number in everyone's mail box.

The stated that if they were too loud to *please* call them and they would
handle it.  They told when the party would start and when it would
end...generally by 11pm.

I called them once in about 3 years and the effect was immediate.

"Good" neighbors are worth it...ya gotta live with them and it pays to
know who they are....

Now I live in the country and I call my neighbors to wish them a Merry
Christmas....they take care of me, and I take care of them.....even if
they are "old curmedgeons".....and they love my Vw's!!...and this is
Arkansas....If you don't have at least 3-4 dead cars on your property, you
ain't from around here<grin>.

Cheers, dave
