Going beyond the anecdotal testimony of those with law enforcement experience -- one has to wonder: what are the stats on accidents/fatalities caused by 
marijuana use?  I find plenty of people making claims, but little empirical evidence -- in fact some studies that do not support this widely held belief.  It might be more 
accurate to say that use of any impairing drugs, including legal prescriptions and over-the-counter stuff, is dangerous.  But I would really be surprised if many of the 
accidents mentioned were caused by people high on THC -- and nothing else.

Disclaimer: I'm not condoning driving under the influence of anything that impairs you -- including anger, fatigue, or quaaludes.  I do, however, recommend and 
encourage responsible and informed drug use, and wish more people would, as appropriate.  I've had some wonderful experiences with nicotine and alcohol in the 
right circumstances, for example.  And don't get me going about caffeine in the morning....

OBC: Well, duh.  Strangest bus pull-over incident I recall was back in '76, traveling with my parents and all five of us kids in a '71 bus on the Interstate in SC.  Cop 
pulled us over, he said, as witnesses that two semi's had just passed us while we were doing the speed limit.  Didn't get searched.
