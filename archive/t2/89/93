Subject: 2nd draft, '78 bus

I am reposting my story because i don't believe i stated it clearly enough and gave enough facts. Entirely my fault. I greatly value the input that is why i'm doing this again. 
I am 20 yrs old and I own a 1978 automatic vw transporter(bus). I bought it a few months back. The previous owner gave me paper work stating they had a used engine installed with a single ford carb. I've been informed by the mailing list that the original engine was fuel injected. Regardless it ran fine, started fine, took off fine and everything. One night driving home from work my van just cut off. I didn't hear any noises above the music i had playing. Then it would not turn over at all, totally unresponsive when the key was turned besides the power to the lights and cd player. So I had it towed to the VW place by where I live. The mechanic took a wrench and tried to turn the motor by hand. He told me the motor had seized. So I had the motor replaced. Just the motor. Now when I drive my van. I can't step on the gas and go. It has to warm up for a bit and even then the gas has to be pressed on with the touch of a feather. If you press on the gas too fast it will cut off, if warmed up then it stalls then ju
mps up to speed and still might cut off. when i do actually get it going, it drives fine and transmission shifts fine. when i get it started it will sit and idle ok. what would cause it to cut off when i try to put it in gear and press on the gas? the delay of acceleration?

Sorry it is so long.
