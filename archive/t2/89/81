Must throw in my similar story.....The only time I've been pulled over in my
bus was in late 1998 on the tail end of a 4500-mile road trip to Baja
California, Mexico, and back.  After a month on the road and all the trials
& tribulations of driving a bus (or any vehicle for that matter) all the way
down there, it seemed pretty funny -- after the fact, that is -- that I get
pulled over before 9AM about 15 miles south of Portland (my home at the
time) as I'm on the "last leg" of the trip and and nearly home.  The wind
was howling that particular November morning, and I was naturally all over
my lane on I-5 -- par for the course for a bus owner but obviously a big
deal for this state trooper, who was on me out of nowhere and had me over to
the shoulder in a jiffy -- probably licking his chops for an early-morning
DUII.  When he appeared at my window, it was obvious to me that this had to
have been his 1st or 2nd solo patrol, he was SO young; I think it was
obvious to him that I was totally sober and hadn't done anything wrong.  He
looked inside thru the window and then, he pulled out the "stickers" card --
told me it was a violation to have so many stickers on my rear window -- it
was obstructing my view -- and then took my license & registration back to
his cruiser for a futile Wants & Warrants check.  However weak his attempt
at finding a violation was, I remained friendly and patient and didn't ask
him to go into the finer points of the "Sticker Law" I was supposedly
violating.  This guy seemed so new on the force that I was positive he was
trying to write his first ticket or something.  Of course, he let me off
with only a warning.
