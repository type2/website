Well, she couldn't speak at all for about a week and couldn't remember
anything about the accident. It was a walkthrough and she must have gone to
retrieve something from the passenger compartment. There was no middle seat
so stepping out into the passenger compartment was like stepping onto a
dance floor. The bus probably lurched at just the right time and sent her
through the open slider while she had no handhold. Strange thing was that I
never even saw her leave the copilot's seat it happened so fast.
