A hole in a piston would cause combustion pressure inside the case.

No hole in a piston. Check the breather system  for blockage, remove the can
and soak in kerosesne, follow the hoses. There is a blocked case vent problem.
A bent hose will restrict case vent. Try it with the breather box off, no way will
pressure cause oil to exit the dipstick tube.

You are asking for trouble with engine flush, try a couple of oil changes using
a pint of Marvel Mystery oil for a couple of days before the change, clean the
screen and change the filter. Look for leaks at the valve cover gaskets and
push rod tube seals, oil cooler, etc.
