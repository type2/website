Subject: Re: 2 liter torque curve?

For anyone interested, I received an RPM/Torque/HP/Fuel Consumption graph
from Jake Raby for a nearly stock 2 liter FI engine. This is just what I was
looking for and if anyone else is interested they can pmail me (or Jake i
suppose ;) and I'll forward it to you.

Hello all,

Does anyone know where I can find an RPM vs Torque curve for a stock fuel
injected 2 liter engine?

Any help is appreciated. Couldn't find one in Bentley or Hanes.

TIA,
