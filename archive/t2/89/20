You know, I wouldn't mind if I got pulled over by a
cop trying to figure out what I was driving. At least
then I'd know I wasn't getting rousted for anything. 

I was pulled over at 3:00 AM for a tail-light out in
my bus. Normally, when pulled over in my other
vehicles for minor mechanical problems, I get told,
and then I go home. This time, I got searched,
ticketed, and nearly got my bus impounded. 

Understand, in no way do I look like a hippy. I live
in a suburb of Atlanta, have short hair, and was
dressed in khakis and a golf shirt, as I was coming
home from work.  I had not been drinking, didn't smell
like anything, and didn't give the cop any crap. I was
completely cooperative. 

So the only explanation I have is that it was the bus.
