Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap FI ECU/AFM replacement!

I'd like to point out again that this is a 'Do It Yourself' situation. No
one is selling assembled units. The user must assemble and install and
modify as need be for a certain application. The SW is complete and the
source/development tools are available on the MegaSquirt web site referenced
below. The only mod I plan on making to the SW for my application is to tune
for volumetric efficiency and to modify the accecleration enrichment code to
use changes in manifold pressure rather than throttle position changes (the
stock VW bus FI does not have a throttle position sensor and I don't plan on
cobbling one on).

I think it would be great to have enough aircooled folks using this setup so
that we can develop a certain level of support via this list. I really think
this is a good long term solution for many of the failing FI systems out
there.

I would be glad to provide support via email or this list to anyone who is
planning on jumping into this. Unfortunately the group-buy of kits just
closed. I'm sure another will hapen at some point - but for now the only
source for a PCB is kits via this group-buy - or to order your own PCB's
from board fabricator (the files for the board layout are also available via
the MegaSquirt web site).

If someone is really interested in getting one of the $100 unassembled kits,
they may be able to score one by monitoring the MegaSquirt yahoo group
(referenced below) and see if any one is dropping out of the group-buy or
will be selling theirs for some reason or another.
