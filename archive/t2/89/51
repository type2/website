Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap FI ECU/AFM replacement!

Ed,

That's what i like about this list....finding out about things like this
about the time I was going to start researching it anyway.

$150 doesn't sound too bad since a replacement ecu is around $100...I like
the idea that i can program it myself.  I started out(1976) in the
computer biz with Motorola hardware and still think it is some ofthe best.

A group buy in several months would interest me greatly!

Cheers, dave
