Subject: Cops and busses

Hello all,

I couldn't resist responding to this post.  Back when I was about 21 and my 
bus was five different shades of bondo and primer, I got searched with a 
friend of mine going through Canadian customs after camping in Maine.  We 
were grubby, the bus was a mess and we were crossing at a very remote 
location on the Maine border.  My friend also had a list of bars and clubs 
in Montreal to go to.  That did it. We were there 2 hours, questioned 
separately and had all our possessions gone through.  They found the mirror 
I used for putting in contact lenses particularly intriguing.  At one point 
the officer told me that if I didn't tell him where the drugs were and he 
found them my bus would become the property of the crown.  He might be 
inclined to be more lenient if I simply gave up the drugs.  I couldn't help 
imagining Her Majesty The Queen behind the wheel of my old bus, with all the 
stinky camping equipment piled in the back.  I thought it was funny at the 
time, but things could have been much worse.  I guess in a way we were 
asking for it.  Six years later, I drove across the US with 2 friends of 
mine.  The bus had a new coat of paint.  We kept the interior tidy and kept 
ourselves clean cut.  We were treated respectfully by both customs and the 
park rangers where we camped.  We were not stopped once on the road.  People 
were extremely friendly and always had questions about the bus.   The only 
exception was a Vanagon owner, of all people, who made some smart comment 
about hugging a tree when I brought my 73 Westy in for a valve job at a VW 
dealer in Flaggstaff, Arizona. We had camped overnight in the parking lot so 
our engine would be cold in the morning and I guess this was just too 
counter cultural for his taste.  Go figure....It is surprising how much 
people are influenced by appearances.
