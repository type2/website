i am in a similar spot - no downtime available to fix it right now...  try:


grease - will temporarily keep the throat free of water condensation and
ice  - VERY temporarily... a day or so. thanks to the vintagebus guys who
tipped me to that!! :)

i also have put some of that grey foam pipewrap around the throat... helped
a LITTLE. but not much. water still condenses on any exposed spot.

only thing to do is clean the heat riser!
