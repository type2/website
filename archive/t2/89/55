Subject: carb icing other =?iso-8859-1?q?solutions=3F?=

Hi. I know that the correct way to fix carb icing is to find a manifold with the heat riser tube open, have all the correct air cleaners and so on.
(This is a 1600 Single port with 009 and 30/31 carb)
I was wondering if there were any other solutions for someone who has no garage and wants a temporary solution until it's warm and dry enough to do it right. 
  One of my roommates and I were discussing using some of that heat-wire for a rear window defroster and wrapping that around the manifold below the carb where the ice is the worst. Any thoughts? Anyone who knows better who will stop me before I do something stupid? (I would insulate it electrically from the manifold) Any thoughts and assistance would be appreciated, as the weather now has been rainy and ~40 degrees for a while, and doesn't look like it's stopping any time soon.
thanks,
