I'll say that just about every pot smoker I've ever dealt with formally and 
informally has been the nicest and most laid back people I've ever met. 
Never, ever, ever had a problem with one. Just couldn't say any of them 
were really in any condition to operate anything faster than an armchair... 
<grin!>

Yes - would be interesting to see some stats like you mentioned above. I'd 
expect good numbers (fewer accidents) for those that toke vs. those that 
drink. Bet alcohol and fatigue are the leading causes of accidents.

I would much, much, MUCH rather deal with somebody that's been toking a bit 
much than some fellow that has been par-taking large doses of liquid 
courage! Met some mean mothers in that condition!

That said - I've always wondered why alcohol is okay but a bit of the other 
stuff isn't.... But I guess I'll leave that topic right there as this isn't 
the place for THAT discussion... <grin>
