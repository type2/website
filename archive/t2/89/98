the motor. Now when I drive my van. I can't step on the gas and go. It has to warm up for a bit and even then >the gas has to be

to speed and still might cut off. when i do actually get it going, it drives fine and transmission shifts fine. >when i get it

Let's identify what you have and work from there. Find the code letters from the engine # on the
engine case ( not on the fan housing ) along with the carb # and the dizzy #. ( mirror and a flashlite -it's on the base
of the distributor forward and not real easy to get to ). Is this something your mechanic can't resolve ? Why not?
Does the carb have a choke ? How cold is it where you are ? Is the basic engine in good mechanical condition ?
You might consider getting a Haynes manual and doing a little late-night reading. ( under the covers with the flashlite :).
