Subject: Re: [T2] Cops & Buses


It depends a lot on what area you're in, really. Buses are common in Salt 
Lake - as compared to anywhere else I've been, anyway. I've never been 
pulled over in mine. I've also never been pulled over in it anywhere in the 
shoreline area of CT, where I used to live, nor anywhere on i-95 between New 
Haven and Fredericton, New Brunswick. On the other hand, I've been pulled 
over dozens of times in Saabs and once in a borrowed cherry red Grand Am - 
and I've only driven that twice, total under two hours! One nice thing about 
these old crates - it's darn hard to be pulled over for speeding!

On the other hand, I've nearly been arrested for loitering on a park bench. 
Apparently the cop didn't appreciate being asked "why is the bench here if 
it can't be sat upon?"...

So, it really depends almost completely on where you are, not what you 
drive. The drug kids where I grew up drove Camaros and Firebirds, so those 
were the profiled cars. Southerners don't take well to us long-haired 
hippies (whether we have long hair or not), and small town cops are ready to 
pick on /anything/ with out-of-state plates.

It helps to keep your bus looking nice. I bet a rust heap bus will be pulled 
over ten times as often as a show-quality bus.
