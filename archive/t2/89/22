Subject: Re: [T2] '78 bus

Nathaniel,

First, my standard disclaimer... I know fuel injection better than I know
carbs by a fair shot.  It has been a while since I owned a carbuteted bus.

That said, Bruce has a very valid point that the single carb with the long
unheated intake runners is very subject to icing at temperattures from
the 60s down to freezing.  Other potential problems to look at are the
accelerator pump on your carb and your distributor advance.

When you step on the gas, the accelerator pump is supposed to inject a
shot of gas into the throat of the carb.  If it is blocked or otherwise
not functioning, you will get exactly the symptoms you describe.

If the advance mechanism on your distributor is not functioning this could
also cause the problem.  You need the spark to occur sooner as the engine
RPMs increase to get decent acceleration.  No advance will cause loggy
acceleration.

Lastly, when it was new your bus came with fuel injectionn.  All '78s in
the US did.  Fuel injection is very different from carbs, but in my
opinion it is a simpler system, more efficient, and more reliable *once
you learn it*!  Many mechanics don't want to learn it and resist and throw
a carb on at the first opportunity.  If you have an opportunity I would
look into retrofitting FI to the poor beast.  This probably is not
practical in the short run, but it is something to think of over time.
