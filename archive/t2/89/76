If you are still interested in the cops angle,
everyone's views on cops are well-documented in the
type2 archives from the past 8 million times
this thread has come up.
**************************************************

With all the talk about Cops and Busses I thought I
would give a new perspective on a cops view of VW's.
My wife and I have seven Split Window Busses and a 79
Westy. My wife's daily driver is a 62 Double Cab with
a personalized plates that simply read 'HIPPY'. The
point of the story is ...she is a cop! Think of the
grief she gets from the other officers when they see
the 62 Crew in the parking lot!!!  I think more then
once they have have gone out of their way to walk the
drug sniffing dog past her truck out in the parking
lot.
Neither of us have ever had a problem driving our
Busses....
