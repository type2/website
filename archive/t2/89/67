If it were a US model, with the original equipment, it would have a 1.8l
fuel injected type4.  Of course, it would also be left hand drive and
called a "Transporter" or "Station Wagon"....

I dont know what the NZ/AU models might have been....maybe you should let
us know when you find out. ~grin~  (..or ask the owner.  it's very
possible that whatever it came with originally is no longer there...)
