Hi,


Yes my wheels are balanced - 'twas the first thing I did when I 
bought the Bus - we have to take a yearly inspection here in 
Portugal, and that's one thing that really makes a difference for the 
examiners (though the one's that did mine kept giggling - go figure ;-
)!). By the way, my tires are recapped... I still haven't the =80's to buy=
 
new/decent ones... :-( But they are balanced alright!
For what I read it makes perfect sense to be faulty CV joints - I'll 
check them out this weekend - Many thanks for all your help!
I'll keep you guys informed!



Later,
