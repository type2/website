Subject: Switching from 4speed to Auto - what parts needed ?

my friend wants to change his 73 bus from the dead 4 speed to an 
Automatic......

there is a 73 crunched automatic at the junkyard....

what parts will he need?
 I know tranny and axles/CVs, 
plus torque converter / flexplate (actually he is going to switch out the 
complete engine/trans from the Auto bus
shifter and bigger brake pedal

anything else that you would not normally think about ?
