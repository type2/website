Subject: Re: [T2] synthetic vs. regular oil

I can't believe the crazy shit that people will believe.

This same type of superstition was circulated when detergent oils first
appeared.  Then it was repeated when milti-viscosity oils were introduced.
This crap about synthetics is the latest.

When I first started fixing cars, the 'pros' wre still using non-detergent
30 weight, since all their 'expertise' told them that those new-fangles
detergent mulit-vis olis were just an advertising scam.

Then the old hands told me that bias-ply tires were just as good as radials
if you inflated the bias-plys to 32 PSI.

Now those same 'experts' tell us that synthetic oils contain plastic.  I'm
sure that Columbus faced the same kinds of experts when he proposed finding
a shorter route to India by sailing west.

Once and for all, synthetics are far superior to natural oils.  Just don't
try to use their superior properties as an excuse to delay oil changes.
The true price comparison to make is not between synthetics and natural
oils, but between any kind of motor oil and the price of a new or rebuilt
engine.  That's why I use the best oil I can, and $3 or $4 per quart seems
pretty darn inexpensive to me.
