     Eugene, Oregon is actually a fairly VW friendly place.  In the warmer 
months I drive my Thing with the windshield down, stinger sing'n (really 
freaks the Jeep people) or when I had my single cab,it was safaris at full 
flaps pretty much all the time.  Not a second look from the local fuzz.  And 
usually when driving my Bay Window Camper, I see those pretty blue lights in 
my rear views, I slow down, pull over and wait from them to pass.  But I'll 
be damn it one night they stopped behind me.  I shut the bus down and went 
into "I don't wanna get shoot mode", (we'd had a small riot or two recently). 
 Anyway, you know hands on the steering wheel, no sudden moves, and the yes 
sir-no sir gig.  Turns out all it was, was a tail light out.  After all the 
computer checks, turns out I'm a model citizen.  I asked if I might take a 
look at the tail light.  We walk back to the back of the bus.  I tweaked the 
wires and of course it comes on.  The cop laughs at this, and tells me he had 
the same troubles with VWs he's owned in the past.  After B.Sing for another 
10 minutes about various VW stuff, we shake hands and boogie on my way.  I 
see him every now and then about town, always smiles and waves at me.      
Yep, Eugene is sure a VW friendly town. 
                                                                              
Peace,
