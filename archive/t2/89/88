Subject: Original VW Bus Keys

Hello Everyone,=20

    I recently inherited a rust 1977 Type 2 that was owned by my =
grandfather since December 13, 1978.  My bus spent the early part of its =
life as a grocery delivery van and was the last of as many as 20 =
different Splities and Bays.  Not suprisingly we found in my grandfather =
filing cabinet various keys. I have a series of apparently original VW =
keys from bus that are as far as I know long gone. Here are the numbers =
off the keys. =20

I have some more even older keys that I need to locate and look for =
numbers on.  Are my keys worth anything?  If interested just let me =
know. =20
