Richard,
The last set of valve covers I ordered from Bus Depot did not come with the
gaskets. I ordered them seperately. I see
you have a 78 and wanted to replace some of the exhaust. This is where  you
will have to make a decision to keep the
78 style exhaust or convert to the 72-74 style. Not all the 78 stuff is still
available. I have a 78 also and converted to the
72-74 boxes and muffler. I switched some tin also that another list member had
gotten me. I would take a good look at
what you have first though.  Here is a link to some steps on how to do it.
