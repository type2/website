Subject: FI vs Carb question 


A friend of mine just gave me his 2000cc FI engine from his 78.  He had =
taken his bus into the shop because it was running rough and not idling =
well.  The mechanic said (presumably after some investigation, probably =
not much though) that it had FI problems that would take at least $300 =
to fix, probably more, he also thought there was "something with a =
valve" and that it was running on 3 cylinders.  So he talks my friend =
into putting a 1600 type I in his bus for $850 (my friend is a newbie =
and has owned a VW only a few months.)  The mechanic also stated that he =
doesn't like to work on pancake engines.

So now I have this engine sitting on my shop floor, which is great, =
because my 1700 porsche motor (PO put it in) in my 79 has a broken crank =
(and no heat.)  After some investigation, it appears that my bus still =
has all of the FI components (ECU, fuel pump & reg, etc...) and if I'm =
missing something, my buddy probably still has it.  Looking at the =
engine, the FI system appears to be intact, so I doubt the mechanic even =
looked at it.  I also noticed that 1 of the plug wires was broken, not =
sure if this happened before or after the engine was removed (my friend =
says he didn't know about it.)  Everything looks stock on this motor, I =
doubt it's ever been rebuilt.

My tentative plan is to put new plug wires and possible points & rotor =
button in it and cram it in the bus and see if it works.  Is there any =
FI trouble-shootin/investigation I can/need to do before I install the =
engine?  Looking at the Bently manual, it appears that 90% of the =
trouble-shooting is electrical so I assume that means it needs to be =
installed to do that.  Did I mention that I've never owned an FI engine?

Also, if I go bald trying to get the FI to work, will my 2 barrel carb =
and intake from the 1700 (circa 1972-74) work OK on the 2000?  It seems =
that I read somewhere that the valves are different for FI vs carb. Of =
course I don't have lot's of $$ to go through a trial-and-error deal =
with the FI.

Thanks,

Rob

PS - I kept hearing (from multiple people) about this great VW mechanic =
named Darryl in Wilmington, NC, but I have yet to seek him out.  It =
turns out that this is the same guy that put a type I engine in my =
buddy's 78 bus.  Sorry for the long post.
