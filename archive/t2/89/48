Subject: ADMIN: Cops & Buses


Ah, you all knew the ride couldn't last.

So now that this thread has begun to turn away from Buses (and it frankly
wasn't about Buses anyway, was just a general cop-bashing thread) and
toward studies of marijuana use as a causative factor in auto accidents, I
think we can safely put this one to bed.

If you are still interested in the cops angle, everyone's views on cops
are well-documented in the type2 archives from the past 8 million times
this thread has come up.

So, that's the end of that one.  You guys already know about what happens
if you continue to post on it.

Thanks,
