Subject: off topic pot use post, or is it on topic when it comes to busses?

Living in the Arctic, where it is -43 today and my buss will not 
crank, no matter what I fix.

I have found that the police have more trouble with booze than with 
potheads.

The result. I think they like people who smoke pot because they 
don't get wild and end up waking them up in the middle of the night 
to go clean up the blood and dump the wild one in the tank. This 
counts for people of all creeds up here.

Pot, on the on the other hand makes people go to sleep, they like 
that. So they only make a fuss when things get real uncomfortable, 
like when someone tries to haul a hockey bag full of the stuff into 
the community.

I am talking about places like Rae Edzo and Rankin Inlet, Goja 
Haven and the such. 

Cheers,
