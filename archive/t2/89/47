Subject: cops in the Pacific Northwest


Well, i gotta speak up here. As a west coaster (Or, CA, WA) for the last 15 
years, i have been pulled over in my bus for (1) obstructed rear window, 
which had a *few* stickers on it. In this case, the officer seemed to really 
want to shine a light in the back of my deadhead painted 71 and see if i had 
something illegal, which i didn't. (2) i was pulled over in the same bus 3 
times in 2 weeks for a taillight problem, which was a PITA to fix. (3) i was 
pulled over and ticketed in downtown SF for an illegal u-turn at 4 in the 
morning, but i was the only car within miles. so, out of all those 1 ticket 
isn't too bad. maybe if we keep the busses on the road as much as possible 
we can continue to appear as "another old car" in the policeman psyche.
  On the other hand, me and two buddies were pushing the '65 kombi down a 
main street in Vancouver WA and a policeman drove up behind us, turned on 
his lights, and provided an obstacle to cars coming up behind us till we 
cleared the corner - and we had no title, registration, insurance or 
anything on that bus, he never even stopped!  Lastly, my brother in law got 
a ticket last week in his 59 panel for speeding.. he was very proud that the 
cop thought such a thing was possible!
okay, enough random recollections
-jeremy
