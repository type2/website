My brother (he's a jerk) tried to become a Maryland State trooper. During
the classes he was taking, the trooper who was teaching the class stated:

"Sure, we pull over black people in fancy cars with out of state tags.
Just like we pull over people in VW buses. out of 10 times they have drugs
on them"

So yeah, take it for what it's worth.

I for one, when pulled over *NEVER* consent to a search. Period. Not
because they'd find anything illegal (they wouldn't) but i figure if
they're gonna take time out of my day to be a bunch of jerks, i'm gonna
use up their time as well.
