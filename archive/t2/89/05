Subject: Re: [T2] Cops and Busses

Hello all,
 I thought I would chime in on this issue. Of course I am gonna be the one
to go against the grain and say that the best thing to do is cooperate
completely with the cops in the South East.  I grew up in the Carolinas both
in the City and the way out Rednecksville.  I have long hair and drive a
bus, I am not a hippy but have been accused of such and really don't care,
nor am I a good ol boy. If you give the cops a reason to get pissed off at
you they WILL and CAN do unfortunate things regardless of its legality. I
knew cops that plant drugs on people so they can make a quota, or just for
the hell of it.  "You don't have any drugs??? then what's this??"  I'm not
trying to be a prick but you folks from the city or the north or where ever
else need to wake up to the fact that allot of southern cops don't care
about your rights, Who is the judge gonna believe ? some outsider in a VW
bus or his brother in law who is the cop who arrested you?    I have been
pulled over many times and never been more 20 minutes, I answer every
question with YES SIR ,NO SIR.  20 minutes may seem like a long time but it
beats a night in jail and a court date.

Later --Bryan
