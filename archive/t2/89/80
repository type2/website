Subject: synthetic vs. regular oil

hello all, 

just a quick question.

i have always believed that synthetic oil was better
than regular stuff. then the other day someone told me
that synthetic oil is WORSE because over time a
plastic laquer will build up in your engine from the
plastic in the synthetic oil. whats the real story?
thanks in advance.
