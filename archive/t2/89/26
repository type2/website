Subject: Re: [T2] Cops & Buses


I have to chime in here. My wife and I drive our 78 Camper in the summer to
Bluegrass festivals and formerly to dead shows. We could count on being
stopped at least once by police for little to no reason on each trip. One
show in NJ we got stopped 3 times, the last time because our license plate
light was out, but strangely enough it was working fine at the campground.
This really pisses my wife off, but we have the system down. Engine off,
hazards on, interior lights on, license, registration and insurance card
ready. If that isn't good enough, ie the cop seems a little aggresive, ask
for directions. That seems to change the subject and once he helps you and
you thank him the whole footing of the situation seems to change.

However, as our campers appearance improved, new paint job, etc the stops
have become less frequent. Or maybe the computers are better, now the
police come up on us going 80MPH, slow down and pace us for a few minutes,
and then haul out of there, we passed the test :-)

The worst stop we ever had was in our Ford Escort wagon, we got pulled over
by a local deep in the Adirondacks for a bad headlight, the day before
Thanksgiving at about 9PM. Both our kids woke up and started screaming, the
guy seemed to drag it out and gave us a defective equipment slip. He said
it had to be fixed in 48 hours,and a receipt postmarked by then or we would
get a $72 fine. I mentioned that tommorrow was Thanksgiving, would Monday
be OK and he replied "You better get it done on Friday and get it in the
mail or you'll get the ticket".
