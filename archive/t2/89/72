Yeah - its quasi-legal, but just not smart.

I drove my 74 with the slider and rear hatch open for a few days a couple=

summers ago. I had coated the cargo bay with asphalt-based roofing tar an=
d was
airing it out.
Even with both doors open, i still picked up exhaust fumes...or was that =
the
tar? BTW, it did stop stinking and does a good job of sound dampening...
