Subject: How To Reply To Digest Version Messages

I receive the DIGEST VERSION (multiple messages 
included in single email message) instead of the 
individual postings.

Question:  How do you reply to a certain message 
within the Digest Version post?  I would like to be 
sure I am responding to the correct message and to 
also keep the thread accurate for the archives 
(whever they are...haven't figured that one out either.)

Thanks.
Jack
