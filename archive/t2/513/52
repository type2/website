That's a big savings for you already.

How is he planning to deal with it?

The problem is that every job is different and the hourly shop rates vary greatly from state to state. My only advice is whatever he quotes you to double it in your head before commiting your bus to that particular shop. Once they start finding hidden rust and other stuff to fix you're pretty much commited to finish the job properly.

What you can compare is the number of hours they estimate to do the work but depending on how many staff work on it at once it's hard to compare one shop's quote to another so keep that in mind. Ask them. If they quote you less than 100 hours they probably haven't itemized the work properly. My guess is 150 hours to do the inside and outside.

Doing the inside raises the cost quite a bit: double the time to prep/paint/etc...
