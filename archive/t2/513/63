Note how long the original lasted before it was stressed to failure by poor 
connections somewhere??

Can anyone comment on a Wells unit with a long life?? I know I and many 
others can comment on short life from such designed to be cheaper parts. 
Beware, because NAPA sells "NASCAR" heavy duty points for these Bosch 
dizzies that cost $9.95. The hinge pin must be worked with a file to fit 
the hole in the plate, then the frame hits the dizzy housing, so it must be 
worked down to clear. The stock Bosch points cost $1.95 and fit perfect 
every time.

You can pay less for junk or you can pay more for junk. In the long run, 
stock will save a bunch of time/money no matter the cost. In fact, only 
stock parts can rule out all together risk of throwing extra time/money at 
poor function or longevity.
