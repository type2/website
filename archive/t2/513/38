Never put gas-a-just on the front of a bus especially if you wear dentures.

The oil filled boges are indeed smooth, the kyb gr2/front gas-a-just/rear
combo gives you slightly better handling at the expense of a rougher ride.

I don't feel like spending $115 to find out but I suspect that the best
setup for a bus are Boges with sway bars to get the best of both worlds.
