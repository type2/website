In desperation I will do my own studs and have the stuff to fix or
overbore them, but like you, when you have someone who can do them for
you at a reasonable cost, it's just not worth doing it yourself for
maybe a one time thing.

Anyway, I dropped the engine off this morning. They
call me about 4:00 pm saying that it is done and ready
to go.  The guy drilled out the old broken studs (even
removed the 2 I did not break off) re-tapped the
threads and installed new studs with anti-seize.  I
was very nervous when i went to the cashier for my
bill.  The grand total:  $25 plus tax!  I couldn't
believe it was so cheap. They have earned all of my
business from this day forward!
Kudos to Automotive Parts & Service in Wilmington Ohio!!
