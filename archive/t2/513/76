Can't tell you how many times I have seen original Bosch regulators 
function nominal at 20+ years. Again, can anyone testify to an aftermarket 
cheap item with that kind of reliability/durability??

Indeed, half of them may last 20 years. Can anyone testify to a SINGLE ONE 
lasting 10 years?????

If it's an original new part there is no risk at all of a new part being 
non-functional. Again, if you want no risk of lost time/money due to short 
life problems, that's what stock is for. Least possible waste of time/money.

OK, we have verified 1/4 the expected life of OEM.

Very true, there are lots of parts that are not OEM with the Bosch name and 
logo. OEM is what was on your Bus when purchased new. These were German 
manufacture typically if not exclusively. These are the one's I still see 
from time to time function nominal at over 20 years/200,000 miles of use. 
Can't tell you how many times I have replaced aftermarket junk (including 
some/most of the Mexican and Brazilian crap) that had no more than a few 
years dust on them. They simply are not manufactured to OEM specs.

Well, 90% of the time I replace a battery or OEM alternator or starter, 
poor connections were showing obvious heat stresses.  The rest of the cases 
have to do with other issues, like 20 years of flawless service or motor 
won't start, so lots of cranking, battery charging, jumping and fussing 
about is magnitudes more stress than the system has seen in a long time. 
Many weaknesses can be put past the limit of proper response.

Perhaps, but when someone suggests that $20 for junk is a better idea than 
$24 of junk, either of which leave open the door to short term failure, I 
just have to advise the problems eliminated by spending nothing at all on 
junk to ensure superior cost/per mile results offered by OEM parts is a big 
load of money saved for the actual results given by OEM durability.

The wonderful thing about the earlier mechanical regulators is they can be 
refurbished and readjusted at the side of the road, if you know how. Add 
another 10 year's of life in a single service inspection. But the 
alternator brush/regulator combo's can be expected to have no problems if 
maintained reasonably (no false stresses from inadequate maintenance) right 
up to the point that the brushes wear and loose pressure. By that time, the 
bearings and diodes are due for replacement. Rarely will time/money be 
saved by not replacing the alternator and regulator with a genuine Bosch 
ReMan/NewMan unit.

And I will point out that just because David wants to give a viewpoint 
differing from my own, I consider his advise no less viable than my own. In 
fact, I tend to watch for and open Davids comments because he is 
consistently rational, though like the rest of us, not yet perfect. I know 
as well, the short term cheapest up front out of pocket purported solution 
is always easier to sell, as it is sold to either the ignorant or greedy 
and sold by charlatans via testimonials and claims only.
