It's a Potts-approved full poptop weld-on
procedure, done by a VW shop in Tucson, Uncle
Bob's http://www.vwsbyunclebob.com/ .  The entire
top, including headliner, from the westy was
transplanted.  So, yes, the top bed is there. 
Everything seems to work fine.  

I really wanted the 74 style full width bed.  I
also thought I might widen this 76ish bed, but it
is a very nice arrangment.  I've never paid much
attention to late westies because I have no use
for a four seat bus.  This one has the rear
closet and a little icebox just to the left of
the zbed.  I assume the sink and maybe a frig
used to be just behind the driver seat in this
arrangment.  Of course the sink/frig cabinetry
was removed for one of my two jumpseats.  

Overall though, the 76ish zbed is really a decent
compromise.  I will definitely put the fullwidth
bed thing on the back burner, unless I find a
74-75 for the right price.
