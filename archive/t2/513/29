Subject: Broken exhaust stud !##$%(-at-)^#&

AAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!  I broke 2 friggin exhaust
studs on my 1600 DP engine last night. I had been
soaking them for in penetrating oil for 2 days, heated
them up, and even tried the melted wax trick. But when
I put the socket on the nut and turned it, SNAP!! I
broke 2 of the 4.  There is still about a quarter inch
of stud sticking out of the head, so I put a vice grip
on it to try to turn it, but it wasn't budging. So I
stopped right there for fear of breaking it off even
further down and flush with the head. 
Soooooo, anyone have any special tricks other than the
ones I mentioned for removing these stupid things???
