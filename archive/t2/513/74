Subject: I gotta share this - Broken exhaust stud follow up

Thanks to everyone for all the great advice for
removing my broken exhaust studs yesterday.  Despite
all the good tips, I still ended up breaking off 2 of
the 4 flush with the head.
Now my friends will tell you that I am a cheap S.O.B.,
and it physically hurts me any time I have to pay
another person to do something for me, especially on
one of my old VW's. But I decided to bite the bullet
this one time and take the engine to a local
machine\auto repair shop called Automotive Parts &
Service in Wilmington Ohio. I didn't feel up to the
task of drilling out the broekn studs, and re-tapping,
etc.
Anyway, I dropped the engine off this morning. They
call me about 4:00 pm saying that it is done and ready
to go.  The guy drilled out the old broken studs (even
removed the 2 I did not break off) re-tapped the
threads and installed new studs with anti-seize.  I
was very nervous when i went to the cashier for my
bill.  The grand total:  $25 plus tax!  I couldn't
believe it was so cheap. They have earned all of my
business from this day forward!
Kudos to Automotive Parts & Service in Wilmington Ohio!!
