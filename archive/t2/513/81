Subject: vanagon fuel pump?

I have a friend who has an air-cooled Westy Vanagon.  It has been acting up
on and finally wont start and is stranded in his driveway.  Apparently it
will start for a few moments with a squirt of gas in the intake but that's
it.  I immediately thought "fuel pump" and had him crank it over.  If I hold
the air flow flap open while it is cranked I hear two clicks, one after the
starter stops and the other after I release the flap, which I assume is the
double relay doing it's thing, but there is no fuel pump noise.  I wasn't
wearing the appropriate clothes to crawl under the bus to look at the fuel
pump connections but it appeared to be in a different location from the one
in my bay's anyhow.  Did I test the fuel pump properly?  This bus has had
recent professional engine and transmission overhauls but he's getting
frustrated with the reliability bus.  Apparently the new overhauled
automatic is slipping a bit as well but he can't get it to the tranny shop
since it's now stranded in his driveway.
