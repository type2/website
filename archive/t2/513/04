Here are a couple of good sources of info:

You can give the paint code (e.g. L90D) to painters and auto paint shops and they can mix the paint up for you by formula. Depending on the paint system you choose there may not be a formula for a particular paint code. For example I couldn't find L90D in PPG DBC Deltron 2000 but I did find it in L90D Omni. Since I wanted deltron so looked for another color instead that was similar and discovered I like LR9A better than the original color.

The giant paint companies (PPG, BASF, etc) use slightly different component colors so the formulas vary (how much ocre, how much black, etc).
