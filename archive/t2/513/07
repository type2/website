BD was selling a Pierburg pump (GFP301) at one time but since Bosch is available for the same price you know what I'd get. You can beat the realiability of a new pump. I'd rather hit the junkyard and take my chances than go with rebuilt with the prices so close.

A junkyard pump FI costs $5-10. There are two kinds to look out for:

0 580 463 016 is the original pump and slightly longer than the older 0 580 463 010 pump I've see installed. The 016 pump has a screen inside the intake as a backup for the filter and the 010 pump doesn't.
