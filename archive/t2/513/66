Subject: [T2] One more Broken exhaust stud !##$%(-at-)^#& question

volks
ive got one last scenario for you all to analyze. the stud recessid into
the cylinder head stud that mounts on the exhaust manifold seems to be
quite difficult to deal with. if i damaged the stud while i was removing a
stripped out nut with a drill, can i still use the remainig viable thread
on the old stud to mount the manifold? most of the thread is there, but i
accidentillay drilled some off while getting the nut off.
thanks
