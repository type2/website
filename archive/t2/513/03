Subject: Fuel pump question

Something about my luck... :-)

I had to move the Bus this morning for street cleaning, and had it 
stall out on me a couple of times coasting up to stop signs.  It also 
hesitated on me a few times (once going up a hill, eek).

It sounded like it was idling a little low, so I hooked up the Sunpro 
to take a look.  Sure enough, it was at ~800, even though I had 
recently adjusted it up to ~950.  Double-checked all vacuum connections 
(all were OK and hoses are brand-new), and backed off the idle air 
screw.  Couldn't get it to idle any higher than 850.

The hesitation made me think "fuel filter" (I don't know how many miles 
my current one has on it, so I should replace it anyway).  But then I 
noticed that I could hear the fuel pump running quite loudly while 
sitting in the driver seat.

I'm going to replace the filter and then do a pressure check, but I 
won't be able to get to that for a couple of days.  What I'd like to 
know from the list is if it is normal to be able to hear the fuel pump 
running so clearly from the cockpit.

Sigh, I wonder if I should just replace the darn fuel pump for good 
measure...

Oh well, at least I have a good excuse for having ordered a pair of 
those nifty fuel line clamps :-)
