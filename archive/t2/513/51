such a job.
The bus will be painted inside and out one color: Dove Blue.

You're right, there's no way to evaluate the job...I would price it around,
and get a written description of what each shop will be doing, and with
what. The paint pros on the list could give you recommendations of what
to ask for...The range in price will be astounding...From a Maaco $200
(or less on sale) up to $$$$...The difference will be in prep...Will the
crease be bumped out or just bondo'd...And in materials...Any sanding
between coats, cleaning, etc. are all items to delineate before you de-
cide on a shop...Another factor to consider...Can you leave the Bus for
a while? Most shops make their money on insurance jobs that are on a
schedule so leaving the Bus for when the shop is slow could save some 
money...Altho' that could have its downside if the shop gets busy and
your Bus sits around for weeks or months...;-(
