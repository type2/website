Subject: poptop mechanism

Are there any pictures of poptop mechanisms on the net?

I don't know the brand of my poptop, it looks similar
to a Devon but it's not exactly the same (judging from
the pictures I have seen). The lifting mechanism is 
gone and the previous owner replaced it for a couple 
of pneumatic lifters that don't quite do the job. I 
could not find any supplier with suitable parts on the
net so any pictures or drawings would be very helpful
so a metal worker can build the parts for it.

I'm also planning to fit a bed platform and canvas on 
the top but that's an easy job for any talented wood 
worker.

P.S. thank you all for the good info on paint colours
