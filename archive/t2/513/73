Stressed by poor connections?  How did you determine that?  I would argue 
that mine failed years ago by not putting out spec voltage.  The fact that 
it didn't *completely* fail is irrelevent.

Mine has been in service for a few years now.  Next question?

*yawn*
I thought we were talking about regulators, so I'm going to ignore your 
rant-du-jour.

To that I will simply quote what I wrote previously.  My feelings haven't 
changed.

Of course, if you'd rather pay $100 for a NOS Bosch mechanical regulator so 
you can experience this joy all over again a few years from now, be my 
guest.  You can be content knowing that you applied DM (Dumme Methode) and 
are somehow superior because of it, even though your bus won't start.  :)
