Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

Hi Volks,

There are other alternatives that will work just as well if you're on a 
budget and willing to put a it of extra time into the search.

We broke a fuel pump on the way to EveryBus, in the middle of nowhere 
someplace in upstate NY (About 10 miles north of Bath). We went to the 
first two FLAPS we could find, but there was no way to get a 
Jen-you-whine-vee-dub-ya pump in less than two days, or for less than 
$200. Luckily, the second FLAPS has a sympathetic older gentleman 
behind the counter who knew how to read the BIG BOOK.

Note: if your local FLAPS has a person like this, they are your 
salvation, and should be worshipped accordingly. Bring them coffee, 
donuts, or sacrifice whatever beasts he or she  wouldst deem 
appropriate. Because once this person retires, your next "sales 
associate" will probably only be able to read you the chinese 
translation off the back of the blister pack.

Anyway, I was able to convince the gentleman to cross-reference the 
fuel flow and pressure ratings with those of other pumps for domestic 
vehicles. Somewhere in the archives is the exact data, but if you look 
for late-80's Ford pickups you will be pretty close. We were able to 
find a suitable pump (with matching filter) and the hardware to mount 
it for about $110. And we were back on the road within the hour.

Happy trails,
