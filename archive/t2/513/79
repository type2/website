The BD regulators are shiny new Bosch made in Brazil units. At least they were when I ordered one two years ago. Two years and running, woo hoo! :-)

The parts numbers are:

55A - 0 190 600 016 (long) 30048 (short)
70A - 0 190 601 006 (long) 30051 (short)

I replaced the original after 24 years (sitting idle for many but a lot of contact with weak batteries). It had gone wonky on me and was causing the headlight to pulse when I rev'd the motor.
