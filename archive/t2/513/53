I have Gas-A-Just on all four corners and I don't think it is that 
harsh.  When I get behind the wheel of my bus after driving the Mustang, 
the bus feels like a Cadillac.  I can take speed bumps at 20mph with no 
drama and it is very smooth on the highway.  I suspect tires are also a big 
factor, and I have relatively plush tires on it at the moment (although 
they are over 1515 and LR-C, not to worry George!).
