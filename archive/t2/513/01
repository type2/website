Subject: VW weekend wrap-up (longish)

Gang,

This weekend I spent Saturday doing front brake work, installing new ignition components on my 019 distributor and installing a new front coupler on my shift rods on my '65 bus w/ 1600 SP.
Timing and valves done too.

Replaced my front/driver wheel cylinders as they were leaking massively. Found this out while I was replacing the master cylinder last week because it was leaking massively. I left the passenger wheel cylinders alone, but replaced the front hoses on both sides.

Remember when you install new wheel cylinders to check the bleeder valves to see if they're open!
I forgot untill I got to the front/driver and had a puddle on the ground. Damn!

Sourced all parts from www.busboys.cc

After the brakes were done, what's this?

Guy two doors down is grinding the rusty floor of a '68 project, spraying rusted floorchunks all over the sidewalk/yardsale going on at his tri-plex.

You have to admire that kind of spunk.

I went and introduced myself. He's just out of the military and living with inlaws, first bus for basic cheap transportation.

I brought him over and showed him my fleet and talked about whether or not the cans screwed to the side of his bay at the engine compartment are "stock" or not.
It's gonna take some work with this one, but I think I can steer him in the right direction.

Back on my bus. Man! Tune up parts for an old distributor are getting expensive. It probably cost me $35 for a cap, rotor, points, condensor for this 019 that dates to the very earliest bugs/buses.

Electronic ignition for sure eventually.

Bus is running with a new zest for life now with those ignition components. Set points, set valves, set timing statically. Valves were just a little loose where they were not spot on, so that's better than being tight, right?. Set all back to .006".

Have dwell meter and timing gun, but didn't get to using them this weekend. Trying to get on the road after much downtime since buying this bus.

After installing the new front shift coupler (the only part in the transmission system I hadn't changed yet!) The bus is really shifting dependably.

My wife/friends have really given me a workout over the downtime/cost of getting this bus roadworthy, so I needed this ventilation.

Only you understand,

Billy
