Karl is a pro, and certainly should have the proper tools for even the
infrequent jobs.  The rest of us do the big nuts by dividing the torque
spec by our weight, multiplying the result by 12, measuring that distance
along the breaker bar handle in inches, and standing on the mark.  My
breaker bar has a permanent mark at the proper place, a great reason to
keep in shape!
