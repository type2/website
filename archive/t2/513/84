Anyone heard of this? Would it be hard to do and make it look fairly 
correct?     Im also open to peoples thoughts on how this is just another 
cutting up of buses etc. I would be doing it on a ratty 64 standard just FYI 
for those who might fear I would cut up an original or early bus.

Dear Rob,

Oh how I have heard this over and over in my head even as I am working on 
other VW's, taking a shower, brushing teeth, sitting in my ride waiting for 
that police officer to bring me that ticket he is writing, toilet, bed, 
meals, etc, etc, etc. All that know what i mean are probably thinking of 
some project they have laying around as they read this. That being said.....

1. "fliptop"?  Dormobile? or Typical Westy, early or late?
2. I have a dormer top that i have have been holding onto for a while from a 
'71 have been dreaming of slapping it on a '66. If this is the top of wich 
you speak it fits my '66. and with some patients and prcision it can be 
done. To speak of the typical westy tops... i can't.
3. If you are going to proceed, it has been done just remeber to reinforce 
the roof. I believe that others may have more experience and can help more. 
Me, I can only tell you what I have heard. But i have seen a guy that did 
this with the westy top on a splitty, maybe from Arizona.
4. Speaking of this possible Arizona ride, this guy even took the luggage 
rack an customized it for a better fit. Westy tops are more square i think i 
can't say for sure. You might try asking some of the guys over at the (T2) 
site if the top you are speaking of is a bay window westy.

Anyway good luck and have fun.
