Hello All,
I am in the process of ordering some Boge shocks for the 78 Westfalia.  Does
anyone have any compelling reasons why I would want to order the KYB has
adjust??
It seems to me I have read posts where the gas adjust didn't bolt up right or
were too short or something.

Also, part number 411813225....Engine compartment seal, is this the foam
engine tin seal????

Thank you in advance.


Kind Regards,
