Subject: Re: [T2] Broken exhaust stud !##$%(-at-)^#&

Hello John   Well you have learned a leason   It is far better to cut the nut 
than break a stud. I use a real sharp chisel and cut the nut  in half hitting 
it on the face of the nut when possible. Now that it is broke try heat and 
vise grips, Worse then try the backwards drill bits being sure to grind the 
remain part of the stub flat and use a center punch to get the bit started in the 
center, use small bit first then increase the size of the drill bit.  I use 
Timeserts(tm)  to repair these broken studs. The main thing is to take your time 
and get the hole drilled correctly  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
