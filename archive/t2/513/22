There's no one torque wrench you can get to do it all. Some of the larger values include:

- flywheel bolts 80 ft. lbs.
- wheel bolts 94 ft. lbs.
- caliper bolts 116 ft. lbs.

Cover those and you'll find you can't accurately torque the smaller items with the same wrench. Or vice versa. There are too many brand and too few good ones I suspect...
