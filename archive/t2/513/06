Yah, "grinding" or "rattling" would be a way to describe the noise.

Oh well, guess I'll order a new one.  Bus Depot seems to have a really 
good price on a new Bosch unit (part # 0580463016) for $150.

Bus Boys also has a rebuilt unit (part # 251-906-091X) for $128 + $40 
core.

Anyone have opinions on either of those options?
