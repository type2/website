I'm not sure if it was me or not, but a while ago I did post my 
procedure to retrofit Vanagon belts I scored in a junk yard into my '76 
Westy.  One of the spools was mounted on the bulkhead behind the 
driver's seat (there is no bulkhead behind the passenger seat on the 
76-79 because the seat rotates).

My procedure can be found here:

If you have any questions you think I can answer, feel free to pmail me.
