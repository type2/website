Subject: Body Panel Compatability (71-78)

Volks,

I need to replace the passenger rear quarter panel on my 78
Westy.  My body guy has found a 71 with a clean (no rust) panel.
Will it swap?  Are there any differences, i.e. air vent, gas
filler, etc.?  Also, the panel will have to include the
corner/back to a vertical line just before the engine and back
hatches.  The topmost horizontal cut will be just below the
sliding door rail.

Please let me know - I'm getting desperate!

Cheers,

Justin L. Smith
