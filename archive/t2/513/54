T4 oil pick-up is different from T1. The screen cover is held with
a single center nut, and the pick-up is suspended with a  bolt
through the case halves. There is risk of breaking the case web
from overtorquing the cover fastener, and another from stripping
the threads in the case when overtorquing the pick-up mounting
fastener, or galling the case threads when removing one.
