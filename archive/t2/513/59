Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching oil pickup in a 1600cc engine

Hello Guys   On the type 2/4 motor the oil pick-up is a very weak point and a 
bad design . What happens is that the screen plate starts to leak and people 
will tighten the nut which will break the case inside where the bolt holds the 
top of the pick-up tube.Correct fix is to tear motor down and either replace 
the case or have it welded. I have used timeserts to repair this problem also. 
 Cheap on the road fix is to get a little longer bolt ,coat the threads with 
JB weld, put sealant on the shaft of the bolt reinstall the bolt, let set up, 
reinstall the screen using sealant and don't touch again. At least the type 
2/4 motor does have an oil filter so the screen can be left alone.  Later and 
have fun  Mark dearing  salem Import Service  Salem va
