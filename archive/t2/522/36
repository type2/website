I am trying to find my color match for "el Verde", green obviously. L 63 H 
Taiga. I am just double checking with the folks who know this color. Sage 
Green? Anyone have experience with mail order paint ie Paint Scratch? Close, 
different tint, perfect? Suggestions are very welcome. Also this is a 
November '76 production, '77 model Westy Deluxe.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe AT "el Verde"
