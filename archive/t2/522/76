Subject: bus instrumentation

I was looking over a site that was sent to me..
http://www.supervwmag.com/vwus/type2bay_window/bay_window.html
an under instrumentation it sez no bus ever came with
a
Tach. ??? huh ?? When I bought my bus (not from the
dealer) it had a tach in the hole to the right of the
speedo.. now up till now I assumed it came with the
bus new as it just..... fits so well..
 Reader's digest version.. did a bay window bus come
with
a factory installed tach. as an option?
