Subject: Push starting my Van does not work...

Dear type2,

I have been having a periodic problem for over a month now.  One consistent
data point is that when my Van won't start after a day of good driving, when
I try to push start her the engine will not fire.

If we assume that the iginition and FI is fine (safe assumption cause she
starts up and runs fine the next day) THEN what is an obvious conclusion?

I have a brand new coil, fuel filter and fuel pump installed.

What would cause her to not start given a push start?

The distributor is old and carbon tracks build up quick but I don't suspect
that this problem is related to weak sparks because once she starts again
she runs strongly.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Chris Walker
