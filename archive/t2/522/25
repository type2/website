'Driveability' is kind of a subjective term. To me, it also includes
reliability. When I changed over from vacuum to centrifugal, I threw away a
handful of components and have not had a distributor-related problem since in
over 10 years of use. This list receives posts on a fairly regular basis
concerning vacuum related problems of one sort or another but I can't recall
ever seeing a post concerning a failed 009.
I guess it depends on what a bus is being used for. I bought mine mainly for
travelling. I use it on extended trips to Alaska and Mexico whenever I get the
chance and reliability is one of the top considerations. If I used it for a
daily driver in an urban area, I might feel differently and want to consider a
vacuum unit.
