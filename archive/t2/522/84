Bus Boys and other sell a ring to mount a VPO tach in. I think it's the
3 3/8 or 3 3/18" size. Doubt it's stock, thats where the clock goes.. :)

---> Looks great. Did to my Bus. Even took the tach appart and painted the needle white to match the speedo. Almost looks stock. I'm a very happy camper...
