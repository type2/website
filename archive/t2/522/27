Subject: 71 bus body part replacements

HEY all.................71 bus here
first ill try to explain my question as well as i can
as to not confuse.......because I AM hehee
OK I have to replace the dog legs on each side and
have PLENTY of doner busses for parts......the floor
pan also........my question is in the wheel well under
each seat where there is sort of a shape inward curve,
that is rusted through.....i assume this is
typical.....and also the support beam that runs across
is shot there too.........how would YOU GUYS go about
fixing it. I had planned was to get a doner support
beam and cut to size and weld in.....then cut out the
pieces that have the curve..........is this for foot
rests or something?......under each in the wheel well
and weld those in place..........would that be proper
or should i tear up the floor replace the entire
support beam..........the full backs of the seats that
all that is connected to and then slap on the dog
legs.......I want a nice job is my main end
result...but how would you guys replace that stuff?
