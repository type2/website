Subject: Bay Window Ceiling - Neon

Ok, I know that I have mentioned this during the winter.

This weekend we had mild mild weather so I went to work.
I've had the ceiling ready to go in (the middle section was up already)
and I had some lights.  I used the standard 12volt computer neon
lights (blue) and Im picking up two red ones for the middle.

B=Blue lights    R=Red lights  O=Neon Round light (blue)
During the day you can see the light but the sunlight overpowers
the coolness.  Kinda as if you were to put your interior lights on
during the day.. wouldn't notice them much.  You can see blue along
the edge.  What's cool is the neon is behind the translucent ceiling so
in the dark it lights up most of the ceiling from behind.

If you have tinted windows on your van and you have the lights on
at nite.. you aren't in privacy. You get this cool smoke effect and you
can see inside. Curtains are a necessity.  My curtains are almost done
as well (tiger strip camoflauge).

I will take some pictures with just the blue lights, red should be in
tonight if I get some time.  Wiring was easy. Hooked them up to the
stock interior lights and set a switch.  You can use the original int 
lights,
with or without the neons.

p.s. underneath the ceiling i have 1" insulation/panel boards (fibreglass)
