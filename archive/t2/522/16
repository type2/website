I started a thread on L90D a few weeks ago and received some feedback regarding its availability at WW, Napa, and Paintscratch.  Paintscratch was the only place that had it so I bought a spray can for $30.  I know there were a few of you who were looking for a cheaper source.
Sadly for me, I just found another source for it for much cheaper so I thought I'd pass it on to those who were interested in Pastel White (and many other VW colors).  They are called Paintworld and the 12 oz. spray can is only $17. They have touch up and I believe quarts as well.  I wish I would have found this before Paintscratch! Hope this helps some of you.
