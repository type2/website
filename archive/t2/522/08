Subject: Help with buying brass drift for wheel bearing race

Hello,

I am about to ride my bike to Sears to get a brass drift set. I need to 
punch out the front wheel bearing races on my bus.

Will this set work fine? None of the FLAPS have any drifts, just 
punches. And nothing in brass.

Will this set also work for the rear bearing races, for future reference?

Is a drift just a punch with no taper at the end?

Autozone loaned me a race driver set, which was nice of them, and they 
stock inner and outer Timken bearings, in case anyone is looking on a 
Sunday (like me).

Thanks,
