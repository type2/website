Subject: '79 Door on '74 Bus?

I know that this has been covered in the past, but for some reason I can't 
find the messages when I checked the archives.

I had some delightful child smash in the passenger window of my '74 last 
night to rifle the glovebox, given that the parking area of the Units I 
live in is open to the public (how the little &^%*&% gotto it last night), 
I can't afford to leave it open like that.

The quickest way to fix it, IF it would work, would be to go to the garage 
where I've got my bits n pieces and swap the passenger door for the 
passenger door off '79 DC I stripped a while back. Problem is, I seem to 
remember the hinges etc changed sometime between '74 and '79, in which 
case I couldn't swap the doors over.

Can anyone give a catagorical answer on whether I can just bolt the '79 
door into the '74?

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,
