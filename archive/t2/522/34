Volks,

These vacuum advance units are no less reliable than the 009..but as
everything else on our old vehicles, they require maintenance, too.

A 30 year old distributor just might need a new vacuum can every decade or
so.  Occasional lubrication, testing of the vacuum unit, etc.  If maintained
with the most minimal servicing, they are much better.  no doubt.  For long
driving especially! The engine runs cooler.  Would you not want that if you
mainly use your vehicle for traveling?

Now, (flame suit on) most of the busses i see or repair come to me in the
worst possible condition............Band-Aids all over them, and any sort of
distributor jammed in the motor which was tuned by "ear".................
