Subject: Flooding Webber 5200

Hi,

I just bought a '74 with a Holley Webber 5200 carb on it. It wasn't
running when I bought it, but was getting fuel and spark. So I rebuilt
the carb. Now it is flooding out like crazy, and the electric choke is
getting really hot. Any thoughts on this? 

Thanks,

Mark
