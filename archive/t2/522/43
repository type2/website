Subject: Mechanic needed in Chicago

Unfortunately, last Thursday on the way home from work (at 2am) the ol' bus 
engine let go.  While cruising at 60mph, I lost power, and as I coasted off 
the highway I notices a large amount of smoke coming out the back of the 
bus.  I let things cool down for ~ 10 minutes then limped the bus home 
doing 20mph for 3 miles.

So now I'm looking for a decent mechanic recommendation in Chicago, 
specifically the northeast side of the city.  For those familiar with 
Chicago, I'm near Loyola University.

Hopefully its nothing terminal, I've become overly reliant on the bus, but 
I'm willing to do what is required to set her straight.  Thanks in advance.

Oh, and although I'd love to tear the engine apart and fix it myself, I 
have very limited time with a 100 year old house, and 2 children under 2 
years.  Hopefully I can do some troubleshooting this weekend.
