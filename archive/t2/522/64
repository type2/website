sounds possibly like the points maybe isn't working or the new coil is not
hooked up right, if the injectors weren't working the spark plugs would
not be wet with gas.

can't imagine it being that bad, for the injectors to ruin em, I would

the intense smell of gas indictate that your injectors are probably
working fine. or at least well enough for the engine to start.

I would suspect the spark plugs are not firing for some reason, put the
old plugs and coil back on to check.   there are other tecniques in the
bentley for testing too
