I'd have to say, that given the fact it's taken 20 to 30 years to reach the 
"needs to be replaced" condition, that's pretty dammned great.  Expose the 
thinner steel in today's cars(and replacement panels), paint it with the 
materials VW used on our buses, and I bet it doesn't take a fraction of that 
time to oxidize into swiss cheese.  The issue wasn't the metal, it is the 
salty environment.  I have a '70 without ANY body rot, and it is because it 
wasn't near the ocean or the salted roads where it snows.
