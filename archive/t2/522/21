howdy,

I have a '75 bus with a 1600 twinport running a 34
pict  and a quietpack extractor and muffler.

It had a 009 when I bought it and ran great flatout. 
Used heaps of fuel and had a flatspot that I drove
around by driving flatout.

Now Im a sceptic with a lot of the 'lore related to
these engines.  I researched, read Boston Bobs take on
it, Aircooled nets, do a goole search with 009 and 34
pict and see the pain lots of ppl have suffered.  I
soldered my throttle plate, upped to a 160 main jet
and it ran better.  

I then got a box of old dizzies for $20, got a svda
one from a t1 engine, rebuilt it with all the good
bits from the box.  I set the timing at 0 as I had
know idea what full advance I was aiming for with the
vacuum, 32 deg has always been my highest.  I then
read an off hand comment on this list about the max
full advance with vacuum going to 40+ deg as the
engine could tolerate the greater advance at part
throttle.

Pluged the vaccy tube, set at 32 deg and drove
blissfully off.  I now have part throttle, smoother
power, economy and a cooler running bus.

Try one and you will never go back to the oo9 unless
you put of a huge pair or webers.
