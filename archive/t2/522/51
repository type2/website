Subject: Re: [T2] IDLING HIGH

I don't know much about carbs, but if anything after the throttle plate 
is leaking, then you'll get a high idle.  I have a leaky booster hose 
and it likes to idle high when it warms up.  I found the leak by 
spraying starter fluid around different joints.  If you hear the rpms go 
up, you found your leak.
