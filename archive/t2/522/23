A perfect use for a brass drift. Pick up a set.

Many Sears items like those Mayhew drifts are a bargain because Sears buys
in such large volume. You'll pay much for them in future when you need them
and can't find them at Sears.

A great tool for installing races is the Lisle 12600:

You can see it in action here. Drifts are nice it's really tricky work
getting the race perfectly true so the hub is exactly where it's supposed to
be.

Good brand. Made in which country?
