Subject: leaking cold start valve???faulty pressure regulator???

Dear Type2,

My 79 FI 2000cc engine ran fine all day and then when I started her she
slowly (20seconds) died with the accelerator fully open.  I immediately put
in a new fuel filter which I carry with me hoping that that would solve the
problem - it didn't. I am suspecting a leaking fuel injector, cold start
valve or clogged fuel line.

On second thought, it does not make sense that one leaking injector would
cause the whole engine to die and then not start, therefore does it make
sense that it is either a leaking cold start valve or clogged fuel line?

I am considering buying a four new injectors and a new cold start valve
because they are the original one to start with and would eliminate them as
suspect problem.

Last night I did a quick tune up to check vacuum, spark, compression,
valve-adjustment, fuel pressure and battery - everything checked out fine.


Would a faulty pressure regulator cause flooding?  I have a new fuel pump
and it put out 40# when the engine is not running.  If the pressure
regulator does not regulate the pressure down between 30 -35 would this
flood the chambers and cause the engine to flood?

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
