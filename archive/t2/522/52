>>I found the leak by
spraying starter fluid around different joints.  If you hear the rpms go
up, you found your leak.<<

i am also getting ready to use this procedure to check for vacuum leaks.

my question is: are there any aerosol substances i should or should *not*
use for this? i was going to use some WD-40 b/c thats what i had lying
around...

of course, i'm not trying to start another WD-40 thread here. ;-)

TIA,
