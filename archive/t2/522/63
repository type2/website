If the shoe has frozen to the drum, which is a problem I have also 
encountered from time to time. Instead of taking the wheel off, etc. what I 
do is crawl around underneath, pull off the rubber plugs for inspecting the 
brake shoes, stick a screwdriver in there and pry them up off the drum. 
Usually it only takes a second to pop them free. Put the screwdriver on the 
metal edge of the brake shoe. If you don't want to pry too hard on your 
baking plate, which can wallow out the hole, try tapping the end of the 
screwdriver with a hammer and popping them off the drum. Only in severe 
cases have I had to push a thin screwdriver under the brake friction 
material. But that is a rare case, like when I forgot and left the brake on 
over a whole Spring semester in college.

But, feel good that you have managed to keep all oily materiel off of your 
brake system. Otherwise they wouldn't rust on there.

Good luck.
