Subject: IDLING HIGH

Hello,

 its me again. 72 van with a 74 FI engine converted to
weber 32/36 dfev. it has trouble starting in the morning,
and after it warms up it will idle really high 4000 rpm.
but if i come to a stop the idle will just die off and then i stall.
after it is warmed up i cant get it to idle at all, just the same
situation with it revving high and stalling out.
i found that a couple of the intake boots were cracked.
i fixed these the best i could but it still idles high and dies out.
if the electric choke was wrecked would it cause these simptoms?
i am still going to look at the brake booster hose to see
if anything is cracked. anyone have any other ideas.
thanks everyone.

Darren
