Subject: RE: [T2] Push starting my Van does not work...

You have the famous hot start problem.  I had it on my 76 with FI and when
you push start the bus, make sure that this key is turned on.  No key on =
no juice to the injectors.  You could also have an instance where there
isn't enough voltage in your battery, but I doubt that as it starts up great
the next day.  

There is a relay that you can get from the good folks at the Bus Depot, The
BusCo, etc that will eliminate this problem.  I didn't go to the relay until
after I had replaced the starter.

Let me know if you need more info on this,
