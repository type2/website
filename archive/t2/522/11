Subject: strange hesitation/bucking problem

hello list,

i went to take the single cab out today to run some errands since the
weather was so nice.  unfortunately, i didnt make it all the way & the truck
made the return trip to the driveway on a rollback.

the engine warmed up beautifully & idled fine as always. after driving about
3-4 miles, it started losing power & hesitating/bucking.  pulled into a
parking lot to try & diagnose. cyl head temp & oil pressure looked fine from
the gauges.  couldn't see anything immediately wrong, so i started it back
up & it drove fine around the parking lot.

went back out on the road & everything was fine for another 2 miles or so,
then started bucking/hesitating again.

went through the whole ordeal a couple more times then decided to call tow
truck b/c i didnt want to cause any unnecessary damage.

the only thing i did notice that was odd was the tach was acting a little
funny when the hesitation was occurring. (jumping around & stuff)

so i am suspecting either:
1) fuel delivery problem OR
2) strange electrical gremlin

i checked the points & they looked alright. fuel filter looked nice & clean
but i think i am going to try replacing that anyway & see if it helps.
FWIW, the tank was treated by the PO, so i don't suspect the fuel tank crud
issue, but i guess its possible.

type 1 motor if that makes any difference.

thanks in advance for any ideas,

also, can someone plz remind me how to set digest mode?
