I know this is on a type 1 motor, but I had a similar experience in my 73
w/type IV motor many many years ago.  I was driving along happily when all
of a sudden the most god-awful racket started.  I was certain I had thrown a
rod.  So I stopped and went back to have a look.  Seems a piece of the metal
tubing for the charcoal cannister had detached itself from the top of my
engine compartment and fallen into the fan (no screen on it at the time).
Broke 7 or 8 blades and sent them down-stream to lie atop the oil cooler and
cylinders.
