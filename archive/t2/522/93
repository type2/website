Subject: Neon roof pics

Just took a couple day pics. Later on tonight I will see how some night
pics look to show the glowing roof effect. It literally spreads across and 
up
the interior of the roof.  The neons are across from each other.

The middle section will have reds.
There is a simple switch run off the interior light power.

Sorry it took so long to put up the pics
