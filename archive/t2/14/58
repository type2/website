No need to be a guru, just having the info and pass it on. The rear and the
front use the same hardware. The total for each item is (8). The VW number
bolts and washers are the ones that VW made. They can be substituted with
hardware store stuff. We do have tons of this vw stuff, both chromed and
painted. Used hardware prices are listed. We can ship usps (about 2 days)
priority for $3.50.

Hi All!

One quick question. As I am in the process of spraying my bus and bumpers it
occurs to me that I have absolutely no idea what I did with the hardware to
mount the bumpers back on. Any guru out there know the size of the bolts I
need to pick up to remount my front and rear bumper on my 71?
