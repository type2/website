I would do the method that Karl described in his post to the list on
finding cylinder 1, tcd, and then put the shaft in place.  Then install
the distributor and see how it situates itself and what direction/plug
in the cap the rotor is pointing towards (hopefully towards the notch on
the distributor rim).  Then put the cap on, hook up spark plug 1 to the
terminal that the rotor's pointing at and then plug the rest of the
cables in the cap in the appropriate places. (1234 counter clockwise
from 1)

Make sure that you put the driveshaft in the correct way.  Be sure to
note that one side of the groove is fatter.  If you flip it, the
distributor will be off 180 degrees.

That should work unless, like karl said, your cam shaft is not aligned
with the crank.  that would suck.
