Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Tent zipper fixes?

Hey,
My tent is at an Amish canvas shop as we speak.  He is replacing the entire
screen and zipper, patching a few small holes on the floor, and touching up
the rain gutter vinyl attachment thingy.   $40  They are great craftsman, so
I expect a wonderful job.
