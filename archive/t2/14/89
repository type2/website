You're using the wrong vacuum tap on the carb.  You want the one that is connected to the little hole just above the throttle butterfly.

IIRC, the correct vacuum tap is the one that comes out of the left side of the carb on most Solex carbs.

Also, some vacuum carbs have to be timed with a timing light.  Check Bentley for specs.  I know that if I try to static time the 
dual-vacuum carb on my bus it will be way retarded from where it should be.  No power, runs bad!

As a final check, put on a timing light and check the total advance.  It should be about 28 degrees (conservative).  Some folks put in 
more, but watch out for detonation.
