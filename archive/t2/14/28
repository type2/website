Subject: alternator removal, 78 bus.

Dear all,
   I was wondering if it's possible to remove the alternator without
removing the engine ? Mine is making funny sounds, so i guess its time to
have it rebuilt. Last time I did it I had the engine out anyway, so it was
easy to get at. With the engine in, it looks awful narrow in there...
   Many thanks to you all,

Gregor
