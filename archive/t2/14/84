My '71 station wagon came with some sort of mechinism that converts the rear seat into a bed.  I don't know if this is a factory feature 
though.  It would seem to be, as there were no arm rests in the back (and no holes for them in the side panels.  When I installed arm 
rests I discovered the bed would no longer work.
