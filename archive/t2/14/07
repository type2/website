Nigel,

On the part number, I went over it with a magnifying glass, and as far as
I can tell, the answer is "no".  On the thread size, I took a deep 17mm
and cranked as hard as I could to attempt removal and again, the answer is
"no".  Sorry :-(

By rack of eye, I would be (a small amount of) money that it is a 14mm
thread.  Alas, the lever arm on the plate is *very* short and the sender
feels like time and temps have welded it in there.  I am leery of bending
the plate, which appears to be mild steel, as I do intend to install it
next oil change.  Once it is in, I will attempt to remove the sender
again, but given the attachement by two M6 studs to the engien case, I
don't think I will crank much harder than I did tonight (I'd *hate* to pop
one of those studs out of the case, frankly :-)

Interesting!  I may well look into that.  The 120C sender sounds like the
one I want.  130C is a bit high for my tastes.
