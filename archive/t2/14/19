ayup, done.

ok, here's where i'm confused:


a) install the dizzy drive shaft at #1 TDC
b) install the dizzy properly
c) put rotor on
d) setup plug wires so that the one the rotor is facing is #1
e) turn over car with timing light attached to #1:  

result:
the 180 degree mark comes up.

This just seems very wrong to me (esp. since the bus was yesterday).

I know i'm at TDC -- I've verified it with a screwdriver in the #1 plug hole.

If the rotor is theoretically pointing at #1 (-at-) TDC -- as described above --
there should be NO WAY that the timing light flashes at the 180 degree mark...right?

Argh!
