Subject: VDO short/MOFOCO

Hi all,
I've attempted to install a VDO oil temp gauge that I pulled at a
junkyard, but when I connect the lead and ground, the guage maxes out,
and this is unaffected when I connect the sender...I assume this is a
short?  Does anyone know if this can be easily repaired?
Also, I'm looking into purchasing a rebuilt MOFOCO 1800 CC longblock
dual carb engine (milwaukee) and was curious if anyone has any feedback
about their work.
thanks much,
mark
