Yes, not that you mention it on my mini-road-trip this summer we went from the railroad museum in Sacramento (elevation 30) to Echo 
Summit (7382) in about 2 hours and 90 miles.  The elevation change is gradual on US50, though, so it didn't seem like all that much of a 
climb.  The drop down into the Tahoe basin was much quicker, as was the drop from Tahoe to Carson City.
