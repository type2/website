Sensor safe RTV refers to " no silicones " which will damage an 02, or "lambda sensor ".
I'm not sure what you have in yours, it has silicones and is sensor safe. (?).
Permatex technical marbles may be found at 1-800-LOCKTITE. ( They are Permatex ).
I usually feel pretty safe if i look around  ( and don't see any lambdas 8^)

Gonna try and put some RTV silicone on as suggested in earlier posts. It's the Permatex, Sensor Safe, Ultra Blue, RTV silicone.
Never as easy as just walking into store and buying RTV, hope this is the right variation.
