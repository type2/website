Subject: Flame from generator during polarization

I am posting this mainly to get it in the archives, so others won't do the
same stupid and dangerous thing thing I did.  While polarizing my generator
tonight, I was too lazy/frustrated/tired, and insane to go get my regular
little jumper wire, so I grabbed a set of jumper cables laying near me and
used them.  The generator whirred, then a flame the size of the entire
opening on top of the generator jumped out a foot from my face.  No excuse
for this awful lapse in judgement.  I know better.  I really shouldn't have
been out there working on the bus tonight at all.  So now I'm gonna let both
busses sit for awhile until I'm in a better frame of mind, and can remember
to put my cautious head back on next time I pop the lid.
