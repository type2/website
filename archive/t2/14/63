Subject: cabinet install questions

this past weekend i acquired a sink/spare tire cabinet from a 78 westy parts
bus (the one that sits on the driver's side wall) the icebox portion of
the cabinet has been removed.

from what i can tell from eye-balling it, it doesnt look like i can put my
z-bed fully down with this cabinet in the bus.

so, is the only z-bed that will work with this cabinet the one from the same
setup? (i think that would be a 3/4 width z-bed, but not sure)

thanks.
