Subject: Re: '68 nose transplant? cost/price/reality?

	Folks,
	A '68 single cab I'm considering buying has a bad Bondo job 
on the nose- no front emblem and I'm not sure the 'tv screen' 
shape around the lights is still visible :) Also, looks like there
was considerable leaking, maybe from rotted out metal below
front window, which Bondo now covers.

	No chance of my doing the work myself, any guesses on what
removing and replacing the nose sheetmetal, at least from bumper
height up to and including the bottom of the window opening, would
cost? Is this more work than anyone would reasonably pay to have done?

	Three CV boots are shot, and I get a foot massage from the brake
pedal. Could bad CVs give pulsating brakes? Or am I looking at
bad drums here?

	Thanks!
	Bill
