Subject: Heat and Big Tires

A question, and an observation. First off, what is the tallest diameter C 
load rated tire that will fit on the stock 14 in wheels? I'm running BFG 
AT/KO 27X8.5X14s now, and want to know if anything taller/wider is available. 
I'm running a little experiment with a test bus of sorts, [not my Westy], 
powered by a Corvair 140hp, so throw conventional VW wisdom out the window, 
and if cutting the fenders is required, so be it. Now the observation: With 
winter around the corner, I was thinking about VW's infamous lack of heat. On 
my '78 westy, after giving it the full Bulley Treatment, I found that the 
heat can be incredible. But I noticed that when I went to insulate the 
accordion silencer pipes that come off the flapper boxes that they seem to be 
very well insulated to begin with. Mine are a tube within a tube design, and 
I found that no insulation was needed. Do I have standard silencers, or 
possibly some "cold weather" upgrade from the factory that I was not aware of?
Thanks all,
Jesse
