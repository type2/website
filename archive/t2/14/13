Exceptional.  We did a list campout down there I organized 5? years ago
or so.  When do you want to go, it would be cool to get something
organized again.  We went October last time and the first night it was
about 28F but the days were clear and gorgeous as was the scenery.
The campground is exceptional clean as heck, and was only 2-3 years
old then, still very nice.  Anyway if you don't mind making it a thing we
could probably draw some of the DC crowd over again, maybe if I'm
lucky my EV camper will be done by then. The campground is a nice
10-15 minute walk to the park but has a awe inspiring view of the rocks,
it is also dirt cheap for its quality and the tent sites are incredibly built
(not that it matters to us.)  You got the whole Dolly Sods, Cass Railroad,
Greenbank thing going for you in close driving proximity as well.  It might
be neat to get together a fall Cass ride up the mountain during leaf season
and camp at Seneca.

Anyone out there interested on the list?

The lifter, just run the beast till it quiets out, else see my tech article
in the
archives on type2.  I'd just change the oil and run it till it quits,
avoiding real
high revs personally.  My well worn '78 would take up to 30 minutes to pump
2 of them up if it sat for a few months.
