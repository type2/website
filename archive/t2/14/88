Subject: Successful journey to NJ

I made the trip from St. Louis, MO to Madison, NJ in my '77 with no worries. 
  With the new shocks, steering damper and non-broken sway bar I could 
really feel the difference on the road.  Other than stopping for ~4 hours 
snooze just over the PA border, the only stops were for gas & bathroom.  Bus 
ran great and never felt hot. I decided the "grap the handle of the dip 
stick" test is worthless so I started touching the tip of the dipstick on 
the back of my hand. That may be worthless too but at least it felt remotely 
hot like a motor should.  Regardless, I got the best gas mileage ever- 20-25 
mpg with the weber progressive and 009.  Strangely enough, it was highest 
going through the hills of western PA along Rt. 70/76.  Granted I was going 
slower ~55-60 vs. 65, but that was because I was going up hills!

I've fully moved into my new New Jersey digs, and was fortunate enough to 
stumble upon a guy with a nice looking '70 camper- forget the model, but it 
pops straight up. He turned me on to a local swap-meet, salvage yard, other 
bus owners, and even an ACVW mechanic.

Any other bus folk in north east NJ area I'd love to hear from you (some of 
you I've talked to and will drop an email soon).

Thanks to all the AIRS members (and administrators) who made my trip easier 
without even knowing it.

Happy bussing

Patrick
