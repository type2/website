Subject: Q: Crank Windows vs. Sliders ('72 Riviera)

I've got a '72 Riviera camper with slider windows like the later bay buses.
I'm interested in replacing these with the crank-type windows found on
Westies. According to a couple items in the archives, I *believe* that all
side window openings for Bay Window buses are the same size. Can anyone
confirm this?

My core question is of course...will Bay/Westy crank-style windows fit in a
'72 Riviera.

Thanks! Joe
