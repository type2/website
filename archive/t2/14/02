I keep seeing people trying to adjust valves using the distributor when it is in
the wrong position. Forget all that goofy crap way of doing it by turning the
engine backwards and trying to remember which ones to do. The EASIEST way to do
it is with a remote starter button and not worrying where the distributor is.
Takes longer to R + R the valve covers then to adjust them!:

Remove both covers.
Connect a remote starter to the solenoid.
Watch ANY pair of rockers.
Turn engine over with remote.
Just as the exhaust valve starts to open, STOP.
Adjust the intake.
Turn engine, exhaust will open and close, intake will open and close. Just as
the intake closes, STOP.
Adjust the exhaust.
Go to the next cylinder.
As the exhaust just starts to move, adjust the intake.
When the intake just closes, adjust the exhaust.
Real simple, real quick, real easy.
The valve you are adjusting will always be on the heel of the cam.

When you are done and before you put the covers back on, you can check the
position of the distributor.
Turn engine in direction of rotation and watch #3 valves. When the exhaust opens
and then just closes, STOP. At the instant the exhaust closes the intake will
start to open. You want the valves to be at 'rocking' position, either way you
move the crank one valve will move. This is TDC to fire #1. Look at your crank
pulley. If you have a zero degree mark, it will be at zero. Your rotor should be
at the index mark also. [a high lift or long duration or high overlap cam makes
no difference, rocking valves is rocking valves]
If you are NOT at TDC zero mark when the valves are rocking, your cam timing is
OFF.
