Subject: Holley Carb ?

Recently bought a '79 bus which was converted to a crab.  Was running lean 
(lots of popping and backfireinn while coasting).  I found a leak where one 
of the intake pipes meets the carb mount (someone didn't connect the hose 
right).  Now I can't get it to run.  I think the carb was tuned rich to 
compensate for the leak.  Now I think it floods.

The carb says "Holley" on it.  I found a couple of part #'s on it:
"12R-5065" just under the right side where the fuel hose enters
"1R-1181" on the left-underside of the filter mount (on the carb body)
I went to the Holley website but could not find these numbers in their 
lists.  It is a 2 barrel unit.  What is it? Is is a 5200? Or some 
Holley/Weber hybrid?

What I really want to know is: How do I set the mixture screw to just get 
the thing running so I can fine tune it?  I assumed that clockwise turn of 
the mixture screw makes it leaner and counter-clockwise makes it richer.

I prefer F.I. on the Bus and have lots of experience troubleshooting it, so 
I'm a bid "green" when it comes to carburation.  I try to avoid it.  I just 
want to get this thing running so I can use it while I restore my '76 (with 
FI).  I just don't want to spend much :>)

Thanks for the help,
