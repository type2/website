I have seem quite a few of these lately. They vary slightly in design 
but are generally the same. After trying the figure out where they 
came from no one seemed to know until DaveE told me they were a 
common fixture in after-market catalogs such as JC Wh!tney.  I also 
ran accross an NOS kit on E-barf earlier this year.  I do not recall 
who the manufacturer was but it was not VW. I wold be fairly easily 
for a competent metal worker to copy one.

The absence of arm rests and the holes for them in the panel is 
suspicious. Is you bus a type 23, kombi? It might not have had rear 
and or middle armrests. I suspect you did have the nuts in the frame 
to accents the long nuts for the arm rests but they may have been 
present in all buses. Seems like 76 or 77 up buses had some sort of 
rear seat fold down option.
