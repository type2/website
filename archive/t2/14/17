Subject: WV Fall Camping

Well I'm going to run with this a bit, I think it would be cool to do
something around here in late September or early October again.
The Seneca Rocks campground is open all through October I'm
pretty sure as I used to go down every October 17th.  To give
everyone some idea of what we might consider doing I've got a
link here for fall leaf watching:

And for Cass Railroad.  When you are there with a SO the railroad
trip is neat and the view from the top is impressive, but when you are
there as a kid some might say it is 4+ hours of getting smoke blown
in your face and often having to stand on a packed train car.  I guess
it depends on the company mostly but it is far better on a cold fall
day that much is certain.

And like I mentioned Greenbank radio observatory is also very close
I think they have the largest freestanding radio telescope in the world
again, I'm not sure, the old one fell down.

Anyway anyone who might be interested and wants to put in feedback
please feel free to do so by pmail or on the list.  If anyone could FWD
this to vanagon if you cross post pleas do, I don't really want to
subscribe to do so.  FWIW Seneca is probably a good 5 hours from
DC metro area.  Might be a bit shorter if you go down I81 and over
US33, I'm not sure, mapquest estimates 4:38 to Harman, WV which
is in the vicinity of where we want to be.  It is probably a lot closer to
some of our NC folks, within 4-5 I'd guess.

Looking at things again BTW I think the campground I'm talking about
is a national forest campground, NOT the WV state park forest campground,
I need to check on that.
