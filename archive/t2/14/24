Subject: 80 Westy pics

Hello, I finally got some pictures of my Vanagon that I am selling.  If you
would like to see them p-mail me and I'll send you a zip file.  Here's the
short version of my original for sale post.

1980 Vanagon Westfalia(type P-22)
153629 miles (37253 on factory rebuilt 2.0L engine)
Weber carb, Icebox, working sink, two tables, rear bug screen
Oil temp gauge, Fishing rod racks, CO detector, fire extinguisher
AM/FM/Cassete Kenwood  Stereo (now installed)
Trailer hitch.
Only minor surface rust on body (none underneath) and some rust under window
seals (not major).
No dents worth mentioning.
The van does not leak or burn engine oil and gets 15 mpg in city and about
18-20 mpg on highway.
Previous owner put $3500 into engine/transmission 3.5 years ago (I have the
reciepts)
I am asking $3000.  Located in Lakeland, FL between Tampa and Orlando.
