Subject: Re:full width z-bed with 78 sink cabinet

Is your bed the vinyl covered one or the cloth one?  I don't know if the
reach on the earlier 3/4 beds is different from the later cloth ones. 
Which side is your rear cabinet on? I know that the full width bed from
a 74-75 will work with the later sink cabinets fine if the fridge is
removed.  I did this; see:
http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin  The bed just reaches the sink
cabinet.
