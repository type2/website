Subject: brake booster hoses/ check valve

Hi all, today I noticed that it's about time to replace 
the vaccum hoses for the bake booster on my 72 westy. As 
done by a p.o., there is a hose plumbed into each intake 
manifold. These two hoses go to a t fitting, with a 
single hose connecting to the booster line. Is it 
necesary and/or desirable to have two hoses connected to 
the booster? Seems like the plumbing would be simpler 
with just one.
Also, the Bentley book says there is a check valve 
between the manifold vaccum hoses and the brake booster. 
Is this supposed to be in the engine compartment or is 
it underneath?
