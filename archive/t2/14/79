I have a 70 bus. Let me first say that this is the only v w  of any kind i 
have
ever driven or ever rode in for that matter. When i bought this bus 3 yrs. ago
i had to put in a new motor. I wanted everything new on the motor. The man
at the supply house where i bought the motor and everything else told me
that the 009 dist. was the best way to go. I assumed that was right, what
do i know. I have been very satisfied with the dist. but remember I have never
drove another v w so i can't compare. I decided to get out the vacum advance
and put new points, cond., rotor and cap." it don't work."Put back the 009,
started the engine and connected the hose of the vac. adv. dist. to vac at the
carb. It advances wide open at idle. what's wrong?
