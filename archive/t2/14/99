Subject: adjusting my weber progressive carb

Well, we took the bus on its first trip.  We went from
VA up to PA, down to MD and then back to PA to go to
the BusDepot to grab a new starter.

Anyway, some things were discovered on our small
adventure...

one of which is that I don't believe the carb. in
adjusted properly.  I think it is too rich.  We have
lots of "splatters" on the rear of the bus (hatch and
engine door,) we are burning about 1/2 quart of oil
per gas fillup, the bus will occasionally diesel when
hot, and we are getting about 18 miles to the gallon.

we also noticed that the engine (2000cc with single
carb...and it was supposed to have had a rebuild
40,000 miles ago, hmmmm) is running at 30psi on the
highway and about 250 degrees f.

any clues volks?  i know this engine will need a
rebuild, by me that is, in the next year, but i'm
trying to ship out this week for 6 months or so.  just
looking for some more wonderful advise.

thanks in advance.
