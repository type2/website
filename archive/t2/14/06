I don't get it either, but from the other direction. I am running an 009 on
my 74 1.8ltr and it does quite well. Good power and acceleration, no
unexpected trouble on hills, etc, etc. I am planning to re-install the stock
vacuum dizzy after I repair my carb to make a comparison, so maybe then I'll
understand.

My thinking is that while the 009 may not be perfect, I have never failed to
get an air cooled VW to run with one. Can't say the same for the vacuum
dizzies, but my experience may be somewhat limited.

My two kroner worth.
