Subject: Bus nose water drainage


Yesterday I was wet sanding the nose of my 69 Transporter after fixing some under-windshield rust
holes, and I noticed some water dripping off the bottom long after the bus should've been plenty
dry.

I figured some water had gotten into the nose while I had a hose on it (throught the headlight
holes, probably) and was sitting in there, slowly dripping out.  I saw that the water was dripping
from two places, both of them just behind the front lowest lip of the nose, directly under the
center of each turn signal.  I gave the nose below each turn signal a rap with my fist, and two
healthy streams of water started pouring onto the ground.  I worked a flathead screwdriver into each
"hole" to "open it up", and the water just flew out.

Either there are two handy nose drainage holes there or I just happen to have two leaks below the
nose, perfectly symmetrically situated...If they're SUPPOSED to be there, maybe every bus would
appreciate those drainage holes being clean and open...

Just a thought,

Paul Sinfield
