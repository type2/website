Subject: Bumpers and Bug-Out 50

Hi All!

One quick question. As I am in the process of spraying my bus and bumpers it 
occurs to me that I have absolutely no idea what I did with the hardware to 
mount the bumpers back on. Any guru out there know the size of the bolts I 
need to pick up to remount my front and rear bumper on my 71?

My bus is in the final stages and prepped for paint. This will be my first 
attempt so I have practiced a lot. It wont be perfect by any regard, but it's 
mine. I'm hoping to make it to the Bug-Out in Manassas, VA this year IN an 
old VW instead of whatever water-cooled I'm riding at the time. (dem fingers 
are crossed)! Anyway, hope to see some of you there. If you see me, say Hi, 
I'm the red head in the red 71 westy!
