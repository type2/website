Subject: Re: [T2] I'm thinking about buying Stinger Exhaust

Not sure if the exhaust system is compatible with a stinger.  Are you
referring to the aftermarket extractor-style exhaust?

FWIW, I run a stinger/extractor in my bus with a T1 motor, and it's probably
worse on gas, since you lose so much backpressure and you have to rev
higher and longer.  It has a better top end, but it takes a while to
get there.  Also keep in mind there are regulations around how far the
exhaust can extend past the body of the vehicle...

What's good for the beetle is not always good for the bus.

Thanks,
