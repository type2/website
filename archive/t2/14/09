Well, John Muir started it in the idiot book.  He vastly preferred the centrifugal advance distributor.

Also, racers use 'em because they run at high RPM and want all the advance in all the time anyway.  If it works for racers, many people 
think, it must work for street cars.  (flawed logic, how many top fuel dragsters do you see on the morning commute?)

The parts merchants add to the myth, since 009s are commonly available and will work (marginally) on just about anything.

The other problem is that the vacuum advance distributors are getting harder and harder to find.  The cost of rebuilding one is more than 
the cost of a 009.  Cheap drives out good.
