The word for the day is Helsinki. In Europe there was more than one 
Westy VW camper. The Helsinki model was set up like the spit screen 
SO44 layout. You can see an example in the links below. The subject 
is supposedly a French registered 1969 westy. The pics support the 
claim. More pics of the same bus are available at thesamba.com in the 
gallery under 68 up campers.

I have seen at least on bus in the US that had a full width westy bed 
in the rear that was of the same laminate as 72 and 73 westies. It 
was a hard top. Folklore has it that dealerships could get kits from 
VW/Westfalia to convert passenger buses into various degrees of 
camperness. In split lore these were know as Mosaic interiors. I do 
not know of the name for bays but I have seen one and heard of 
others. The rationelle was that dealers could not get enough campers 
to sell so kits were made available to satisfy customer need.


If anyone has a bus like the one in the pics below, let me know and I 
will get out my checkbook :)
