I'm thinking about buying Stinger Exhaust. 
Thats it. 
I'm thinking about buying stinger exhaust for my 83 Air Cooled Westy.
I don't need the stainless steel high $ system, Texas no salt.
I'd even consider a used set of it is in good condition.
I'm mostly interested to see if it will give anything to performance or
let the engine run cooler.
