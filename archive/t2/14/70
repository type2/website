Hmmm.  I know I'm showing my ignorance, but I wasn't
aware that loaf westy's were available with full width
beds.  In my search for a loaf westy (so I could
return to the aircooled ranks), I was avoiding late
models because I dislike the four seater arrangement. 


Which models have the full width bed?  And what do you
lose other than the propane stove?
