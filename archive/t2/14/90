Subject: Re: [T2] Dropped Valve Seat

That is more than a big enough guaging to expect the rod might have a
problem as well. Warped, bent, twisted. Pull the piston off and then the
rod and spec it and magniflux it or be prepared for a short life repair.

No question I would replace that piston. NONE!

Oh, and if the rod is apparently tweeked or cracked, it brings up the issue
of the possible crank damage. Just pointing out the possible risks.

Think about the cost of having to do a proper rebuild now as compared to
the cost of just putting it back together and hoping for the best then
adding the cost of doing a proper rebuild later?? Which is the "cheaper"
methode????????

Yeah, that means new heads, too. A properly machined and assembled long
block now certainly adds the most value to the vehicle. If maintained
properly it won't drop valve seats. Check the valve guides and valves for
wear on the damaged head. If those are in spec then the other head should
be ok. If they are out of spec, then both heads should be replaced. 

If you use junkyard heads, make sure you spec them out before you buy them.
