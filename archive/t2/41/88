my idle is staying high and then if I engage the clutch slightly (while
in gear) and drop the rpms down, they stay down... I checked the decel
valve and there is suction on decel.  I also checked the distributor
advance plate and it is working also.  Points are good, dwell's good,
new plugs... It seems like when the engine warms up, the rpms stay up
high... 

Also, another thing that may or may not be related, I went to get
smogged and my CO2 is high.  Does that mean too rich?

Thanks,
Mike
