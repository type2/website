Subject: RE: [T2] Ignition switch removal-Ugly Way

[...]

While reading and clearing out old List mail, I finally realized why
there is a hole in the ignition key housing on my 71 opposite the one
for the cable on the right side.  This must be the quick and dirty
way that one of the previous owners of my bus changed the ignition
lock.

Drilled a hole through the housing just behind the lock.  Used
something like an old bicycle wheel spoke to pop the release pin.  No
grinding off the face of the lock.  No major disassembly.  Just an
ugly 1/4 inch hole.
