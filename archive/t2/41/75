I recently bought a 1971 Westfalia camper. I know I paid too much, but =
am going to try and restore anyway. The guy I bought it from told me he =
would come up with an engine case for me. He hasn't yet. He had all the =
other parts. Mahle pistons. My question is will any 1600 engine cases =
work or do I have to have one for a bus? I believe I have everything =
except for the rods and case. Also can you tell me about mounting the =
camper back on. Does it have nuts under the headliner? What about the =
luggage rack mounting? I have the camper top and luggage rack but they =
are just tied on. I live in Broken Bow Oklahoma if anyone knows anyone =
close I could hire to help me.
Thanks for any help.=20
