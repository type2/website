Hi Dave,
Who knows why buses are so popular?
All of the reasons I originally used to justify buying
one to my wife have been contradicted.
Buses chew fuel compared to modern cars & you're
right...they are draughty & tend to be vehicles of
finite acceleration.
It still doesn't change the fact though that my wife's
happiest moments are with me when we travel in our bus
& those times when we owned a camper & slept in it.
Many people when they find out that I own a bus sigh
like remembering their best childhood memories(in fact
many are:-) and they look fondly upon pics on my
website and are always interested in taking a ride.
Buses are a breath of fresh air out of the motoring
past when it wasn't important where you were going or
how fast you got there & that the most important thing
was to chill out & enjoy the ride.
I'm proud to preserve that legacy & there's nothing
better on a sunny Sunday afternoon than piling into
the bus & heading out onto the open road.
:-)
Cheers & keep bussing,
Andrew Wood
