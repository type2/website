Hi everyone. I have an 81 Westy that I just purchased
and I put a new motor in. It's running rich on one
cylinder and before I tear into the motor I wanted to
get some second opinions about possible causes. I am
giong to check for a valve out of adjustment, a dirty
fuel injector, a bad plug or plug wire, or a stuck
lifter. It has hydralic lifers so I havent adjusted
the valves since break in. If anyone has any more
suggestions on what it might be I 'de appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.
