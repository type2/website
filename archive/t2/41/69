Subject: Busses for Sale

Too many busses!

'72 Westy (Sally), slight nose damage, small crack in windshield, I'm
the 2nd owner, great bus, NO rust, lovingly cared for.  New engine foam
seal, slider seal, carbs (weber 34ict), 150 compression all around on
porsche engine.  Clean.  Not installed but available:  Front window
scrapers, poptop canvas, replacement cables and goodies.  Sierra Yellow
(orange to us mortals).  

'78 Riviera.  Bought this bus last year as a stopgap - running a bit
rough now, and has seen some not so great body work.  Looks great from a
slight distance and I know Walter has lotsa heart, just needs a bit of
TLC.  The usual battery tray rust, nothing totally horrendous.  Orange.

In Silicon Valley.  I'd like to get about $3000 for Sally and $2500 for
Walter.
