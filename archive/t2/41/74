Subject: The Perfect Body (Metal)

"The Perfect Body":
The VW rumor mill in the pacific northwest has been running again. I have a 
'65 kombi with some pretty nasty body damage on the drivers side, behind the 
front door. looks like somebody hit the bus with a forklift at about 10 mph. 
Anyway, a local (yokel?) said "just heat that up red hot and splash some 
water on it, the metal will shrink back to its old size"
Uh, this sounds like something i'd rather not do without a little burn kit 
on hand. Anyway, has anyone else ever done this? Is it (ill) advised?
-Jeremy
