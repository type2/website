Subject: Click and Clack Endorsing a Bus?!?!?!

I was listening to Car Talk, you know Click and Clack, and someone asked if 
she or her husband or boyfriend got the better car.  He got a Lexus and she 
got a 1966 Westfalia.  They told her that she did because as they told 
her,"he got a Lexus, you got a legend".

That's about the first positive thing I heard them say about a Volkswagen Bus.
