Dear Chris.

I can gain access to SW Washwiper AB website, using either of the Yahoo, 
Google or Alta Vista search engines. I checked it out again today, just to 
be sure!

URL is http://hem.passagen.se.zelus/

Make sure you set the check-boxes to any language and for countries outside 
your own.

Tell me what you think of the wash/wipers!

Regards.

         Nigel A. Skeet

YOU SAID
>
>Link didn't work for me? Any ideas?

I SAID

>>Just a short posting to let you know about a Swedish product I have had on 
>>my 1973 VW Type 2, since the mid-1980s and which is now available by mail 
>>order, direct from the manufacturers.
>>
>>The SVD wash/wiper blade has a hollow rubber filler (fed by a thin rubber 
>>tube), with small holes at about 2 or 3 inch intervals, so that water is 
>>delivered to the glass, along the leading edge.
>>
>>They use very little water in comparison to standard washer jets and are 
>>completely unaffected by wind or vehicle speed. I thoroughly recommend 
>>this product!
>>
>>For illustations and details in Swedish, see the following website:-
>>
>>http://hem.passagen.se.zelus/
>>
>>Prices are quoted in Swedish Kroner for complete kits and replacement 
>>rubber blade fillers. £1 Sterling = 1.4 US$ = 15 SwKr.
>>
>>My Swedish friend from university originally bought some for me, at his 
>>local car accessory shop and more recently gets more by mail order before 
>>he visits me in Great Britain, if I need any.
>>
>>Hopefully full details of this and other windscreen wiper & washer 
>>innovations and accessories, will be published by the British VW Type 2 
>>Owners' Club; either in the Technical Information Booklets or the 
>>bi-monthly club magazine, "Transporter Talk".
>>
>>Look at the rear-window washers of the modern Mercedes Vito vans for 
>>another interesting washer system, which is almost identical to that 
>>forming my 1973 VW Type 2, pantograph rear-window wiper & washer system.
