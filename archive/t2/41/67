It is almost too much to bear, but the time has come to pass the hooptie
along.  She's been in my care for about a year and I've graced her with a
new longblock (from Old Volks of AZ), new tires, new exhaust, new carb, new
clutch cable.  She's been my daily driver up here in the NW and I can say
she's been dependable and that the heat works just fine.  Wish I could keep
her, but the my story is an old one: family expansion.  I'm asking $6,000
obo.
