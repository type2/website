Eric
Thank you for your response and recommendation.  What is the serial # of your 
dizzy?
Sounds like you got the dual vacuum advance dist.  This is the single vacuum 
advance dist. (the only vacuum access is out of the "can"). My question is 
whether to connect the vacuum line to the manifold or above the manifold 
(different vacuum characteristics)
I think the vacuum should be connected to the lower manifold...but not sure...
Thanks Again
