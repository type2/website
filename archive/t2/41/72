Subject: Heads up on Harad starting in F.I. vans

Just a quick heads up. My Westy was being difficult to
start in the mornings since purchased used about a
year ago. Went through the usual cold start injector
routine, etc., but it turns out that the COIL was
slowly heading south. It finally gave up completely
the other day, and when Mike Adams and myself
installed a new coil, the hard starting in the
mornings disappeared as well! Somehow the coil was
affecting the first starts of the morning. Just
thought I'd mention that as a possible cause that
people might overlook. The difference in starting in
the mornings is incredible, first fireup in 1 second
with a nice idle.
Regards,
Courtney
