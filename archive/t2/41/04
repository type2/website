Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment? 

I've taken speedometers apart (mostly to fix problems with the odometer) and
they're pretty neat to check out but not much you yourself can do to fix the
speedometer accuracy.  I think to correct a speedometer accuracy problem,
you have to adjust the preload on the speedometer return spring.  To do this
correctly would require some sort of test setup where you can get known
speeds from an input drive while you adjust until you get it right.  I
suppose you could also adjust, put it in the Bus and drive to see how you
did, then take it out and adjust again and so on until you get it right but
that's not worth the hassle for me :-)

I would suggest just removing the speedometer and sending the whole unit to
a place like Speedometer Plus (http://www.speedometerplus.com) and they will
recondition the whole thing, not only adjusting it for accuracy but fixing
that annoying chatter it makes when it's cold, fixing any odometer problems
and in general making the whole thing look and work like new.  I sent them
an '84 Mercedes speedometer and they did a great job on it (it's basically
the same VDO unit as our Buses have).  Haven't gotten around to sending them
the Bus speedometer yet but I will get to it :-)
