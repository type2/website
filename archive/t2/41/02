I have my tire on the front because 

.  I like the looks up there
.  I couldn't fit a piece of plywood in the back with it in there
.  It is easier to get to the check the air and/or change the tire
.  I live in the city with a lot of parallel parking, it helps protect the
front from the inevitable dents and dings from folks from the suburbs who
don't know how to parallel park with big SUV's.
.  Oh did I mention, I think it looks sharp up front.
.  makes it easier to get the canoe on and off the roof

never put the tire on the front for crash protection
