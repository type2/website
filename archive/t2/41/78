Jeremy, this is a traditional way of shrinking metal.  It is not quite so
slapdash.  You heat a small spot in the center of the stretch until dull
red, then quench, then work in circles outward.  I'll confess I have not
mastered this, but good metal guys tell me this is the way to do it.

I think you also have to be realistic about how much shrinkage you can hope
for.  if the damage is real serious, you'd be better to cut and patch.

Grant
