Subject: Fuel filter for gas =?iso-8859-1?q?heater=3F?=

I'm getting ready to install a gas heater in my Bus.  Should I install
a fuel filter on the gas line feeding the gas heater or does it not
matter?    Also was wondering if someone has a better copy of the
Stewart-Warner manual then what is in the Library.  The scanned
pictures just do not print out that well.  

Thanks,

Kevin
