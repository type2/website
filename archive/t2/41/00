Can't say I have an Idea but I seem to have a similar problem right now and 
look forward to suggestions on a possible fix.  "Janis" left turn sig. works 
fine but the right burns the fuse and causes the fuel gauge to slam to full? 
  and does not function otherwise?

Anyone have a suggestion?  I'm thinking either short on right, bad relay or 
switch.  Anybody?
