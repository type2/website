I have heard Wally Mart allows camping in some of their parking lots but =
maybe that is just an urban legend.

On our way to Everybus this year, Wal Mart security freaked out when our =
caravan of 11 buses rolled into their parking lot! One of our group =
overheard security being told to order us off their property! When we =
informed them we were there as customers they lightened up, but I sure =
wouldn't try to spend the night in one of their parking lots-although I =
do see a lot of big motor homes in the lot of the one in town.
