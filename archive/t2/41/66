Subject: Re: titles in california

I got my 71 with no title. It cost me a whopping $15 to get a duplicate
title. I was lucky that mine had been on a non-op since last registered in
'93.

Go to the DMV site online (http://www.dmv.ca.gov/forms/formsreg.htm) and
download the application for a duplicate title
(http://www.dmv.ca.gov/forms/reg/reg227.htm).

Fill it out and turn it in. If it's currently registered or on a non-op then
your only cost should be the $15. If not then back fees may be due.
