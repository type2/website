Thanks for the info Karl.  Note everybody that's why I said I don't know how
to adjust it.

The speedometer I sent off to Speedometer Plus read about 5 mph fast when I
sent it and it was dead accurate when I got it back.
I suspect that the spring weakens over time and perhaps they are putting new
springs in (I didn't ask at the time) when they recondition them.
