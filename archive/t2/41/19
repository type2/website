Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment?


Correct. When I wrote "There is nothing to adjust in a speedo head if it reads
too fast.", I was answering the original question as to 'what could HE adjust'.
Here is William's original question:

"I have 71 westy and the indicated speed is around 20-25mph+!!!!....when you
take apart the speedo, what do you adjust to make it right? How difficult is
it to take the speedo apart?"

Then the one about adjusting the spring came up and I replied "Whoa......"

I thought my explanation about the speedo needle and how it works was written in
as simple as could be written so a LAYMEN could understand it but I guess
not.....

I guess I won't be sending any thing more technical then 2 + 2 = 4 to the list
anymore.....

Well, it is a little difficult if you don't have a 4 pole magnetizer.
American cars use a 2 pole magnet. A 2 pole magnetizer will not work on VDO
speedos.
