Subject: Help on the rubber 

I just installed new rubber on the front doors & back hatch (71westy). Front 
worked well but for the left side needs a good slam to close, hope this well 
get better well time.

Now to the slider. Do I have remove the door to get the seal in place?  This 
will be some work, so if I can avoid this I would like to.

Thank you, for your help.
