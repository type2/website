Subject: Need wiring diagram for 1995 VW Eurovan

This is passed along from my dad, who is not on the list.  If you reply,
you may reply to him directly at tibi(-at-)mindspring.com or I can pass it
back to him.

--- Start Dad ---
Can you locate a wiring diagram for  the 1995 Eurovan, particularly the
portion dealing with the starter motor.

My problem is this.  Battery is good.  Engine will not crank when the key is
turned to the start position.  I ran a voltage test at the solenoid, + terminal
and received no voltage when the key was turned to the start position.  I then
ran a jumper between the positive battery post and the solenoid, + terminal and
it engaged the solenoid and cranked the engine.  There might be a switch on the
automatic transmission that only allows it to start if it is in Park or
Neutral, but I haven't found it yet.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dallas
