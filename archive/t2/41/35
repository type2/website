Yes. I like to think that the Virgin of Guadalupe was looking out for us
that night.  She now adorns my dashboard at all times, more to remind me
to take my own fate seriously in my own hands every time I drive than out
of any serious faith that she or any other deity would intervene if I were
to be so stupid twice.  And I have never driven after dark in Baja in the
8 years and dozen or so trips since.

Vaya con dios,
