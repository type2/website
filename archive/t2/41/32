The last thing that you want is an elastic collision!  If something
bounces off the front of the bus it will impart even more momentum change
to the bus and you.

Accelerating any multi-hundred pound object from 0 to the speed you are
going in a few inches will cause incredible forces.

Something I pondered seriously as I drove along Canadian roads with forest
growing right up to the edge of the road.  On a motorcycle.  Someone told
me that moose can even run through thick woods despite their racks.

A few miles north of the place where I hit the deer we had met (the year
before) a fellow in a pickup that had hit a yearling steer with his F-350
F*rd truck with a very hefty full-width grillguard,  The impact had bent
the frame and shoved the grillguard into the grill, as well as wiping out
the radiator.  Coolent, transmission fluid, and diesel fuel were all
running onto the ground.

Be careful out there!
