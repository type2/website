I'd expect it is a military application.  The lead number staring in -181
is a Thing part as I recall, and Things were originally intended for the
military..

I know that my '71 has a different coil specified than the beetle of the
same year.  I've no idea of the difference except that the Bus coil is a
few dollars more.  Perhaps it has more turns to make up for the longer
ignition circuit.  This "bus coil" had normal connections.

More evidence of a military connection.
