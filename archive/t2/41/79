Any of the 1600 engine cases will work if you are
willing to tap it for the moustache bar or run an
oil-pump/moustache bar adapter plate. However, what
I'd do is get a new case, almost all of which are
tapped for the moustache bar already. I just bought
one, myself, set me back around $350. Well worth it,
IMHO. 

Don't know diddly about remounting a Westy top,
though.
