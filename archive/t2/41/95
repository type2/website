Metal shrinking is slowly becoming a lost art.  The last time I use a torch 
to shrink was back in Auto Body school.  First off water is a major no-no.  
As for the torch, the tip is way small, think it was a #00 tip.  Like I said 
it's been a long time.  Basically you heat your high spot till it glows red, 
then quickly place your dolly behind your high spot.  Then hammering, 
actually it's more like a hammer slide stroke, push the metal toward the 
center of your high spot.  Working fairly fast, you work your way around your 
red spot.  Just as the red spot starts to fad you hit it with compressed air. 
 Body file the area and see how much more you need to go.  Warning, to much 
shrinking will make the metal brittle!! The trouble with using a torch is 
there is an awful lot of heat.  Technology has moved forward and most 
shrinking is now done with special tip for Dent Masters and stud guns.  These 
have more control and heat a smaller area.  Also there is less danger of 
fire.  The best advice, no matter how you do your shrinking is practice, 
practice, practice.
