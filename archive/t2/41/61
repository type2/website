Subject: Failing to start when warm?

Hi,

I've noticed that over the past few weeks, my '75 bay has been failing to
start. Not when it's cold in the morning, but when I've been driving for a
while and then stopped for 20 minutes to an hour or so (ie, going to the
shops or whatever, ie the engine is still a little warm). It seems to start
from cold first time everytime, and it'll start again if I cut the engine
and restart it straight away. If it's been 20 minutes or so then it just
turns by the starter and fails to catch, even with heavy pumping of the
accelerator (gas pedal).

Anyone any ideas what may be causing this? I'm a total novice machanic by
the way (or a John Muir complete idiot, whichever yo prefer ;)

Thanks

Paul James.
