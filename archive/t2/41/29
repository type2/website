Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal indicator works only in one side

My 74 Riviera has a single light on the dash with both left and right arrows
on it. When the signal is activated the light flashes illuminating both
arrows. The lens is so small that there's no way two bulbs would fit behind
it, besides that fact that even if there were two bulbs, either buld
lighting up would illuminate both arrows since they're on a single lens.
