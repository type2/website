George,
  I suppose in the unlikely event that you were to
rear end a truck with an over hanging load such as a
pipe or 4X4 and you were lucky enough to take it in
the spare... it would spread the force over a larger
area and lesson the chance of the pipe/4X4 of punching
through into the cab.
  Or say you are running down some cool back road at
say 35-40 MPH and it is getting to be dusk... Out of
the blue there is a 1/4" steel cable stretched across
the road. I think that having the tire up front to
spread the force across a greater area would probably
prevent the cable from turning das bus into a Vert an
you into a Veg. (just maybe)
  There are absolutely no absolutes.
