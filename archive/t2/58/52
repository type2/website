FORD is still doing this??? They were having problems with exactly that 
with the flathead engines back in 1932!!!

The engines had a reputation for running hot until a few hot rodders 
started really examining these things. One fellow was interviewed on a TV 
show and held up a mason jar half full of casting sand pulled out of one 
block recently.

Guess our air cooled engines wouldn't quite have the same problem....
