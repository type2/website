Subject: mystery e-mails from the list?

I recieved e-mails from a question posed to the list.

Volkswagen Restorations USA
and
 Joel L.
  Both were blank wth the exception of some...

stuff... tried to email them back but both
addresses returned undeliverable. So my
curiosity is up.... Who? What?

  My question had to do with Bry's wrecking yard
in Seattle Wa. and if it was still closed or what.

thanks,
