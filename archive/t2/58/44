A listmember has pointed out a factual inaccuracy here.  While VW has
already discontinued the Brazilian Beetle, and 5 months ago announced plans
to discontinue it in Mexico, they have not actually ceased Mexican
production yet.  Production will continue there for 2-3 more years, but its
days are now officially numbered.
