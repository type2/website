Hi Ken,

Good to know what it is.  I must confess that I have never cut open a
working thermostat to see what's in it.  But alcohol definitely qualifies as
a volatile fluid.  When I was a kid I had a trick glass that had a thin
cavity of colored alcohol under vacuum which would boil when you put it to
your lips.  Looked like you were drinking  boiling liquid.

These devices have other interesting applications such as in tracking mounts
for solar panels.  The sun heats up the reservoir and causes the fluid to
migrate toward the cool (i.e. low pressure) end, and the ensuing weight
shift makes the carefully balanced set of panels follow the sun.  I think
those systems do use freon, but you could probably use paint thinner or
gasoline with enough vacuum.

All of these volatiles have strong tendencies toward thermal expansion,
which is why your paint thinner can goes thump if you leave it in the sun.

Regards,

Grant
