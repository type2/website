Steve is great!  He gave me advice on a lock problem and turned me into a
do-it-yourself- rekeyer!

> I just wanted to post a little info concerning one of our fellow list
members, Steve Sandlin.  We hear from Steve from time to time concerning
lock and key issues for our busses, and I sent him a whole set of new locks
for my 71 Bus for him to key-alike.  His turn-around time is fantastic, and
he takes the time to communicate and follow-up like all service providers
should.  He has my highest recommendation, and hopefully all list members
will be able to do business with Steve in the future.

it's important to also give praise when it's due.
