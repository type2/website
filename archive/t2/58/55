When making mods like this, think about the poor guy that has to work on
your creation afterward.  I certainly hope that the previous "mechanics"
of my bus feel a small pain every time I have found, cursed, and repaired
their "innovations".

I think that the type 4 cooler mod is probably a good thing, and it isn't
all that hard to do correctly.  If you aren't a welder, you can still
space the housing out with strips of metal and pop-rivet the thing in
place in a workmanlike manner.  Don't forget that you will also have to
modify the ductwork tin to match!
