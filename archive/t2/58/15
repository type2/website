Subject: Domain Changes


Just a quick note to testify: I'm told that the vintagebus.com website has
now completed its move; vintagebus.com and type2.com are now together in the
same server, which is the excellent box that was bought with your donations
earlier this year. This has been an "inevitably someday" thing for years,
but now it's happened, you're all under the same roof, both list-wise and
web-wise.

Hope I didn't steal any of Thom's thunder saying that!

Also, the domain registration admin contact and billing contact have been
transferred to Thom tonight; technical contact is David Raistrick. In
internet terms, Thom now owns both type2.com and vintagebus.com and has
ultimate control over those domains. That's cool, I know they're in good
hands, and I know the lists will maintain the free flow of bus information
as they always have. Administrative staff for both mailing lists hasn't
changed, nor webmaster staff, all of whom are excellent people.

Sort of a sentimental night for me. That was a long ride and it was pretty
cool too, but lately I've been driving a *toff* Volvo and the world does
change. =^ )
