Folks,

I drove my 78 Champagne edition over to my Mom's house last Saturday!

Got the title and tags finished up on wed afternoon and the new push rod
seals in on Friday.  First side took about 4 hours and the second side
took about 1 hour.  Nobody *told* me that I was gonna have to
pound(tap) them back in with force!  I thought I could gently push and
twist...but no biggie.  It runs pretty good for 132,000 and sitting for 8
years.

I used the 1.5 turns from contact to set the valves.....but! I had several
lifters that were not pumped....set them as close as I could and went
on.  Things now seem very quiet, except for #1 cylinder.  Intake lifter
just never seemed to pump up...even ran it for a little while and
immediately jerked the cover off and it was still "soft".

Do I need a new one?  It only makes the noise at idle and if you ignore
the noise, the exhaust sounds pretty good.  Anything over idle and it
sounds like a good engine....and runs fairly decently as well!

BTW...the valve covers leaked like having *no* gaskets, but there
was....this is a lesson in what to put rtv on and what not to.

both sides of the gaskets were literally soaked in rtv before they were
put on, instead of cleaning the crap off of the sealing sufraces on
the heads...once I got them cleaned up, I have *no* oil leaks...I am
impressed!

Do hydraulic lifters really go bad?....please don't revisit the solid vs
hydro and cam question....If a lifter goes bad, then you are going to
replace it(period).  Can I get the lifter out without pulling the pushrod
tubes again?

Cheers, dave
