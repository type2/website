Subject: Re: [T2] RE:Finishing Interior

Hey ya Barry and Volks,

I've been that same rout and there is no good way to stain or refinish this 
stuff that I've tried!  My Bro in law painted the interior spray can red and 
put yellow,blue & black spray dots when I had given "Janis" to him years 
ago, so I had to remove the panels including the roof when she was given 
back!

The solution I've proceeded with is replace all panels with the kind of 
paneling you back a book shelf with.  I have stained it Mahogany Red with 
polyurithane mounting it with brass screws.  I'm now in the process of 
covering all interior cabinets with panels which will also be stained and 
held on with the brass screws.

The roof is another problem and the archives have a great deal to say on the 
subject ordering 1/8" baltic burch and sources but are beyond my capasity so 
I have chosen to replace it with a suitable counter top formica.

It's been extreamly slow project but so far so good!  She's looking very 
sharp and can't wait to show her off at the next campout we're able to make 
it to, prolly next spring or fall.

Good luck on your project!
