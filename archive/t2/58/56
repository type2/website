Subject: hit & run UPDATE!!!!

well i decided to come home for lunch today & cruise the neighborhood
looking for the vehicle that hit my bus last week.

FOUND IT!!!!  it's only about 5 houses down from mine.  just called the PD &
they are on their way.  i will keep the list updated as to the results.

also, i want to say thanks again to everyone out there who has written with
their suggestions/condolences/kind words.

hopefully this will all work out.
