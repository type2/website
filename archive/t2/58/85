Volks,

Just so you know, next time you think that the "no attachments, no html,
ASCII plain text only" rules are annoying....  This is why they exist!  If
you get a worm/virus and it e-mails itself to the list, the list will kick
it back automatically.

David Raistrick started the ASCI Ribbon thing and I suppoort it intensely,
but it has been list policy since the days when Ken ran the list.  Nothing
but ASCII text belongs in e-mail.  Free web sites are just too easy for
transferring html and binary (.gif, .jpg, .mp3, .wav, etc. etc.) files
with way more controls (hint: automatically execute NOTHING!!!)
