Subject: ignition lock questions

Hello all,

My 71 Westy's ignition lock sometimes depresses about 1/4" into the column.
In order for me to turn the engine, I have to stick my key in and wiggle out
the lock. What is going on with this? What do I need to do fix it?

Also, the passenger side door lock is broken off, and the lock came out of
the handle...Can locksmith put a new lock in, or should I just buy a handle
with the lock and have it rekeyed?

Lastly, sometimes the turn signal handle won't stay on the right turn
position, and I had to hold it and gently let it go to have it stayed on the
right turn position. I took it apart and found the metal retaining ring made
about 1/8" groove in to the metal bracket, so I put a rubber strip to hold
the handle on the column. Do I need to change out the metal bracket to fix
the problem?

Thanks for your help!!!
William
