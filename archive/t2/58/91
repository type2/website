With all the recent/ continuing talk about Bus Depot's shipping speed, I =
thought this might be relevant.  Some people have had good experiences =
and some bad.  I have always been one to make my own decision about =
things like this, especially when opinions vary so greatly.  So, with =
good spirit in mind and credit card in hand, I picked up the phone and =
placed the order.

I dialed direct, opting not to use the 800 number, since I had some =
questions.
The on-phone experience was easy and rather pleasant.  I spoke with a =
rather nice young (sounding) man named Andy.  Andy took the order and =
verified my parts numbers matched his part (so I get what I expect to =
get.)  He then, on my request, checked to see what was in the warehouse. =
 Anything that would delay the shipment, went on back order so I would =
(will) get everything else a.s.a.p.  And one item is to be drop shipped =
direct from the supplier.  In all, I ordered 20 items totaling about =
$426, paid with Visa.

Ordering was easy.  Will it arrive in the "promised" 7-10 days?  We =
shall see.

more to come....
