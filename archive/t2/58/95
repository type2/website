Mmmm, sounds like trouble, Beth.
Like my Camper that had a little rust in the floor
until we left it a couple of months.
Then we had rust in the drivers step,wheel arches,
passenger floor & step, front apron, drivers side
skirts and cargo floor and windscreen.
And we don't even know what's going on with the
engine, which could be VERY costly to replace or
repair if it's a 1700,1800 or 2litre.
If your "friend" has such little disregard for the
upkeep of her bus I'd say it probably is worth a LOT
less than the storage fees.
Good luck...but don't hold your breath:-/
Let's hope someone comes along that'll give it the
respect it deserves.
Cheers
Andrew
