Hi Grant,

I believe if you cut open a new one you will find that the volatile fluid is
plain old isopropynol (rubbing alcohol), which with its boiling point of
~175 degrees F is just about right.

Or I could be wrong, which would not cause me to throw a tantrum. I'm
usually wrong anyway. Marriage taught me that. It is bachelors causing all
the trouble around here. =^ )
