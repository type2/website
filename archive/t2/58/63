Subject: hit & run - another update

the cop is being really cool about it,
 but still there isnt much he can do since there are no witnesses.
 anyway the dude said he would pay for the damages,
 even though he wasnt the one driving the truck (yeah, sure).

the officer really put on a show for this guy.  he told him there is a
witness who saw the truck hit my bus when in fact there isnt. he also
got out a plastic evidence baggie & scraped paint from the guy's truck
& told him it was going to be sent off to the lab to be matched to
the paint on my bus.

haha.

of course all this was just BS with the intention of getting a confession
out of the alleged perpetrator. but he still denies being the one driving.
however, he did agree that his truck was definitely involved in the
incident & also agreed to pay to have my bus fixed.

so, i am remaining optimistic.   i still have the option to sue his
 insurance company if he refuses to pay, but i dont want to go through
 all that.

now, off to get some estimates!

thanks again everyone. & a special thanks to the PD. the officer really put
the heat on this guy.  i think i will be making a charitable donation this
holiday season to a fund set up for an officer in our town who was recently shot
while on duty.
