O.k.,Jeremy, I think I can go one better.
Didn't include this one before because I thought we
weren't counting trailers.
When we still owned our 76 camper "Daisy" I found the
ad in the classifieds for the 67 Panel splitty that I
now own. 
I figured "Daisy's got a 2.0litre & a towball, why
not?"
So I arranged through a friend who works for a hire
firm to get a car trailer for the day for nothing.
We rocked up to his place of work to find that the
aforementioned trailer was actually a heavy duty model
capable of carrying small trucks and weighed 750kgs
all by itself.
Yours truly thinks "No sweat, VW engines are renowned
for that lowdown torque" and hooks up the extra heavy
trailer.....well actually it took two people lifting
the front of the trailer and another standing on the
back to lever it up high enough to mount it on the tow
ball.
The CV joints on Daisy were pretty done in but we
pulled out and cruised toward the owners house to pick
up my new acquisition.
So we loaded up the stripped down panel which still
had all the removed body panels and tyres inside onto
the trailer.
Then we put the glass, the engine case and everything
else under the sun into the back of Daisy. 
She also had he camping interior complete with 3 way
fridge....I can't BELIEVE I did it to this day!
She averaged about 60km/h(40mph)with a gross weight of
about 4000kg or 8800lbs!
The engine wasn't new and leaked oil like the Exxon
Valdez and the gearbox was as tempermental as
manic-depressive without his medication but she kept
on pulling even though the CV's had to be replaced
within a month.
How we got the split up my 35 degree driveway when it
had no brakes and it was obvious the camper couldn't
reverse up(I did consider it though:-) it is an
ENTIRELY different tale:-)
Cheers
