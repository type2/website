Mmmm, never done a piano myself but my wife works for
a charity that provides medium term housing and they
were  putting together Christmas hampers last year for
their tenants.
We put the contents of three pallets of food into the
76 Camper we had then,packed right up to the roof in
places, and Daisy(our camper) cruised like it was no
effort.
She was a little slower off the lights but the
suspension handled like it should've been loaded like
that all the time.
It was firm but comfy like a nice lounge:-)
We also loaded an entire drum kit, a 4x12" speaker
cabinet, a 15" speaker box, a guitar combo amp, bass
amp head and Marshall guitar amp head, 2 electric
guitars,1 acoustic guitar, a bass guitar, a bag full
of leads and pedals, a surf board, sleeping bags and
bags of clothes when we played music for a Boy Scout
Jamboree in January this year.
And that doesn't include the full camper interior
which  took up part of the room.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew
