Subject: Re: [T2] bus utility


This won't top anybody's tale, but I moved from Connecticut to Utah in my 
'72 bus (Janusz, named for a previous owner) loaded with every single thing 
I own plus a set of gaming tables I was hauling for my flatmate. I made it 
in four days, and the starter died on my during day one; I had to park on 
hills and push-start the old beast every day.

This trip was the bus' second cross-country trek... I bought it in CT from a 
rich kid who'd had his parents buy it for him in California because he 
thought it would be fun to drive across the country in one, but the seats 
were so uncomfortable he didn't want to drive it back! I solved that with a 
couple $5 seat cushions from Walmart and haven't suffered a sore bum since.
