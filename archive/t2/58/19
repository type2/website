Mmmm,well so's Ford.
The minister from my church found out the hard way
that they hadn't cleaned all of the sand from the
casting process out of the engine block.....in North
Western Queensland(Australia) when the ambient
temperature was 42 degrees Celcius or well over 100
farenheit.
The engine seized and every piece of rubber or plastic
fused to the engine.
He got NO support or re-imbursement.
The car was 2 years old.
Lets face it....the corporations SUCK.
