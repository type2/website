Shawn, Mike:
Try to find one the same BRAND manufacturer. I think there may have been 4 or
possibly 5 total brands:
Mahle and Kolbenschmidt would have been original.
NPR, Cofap,and possibly a Taiwanese no-name are aftermarket.
Because of differences in the steel strut design, they can weigh a lot
different.
NPR's out of the box were within about 1/4 gram when I built my 78 back in the
mid 80's. Good stuff.
