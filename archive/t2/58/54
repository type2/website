Hey All,

After the debate yesterday, I was curious to see just how many of these
item's were really available.

A quick phone call to my guy at the local VW parts depot, proved
fruitfull.

He called the VW parts warehouse here in Chicago, and there is the total
of two here, and 147 nationwide.

So in retrospect, if a parts guru, tells anyone that they are NLA, they
are looking for the wrong item, or they just don't want to be bothered.

The correct thermostats are available, if the parts purveyor is on the
ball.

The search is now completed.


Later,
