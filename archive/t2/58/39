Bob:
It sure would be neat to check out their dumpster from time to time. I've heard of
lots of neat stuff being thrown away. Back in 1985 I got a list of scrap parts
from the national warehouse. Among other things I bought a new front floor for a
69 and 2 of each side rear pickup corners for 68-71. I think I gave about $12 for
the floor and $9 each for the corners!
I know it sounds crazy now, but I was pretty impoverished back then and I did not
as yet even HAVE a pickup! I did know what they were and wanted one really bad!
Considered doing it the Johnny Cash way- one piece at a time! (Never did tell my
wife. Hell, she probably suspects even worse!)
