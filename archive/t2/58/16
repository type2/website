What Dealer?

The Autobarn
Mt.Prospect ILL.
847-392-6300

Ask for Dave the parts Mgr.

Pt # 021-119-159-A

If you contacted any VW dealer with that particular parts number, they
would be able to get you one-----Like I said they are in ( or should be
) a national VW parts warehousing data base----

Later,

Terrence
