The reflectors in your taillights are made to work with a small filament
that is positioned in just the right place.  The LED bulbs tend to ruin
the focus of the assembly, resulting in a single "hot spot" rather than an
evenly illuminated lens.

I'm working on a LED taillight idea with the LEDs actually mounted in the
lens.  This way the narrow beams of the individual LEDs will be aimed
directly aft so that the light will be where it is the most useful.

When I get it done, I'll let you know how it works!
