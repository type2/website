Subject: Engine Builder expereince

Can anyone shed any light on their experience with engine builders Fast
German Auto (http://www.fastgermanauto.com/) or JustVeeDubs, which seems
to have many alias on the web  (http://www.justveedubs.com). Both have
web pages that seem to indicate they will deliver a quality engine with
new parts (lifters/cams/heads, ...).

What is the communities experience?
