Subject: Re: [T2] re removing Pitman arm and drag link end.

Yes, I tried using a 2 jaw puller the other day, there's no way, it just
keeps popping off.  I just borrowed a Snap On pitman arm puller from a local
performance shop. They told me that to remove the drag link, you hit the bar
on the side, beside where the tapered link end enters the Pitman arm. I know
you're not to hit the threads on the link.

I pulled mine using a Sears two arm gear puller......and it was SCARY!
Kept popping off, violently.  I finally put a C-clamp on the arms, and got
it off
that way.  I don't recommend you do the same, though.  Get a two arm puller
that has some sort of adjustable brace between the arms, built in.  I've
seen
'em before, and will buy one, when I see one next.  This would be a tool you
could use for more than one thing, and avoid having a slipped off puller
going
through your skull trying to pull that d(-at-)mn Pitman arm.
