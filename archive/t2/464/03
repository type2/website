Scott,
Your right on the money with the Hydro seal--
Cleans cabs squeeky clean in minutes---

As far as the carbon removal on the pistons go ---I would try them at an
hour interval---this stuff is strong--
If you get it on your fingers or hands--I do know it'll turn them to a
rubber like substance for a couple of days--

Pretty hard to locate too--most FLAPS used to handle it--not too many do
anymore--but worth looking for---it does work excellent for cleaning any
kind of metal---clean---

I've cleaned up and rebuilt many an AFB using this super product---

Later,


Terry

Hiya everybody,
                Anyone know any tips on
how to dissolve carbon from pistons without destroying the surface?

Gunk makes a solvent called hydroseal which works very well. Soak the
pistons in it overnight and they will be clean. Sometimes a brush is
needed.
