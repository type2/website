Subject: re:Where to find brake booster hose???

Daniel Nelson sez:

"My FLAPS doesn't have it, busdepot.com doesn't have it, where can I find
it, I just need a little, 2ft should be plenty. Does anyone have some? It's
for my 71."

Bus-boys.com lists "N 20390.12  Hose - High Pressure Rated For Servo Vacuum,
Bus/Pickup/Vanagon 71-91 $10.75 per foot
"

Sounds a bit high to me, but I haven't bought any in a long time.
