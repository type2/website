Subject: Re: [T2] Engines

About those Mexican engines: I had one shop encourage me to get one and another shop pooh-pooh'ed them, saying, with a kind of a sniff, "Well, that's fine if you want a low-compression engine."  Any other thoughts from those who've tried them?

Thanks.

to my door in two days and they have worked just like new engines ever
since!  No drips, start and idles perfect, and pushes the bus and bug
just fine.
