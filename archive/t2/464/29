Subject: cooling tin and t-stat

 When looking at my new '75 bus last night, I noticed that the thermostat
cable has come loose from the flaps. So, I pop under the van and see that
the thermostat is still there. My first question is, this being a 411/412
engine, I think, (EA engine code and 4 stud heads), am I missing some tin
down there if I can see the thermostat? My next question is, I need to heat
the thermostat up before I install it, right? My Bentley is kinda vague on
this. Or I don't get it. Thanks for all the help.

Dan
