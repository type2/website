Subject: Heater/defrost cable part number?

Corbett,

IF . . you don't find that cable NEW, I have a good USED one ($10 plus
shipping)
as I just finished parting out a '73 Westy.

I am finishing up my heater repairs and I need to replace a cable that
broke. This is for a 73 Westy. The cable is the short (15 inch?) cable that
runs from the heat/defrost lever down to the flap that it controls.
