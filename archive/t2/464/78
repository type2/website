Subject: BA6 Heater for Sale

Hi all,

Yesterday's heater thread helped me ID the heater I pulled out of my bus.
It's a BA-6 heater from a 79 Westy, that mounts underneath the bus, inline
with the heater tubes. I'm never going to drive my bus in the cold, so I
don't need the heater. I still have yet to pull out the switch and wire
harness, but it's all there. Does it work? I'm not sure, to be honest. But
the unit is in good shape, just some surface rust, etc.

Anyway, I could use some cash to fix up the rest of the bus so I'm going to
put the unit up for sale for $225 obo + shipping from 06095. I'll pull the
harness and switch once someone says they want it. I can also get pics if
anyone needs them, just give me a day to take them.

Just email me if you want more info. I figure this would be a good way to
stay toasty for those of you who actually drive in the cold.
