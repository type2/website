If the cable is broken, the speedo and odometer would stop working.  Unscrew
the cable from the back and see if you can either lift the wire out of the
cable or spin by hand.  If either it is broken and needs to be replaced if
you want it to work.

It might also be broken at the other end (drivers side front wheel) or the
clip might have popped off the cable slipped out of the wheel.

Try all this and you should find your problem.

Good Luck,
