Subject: Speedo removal from dash ..

my '70 bus will be completely color sanded and back
together again (2nd time) next week. i posted a note a
while back regarding my speedo was 20 mph to fast.

im simply going to hop the resting peg and retard the
needle about 15$.

seeing how its a group cluster and not individual is
it easier to remove from the front of dash or remove
just the cluster (not the glass) from under the dash??

peace,
