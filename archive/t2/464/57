What you want is a Late Bay trans from a 1979 that has the 4.57 r&p with
the 0.82 4th
the 091 trans
This trans drives like a 5 speed

I just installed one in my 74, which is a bit more difficult as it is a
carb based body, and uses a 215mm clutch instead of the 228 so I had to
switch bellhousings as well as the hanger cradle.

I just love how quiet the bus is now at 120km/hr with rpms lowered.

check it out, I think you'll find it much cheaper than a 5 speed,, and you
won't have to shift as often!
