Did the orignal question get answered? There are two cables:

72-79 (3215mm) 211-721-335J
68-71 (3200mm) 211-721-335E

It's obvious the end of the cable is different and requires a different clevis pin. The cable is only slightly longer so will the later pin fit the clutch pedal lever on the older bus?
