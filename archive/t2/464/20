so many complaints about cables being too long. They've cut it down to 2

generic lengths that aren't really right for anything? Tom

From the pre-internet it'll get you home but no further files:
A too long cable can be shortened enough to get you home...
You need a "brake cable shortener" (and don't ask if they're
still available)...Years ago my cable snapped and I really didn't
want to drive through NYC without a clutch (too many stops).
I had another with me that I thought was the right one but was
too long...I found a small auto parts joint with the aforementioned
"brake cable shortener" a metal "Y" with a threaded hook that puts
a tensioned kink in the cable to shorten it. It was just enough to
use the wing nut to adjust the clutch...
