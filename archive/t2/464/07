Subject: RE: [T2] how to dissolve carbon

Buy a gallon bucket of carb cleaner from any auto parts store. I've
typically seen the Berryman's brand. Good stuff, but real noxious.
Follow the directions and only use in a very well ventilated area. The
stuff will make you sick if you breathe it.

destroying the surface?
