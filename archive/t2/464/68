Subject: Heater thread

Hello All,
I am currently rebuilding Stewart Warner/ Southwind heaters for Type 2's.  If 
anyone has one and needs it repaired, please contact me.  If you are in need 
of a heater I have a few left.  Contact me for prices and specifics.
Also, I am looking for ductwork that was used to install these heaters.  If 
anyone knows of any in a junkyard or has some lying around please contact me.
I can send photos of the ductwork in question if need be.  
Regards,
Al
