on my 71 could use more brightness.  Do you have to make any changes, other
than the bulbs, to use them?   I bought them off ebay for $14 a pair.  I
don't like them.

My originals are brighter.  The way the LED's work is they aim all the light
out the lens as opposed to the originals that use the reflective back of the
housing to increase brightness.

The LED's themselves are brighter and faster than the original bulbs. I
installed one LED and one original in my 71 Single cab and hit the brakes at
night.  The original bulb was much brighter than the LED.

As for changes made, none it is a straight swap.

Hope this helps.
