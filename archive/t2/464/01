Subject: Yet another towing question :-)

Hi folks, I'm just popping in to ask yet another towing question.

I've this Ford F100 truck that I'm building up (351W etc) to tow a
future bug to Sacramento raceway from San Jose.

Now, I'm tempted to buy a '68 bus and use that to tow the future race
bug instead and sell off the truck. I've a 2276 (with 110 cam) in my
current SB daily driver so power/torque shouldn't be a problem.

I'd have to get rid of one vehicle in order to get another 'cos I'm
out of parking space in front of the house :-(

Does anyone think that flat towing a bug behind a muscled up bus
(Schwartzabus?) would work?

I also have an '82 Westy, but that's yet another (sad) story.

Thanks!
