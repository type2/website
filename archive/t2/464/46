Subject: New River Bridge Opening - West Virginia

The New River Bridge West Virginia festival is this weekend.

I just took vacation time, and I would like to drive down via I-81 tomorrow, 
Thursday AM.  Just hang around, see the sights.

I will be on cell 571 235 4779.

Anyone going to be in the area Friday - Sunday???  Pmail, please.....

I would like a spot to 'camp' in my '78 Westy.....
