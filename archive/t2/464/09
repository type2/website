Subject: [T2] Bus soundproofing - NASA technology

as far as the soundproofing goes  i used the link for sound and noise that was provided here except i used no nasa stuff was to exspensive and i used another alternative.

i cleaned out the bus interior from the back of the front seats all the way to the back window..

got me a 5 gallon jug of roof wet/dry patch and a big puitty knife and started spreading the guke on...

spread it thin enough to coat it no lumps made it smooth...

did the whole bay and let is sit a couple of days and dry a bit..
it will never seem to dry completely...

next i went out to home depot or lowes either one and bought the big sheets of insulation board that are as big as sheets of plywood cant remember the name of it maybe some of the lists carpenters will rememeber the name of this specific insulation board?

anyways i cut the board and lay it over the gooy roof patch and then i was able to crawl around on the top of the board...

after getting these done i insualted the walls with foam and r 13 home insulation (this was a big mistake i will have to fix though so dont use r 13 insulation) {the insulation can be getting wet with condensation and rust the insides of the walls}
i will sooner or later fix this before it causes the interior of my walls damage....


the insulation board was covered with a sheet of carpeting and then coverd that with pergo laminate flooring..

the bus is really really quiet inside now and dont have all the smells of gas and oil that it used to have...exhaust and such..

the metal flooring and its non seeing holes are now covered byt the first layer 
roof patch and then the second layer
insulation board
and the third covered with 
carpet and the 
foyrth covered with 
pergo flooring..

sound thinck but really isnt th at thick.,.,

i also did the front flooring the same way except i used no insulation board.
instead of the insulation board i used the rubber mat that came in the bus front section to go over the top of the roof patch and then i added the carpet i used no pergo in the front also ..
could have but ran out after flooring the back section..


i have somepics if any are interested.. many have already seen them though but if i can find them i would be more than happy to post again...
i used the link for noise and soundproofing as a basic start to learn from...
did make a great change in sound and smell.....

very warm when we went camping at High country bus festival as well..

got cool that night but was plenty warm without a blanket in the bus...

any questions holler back .,.
peace
