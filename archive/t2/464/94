Subject: Re: [T2] LED Replacements for Tail Lights

Andrew,
Having experimented with all kinds of bulbs for some time--and having
come up with a solution to the Vanagon's low watt tail lamp problems---I
hada hard time finding the appropriate bulb for my 74 Westy--and only
because of two reasons--

One, the LEDs are a focused bulbs-and being focused I mean they do not
radiate any light other than straight to the rear of the vehicle in a
pretty narrow beam.
And the lens with its multi faceted lens--in combination with the
reflector present, doesn't throw much light to the rear---

It's a focused narrow beams of light and really not very bright.
Whereas the std bulb uses the reflector--and all the cuts in the lens to
radiate a non focused wide beam of light.

Now, I tried to up the wattage, and I believe I have found a usable
incandescent bulb--that won't melt the lens--and offer twice the
candlepower out the back of the type 2 Buses---
It's a 24 / 48 watt bulb---24 for the running lamps--and 48 for the
brake light.

They have worked well in my 74 with no problems for over a year--I'm
happy--and I also installed them into my front turn signal lamps
too--they make the front end really light up with no penalties--

Scroll down to the "Van Stuff" page below--
There is a picture of the difference between the LED's and the std type
big wattage bulbs in the front end of a Vanagon Westy---you'll see the
difference--the LED's are pretty lame in comparison--and this example
will show you what you can expect from the tail lamps--

Good Luck--

for Tail Lights
Has anyone ever tried those LED cluster bulb replacements for tail light
bulbs? They are supposed to be brighter and turn on faster. Autozone has
them for $16.00 a pair. Are they worth it? The rear lights on my 71
could use more brightness. Do you have to make any changes, other than
the bulbs, to use them?
