Daniel,
    When I replaced mine I was able to get 15/32 of an inch vacuum
hose from a FLAPS.  Not my usual one, but not that far away either.  I
spent a morning with the phone in one hand and the phone book in the
other and just kept calling until I found someone who had it.  And he
we are almost a year later and it works fine and is still in good
condition.  It's not the cloth covered hose, but is thick walled and
has a reinforcement in the rubber of the wall.
