Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable

Man- Look at CIP's website. They only list 2 sizes, one for early and one
for late, and they don't correlate to those sizes. Maybe that's why you hear
so many complaints about cables being too long. They've cut it down to 2
generic lengths that aren't really right for anything? Tom
