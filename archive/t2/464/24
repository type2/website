Subject: Heater/defrost cable part number?

I am finishing up my heater repairs and I need to replace a cable that
broke. This is for a 73 Westy. The cable is the short (15 inch?) cable that
runs from the heat/defrost lever down to the flap that it controls. This is
a small metal flap that also has another cable that controls the heat
entering the passenger compartment. Anybody know what the part number this
cable is so that I can see if Bus Depot has it or a link to it?

Thanks,
Corbett
