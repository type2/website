Subject: Selling My 73 Westy 5-speed (Colorado)

OK, I'm a better mechanic than I am a web page designer or digital picture
taker, but I did finally manage to put up some pics and text about my 73
Westy that I'm selling.  You can read (and see) all about it at
http://home.adelphia.net/~mgensler/bus.html  I'll take some better pictures
this weekend and replace some of the crappier ones so check back next week
to see more...
