Subject: barndoor badge

if somebody could cross post this to vintage bus for me also but on ebay
right now is a supposed barn door wolfsburg badge.  i have one of these at
the house but mine is missing one of the tabs on the sides as i broke it
off on accident DOH!!! anyway, i was wanting to know if this is really what
it is or if this guy is just trying to rip people off.
