Subject: '71 air cleaner question

I just went through John Anderson's procedure in the type2 library on cleaning
the air cleaner . My next question is : does anyone see anything wrong with
soaking the whole bottom portion of the air cleaner (including thermostat) in
kerosene in order to clean out the inside of the neck?

Thanks,
Bill Moon
