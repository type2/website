Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Builder expereince

Like any vendor, there are those with good experiences and those with 
not so good experiences.  I'd suggest that you check the archives and 
draw your own conclusions... (Personally, based on a story on the 
Vanagon list a few years ago, I'd rather walk than do business w/ Fast 
German. There are more reputable vendors out there.  Want an '82 motor?  
Jake Raby and NW Connecting Rod come immetiately to mind.  AVP as well.)
