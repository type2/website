Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake **SHOES** retaining pins

Sorry - I made a typo - these are on the rear brake SHOES - not pads.

The rear brakes have shoes not pads.  Are you referring to the rear shoes or
the front brake pads?

For the rear shoes:
Sounds like you may have the short pins.  Did you compare them to the old
pins for length?

I use a spring tool *while holding the pins in place behind the backing
plate* pushing down on the spring then twisting to lock them into place.
