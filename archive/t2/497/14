This is an aircooled Van right? If so it should have the same transaxle as
the late bays which are not hydraulic clutches. They are cable operated and
it sounds like yours clutch just needs to be adjusted. On the drivers side
of the frame rail beside the tranny you can see where the cable comes out of
the bowden tube and connects to an arm on the tranny with a wing nut. Its
kind of a tight space to get to but that wing nut needs to turned to tighten
the clutch. You should have about an inch of travel at the clutch pedal
before feeling working resistance. Adjust the wing nut one turn and check
the pedal freeplay. Repeat untill you have one inch of freeplay.
