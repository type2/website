The Vanagon list archives have TONS of discussion about putting Mercedes and Audi rims on Vanagons. I know the bolt pattern is the same for late bay busses but don't know if there's a difference in offset. Audi rims need to center hole reamed out to fit correctly.

Several list vendors carry steel and alloy 15" rims for the Vanagon for various prices. Vanagain.com and Fast Forward (http://www.fastforward.ca/) come to mind. A friend put 15" steels on his 82 and loves them -- plenty of tire choices, but can't find hubcaps to fit. 16" steels are also available, but check for clearance before sending the $$. IIRC they won't work on Vanagons unless you're driving a TriStar.
