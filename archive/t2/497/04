Subject: lugg. rack "trim?"

OK, thanks for all replies..
one more question on this pop-top project then I'm done!
 
73 Westy..
I know there is no seal for the luggage rack due to drainage....
but, GoWesty has a "luggage rack trim"
Is this OK to put on, was it "stock," or is it just supposed to be plain, will it prohibit drainage...is this just for looks to match the pop-top seal?
thanks in advance for helping me finish this up!  
-Chris
