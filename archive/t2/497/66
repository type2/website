I can tell you something Scott,

I got the same seats you describe in your deluxe westy for my old '76 weekender from Nate Morse (nateswaterart.com, now something else)
when he was parting out his deluxe '79 westy.

So I believe your seats are stock, perhaps only for a short time in the production of T2's. Vanagon owners?

What can you tell me about those seats? My 79 mexico beige, brown plaid westy has seats that are almost exactly like those (brown velour with the same topstitching
