for sure the seal is blown, not expensive and get two, they are easy to
damage,  bus depot had em last I checked

without fluid a noise is almost inevitable, but you won't know until seal
is repaired.  lousy way to find out if you have to drop the engine a
second time

a good tool box and a good jack is about all the special tools you need.
it is definately a two person job if you haven't done it before.
I pull only the engine, because it is lighter and less likely to damage
the shift linkages.  others pull engine and tranny together

having a spare tranny would be the best bet.

specific tips for that repair
