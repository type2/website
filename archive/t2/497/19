Subject: Decel valve

There is a round gold colored diaphragm looking thing mounted in the front of
the engine compartment with 3 hoses going to/from it. I found a picture of it
on Richard's site labeled as a "Decel valve". Can anyone tell me what this is
and what it does? The small short hose is cracked and needs to be replaced. I
didn't know if this thing carries fuel or just vacuum or what.

Thanks,

Mike
