Subject: Sliding door off it's track

I bought a '73 VW Standard Bus a couple months ago. Runs great...and now
that I put an exhaust on it it doesn't even throw flames any more...that was
cool though. Interior original and great. Exterior has surface rust and rot
on inner and outer rockers on both sides and beat up lower corners at both
sides in the rear...all repairable with repair panels from the catalogs I
think. The only body work issue that gives me a bit of concern is that the
slider door comes off in your hand if you don't hold it up into the top
track as you open and close it. The reason is that the bottom track is
rusted through in the very front, allowing the peg that goes in that track
to drop and the top peg falls down of of the top track. I see that the
catalogs also show a track for sale that looks like it is intended for this
purpose.

MY QUESTION: Has anyone replaced this track before with one of these from
the catalogs. It looks like if I replace the inner and outer rocker/sill and
the track that that is the whole of what rests under the door opening. Does
anyone have any wisdom on this topic?

Thank you,
