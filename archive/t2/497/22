When you let off the gas pedal, all of a sudden there is a high vacuum condition: lack of air going into the engine. However the fuel injectors are still firing because they are timed to the ignition which is always running so you temporarily have a rich condition. The valve detects this condition and injects some additional air into the intake in order to help burn the excess fuel.

You'll notice that the valve is hooked up to the intake before the throttle plate for a source of air, the manifold via small vacuum hose to detect the change in the vacuum level to operate the valve and the plenum via the tee for the brake booster valve for the air to flow into the engine.
