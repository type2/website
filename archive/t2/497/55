Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel lines...

The tech library has a great article about fuel line replacement, including
metric sizes. I had trouble finding the correct size from the fuel filter to
the fuel pump (larger diameter), but since that is very low pressure, I just
used an english size from the FLAPS that was real close. The smaller
diameter can be had from any German parts specialist, but make SURE you get
high pressure FI hose though...

What size? From the tank to the filter and fuel pump? And from the fuel
pump to the injector rail? 1/4"
