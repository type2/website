I've come across drums that while turning freely have been very stubborn
to get off the hub. I found that my local generic auto parts store
(Kragen) will rent a drum puller for about $10. Of course you have to put
a deposit down equal to the cost of the puller but it was well worth it
for me as I had the drums off and the puller returned within an hour.

> Can't get 'em loose!  any suggestions?  Is it OK to spray PB Blaster in there or will I soak the shoes?  Of course I'm hoping to get them out anyway.  Should the drums slide off without loosening the stars?  They don't- the stars are my only hope.
