Subject: Airs Help needed in Walterboro,SC

I just got an update from Kyle.
They ended up getting a hotel room at the Friendly Motor Inn Room #17 843
549 5552

They haven't been able to figure out which part they need so if you have any
knowledge of a 79 automatic they could sure use it.

The recap:
79 Automatic Westy in Walterboro, SC need to get to NC.

Tranny is pouring tranny fluid and now if they start it it sounds like
grinding rocks.

The parts houses around there keep asking them about a sleeve???

Please help if ya can... Even if it is just to talk with them to try and
figure out what they need to get.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy

PS:
Will the person that posted this to the Samba do it again please.  And feel
free to pass on anywhere else you think might get them some help.
