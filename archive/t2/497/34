Subject: Re: [T2] 15" wheels???

hey Richard,

i haven't been able to find anything like you describe, but the 
Mercedes wheels seem like a good direction to pursue.

also, the Yoko Y356C or D is a very reasonably priced 14" stock tire 
available from tirerack.com for about 50 bucks each.

are you going to put some neons on there also with the spinners? drive 
by the house when you get finished i want to check them out. ;-)
