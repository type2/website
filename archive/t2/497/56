Tank to filter: 7.5mm
Filter to pump: 10mm
Pump to every fuel hose on engine: 7.5mm HIGH PRESSURE
fuel injection hose!!!
 
Mercedes hose works the best. Got a MB dealer near
you?

916030-000527 (-at-) 13.50 a meter for 7.5mm hose. 2 meters
should be enough....

112-476-12-26 for the 10mm hose. Should just need 3"
of it. You don't need to buy a meter of it, it is
18.50 a meter. They should cut and sell a short piece
:)

These are MB suggested list prices....
