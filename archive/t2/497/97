A few years back a friend of mine had the same problem
on that "other" VW, can't remember the name of it but
it was that short fat one with bug eyes that floats.

Basically he had the same problems, bright lights,
turn the key and nothing.  Well we put it in 2nd gear
with the clutch out and pushed 'what ever it was'
forward, thus freeing the starter. He then fired up,
waved goodbye and left in a cloud of blue smoke.

Not sure if you had the same problem but if it happens
again you may try that.
