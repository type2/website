The flappers are there so that when you turn your motor off the hot air in
the heat exchangers won't rise back up into your engine compartment.  I
haven't tested to see, but I would be willing to bet that even at idle those
flaps are open whether or not you're using the aux heat blower.  If you
don't have the flappers (or the covers for the channels), I'd recommend
getting them - Joe at Busted Bus probably has stacks of them.
