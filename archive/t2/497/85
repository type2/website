Subject: Sliding Door Track Gone...Ideas?

The slider door bottom track on my '73 VW Standard Bus  is rusted out at the
front.
This is letting the door come off when brought to the near-closed position
if it is not lifted UP into the top track.
Has anyone changed this track before?
What is involved?
Are the parts limited to the inner and outer rockers and the track piece?
Thanks for any help!

Thank you,
Duane Miller
