Subject: Starter woes

Hello all,
    Here is my problem. I got to my bus last night to head home from work and
it won't start. I turn the key and nuthin. Headlights are very bright, barely
dim when I turn the key like normal. I don't hear a click or  anything just
nothing.  I got a ride home and when I came in this morning it started right
up. No problems at all.

I haven't gotten under there yet cause I'm at work right now, but when I do
what should I look for? Battery connections are good and I know the battery is
in good shape. Starter connections maybe. I didn't touch anything to make it
start up today. Gremlins maybe?? It was pretty cold last night about 20F, but
it wasn't much better this morning (maybe 25F, man I need to get my heat
working!), but I don't think that would make any difference either way.

Please let me know if you have any good ideas fro what to look for tonight.

Thanks
Zach Freshman
