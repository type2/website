The constant flexing would crack solder in short order. I've heard you can
TIG weld them if you know what you're doing. You can get rebuilt dizzies for
about any VW from: http://philbingroup.com/

i have a 205T with a broken plate to ground wire.
ive saved wire from some speakers we reconed which should be perfect
because it is made to flex. heres the q.
how to connect it to the plate and the nut?
is the plate steel? that sould make soldering to it directly a no go.
