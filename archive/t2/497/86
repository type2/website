Subject: re: [T2] Sliding Door Track Gone...Ideas?

Hi Duane,

I was surfing Richard Atwell's site last week and discovered this link, 
it has a very detailed explanation of what's involved and the pics are 
very good:

Depending on the degree of damage on your bus, you may be able to get 
away with doing less... In my old 73 westfalia I replaced the "floor" 
of the slider track due to a couple of sizable holes, and the repair 
lasted for a couple of years. Right now my family is working on a 75 
westy that needs inner and outer rockers on both sides completely 
replaced, and we're going to do it the right way this time around. The 
website above does a great job of explaining how the parts go together, 
which is not at all obvious when you a re looking at it fully 
assembled.

Happy trails,
