Subject: Extremely urgent

Hello everyone,
Some of you may have already heard since Snoopy did me the favor of posting 
a message for me, but I finally found a library so I figured I'd give the 
current info.

I am stranded in Waltersboro, SC. My tranny has leaked all of its fluid. The 
bus felt almost like it was stuck in neutral. So we pulled over. Tranny 
fluid smokin off the engine. Looked underneath and watched a stream of 
tranny fluid pour out from the bottom of the final drive from behind the 
torque converter.

Tried adding fluid and it didn't drain, but as soon as I started the bus I 
could watch it pour out.  Now if I start the bus there is a loud crunching 
noise that immediately starts. So I don't start the bus.

I figure the converter seal is probably bad. Maybe the converter bushing 
went bad and caused the seal to go bad. Could that cause the noise?

I really need any help? Never dropped an engine. Not sure what special tools 
I need. Very low on $.
Willing to try anything. Found access to parts, but no address to ship them 
to.

Need place to work on bus. Any help or advice is much appreciatted.

This is a 79 w/ an auto tranny.

We are staying at the friendly inn in waltersborough, SC

The room is under Kyle LaFerriere. Not sure what room # right now cause we 
had to switch. Please call or stop by.

Thanks.
