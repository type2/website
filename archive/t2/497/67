Plus BB is cheaper than the MB dealer. When is BB going to change the webpage to NOT say "12 to 15 feet usually does the engine compartment, supply lines and return lines, depending on the year"?

4 feet is more like it.

Hose clamps are pretty expensive if you get them for VW or MB and you need a lot of them. Use the originals or get FI hose clamps by the box from the flaps.

I prefer clamps without the phillips head. See mini clamps on this page:
