Please be careful.

Using inch size fuel line is a recipe for an engine fire. I am not being
alarmist, I have seen it happen personally. 7.5mm is already .5mm too big,
as the OG size is 7mm inside, but it works because the Mercededs hose is of
excellent quality, very well reinforced on the interior of the hose and very
stiff. Any 5/16" hose I have seen will be much too large on the inside to
seal properly on the hard fittings, and the qulaity of the hose by gates and
goodyear (the most common hose available in inch sizes) is nowhere near that
of the german hose. Even the so-called "fuel injection" rated hose available
at most parts shops is very poor when compared to the original or the german
stuff. Bus Boys sells continental fuel hose, which is the best thing to use,
it is 7mm inside and will not deteriorate in the engine bay the way the
american stuff will certainly do. Be careful also with which clamps you use,
the VW dealer has good ones, as does the Mercededs dealer. The stock ones
are the best, if they are still useable.
