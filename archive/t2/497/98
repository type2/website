This is most likely a very common and easy to fix problem. Look on the type2 
home page under Library, look under "S" for "Starter", and read the Starter 
Relay Installation article.

You could probably use a relay other than the one specified (I think a 
standard Ford starter contactor works). In the meantime, you might be able 
to get it to start when hot by crawling underneath the bus and beating on 
the solenoid with a screwdriver handle or small hammer.

Hello all,
    Here is my problem. I got to my bus last night to head home from work 
and
it won't start. I turn the key and nuthin. Headlights are very bright, 
barely
dim when I turn the key like normal. I don't hear a click or  anything just
nothing.  I got a ride home and when I came in this morning it started right
up. No problems at all.

I haven't gotten under there yet cause I'm at work right now, but when I do
what should I look for? Battery connections are good and I know the battery 
is
in good shape. Starter connections maybe. I didn't touch anything to make it
start up today. Gremlins maybe?? It was pretty cold last night about 20F, 
but
it wasn't much better this morning
