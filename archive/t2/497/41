Go to http://ww.tirerack.com

Click on Products
Click on Tires
Click on Shop By Size

Set the top of the search section to 185/NONE/14
Do not select ANY other options on the search page
(I tried to select the speed range by clicking the top 4 speed boxes --
look closely and note that speed rating "R" is not there -- guess what
speed rating all the C/D load tires are)

Click GO

It brings up 5 tires. 4 of them are C or D rated and two of those are VERY
reasonably priced -- the others aren't bad. I can get a set of *6* Yokohama
Y-356-D tires delivered for $405.

Most local shops can get the same tires for about the same price if you
already know the brand/model to ask for.

Richard Palmer said something about [T2] 15" wheels???:

>  I know Mercedes wheels have been discussed as options for late models
> & vanagons (they are the same wheel, aren't they?) but I was wondering
> if there were perhaps any cheap & easily available 15" wheels         
> available for busses. 14" tires are hard to find and really expensive 
> in the proper weight/load class, but there seem to be tons of 15"
