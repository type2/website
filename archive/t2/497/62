Subject: painting tin

""None of the high-temp paints I've ever tried have
lasted more than a 
couple
weeks. Next time around I'm doing powdercoat on all
the tin.""

  When I painted my tin (Krylon rattle can) I first
cooked it in a old weber BBQ then wire wheeled what
was
left off. That was a couple of years ago and it looks
fine still...

YMMV
