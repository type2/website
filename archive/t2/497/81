I dunno about that, but I have seen these things that bolt on under the oil circle sumper plate, that you can plug into an extension cord.. to keep the engine warm.  

Right now that seems to be a nice thing to have as the temperature hasn't been above freezing for days, ice is 2 inches thick in the swale (I can walk on it).  Let's not talk about the eberspacher being in the garage not installed in the bus.  In spite of the thermostat operating properly, it seems to me that the engine may feel a bit chilly.

At least the outside mirrors aren't broken, which happened to me before (water trapped in there)
