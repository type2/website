Hello Ron

If you can remember me I wrote you a note a few month ago looking for a job
in your bussines :o), well the peace our spanish spoken friend is looking
for are the heads of a fuel injection Kombi, he want to know too if you have
some manual (for the type2 I guess) and the price in order to place an
order.
Ron, please feel free to Pmail me or tell the guy that pmailme to in order
to serve as translator for you both.

Roberto
