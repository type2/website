What I used to do when it was that cold was just park my trouble light 
(drop light, about 60 watts) inside the engine compartment and run the 
extension cord inside. First thing I did when I woke up was plug it in. 
After a shower and breakfast when I went out to start the bus all I did was 
take it out of the compartment, turn it off, hang it on the wall and start 
the bus. It was enough to warm the battery a little, the carb and the block 
a bit. I doubt that it warmed the oil all that much, being in the bottom of 
the sump, but 5W30 oil pumped just fine when cold. A battery at 32F can 
generate almost twice the cranking amps of one at 0F. Of course, having an 
engine that would fire before even 1/2 revolution was complete was a big 
help. If your coil, points, starter or battery are bad or your wiring 
joints are corroded, no spark will come, no matter how warm your oil is.

Also be sure that the tranny is in neutral and you have your foot on the 
clutch. Without your foot on the clutch the starter also has to turn the 
tranny main shaft. No use working it harder than you have to.
