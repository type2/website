Subject: RE: [T2] throttle cable question

This pic helps alot with my problem. My cable is running through the other
side of the transmission. The PO must have moved it to work with the weber. Is
the other side of this cable easy to get to from under the bus? It looks like
it could be a pain to get up there and move the cable. I guess I have no
choice but to try to crawl under the bus and see if I can move it. Hope I get
some good weather this week.
