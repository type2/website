It's quite easy to type the umlaut (if you're using a windows PC). Just hold
down the ALT key and type 0252 (including the zero) on the number keypad to
get a |. The hard part is remembering the numbers for the special characters.

See the Character Map application for other useful ALT + number combinations.
