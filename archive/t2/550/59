If you can't make the umlaut, the proper way to spell the word is to follow
the vowel with an "e", i.e. vergnuegen. On the VW oil cap is the word Oel,
for oil. Spelled with an umlaut it would be Vl (alt 153). You need to press
alt 129. Once you let up, you get the u with an umalut |.

Bus content. I drive a bus because it's practical, fun and easy(sometimes)
to work on, and everyone waves.
Just took Kermit (76 westy)out of hibernation for the warm season. I have
taken to garaging him for the winters.
