Subject: Listees in Knoxville

Hello generous list,

The search for a new bus goes on and on.  Thanks to VW Tech's
Bob in Leucadia for inspecting a bus in Orange County for me.
His expertise was invaluable.

Ok, to the point:  any listees in Knoxville, Tenn want to inspect
a bus there for me.  As always, I will gladly pay for your
time and expertise.

Thanks,
