Get him to do that if he sticks to him quote even though the job is easier
than a split window.

This is unreasonable even for quality repair work. Buy the $40 tie-rod tool
and DIY. It's a 15 minutes job with the tool. Measure carefully and you
won't have any change in wheel toe.

pm me for details on where to buy the tool.

Buy this from Bus Boys instead:

I.  211-498-101BX  Front Torsion Arm, Rebuilt With New German Ball Joints -
Set of 4 Bus/Pickup 1970 to 1979  $174.95
