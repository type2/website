Don,

The object of using a set of relays is to relieve the switches ( on/off,
dimmer) from any big amperage damage--like melting, with the addition of
big wattage headlamps.

The wiring can handle the juice--the switches can't--

The relay will by pass the switches from carrying the amperage load
necessary to operate Halogen--E-Code, or 80/100 watt headlamps.

You could rewire the whole front end of the Bus with 12 ga. wire--and
add a larger amperage dimmer, and headlamp switch of unstock variety
--but the addition of the relay will take 1/10th of the time and do the
same job inexpensively.

And now you know the rest of the story.

Adios,

Terry
