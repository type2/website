it may mean the case is bad. i have seen this a few times.

you can have the case machined for oversize lifters, but the only ones
available are ceramic from LN engineering and they cost over 400 bucks. it
may be cheaper to get a different case. the case can also be sleeved for
type one lifters, as is done in some instances when people want to use very
large lift cams, but again, these are expensive solutions.
