Marcus,
Anytime you start drawing big, amps or wattage through any switch or
wiring your get big heat ---and the weakest point in the system is going
to go bye bye--which usually is a switch in line to the object using the
juice.

Case in Point--
58 Delray-with aircraft landing lights for for high beams
59 Impala--same
62 Grand Prix--same
63 Eldo---same
64 Buick 225 coupe--same
64 Bonneville--Same
67 Bonneville-same
67 Ranchero--same
86 BMW 325--same
74 Westy-with 80/100's
85 Vanagon GL--with 80/100's 
87 Westy--with 80/100's & 100's for the high beams
89 Carat with 80/100's & 100's for the high beams

And this is only what I can think of this second--

They all cooked either the dimmer switch or the headlamp switch due to
heat generated by the big wattage lamps.

A set relays relieved the heat from switches and this is a pretty
common, accepted practise to prevent this from happening.

Either your a real lucky guy--or you aren't running your vehicle much at
night with the bright's on--

And being that the Bus isn't a brand new item--why tax the 30 year old
and grey switches & wiring with a large amp draw?

I sure don't wanna--

The kraut stuff ain't that good--:>)

I do know of hundreds of VW folks who have had the same problem's with
big wattage lamps--and the relays have set them free--
And it most surly isn't a complicated fix--

Amen--

The switches can handle it, too. I have 80/100 W H4s installed since the
turn of the century or so. Only problem so far has been one connector
right one the low beam side of the bulb that fried due to corrosion
problems. European buses used the same switches and came with H4s from
the factory. 
Advantage of going with relays is additional brightness due to less
voltage drop.
