Could someone forward this to Eric...
 
I had a similar situation a couple years ago. I got an AVP worldwide rebuild delivered to my apartment in San Diego for about $1100. The price included picking up my core. (They're in Sacramento). 
 
Mine was a T4 engine, I think yours would be a T1 1600 which might be cheaper. You could also find a rebuilt 1600 in San Diego I imagine. BusDepot.com sells one for $1300 (less shipping), but I think this is an AVP rebuild anyway. BusDepot is the gold standard for reputable online vendors of Bus parts.
 
I do most of my own work (including installing that rebuild), but I take it to BRU when I'm busy or need a smog (N/A for you). They have never tried to rip me off, and are pretty helpful.
 
If you have the 1600, I think you could easily swap it yourself if you have a roomy garage or if you can leave it on your street. Get a couple friends to drop it, swap all the parts to the new engine at your leisure, then have your buddies back over to hoist it up. You would need basic metric tools, and a couple of manuals, but not hard at all. pmail if questions.
