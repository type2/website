Don,

i bet you can beat the 250 price for tie rods by installing them yourself.
as a previous post mentioned, you'll probably need an alignment afterwards.

thanks to a very knowledgeable & willing auto teacher, i was able to get the
ball joints done on
a bus i owned several years ago.  go with the Bus Boys arms/ball joint item
to save time. this
can be a bear of a job & quite frankly, if i had to do it again i would
probably just
shell out the money to a competent professional. you'll also probably need
an alignment after
this too, so best to do it all in one shot.

good luck,
