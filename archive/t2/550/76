Subject: Re:Vacuum hose on early '76 

On my 76 Westy, the gases were drawn from a port welded onto the side of 
the muffler near the entry pipe, through a long metal tube and into a 
filter just in front of the EGR valve.  That valve is the control for 
pulling exhaust gases from that muffler and delivering them to the intake 
manifold, where they mixed with the intake air. When I rebuilt my 76 
engine, there was a huge accumulation of carbinaceous crust in the intake 
manifold, where the EGR valve dumped the exhaust gases. I had to scrape all 
that stuff out. Apparently the filter didn't help much in the 28 years that 
went by between the time it was installed and the time the engine was torn 
down.

I have a EGR valve on my newish '76 like Bentley pages 32 and fig 7-2, Sec
10 (fuel injection).
Question: where does the vacuum line on the EGR valve go to?? I have just
3/4 of the line connected to the EGR valve, and I cannot find where it
should connect at the other end; it is cut too short, and I cannot see an
empty connector. I will have a major leak, Help!!
TIA
