Subject: Weber carb 32/36 DFEV

I have a 73 camper and it has a 1700cc motor in it I believe and I purchased a
weber progressive kit for it and it came with a 32/36 DFEV carb.  I know that
it is running rich and that I need to change the jets in it.  I was wondering
if anyone else if running the same system and what they found to work out well
on it?  Looking for what size jets cause Im pretty sure both of the stock ones
that came with are too big.  Any ideas?

I was also wondering if theres anyone with a similar setup that runs lives in
cold weather areas and what they have to help the bus run better on startup in
cold weather areas?
