So you have a Rio Car too!!

I have one with a 40 gig hard drive and don't know how I ever lived
without it. It's an incredible unit, way ahead of its time. I put extra
sleeves in my other cars (an old Mini Cooper, a Fiat 500, and a Fiat
Spider) so I can move the same head unit from car to car.  (If you
haven't already, do the Emplode hack; it adds a lot of very useful
features.)
