Subject: Vacuum hose on early '76

I have a EGR valve on my newish '76 like Bentley pages 32 and fig 7-2, Sec 
10 (fuel injection).

Question: where does the vacuum line on the EGR valve go to??  I have just 
3/4 of the line connected to the EGR valve, and I cannot find where it 
should connect at the other end; it is cut too short, and I cannot see an 
empty connector.  I will have a major leak,  Help!!

TIA
