Subject: Ignition switch or starter?

Volk-a-maniacs,

Once again, I draw upon the combined experience and knowledge of you all to
confirm/deny/assist my latest woe.  I have an intermittent non-fire of the
ignition system.  I put key in, turn half way to see all the pretty little
lights and the other half to fire up the starter/engine.  The second half is
where I am not getting anything to happen.

Intermittent today, but also started today.  I just got back from a ~200 mile
trip with the family (a '67 and a '66 bus) and for 2 out of the last five
times we stopped and tried to start again, I got this failure.  Each time, I
crawled under the right rear wheel and fiddled with the starter, trying to
jump it.  I can get pretty good spark and I can here the starter spinning, but
it doesn't fire up (yes, the key is on).  The first time, I must have wiggled
something just right because I tried the key again and vroom we went.  This
last time, I had to push start it... grr.  Then, when I got home, I turned off
the key and then on again... it started right up.  WTF?

Any thoughts?  Is my ignition switch going, going, going, almost gone?  Or is
my starter getting tired?  Maybe I have a loose wire... there was some gravel
parts of my trip today.

Logistics:
1963 Panel converted to a camper with 12V.
Single port engine... not that it should matter.
This has never happened before today.

Help.
