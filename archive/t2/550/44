Subject: Anybody done the H-4 headlight conversion?

I'm curious about wiring. The headlight wiring on our buses is IMHO undersized
for regular halogens. Has anybody done it and had the lights stay bright with
no relay-to-plug wiring replacements?

I see them for sale all the time. Here's an example:
