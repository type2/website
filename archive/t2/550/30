You do have the IRS (double jointed) axles and do need to support the
transmission.  The chain-and-hooks arrangement previously described is the
traditional support method and has the advantages of sstrength and
adjustability.  It is sometimes lacking in the availability department
however.

If you don't have a couple of meters of chain hanging around then 1/2"
rope is a very adequate substitute as long as you apply it in conjuction
with a cinder block and 2x6 pad.  The rope is far stretchier than chain
and removing an engine with only the rope supporting the transmission can
be tricky.  If you put a cinderblock under the transmission with 2x6
blocks to build it up to the trans then remove the engine that will work.
If you don't need to move the bus it is a complete solution.  If you do
need to move the bus then lift it off the cinderblocks with a rope saddle,
move it, then replace it on the cinderblocks for engine installation.

The chain is preferable but in a pinch other solutions are available.

                             OOK!
