Subject: Re: [T2] Tips on getting ball joints done - 1973

Thanks all for the tips and comments.

For the tie rod ends, I already planned on doing them myself, as my original
message stated. Those are easily done with at worst a small puller (though
over the years I've never had to use one). Under $100 and I can get new
complete tie rods. heh

My issue was the ball joints. I've never replaced one, and the need to
perfectly align the new ball joint with the arms is beyond my
skills/courage. ;-)

The BB arms look like a winner for when I actually decide to tackle them.
HOWEVER:

I just went out and jacked up the bus and inspected the movement. I can't
see any play in the ball joints with my Mark 1 eyeball. I know the allowable
play should be nearly unnoticable (2mm?) so I'm probably ok. I've got two
tie rod ends that are moving a LOT. But I can't see any slop in the ball
joints.

So, the plan is: Ordering tie rod ends from Bus Depot, installing them and
taking the bus in for an alignment. I'll be able to more accurately guage
the need for ball joints then... If it won't hold the alignment within spec,
I'll do the replacement. If I can get away with them a while longer, I will.
There are lots of "immediate" issues with this basket case that need my
attention.

Whew. That was long! =D
