Subject: Re: [T2] throttle cable question

Hi Corbett,

It isn't that hard to reroute the cable, VW left lots of open space 
above the tranny. You will find the drivers side of the tranny is a bit 
busier than the other thanks to the clutch cable and power brake vacuum 
line, but it shouldn't be too hard to manage.

The only other problem you might encounter is with the length of the 
cable. The 72-74 solexes used the longest throttle cable VW ever made 
for a bus. The only since weber install I've ever worked on used an FI 
throttle cable, and that won't be long enough to run a dual solex 
setup.

Happy trails,
