Subject: Tips on getting ball joints done - 1973

Well, I had the bus in the shop to look at my steering. I'm working 6 days a 
week, and not getting to spend the time on my bus that I would like. :(

They said: Ball joints, tie rod ends, and swing lever shaft kit all needed 
to be replaced.

Ok, I knew about the swing lever shaft (I even bought one to put in - 
anybody need one?), and suspected the rest.

The mechanic and I discussed which would have the most affect on correcting 
my steering: Swing lever shaft, then tie rod ends, then ball joints.

Cost?
Swing lever shaft: $100 installed
Tie rod ends: $250 installed
Ball Joints: $470 installed

Ouch. I let him do the swing lever shaft. I can do the tie rod ends cheap 
and they're relatively easy. But without a press, and having to mess with 
reaming and such necessary to press in the new ones puts this out of my 
league.

So my question is: What tips do you guys have for getting this done much 
more cheaply? I can buy the balljoints from Busdepot (where I plan on 
getting the tie rod ends from anyway), but I assume I'll have to pull the 
arms out myself and drop them with the balljoints off at a machine shop to 
fit? Any idea on costs?

Thanks!

Don
