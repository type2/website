Subject: Re: [T2] Anybody done the H-4 headlight conversion?

The switches can handle it, too. I have 80/100 W H4s installed since the
turn of the century or so. Only problem so far has been one connector right
one the low beam side of the bulb that fried due to corrosion problems.
European buses used the same switches and came with H4s from the factory.

Advantage of going with relays is additional brightness due to less voltage
drop.

The object of using a set of relays is to relieve the switches ( on/off,
dimmer) from any big amperage damage--like melting, with the addition of big
wattage headlamps.
The wiring can handle the juice--the switches can't--
