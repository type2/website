Subject: Re: 6 volt battery?

That subject came up a couple years ago on the T34 elist and Greg Banfill
of VintageWarehouse.com said that he had done the conversion. He said that
he somehow tweaked the regulator so it wouldn't cut out until 8.5 volts.

Another option is an adjustable regulator which I first heard about from a
Volvo guy. Here's a explanation about it:

The only problem is that this solution is for increasing above 12 volts.
I'm sure that the same thing is possible for the 8 volt range but I
haven't found it. Here's another pertinent link:
