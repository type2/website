Which is why I have a Rio MP3 unit ready to go into my bus when it gets back
from the shop.  No loss of signal.  I've only got two 10GB hard drives in it
at present, so I'm limited to 20GB of files, but so far I've been putting
all of my CD's content in it.  Very cool.

You can put almost any audio file in the unit, books, music, etc..  A friend
has two 80GB drives in his, and keeps his entire CD collection in the unit.

It's exactly the same size as a standard car radio unit, fits into the same
hole, but I'm probably going to install it somewhere out of sight and use
the remote to access the unit.
