Is someone saying they will not fill it? I just had the propane guys
test (soap)the valve, if we had bubles then there was  leaks and no
leaks and he filled away.
Best of luck
I do not mean to hijack your thread, but I have a question on this
topic. Has anyone considered a valve on the side of the tank to conect
to a longer hose to a cache cooker or a camp Lantern?
