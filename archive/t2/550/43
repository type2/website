Hi,

http://www.everybus.com/

It has been two weeks and I have finally gotten around to updating 
the EveryBus web site. There are now links to lots of trip reports 
and photos of EB04. If you have pics and reports that are not listed 
please let me know and I will add them to the history page.

The dates for EB05 are also posted.

Once again, thanks to everyone who attended and helped out. EB04 was 
the best yet and I have no idea what to do to top it. Maybe a Ferris 
Wheel?

Thanks
Chris
