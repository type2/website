Have you just bought a new cable and/or tube?  I'm convinced Gemo are making
them wrong because I keep hearing of people with this problem (me included).
I know it's not the clutch because I just fitted a new one.  I was going to
put some washers on but I didn't have any big enough and I HATE taking that
cable out.
