Already Emploded. :O)

I'm about to rip five more of my personal CD's into the unit tonight.
Finally figured out how to activate the visuals, the graphics that do their
thing to the MP3's while they play.  Really cool.

Have you done the light-up hack for the buttons?  Mine's not done, but I had
borrowed a unit with the hack installed.  I'm working on some clear tinted
buttons for the hack, along with some colored plates for the fascia.
