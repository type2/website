yes.
my favorite way to support the tranny is with a length of chain and a
couple of s hooks or small turnbuckles.
i support the engine on a floor jack and unbolt the rear support.
then i lift the engine up a few inches.
then i slide under and support the tranny with the chain looped around the
frame rails. there is a spot on either side convenient to loop through.
then once the engine is out the bus can roll if needed.
