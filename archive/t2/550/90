Hi all,

I'm German and have to write sometimes letters to Germany. Living in Canada,
I still have kind in Germany. If you're realy intrested to write
fahrfergn|gen right, go to start, setting, control panel and key board.
There you can hit the key for the Germen abc (called DE). Print every line
out with and without the shift key and you know where the keyes are. Believe
me, every computer have this.

Hartmut
