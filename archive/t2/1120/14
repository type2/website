Subject: Engine Binding

Hi folks,

For my '71 Westy, "KK-Louise," I recently purchased a rebuilt 1600dp AH
block with an alternator mainly because I just don't have time to build a
motor right now. Before purchasing I heard/saw it run for 5-10 minutes. I
installed an EMPI rear engine mount hanger adapter for it to work in my bus.
Two days ago I installed, and it was the worse engine install of my life.
After it was installed I couldn't turn the engine over, it was bound up. I
pulled the engine and noticed the throwout bearing guide collar was fighting
with the flywheel on the engine. I cut the collar back a few inches, the
throwout bearing still barely sits on the collar. I reinstalled the engine
again, it turned over but was tight. After hooking everything up, I bumped
the starter and it was bound, I could turn it with the starter but not by
hand. Back out it came, this time I noticed metal shavings around the crank
pulley. I removed the pulley and the engine again turns over by hand as it
should.

The crank was actually cutting groves in the engine tin.

The pulley itself was being shaved on the back. http://tiny.cc/7puw2

I do not know why it bound up like that. Do I need a special pulley for use
with an alternator, again I saw it run fine, but after the throwout guide
collar tightening the engine up, I am a bit lost. Is there a different
washer to use with the crank pulley/alternator setup?

This one has me stumped but I do not want to put it back in just to have it
give me fits again.

As always,

Thank you.
