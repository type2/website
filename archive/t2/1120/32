Subject: Re: [T2] 7 foot door

well.. if you are driving the first concrete truck and you leaves at 8 am,,,
and travel east for 2hrs.... and the second truck leaves at 10am going to
the same garage,, the first truck has to go 20km/hr as the trans pops out of
3rd gear,, but the second truck can travel at 80km hr fully loaded.
A, When will the garage be filed with concrete to the top of BOTH 7' doors.
B, where will the trucks pass,,and where will they stop for coffee?
C, solve for the amount of concrete required
D, what is the first truck drivers name.
