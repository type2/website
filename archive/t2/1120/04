Subject: engine running rough...not so much now

Okay i am officially computer illiterate... and maybe a little bus
illiterate too.

 Anyway. So I replaced the spark plug and it fires. Can't believe
after all that... wonder what caused it to fail. Looked like i have
been running really rich. So i bought a set of Spark Plugs and unsure
if they are okay to use. They are the NGK BR5ES (resistor). is this
okay? Please let me know. I had the NGK B6ES ones that i always hear
about.

So i will be doing a compression test in the coming weeks. Have to
wait till i get my svda  in the mail. Mechanic can do both at once. I
am going to pay close attention to how this is done for the future.
well thanks for everything... again.
