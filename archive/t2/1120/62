Subject: Canoe on top of poptop?

Would it be ok to load a canoe on top of my Rivi poptop? We have foam blocks
for it, would load it upside down and tie to bumpers front and back. Would
have to rig up an easy release for back so we could check oil, etc.  It is a
hand-made canoe, fiberglass and wood, not as lightweight as a commercial one.
I don't think I've ever seen a picture of ANYthing on top of a poptop except
the luggage compartment so wonder if there's a real good reason for that
besides the fact that it's a long ways up there.

Thanks,
  LJ
