Subject: Re: [T2] Canoe on top of poptop?

I caried a pretty heavy boat (OT Discovery Sport) on my '82 for a long time on
racks.  This on the stock westy top, an old set of Yakima racks screwed to the
sides of the top with stainless hardware.  115# or so boat, not light, did
fine for years.  How that relates to a Rivi top, I have no idea admittedly.  I
of course never popped the top with it in place, always removed it, though I
probably could have with the hinged top, again a Rivi, I wouldn't likely.  A
lot more snow load than that probably sits on pop tops here in AK all winter
though, and on foam is actually likely better than the concentrated force of
the racks, though with the racks it was load on the vertical section,
then bearing right down on the roof, on foam blocks I guess I might worry
about oil barrelling it down, particularly if you cinch it down too hard with
whatever tiedowns you choose.  Probably no worse than on a steel roof though.

Would it be ok to load a canoe on top of my Rivi poptop? We have foam blocks
for it, would load it upside down and tie to bumpers front and back. Would
have to rig up an easy release for back so we could check oil, etc.  It is a
hand-made canoe, fiberglass and wood, not as lightweight as a commercial one.
I don't think I've ever seen a picture of ANYthing on top of a poptop except
the luggage compartment so wonder if there's a real good reason for that
besides the fact that it's a long ways up there.
