Subject: RE: [T2] Engine Binding

Max,

I had this sort of binding between the crank pulley and the tin last summer
when I used an oil pump adapter kit to put a Bug engine in my '71 Bus. The
studs from the kit were long enough to push the crank pulley tin out to where
it interfered with the pulley. I was able to turn & start the engine, but it
made a awful racket, & produced a wear pattern just like the one in your
pictures.

Fortunately, I didn't have the engine in the Bus yet.

I had to take the crank tin back off & trim about 1/2 inch off the studs to
make it all work.

I think I can actually see the imprint of the studs in your photo of the crank
tin.

The crank was actually cutting groves in the engine tin.

The pulley itself was being shaved on the back. http://tiny.cc/7puw2


Hope this helps,
