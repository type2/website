Subject: Re: [T2] Canoe on top of poptop?

It'll be fine. My westy poptop withstands an 89 lb coleman 17' canoe
without any trouble. I've gone on many, many trips with it up there and
not had any problems, including 1600 miles last summer return trip to HCBF
with a 16' grumman aluminum up there.


Happy Trails,
