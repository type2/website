Subject: Timing spec when EGR disconnected

Hi guys ,

I have a couple of questions.
I just fail the smog test because of the timing and visual inspection  ( 
emissions inspection passed)
I have a 2.0L California engine aircool with EGR
For all those year I was not aware that the EGR was in fact disconnect 
from the throttle valve lever, they were a spring connecting them 
instead of a rod. the EGR practically opened  at  the highest RPM only.
I found a rod and installed it for the smog test. the timing for my 
engine should be 5' ATDC (it is 1' BTDC right now).
After the smog test, I plan to disconnect the  EGR again , I red in the 
type 2 archive that by disconnecting the EGR you should also change your 
timing but I could not find by how much ?

The second question is more ethical , is it really bad to disconnect the 
EGR for the environment ? EGR are only found in California engine in the 
US and my emissions inspection showed that I am clean. What is the 
benefice of EGR (other than environmental ) ?

Thanks for any thought.
