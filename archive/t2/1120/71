Subject: Re: [T2] engine removal hieght

I've never met a T4 I couldn't remove with the bus on a set of the red "truck"
steel ramps, with a relatively low profile floor jack and a chunk of 3/4
plywood.  Don't know how tall that is.  However I've probably ended up sliding
the plywood off the jack on occasion, though not often, mostly when I had flat
tires and no source of air easily available (backwoods bus retrieval.)  One of
the motorcycle lift jacks is a bit more convenient, but mine is pretty high
(inch or two more) in profile compared to a regular floor jack.
