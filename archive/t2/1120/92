Subject: upholstery

Someone posted a note on a beautiful upholstery job.

Thought I would post the other end of the spectrum.

Remove existing seat cover due to absolutely no cushion left.

He stuffed it with standard upholstery materials.

The seats fabric was reused.

On the drivers side there is accelerated ware on the drivers side as you
get out on the edge of the fabric.

Swapped the sides of the seats to give a clean edge on drivers side.

$325.00

Not bad considering my current financial situation.
