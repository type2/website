Subject: Alternator wiring

The new motor is now running but the alternator is not doing its job. I am
sure I have something wired incorrectly.

This is an AH engine with alternator that I have put into a '71 bus that
originally had a generator with external voltage regulator. For the past 7
years the generator has worked fine but since this engine came with a
rebuilt Bosch alternator with internal regulator I converted.

When I turn my ignition key on click, I now only see the red oil light come
on rather than both the oil light and gen light. This tells me that I wired
something incorrectly, and without the gen light, I have read the alternator
will not get excited and thus not work. I have a wire connected to my +
battery terminal running directly to the B+ stud on the alternator. I also
have the blue wire that I have read connects to the gen light connected to
the D+ connector on the alternator.

On my old voltage regulator I had a wire connected from the + battery
terminal and another wire from my starter solenoid that I just soldered
together.

What I feel would be really helpful, is to know what voltage readings I
should get with a multimeter on the alternator connections.

This is a link to a photo of the connectors on the alternator and my wiring
from the battery terminal.

Thank you again for any hints or tips. I believe if I can get the gen light
on the dash to light up, the alternator will work.
