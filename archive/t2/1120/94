Subject: Sage Green upholstery (a bit to spare)?

Anybody got just a little piece (maybe 12x12") they could spare, can even be
dirty?  I just picked up a '77 Scirocco that features a beautiful bright green
metallic (didn't even know this was a factory color but it is) exterior and
the interior is black vinyl bolsters with an inset that strikes me very much
as sage green Westy fabric, or real close, but I'm not sure and would like a
direct comparison piece not just the picture off of GoWesty before I order
some.  If anyone has and could spare a bit (even an ugly worn bit) I'd sure
appreciate it.
 
Thanks
John
