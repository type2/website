I have this sticker and it does not say anything about a CAT.  Also, 
whenever I go to do my testing, the guy put that I have a CAT, but I 
never anything about it because I didn't want to fail.  But should it 
ever come up, I will indicate that I don't require one.

I will also check on the door jam to see if there's anything there...

thanks!
