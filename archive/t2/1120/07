Subject: Tar as seam sealer?

Hi All,

I've got my bus stripped down for repainting. I'm finding a lot of tar
applied as seam sealer. Is this a VW OEM thing, or did someone along
the way on a previous repaint think that was a good idea?

It seems to have worked great to prevent rust, but paint applied over
it is peeling off in many areas.

Thanks,

John
