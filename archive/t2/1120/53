Subject: Re: [T2] Question about catalytic converter requirements

Usually there is a factory provided sticker on the door jam (above the
striker) with the vin number and the words "catalyst" if it was originally
equipped with a catalytic converter, usually on California Models. Most
Federal Models 75-78 did not have a converter.  1979 models, regardless if
California or Federal Models were originally equipped with a converter (and
to add to the confusion, a different converter was installed for California
and for Federal Models.  The California 1979 was up by the left side Valve
Cover, the Federal 1979 was out in-line with the muffler, like the 75-78
California models).

In most cases, there will be factory sticker in the engine compartment
indicating whether it was converter equipped.  Of course, in the case of a
35+ year old bus, these stickers could be long gone.
