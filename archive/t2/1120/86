Subject: RE: [T2] engine removal height

I have a '73 with a 2 liter in it with dual solex carbs, I drop the engine
with a floor jack on a piece of plywood and then remove the jack, letting
the engine sit on the plywood.  Then the engine can be slid out.  The bottom
part of the bumper, with stone guard removed, needs to be 22.5 inches off
the ground.  Hope this helps.
