Thanks for the tip Richard. What did you cut the studs with?

Mark, how would I verify a correct pressure plate? I pulled my interim
engine and removed the pressure plate and clutch that I had been using
and put it on the rebuild.

I will still double-check the endplay.

Thanks again, I appreciate the support and ideas.

Max
