Subject: Re: [T2] concrete color

Natural (no color) for the win!  This is for several reasons:
1)  It's cheaper.
2)  It looks good forever (stained or painted concrete will have to be
re-stained or re-painted periodically).
3)  It cleans up well.  With the right chemicals or power washer you can get
it looking mostly like new even if you've spilled oil and grease on it for
years.
4)  In the voice of Reb Tevye, from Fiddler on the Roof: TRADITION!

I would avoid painting or staining the concrete.  Paint will peel (especially
if exposed to some of the nasty stuff found in garages) and stain will get
permanently tarnished by whatever drips on it.  Also any chips in the surface
will show the natural color concrete and rocks below the stain.  If you are
going to colorize the floor I'd ask the contractor about colorizing the mix so
that the entirety of the slab is colored.  But, then again, I wouldn't
colorize a concrete floor for a garage.  I would colorize concrete for use in
a low-impact area like inside of the house.  I've seen some gorgeous stained
and polished concrete floors in living areas.
