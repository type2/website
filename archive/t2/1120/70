What year bus, Alan? Pre-1972 need no clearance, carbed engines need the  
carbs taken off so require less clearance than FI (if you leave the FI  
attached). The coil was always the part that hung me up. What are you using  
to lower the engine? You'll also need to take that height into account. I  
usually wind up with about a 30" height using a motorcycle jack.
