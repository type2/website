Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Binding

The endplay is a good idea offered by all of you. I will check that
out. As I understand it, once I mated the engine to the transmission
and turned it over it with the starter, that possibly sucked up the
endplay, thus binding the engine.

The rear hanger does mount to the oil pump cover but I also do not see
how that would have affected anything, because it is the pump cover,
then the hanger.

Thanks for the ideas thus far, I will do my best to get to the bus and
check the end play tomorrow.
