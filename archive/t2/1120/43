Subject: Re: [T2] Question about catalytic converter requirements

Your local smog check tech would be able to tell you. If you are in
California, you are required to have all the OEM equipment. I don't
remember what year Federal models got cats.

Also, if you are in California, you can visit the DMV website and get
a smog check history on the bus.

 not totally sure.  And if that is the case (which I'm hoping someone can
 help me figure out), am I required to have a cat?
