That's really a lot of changes, Mike. Are you not running a stock cam?
And I thought lower compression was cooler. I've been thinking about
you since the comment that your compression is too low, and I have
remembered that VW is very tolerant of low compression. The industry
norm is 10% variance between cylinders, but VW allows much more, and
also allows down to what, about 75 psi as acceptable? Which
corresponds to about a 5:1 compression ratio.

I'm no expert, but it doesn't seem right to me to have to change cam,
exhaust, and compression ratio to deal with high temps. But nothing
else has worked, and Jake is the expert, so by all means give him a
shot!

  Based on a bunch of reading on the Camper Special, I'm guessing I'm going
 to have to change the cam, possibly have some headwork done, bump up the
 compression ratio, change my exhaust and I might need to run higher octane
 fuel.  Most of the changes don't bother me that much because they're just
 initial time and money spent - it's the change to higher octane fuel that
 has a long-term cost effect... I guess I'm just gonna have to get a better
 job to support the bus :)
