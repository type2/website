Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Binding

Solved: The bind was definitely caused by the crank pulley grinding against
the long oil pump studs. I cut them back with a Dremel and cutting disc as
suggested by Richard Coombs. Once I got it back in the bus, she started at
the first turn of the key. However another issue...see the next e-mail.

Thanks for all of the help and suggestions.
