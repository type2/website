Subject: Upholstery Question

I have a '78 and am in the process of getting some upholstery work done.  Was
wondering if anyone out there has paid for that type of work and what it ran
you.

My guy quoted me $2k to do the 2 front seats, 2 custom built boxes for the
back, a tool box, a center console, and all the side panels.  He's basically
just recovering the front seats and is doing padding and fabric in the back.
Everything is multi-color so there is some extra work involved.  I have seen a
lot of his work and it's top-notch.

I tried getting some more quotes locally but no one seems interested in doing
the work for some reason.  I thought during this economy people would be
fighting over my business, but that doesn't appear to be the case.  I'm just
curious to know how that dollar figure stacks up vs. what others have gotten
done.

Thanks,
chandler
