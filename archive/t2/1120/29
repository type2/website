Hello Alan. I'll assume that your 7 foot garage doors are overhead doors, 
but it really doesn't matter. They could be swinging barn doors on hinges 
and it would accomplish the same thing.

I'm guessing that your concern is that the top of your vehicle will scrape 
on some part of the opening when you go in or out of the finished garage. 
You can't change the height of the door, but you can alter the elevation of 
the concrete surface because you haven't poured it yet.

I don't know how high your vehicle is, but my 1976 Westy is about 6 feet 6 
inches high. 7 feet sounds like it would be enough for my bus.  But I don't 
know about yours. How high is your bus?

One of the solutions from an earlier post was to pour the concrete with two 
grooves/trenches , each at least 12 inches wide and deep enough to allow 
easy clearance of the roof of the vehicle.  You would put a removable block 
or plug in each trench after you got the vehicle inside the garage, and the 
door would come down and seal against the block, to keep out the weather. 
The longitudinal elevation of the lower surface of each groove should have 
a slope that would permit fluids to drain out of the garage toward the street.

The grooves should be deep enough to keep the roof from scraping, but not 
deep enough to cause the
undercarriage to scrape. If you want to park other vehicles in the garage 
after you no longer have a bus, you can fill in the grooves.

A simpler solution would be to pour the floor flat, but low enough to allow 
the bus to enter without scraping, and then put an extension on the bottom 
of the 7 foot door....perhaps a flexible flap made of material like a 
heavy-duty mud flap on a big truck.
