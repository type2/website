The video on the web site is even better, and the cheese bus tour
themed home page is nicely designed too.

The whole concept shows some nice creative thinking. At first I hated
seeing the splitty cut up, but then I realized that their theme is the
Tillamook Baby Loaf cheese. It really fits since a VW bus is often
called a bread loaf, and their cheese loaf is smaller than a bread
loaf, hence the name baby loaf, and the diminuative sized shorty
splitty buses. A really cute campaign!

I've heard Tillamook cheese is one of the best. Been a long time though....

 I know it's a splitty but they call it a "loaf"
