Subject: re:tar as seam sealer

I do not think, nor have I ever seen this used as seam sealer. 

 

I have heard that some folks swear by it-albeit you cannot paint this area,
but if it isn't rusting, and you can't see it.why not leave it.

 

I used it as a sealant when installing the windshields in my Splittie, but
Bentley does call for some sealant in the lower corners of the windshield.
