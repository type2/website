Max,

I hate to say it, but the problem is an easy one.   The fix is a bit 
harder.   The alternator you have is an -externally- regulated alternator, 
found on 72? (73 for sure) up beetles.  It has a three wire harness that 
connects to the external regulator, which is a ~~~1x3x3 silver box.  The 
silver box, iirc, gets the gen light connected to it.

If you find you have the box, hunt down a wiring diagram for a 73/74 
beetle - it'll have the details you need for the hookup.

I haven't touched one in about 12 years, when my last one burned up (and 
I switched to the 2 wire internally regulated guys), so I can't help much 
more than that....
