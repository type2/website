Surfing I see Yakima sells "HiRise" towers with a spacer that clears 10 3/4
inches.  Perhaps enough for the Rivi, perhaps not?  Looks like just spacer
blocks though that go on their normal gutter clamps, which come in pretty
significantly, so I'd hit a Yakima dealer to trial fit before buying a set. 
Conversely Thule has "super high foot" rack adapters as well, which appear
less ghetto actually (not a spacer but a purpose made adapter) and go higher
without going in as much.  They claim 11" height.  $150-200ish for set of 4
adapters of either brand it looks.  Then wide Yakima or Thule bars are on *bay
all the time or surf craigslist, much cheaper than new, but shipping can get
you.
 
My ghetto Bug Out set was like $20 of course, and 2 2x4s, and some loud
carpet.

changing: those of you said you have a frame that goes AROUND or OVER the
poptop and you put the canoe on top of that instead of directly on the
fiberglass, got any photos of such a rig, or more info on what such a frame
is
called or brand name or...?
