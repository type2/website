Subject: Question about catalytic converter requirements

I was curious how I would figure out if my car requires a catalytic 
converter.  I'm pretty sure that my bus is not a California model, but 
I'm not totally sure.  And if that is the case (which I'm hoping someone 
can help me figure out), am I required to have a cat?

thanks!
Mike
