Thanks for the input on this.

It's just about having the bus stripped for paint - want to keep it
easy so the entire interior can just be shot at once. Which of course
means me doing much more work to get the organics removed. Between the
tar and the contact cement everywhere I'm having a tough time.

Interesting Bentley calls for that since that's the primary rust point!
