Subject: Oil plug failure: Was Re: [T2] First camping trip in bus

Hi LJ,

I had my oil plug drop out about 100 miles from home on a trip back in 
2004. At roadside I discovered that a seat belt bolt has the same thread 
as the oil plug bolt. I put a nut on it to make sure it didn't go too 
deep. And I was super-lucky in that the friend I was traveling with had 
very recently purchased a whole case of 20W50. We were back under way in 
less than an hour total.

Happy Trails,
