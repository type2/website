That was your cue to pass them an additional $40 and let them fix it
for you. Easier to have it done and over with than go through all this
hassle :-)

 After the smog test, I plan to disconnect the  EGR again , I red in the type
 2 archive that by disconnecting the EGR you should also change your timing
 but I could not find by how much ?

The 5 ATDC issue has to do with the retard connection on your
distributor. It has nothing to do with the EGR

 for the environment ? EGR are only found in California engine in the US and
 my emissions inspection showed that I am clean. What is the benefice of EGR
 (other than environmental ) ?

I suppose that's a controversial question, and you may get a lot of
answers, but I always thought it best to leave it connected as long as
it is in working order. It just introduces inert exhaust gas into the
intake mix to reduce combustion temperatures, which is probably a good
thing when dealing with an air-cooled engine. I'll leave it to others
to explore the more arcane facets of the issue.
