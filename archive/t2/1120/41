Well, I don't want to lose heat.  Granted, it could just be for testing, 
but it's another sum of money spent towards something that may or may 
not work.

That said, I finally put an email into Jake and he told me that my setup 
is misconfigured - which is pretty much what he said when I first bought 
the heads, but I didn't want to change things too much because I was 
worried that I might not pass smog.

So, I'm going to chat with him this Wednesday and see what he has to 
say.  Based on a bunch of reading on the Camper Special, I'm guessing 
I'm going to have to change the cam, possibly have some headwork done, 
bump up the compression ratio, change my exhaust and I might need to run 
higher octane fuel.  Most of the changes don't bother me that much 
because they're just initial time and money spent - it's the change to 
higher octane fuel that has a long-term cost effect... I guess I'm just 
gonna have to get a better job to support the bus :)

Mike
