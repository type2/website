Subject: Re: Canoe on top of poptop?

Actually, John, I figured out that I wasn't bundling up all the canvas and
screen properly when I pulled the top down, that is why it was hard to get the
edges to fit nicely in the rain gutters. It works much better now. I haven't
forgotten you guys telling me I need to get spline to put around the edges.
Soon's I get it cleaned and painted will do that.

However, after reading all the different aspects I'm leaning against putting
the canoe up there because it's NOT a Westy top. Mama mia, it would be such a
pain to fix it or replace it from AK if the fiberglass broke. So question is
changing: those of you said you have a frame that goes AROUND or OVER the
poptop and you put the canoe on top of that instead of directly on the
fiberglass, got any photos of such a rig, or more info on what such a frame is
called or brand name or...?

(Should I be asking this question at Samba.com? I haven't figured out how to
navigate that site yet so hope you don't mind if I'm a little off-topic.)

thanks much, as always.
