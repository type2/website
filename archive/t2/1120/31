I dented in the front of my bus that it was pretty much shot.  I went to 
a junkyard, had them chop off the front of another bus that was still in 
good condition, and then had that piece welded onto my bus.  The metal 
guy that did the work was *very* good and did an awesome job.  You'll 
want to find someone that does this kind of work and has done it before 
and you'll get great results.
