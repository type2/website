Okay. This is making sense now. It jives with what I've learned about
the air-cooled engine being phased out of the market because
increasingly strict smog regulations forced settings that ran the
engine too hot. I didn't realize that extended to the engine design.
So now I know that besides being saddled with oddities like a dual
vacuum distributor, smog also gave us engines that were not ideally
engineered. So I'm sure Jake knows what he is doing, and I will be
interested in what he has you do as well.

 he's done something right.

 "worried" with smog and that worry resulted in poor performing, hot running
 engines.
