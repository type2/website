one of those little tidbits never ever take the center bolt out of the 
bottom of the engine it looks like where you would drain but it is super 
easy to break and never wants to seal correctly always use the actual 
drain plug a 19mm just to the rear and right of that center plug. this is 
tough bolt and is the real place for draining the oil.

that center one is the oil pick up and can be broken very easily and if 
broken means a major engine repair.

hope luck was on your side....
