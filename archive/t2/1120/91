Subject: Concrete color - WHITE

I used to think this was completely stupid until someone explained the science
behind it.

Go with with, as I remember seeing on many Air Force bases in hangars, as the
white reflects the light up so you can see a little better under your jet
fighter (bus), or any vehicle. Don't use floor paint but a two part epoxy and
as always SURFACE PREP, is the key to a lasting paint job
