Subject: Re: [T2] Window Lifter  Regulator Replacement

Karl's way is obviously the right way, and will keep you from screwing 
anything up, however, I used a small flat sided prybar set against the 
wing channel inside the door to carefully and quickly create a gap big 
enough to slide the regulator through. Took a couple of minutes and 
didn't do any damage to the door or the channel. I'd say be extra 
careful to not bend the wing channel if you try this way.
