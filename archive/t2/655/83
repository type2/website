When hot, it expands, the cable moves and the flaps open.

Open to keep the engine from overheating if the spring is properly
connected. The only downside to this is that the engine will be overcooled
at startup and the Hoover advice wrt this is that the cylinder will wear a
little more than normal over their lifetime.

It's stamped on the thermostat. The Type 4 unit says 85-90C (185-194F) which
would have the fully open by then.

Open, otherwise you risk head and/or piston failure from overheating.
