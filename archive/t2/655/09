Subject: Baywindow Popout Glass & Fiamma Rack

Volks,

(1) Back when I was still brain-storming my resto, I recall coming across
custom popout glass and frame for the rear hatch of a Baywindow.  Anyone
know the vendor or have a link?

(2) Anyone on the list have the Fiamma bike rack sold by JustKampers?  How
is it?

Thanks, all, and Happy Thanksgiving!
