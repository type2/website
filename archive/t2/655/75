Marc,
What model distributor did the mechanic install? This is huge, as the wrong
one can cause drivability issues. That said, the electronic distributors are
far superior to the points, IMHO, and the only reason to remove one and
replace it with a mechanical dizzy is if it's totally worn out and you can't
afford a new correct one. If he's installed an 009 (identifiable by a lack
of vacuum canisters on the sides and a part number ending in "009"), I'd
steer clear of that mechanic in the future. By the way, make sure your
battery is strapped down. A hard left could tilt the battery, causing the +
terminal on the cable, if it's oriented the right way, to come in contact
with the body, causing a low voltage situation.

> 2.  Now here's the weird one - when I make a left turn and step on the
brake, the turn signal goes all wacky.  It either  slows down or stops.
Never happens when I make a right turn.  And it's intermittent as well.
Sometimes the left turn signal works just fine.
