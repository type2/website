Subject: Re: [T2] 80 Vanagon odometer not working

Well I figured out what was jamming the odometer. the reset button presses a
lever that moves and allows the trip odometer to reset. there is a steel shaft
that has a coil spring attached to it that stops the lever from going too far
into the odometer wheels. this shaft had moved to one side slightly, allowing
the lever to jam the gears. moved the shaft back into position. Now every
thing operates smoothly. All I have to do now is find the lost spur gear and
I'll be counting miles. Does anyone have a spare gear they want to sell?

  It seems the P.O. must have reset the trip odometer while moving 1 too many
  times. I got the shaft back into position with the gear engaged. Ran the
  speedo at aprox. 20 mph with a variable speed drill. seemed to clock the
miles
  ok for about 15 miles then the gears locked up and the spur gear spun off
the
  shaft and got lost somewhere in my living room, ^&*)&^&%^(   . I tried
moving
  the shaft the gear came off of using a small piece of vacuum hose. Found
that
  if I press slightly on the trip reset I can count up the miles ok, tried to
  remove the MPH pointer so I could remove the dial face but no go! I wonder,
is
  there anything that can be done to repair this situation without trashing
the
  whole thing?

  Looking for the lost gear
