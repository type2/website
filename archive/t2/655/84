Subject: Depressing afternoon working on the bus...

I just spent the past few hours trying to get my wiper motor working.
I found it was easier to pull the entire dash out a foot or so than to
try to get the (-at-)^%&(-at-)#~! thing out from underneath.

Rained on me the whole time I was working on this. Not so bad when
working in the bus, but the weather decided to dump buckets on me when
I was pulling off the wiper arms and pushing the shafts into the bus.

With the dash off I discovered that the windshield rust is worse than
I thought. I was watching water weeping from around the seal into the
bus. Crap.

With the motor out, I got it to turn while on the bench. But it was
painfully slow. Cleaned and lubed the arm joints, no difference. Tried
wiring both leads up, no difference.

When I had checked out the switch a couple weeks ago, the thing was
shorted all across the contacts. That tells me that the switch burned
out the motor which now draws an outrageous amount of current to not
move anything. Could have been the other way around, though, but I
doubt it. The white plastic carrier for the switch was cracked. The
wires now get nice and toasty if I power it up.

So, I need a switch AND a motor. And no $$ in the budget for the bus
until after the holidays.

I haven't even cleaned up all my tools yet. Decided to come in for a
drink and a few minutes to surf the net first. I did manage to put
everything back together first.
