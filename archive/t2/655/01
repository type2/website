Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Idle Retard connection - 71 DP

When discussing vacuum hose connections on a '71, there are a couple of
units that have not been discussed.

There is a vacuum control valve that lives on the left side of the engine
bay just inside the hatch.

There is a throttle positioner on the back of the carburator.


A hose comes off of the left manifold to the vacuum control valve,
hooking up to the port extending radially from the valve.

A hose comes from the axial port of the vacuum control valve and goes to
the left port of the throttle positioner.

A hose comes from the right port of the throttle positioner and goes to
the port extending upward at an angle from the base of the carburator.

A hose comes from the port extending aft from the carburator and goes to
the distributor port nearest the cap

A hose comes from the left side of the carburator and goes to the
distributor port farthest from the cap.

This is how my stock '71 was set up, and I think that this is correct.
