Subject: Shipping to Hawaii

To ship a hitch to Hawaii, check out Yellow Freight under freight
forwarders in the phone book. They have been consistently cheaper than
UPS, FEDEX etc. in my experience. They shipped a long block from
California for $86 when UPS wanted  $240! Cheaper, too, if you  can take
the package to them and have it picked up at the other end, instead of
door to door.  Aloha, Timo
