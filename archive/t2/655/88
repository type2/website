Well Don, that's quite an adventure you've had today. All I can say is
bless your heart!

If you have the motor out, why not dissasseble it to see if maybe
you've got binding bushings you could lubricate, or burned brushes and
armatures you could clean and otherwise generally refurbish it if
there is no permanent damage like burned out windings?

If that doesn't work, credit card? Or a trip to a junkyard? Hate
buying electrical parts there though. Can't tell if they are good!
Ebarf? :-) Need to have those wipers this week! Well, rain-x does a
world of good too.

If Richard hasn't gotten back to you yet, it's electro-magnetic field
(or force).

Best of luck to you!

John
