Subject: Dumb Thermostat/Heat Flaps Question

I can move the lever for the air flaps but I don't understand/know what
position is open or closed and, I'm not sure if my thermostat is working -
so:

 

1 - Does the thermostat pull the wire when it gets hot or does release the
wire when it gets hot?

1a -  If the wire is not attached and the lever on the flaps is let loose so
that the spring move the lever - are the flaps open to let are in or closed
to help warm the engine?

2 - When should the thermostat move the wire. i.e. It was about 50 degrees F
today and I started the motor and let it run until is slowed to an idle
(around 5 minutes)- should the thermostat have moved?

3 - If we determine that the thermostat is no longer working - what should
my plan of attack be (I understand that the thermostat is NLA)?  Until I can
find a suitable replacement for the thermostat, should I leave the flaps
open or close (summer / winter)?

 

TIA
