Subject: [T2] Help prevent a vanagon related suicide!

I second Tom's recommendation..... after fuel stands for a year, it loses some 
of its volatility.  You began to address condensation effects by adding what is 
generally an alcohol product, but this would have the side-effect of lowering 
octane rating.  I don't recall how difficult it is to flush a Vanagon tank, but 
if there is any way to get a sample from your tank, I would check that 
immediately.  It might be smart to rig a temporary, known-to-be-clean (small) 
tank filled with fresh fuel, and see how the engine runs on that.  Best of luck!

My first question is, did you drain all the year old fuel when you changed
the filter? I just changed the hoses and filter on my 80 Westy after it had
sat for about a year. I drained all the fuel into a clean gas can intending
to put it back into the tank when finished. I happened to look in the can
before returning the gas to the tank and the color of the fuel caught my
eye! It looked way too dark.....
