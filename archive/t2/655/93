Subject: Dumb Thermostat/Heat Flaps Question

When the engine is cold the cable pulls the flaps closed.
As the engine heats up the bellows expand with heat and the cable allows the
spring on the cross rod to open the flaps.
I've run my flaps in the full open position for ten years, just locked open.
I'm sure the thermostat helps in cold weather but my Vanagons have all been
hard to warm because I use giant oil coolers on all of them.
