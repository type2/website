There used to be a kit available to make one from your stock sump plate. It
had a drilling pattern, sender and the right kind of nut to back up the
sender. You need a very small size nut on the inside or it will hang up on
the case, but it is completely do-able. I can try to get a photo of one, my
buddy has my old one on his bus which I made myslef. I had to machine the
inside nut so it had no flats left on it. It ended up looking like a
threaded collar. Then I brazed the nut/collar to the plate. Measure twice
where the hole has to go :-)
