Subject: Re: [T2] Dumb Thermostat/Heat Flaps Question

Forgive me for jumping in on the conversation....

Loose flaps don't necessarily signal a bad thermostat. Check to see
that the cable hasn't popped off the roller. Also, make sure it is
securely attached and tightened (adjusted to remove slack) at the
clamp. Also, physically inspect the thermostat to see if it looks
expanded or contracted.

 So, since I can move the lever for the flaps when the engine is cold, I
 should assume that my thermostat is already expanded... therefore NG.
