Hi Marc,

Start with the basics:

1. Check vacuum. If less than 15" at idle then go hunting for the leak. 
You can use a can of quickstart or unlit propane torch to help find the 
leak, but be careful because there is a serious risk of fire. Spray the 
FI components while the engine is running and if the RPMs increasy you 
have found a leak.
2. Confirm dwell and timing with set idle to spec. Idle speed is 
critical to auto tranny performance.
3. Set valves and check compression (This also gives you an opportunity 
to read the spark plugs, and to log the compression values for future 
reference.)
4. Check the fuel pressure.

Once you have confirmed the above, get back to us.

Happy trails,
