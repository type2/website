Subject: from 1.8 to 2 w/ hydr. lifters

Well, after a few years of fun, the 2.2 liter 911 engine is on the 
fritz. I eventually hope to upgrade to a 3.2 and a matching 
transmission, but these things take time to find and install. And 
money, too... :(

In the meantime, I'm ready to go back to type IV power and plan to buy 
an AVP engine. My bus is a '75 and had the 1.8 fuel injected engine. I 
still have all the original parts.

Question: the busdepot suggests the 2 liter engine as an upgrade to the 
1.8. In my opinion, the FI is probably not optimized for the extra 
displacement, but is it close enough?

I'm also considering a move to hydraulic lifters. I cannot think of any 
reason why this would be a problem, but if anyone does, please do let 
me know.

TIA!

Sami
