Whazzat? A back emf? Only thing I can think of is "Electro-Mechanical
Feedback" but that can't be right, can it?

The motor all by its lonesome barely moves. The arms are all nice and
smooth and move with barely any effort when not hooked to the motor.
The plastic bushings were all in decent shape too, no cracks.

So, I suppose there could be some internal physical resistance in the
motor. Siezed bearings, etc... Unless there's something else I'm
missing?
