I have to agree with Bob, you can test it in your driveway like I would at my shop. Bring the vanagon to running temp and normal idle speed if possible. Then just press the brakes most people have the habit of pressing the brakes when starting a vehicle, explaining hard restarts.  You could be pulling power from your ignition system, remember your brake lights run directly off your ignition. If you have a multi you can test drop at the coil.
