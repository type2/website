Subject: VW shop in Pine, CO

Folks...

Drove through Pine, CO Friday... saw a small AC VW shop ... one purple 
metallic bay, a bay double-cab, and maybe half-dozen parts bays, along 
with a Bug and a few old Jettas.

It was closed, and I didn't really have time to stop to check it out.

Anyone know this shop?
