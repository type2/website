Subject: 80 Vanagon odometer not working

In most cases you can sand the shaft area on the drive rod under the spur
gear and glue it back.
If you clean it real good and just use some super glue It'll last for
several years.
Try to never reset the odometer/trip meter while the van is moving. It'll
break the speedometer.
I think that scenario is common on all VDO speedometers.
