Subject: fs: cylinder heads

I cleaned up around the shop today,, started to put things in piles of similar
items...
I have some difficulty with type4 cylinder heads .... I had to triple check some
of the numbers and measurements as they do not jive with any information I
have,, but it looks like this is the list of heads I have and do not need
They are cores only, some are complete,, with the exception of the ** ones, they
would need some attention.
The ones I marked with ** are very clean, complete, rebuilt?
If you see something your interested,, pmail me and I will give you exact
details and photos
If you can identify the 022 101 371 H  in cc size I'd appreciate it!
