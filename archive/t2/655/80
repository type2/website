Your drain pipe runs under the vehicle and is supposed to have a cap
on it to hold your gray water until you can get to an approved gray
water dumping site.

 HI
             I am the owner of a 1975 VW camper an I am wondering if anybody
 could tell me if the drain water from the sink is suppose to be collected in
a
 holding tank or should it be draining directly on the ground
 Thanks.
