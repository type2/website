Subject: Re: [T2] Help prevent a vanagon related suicide!

People have suggested a vacuum leak, which would result in lean running.
But, the opposite situation, i.e., too rich, can cause the exact same
symptoms.  Since you said the problem was occurring in traffic (suggesting
the engine is warm) and that sometimes you'd have to wait a minute or two
before it'd start, a too-rich mixture (a not-uncommon problem for an '81
AFM) was my first thought.  If you've got an California vehicle with an O2
sensor you might check the output of that (engine completely warmed up) or,
if it's a Federal model, take it to a shop with an exhaust gas analyzer.

Most of the time, it was fine.  I figured it was water in the gas or
something that would work itself out with time.  I put in a bottle of "dry
gas".

The vehicle did sit for a year while I was working on it.  It's got a brand
new fuel pump.
