Definitely for stationary use only. Don't know how that differs from
just popping the hatch, but it could be more convenient.

 The oil comes out  from under the back of the bus and is deposited
 on the engine hatch and the rear hatch and window...Now, I can't say
 for sure that a pop out hatch window will suck exhaust fumes back
 into the bus, but I might bet a virtual buck that it does... ;-(
