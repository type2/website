Gerald,

The pics are good-enuf!  So, can you add anything to what John C. said 
about the "unilite"?

This one appears to be mech advance only...I don't see a vacuum can...

Looks like it has the optical pickup as well.

Was it worth $289 in terms of power....can you "see" the difference when 
you timed it over a bosch(old or new, I don't care)?

Better gas mileage?
Does it have the grey springs like John talked about?


Why did you spring for it rather than some other dist?


Cheers, dave
