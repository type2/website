I think your hunch of a vacuum leak is the best first place to look.
I had one in the "Y" connector off the plenum underneath a hose clamp. 
The PO put clamps on it to keep it tight but over time with vibration 
the clamp cut into the rubber.  Loosen any clamps and check under them.

Next I'd check the resistor on the front wall of the engine compartment.
I bought my '80 after the PO had replaced the engine.  It had been 
slowly developing a similar behavior.  After checking a number of things 
I found that a couple of the wires on the ceramic resistor at the end of 
the wire harness were broken.  This probably occurred when his mechanic 
reinstalled the motor and bumped it.  It sits on the upper left (facing 
forward looking into the engine compartment) of the front wall of the 
engine compartment.  Without proper resistance the computer can't manage.

Hope this helps.
