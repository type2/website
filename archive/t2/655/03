I said I'd take pics of the UniLite installed on my motor. I did, then
couldn't find he USB cable that fits my camera <sigh>.

I finally dug out my card reader and transferred them that way.

I tried to show how much it blocks the oil pressure sender location but I
was "shooting blind" just holding the camera inside the engine compartment
from the back and pushing the button.. You can sort-of see it in a few
shots but none really shows it from directly above -- and the angle on some
shots is enough to make you seasick <grin>.

If someone wants pics that are more clear let me know and I'll clear the
tool boxes off of the hatch and shoot from the top.
