Been crawling on hand and knees for 2 hours. I'm sure as soon as I make
arrangements to get another it will rematerialize. Is it possible I have a
black hole in my living room? Opened an old speedo (71 I think) hoping to use
its gear. No-go, its brass and pressed on so well I think I would break
something getting it off.

  C'mon. The law of conservaton of mass and energy means that gear is
  still there! (somewhere...)
