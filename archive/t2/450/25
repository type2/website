Subject: swing arm bushing

Maybe I didn't explain it correctly last time. So here it goes again. My 
center pin bushings and the new center pin appear to be loose out of the 
box. Is this normal and the grease will take up the tolerance? Is my pin 
and bushings defective? Anyone have a new center pin kit they could 
check out for me?
