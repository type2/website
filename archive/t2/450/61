Subject: chips

I dont know about the Van-O-gone but installing a 
"performance chip" can gain you some extra ummpp.
  On this subject go to www.vwvortex.com. There
is always a thread on this subject going. The chip
controls a number of parameters and the stock chips
"detune" the car a bit. I would agree that if you
want significant improvements you need to get a little
deeper into the engine.:-) But from what I have seen
a chip change can make a difference. I know a couple
of serious water head speed types you are running
high 11's (Waterwagens/Seattle) and they are not
running stock chips.
