Subject: Oil capacity - perplexed

Hi folks...

Changed oil and filter in my '76 Westy today, and I'm a little 
perplexed by the apparent capacity of the case.

Firstly, I ran the engine for about 5 minutes to let it warm up and 
thin the oil out, and then removed the plug and went on to my other 
project to give it plenty of time to drain.  I'd say it had 30 minutes 
or so to drain.  After my other project was done, I removed the oil 
filter, and then wiped the drain plug opening and filter sealing 
surface clean with a rag.  Reinstalled plug.

Now, Bentley claims "7.4 US pints" for an engine with oil filter.  By 
my calculation, that is just a tad over 3.5 quarts.

Muir, on the other hand, claims 3 quarts for an engine with oil filter.

My observation is different than both.  I put about .5 quart into the 
filter before installing it (no reason other than this is simply the 
way my dad taught me to do it when I was a kid).  I then put 2 quarts 
into the case via the filler neck.

So now I pull the dipstick, wipe it clean, dip it again, and it reads a 
bit (like maybe 3/16''-1/4'') over the "full" mark.  "Uh, what gives?"

Ok, I'll give the oil a little time to settle in the sump (which, of 
course, should be totally unnecessary since you're filling directly 
into the sump, right?), and head off for lunch.  Come back about 40 
minutes later, check again, still over the "full" mark.

So, I'm a little confused.  Can someone help me out, here?  Itt can't 
really be overfull, can it?  If it is, can I siphon the excess oil out 
of the filler neck using a small hand pump?
