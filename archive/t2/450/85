Hiya Richard,

I was under the general impression that this company was hanging on by the 
skin of their teeth.  Their service/communications were spotty at best.  I 
visited their place of business and was not impressed.  I'm not surprised to see 
their website go down.
I think I'll drive by again and see what's going on, if anything.

Mike
