To follow up... I hooked up my dwell meter again tonight, and it read 
back about 40 degrees.  Clearly I need to regap the points (I have a 
new points and condenser, so I might as well put new parts in while I'm 
at it) and time it.  Tach indicates about 800RPM idle speed.  I think 
that's a little low, but I need to recheck Bentley.

While it is clearly running better with the new vacuum hoses (in the 
correct configuration!), it's still idling a bit rougher than I think 
it should.  I'm also seeing a "hesitation" when revving at a 
standstill... I can bring it up to about 1500RPM (that's just a by-ear 
guess) okay, but if I hold it there, it begins to labor a bit, and 
hesitate.  I experienced this problem before I replaced the hoses; 
moving the Bus back to the curb in front of my house last week, I 
nearly stalled in the middle of an intersection just pulling away from 
the stop sign.

I suspect it's just a timing problem (with the dwell that far off, I'm 
sure the timing is whacked, too); all 4 cylinders seem to be firing 
(i.e. it idles worse if I pull each plug wire one at a time).
