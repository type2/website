Subject: Re: [T2] Chipping?

"Chipping" an engine is routinely done by guys that won't/can't get their
hands dirty, or can't perform REAL upgrades themselves. You'll routinely
here the Rice Crowd throw terms around like "chipping", "NAAAWWWS", etc, and
most of them have no clue how an engine really works anyways, so it's good
for a laugh as they try to impress their friends.

"Chipping" an engine is either installing a new ECU, or re-programming the
existing one, to achieve different engine controls (boost, timing, injector
times, etc), and it's almost always done to improve performance. The only
Flat-4 VW engines you can do this to are the late model vanagons.

It's also worth noting that in many cases "chipping" a car does absolutely
ZERO to increase an engine's peformance. It's easy to put something in a box
with fancy marketing and advertising, most of the guys buying them would
never know if the thing was faster or not. Of course if they pay $200 for a
"chip" they'll swear it is now faster then before, even if the chip
changeover was never even performed by a mechanic.
