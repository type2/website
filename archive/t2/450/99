Subject: odd problem

Hi all!

My 78 westy (stock FI) has a funny problem.  I recently replaced the header
and exhaust.  I have the 74 style heat exchangers.  When I had the header
off, I noticed that 3 of the pipes were dark colored, while one was very
light grey.  This cylinder also has a pronounced popping while running.  The
engine runs smooth at idle and at speed, and runs cool. It definitely is not
missing because the engine has plenty of power. I am thinking the cylinder
is lean from an injector seal, perhaps?  Or does anyone think burnt exhaust
valve??

Thanks
