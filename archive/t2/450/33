<< Hiya All,

I was making small talk at a function the other night with my boss's boss.  
He a real Porsche fanatic.  The conversation drifted around to AC engine 
potential.  I had made some remark that the VW engines could be built to 
considerably higher horsepower.  He replied that it used to be that one could 
"chip" a 
Porsche engine.  But nowadays they were so built that one could no longer 
"chip".  I had no idea what he specifically meant by "chip" and so, not to 
look like 
a complete idiot, I smiled and comiserated with him.
What does he mean by "chipping" an AC engine?  Anybody out there familiar 
with this term? >>

With the increasing use of electronics to control engines (and now 
suspensions),
a new section has opened in the Hot Rod Supermarket...Gentlemen, hack your
engines! Essentially, to "chip" or "rechip" an engine is to change the 
program-
ming to your specifications...I would suspect that this might work best on
engines not built for speed; i.e. a Honda Civic engine that from the factory 
is
set up for economy and compliance with emissions standards...The Porsche
(which BTW, is no longer AC) starts out as close to optimum as the factory
thinks is still reliable...Can it be hot rodded? Sure. Track Porsches are 
faster
than stock street Porsches and you could (if your wallet could stand it) build
a street machine that is the equal of a track car, but it would take more than
just a new "chip"...Impress your boss's boss, tell him you've insured all your
relatives and after you collect after the contract killings, you're gonna buy 
a
really fast car...A Bugatti Veyron 16/4... Zoom ZOOM ... 8-)
