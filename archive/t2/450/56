Subject: Re: [T2] Chipping?

Hiya Scott, John, and others,

Thanks for pulling my head out of the sixties and seventies.  I was aware 
that modern cars are computer controlled and vaguely aware of the presence of 
silicone chips in those computers.  But I sure as heck (obviously) did not relate 
that to the comments I had heard.
I hear you John..............To be absolutely honest, I am a lot more 
comfortable back in the automotive sixties and seventies.  You know, when improving 
performance meant actually doing something to the engine rather than mess with 
artificial intelligence.
And Scott, thanks for your comprehensive "hand into the present".  But I am 
still puzzled at one thing he said.  He was sad about not being able to "chip" 
present day Porsche engines (his words and sentiment, not mine).  Does this 
make sense?
