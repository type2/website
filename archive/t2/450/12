Subject: Best place to get a rebuilt longblock

I am in maryland and need a new longblock to put in my
83 aircooled vanagon.  Any suggestions as to the best
companies to go with and best prices for mail order?
also if anyone knows a shop close to the baltimore
area that would be great as well.

Thanks
Drew
