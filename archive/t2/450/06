I have a few videos that show snippets only. A whole bunch of factory VW 
and Porsche photos can be found in "Excellence Was Expected", the 
definitive history of Herr Dok. Ing. Ferdinand Porsche and his sons. 
Original editions in good condition go for $100 or more. The current 3 
volume updated version is way spendy. My brother has many VW books showing 
inside factory pics, so start cruising the local book stores, or search at 
Powells.com. Super service and huge inventory used and new books. Full 
downtown block, 3 stories, and several mall stores in the area of Portland, 
Oregon.
