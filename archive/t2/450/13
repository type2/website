On my own '73 Panel:

HPIRDNK

The frame says:

Hair Like a Hippie
Heart of a Redneck

The reason:
My last hair cut: December 4, 1998, The day before my last Reserve 
Drill.  (10 years Active Duty, 13 Years Reserve).
The Redneck part:  Bluegrass and Country Musician  (deep hobby/Obsession 
and occasional job but not the one that pays the bills).
