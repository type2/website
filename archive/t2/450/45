Subject: My continuing vacuum saga

Folks...

I finally had some time to untangle my vacuum line mess today.  Several 
vacuum connections were incorrect (thanks for the diagram, Alex!), and 
several lines were old and leaky.  One of the incorrect connections I 
believe was causing the Bus to run rich at idle (incorrect connection 
for Fuel Pressure Regulator).

Here are the connections as the stand now:

	Intake Air Distributor:
		- Decel Valve
		- Fuel Pressure Regulator
		- Distributor timing retard
		- EGR valve
		- capped nipple for vacuum gauge

	Throttle:
		- Air cleaner
		- Distributor timing advance

The only connection I'm not sure about it the EGR valve.  It is correct 
on the intake, or should it be on the throttle?

Anyway, gauge tapped onto the intake vacuum reads 15'', which isn't 
bad, but I think I'd like to see 1 or 2 more.  I might be imagining 
things, but I could swear I can still hear a hissing sound that would 
be symptomatic of a vacuum leak.  I still need to check the dwell, 
timing, and idle, though, so I could see some improvement there.  I 
know of the wonders of using starting fluid to check for vacuum leaks, 
but I really hate spraying flammable stuff all over the engine 
compartment.

On the other hand, the rich running problem seems to have gone away.

So, can anyone comment on the EGR valve?  Once I have that clarified, I 
think I can put the vacuum issue to rest for now.

Thanks!
