That's a really really really long time...

Right.

Also right!

Sounds like you overfilled it. Everyone is so eager to get it to read
exactly at the full mark they usually blow it. I've done it too.

The amount of oil required depends on how much of the old oil is stuck to
the interior of the engine, in the passageways, etc.  A clean crankcase
required 4 qt. of oil, 3.5 qt. is the spec and having to add less at oil
change time is more typical.

Ever since discovering that I've only put in 3 qt., examined the stick and
decided to pour in more afterwards. The amount of oil the between the two
marks translates into 1/2 quart.

If it's really overfull then you can remove the drain plug and quickly put
it back. The oil will stop flowing out even before you thread the plug so
you don't have to worry about it all coming out unless the oil is too hot.
You should wait until it's cool...
