Mike,
any time.
With regards to present day Porsche engines, I'm guessing your guy is a bit 
behind the times.

The Boxter has pretty much a "present day" porsche engine.

I'm guessing that he is referring to the days of past when it was as simple 
as pulling the old chip out and swapping in a new one.  I'm looking at my 
stack of GM chips up on the shelf and GM was real nice, providing a easily 
removable holder for each chip, with the actual swap taking much less time 
than opening up the ECM.

Now its a BIT more complicated but not impossible and in some cases, not 
what you want an average grease monkey messing with.
