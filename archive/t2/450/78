i have yet to check my brake lights, (bus is under
construction) but i know they dont work... 
I was browsing a catalogue the other day and came
across the brake switch, this thing is only like 3 or
4 bucks and im ready to put money on thats the problem
w/ mine, my bulbs seem fine but thats as far as i
checked.
