Subject: shifting is stressing me out man ...

Jeeze!

Okay so.  I had this same problem before the summer and I THOUGHT the nice 
mechanic guy I paid to fix it indeed did FIX it, but now this problem has 
returned.

At a full stop ie. stop sign or just starting the bus, I have INCREDIBLE 
difficulty shifting into first.  It seems that I always get third or 
something.  I have to push down into the floor and really grind it to get 
first.  Sometimes shifting into reverse, then trying first works.  Getting 
to a stop sign from thrid, then stopping, then going to neutral then first, 
is almost impossible.

The mechanic I mentioned replaced my old hockey stick and a bushing at the 
linkage and somehow tightened up my shifting in July.  It worked beautifully 
for two months, but now it's beginning to deteriorate, and I know it won't 
be long until I absolutely can't get into first or second no matter how hard 
I try.

Am I doing something wrong while I am driving?  Is this transmission 
trouble?  Is this simply more linkage problems?  Please help!

ps.  I have searched the archives and found similar (identical actually) 
problems that people have had, but have had a difficult time finding good 
answers to this problem; so sorry for the repetition ...
