Original editions in good condition go for $100 or more. The current 3 
volume updated version is way spendy. My brother has many VW books showing 
inside factory pics, so start cruising the local book stores, or search at 
Powells.com. Super service and huge inventory used and new books. Full 
downtown block, 3 stories, and several mall stores in the area of Portland, 
Oregon.

is a superb way to search through the shelves
of many book sellers without leaving home.
Great for pre-read books too... ;-)
