If you're a kindler, gentler, type, You can also use a balljoint puller
that pushes the stud out from the nut end.  I made one from a Chevy pitman
arm puller, easily found at your FLAPS.  I made a spacer to go into the
fork of the puller to close up the hole to fit the ball joint.

Hmm, there is either a clamp that locks the adjustment or no adjustment at
all on tie rods.  On the drag link there can be either a clamp or a jam
nut depending upon the age of the part.
