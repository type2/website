Subject: Ignition Switch woes

Hi Group,

I've been away for quite some time - Had to sort out some matters over the 
past two years and have had to be hunkered down with my nose to the grind 
stone - All better now !

About to take off for a 3 week road trip in NewBus, and the ignition switch 
went kapoot Saturday.
All works fine, except for actual actuation of the starter.
I can do a push button fix to get me by.

Long term solution ?
Can the old one be fixed, and if so, to what probability?
Or is it better to just buy a new switch and tumbler to fit all other keys?

I am on digest mode.
