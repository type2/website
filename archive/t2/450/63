Subject: O2 sensor readings on  A/F gauge 

I just got my O2 sensor installed and hooked up to a new A/F meter.  According to the gauge, I am running rich most of the time.  This is on a my 2.0 haydraulic with Dual 36 dells.  (135 mains, 190 A/C, 60 idle 50 pump) 
 
Is it normal to run rich like this for an aircooled?  I am worried about leaning it out to the 14.7:1 and causing burnt vavles or something. 
I am sure others use a A/F meter, what are the readings on those?
 
Paul.
