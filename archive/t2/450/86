The original aftermarket chips in the 1980s simply advanced the timing and
then required premium fuel to prevent detonation.  The engine management
software in most modern engines use knock detection to automatically adjust
timing to fuel octane.  So, there is little to be gained with this old
trick.

Some newer ships promise revised fuel injection maps and/or advance curves,
but it's pretty darned hard to out-engineer the factory on these.  One of
the major car mags did a test a couple of years ago with a number of cars
and aftermarket chips.  They ran dyno tests, 0-60, 0-100, quarter mile and
rolling acceleration tests on cars with stock programming and then the
aftermarket programming.

They found that aftermarket tuners could only make gains in 3 areas.  First,
on turbocharged cars, they could basically turn up the boost.  In most cases
this will reduce drivetrain durability, but this is an acceptable trade-off
to many.  Second, on cars equipped with an automatic transmission, they
could reprogram the shift points for faster acceleration.  Third, some
programmers allowed a certain amount of knock before the software would
retard the timing.  In testing, the mag found some small gains doing this
while creating some quite noticeble knocking.

In normally-aspirated, manual transmission cars, they found virtually no
increase in measured hp, torque, or acceleration.  In some case, the
aftermarket programming actually decreased performance.

So, I think that is what is meant by saying that you can't chip modern cars.
Sure, you can pay your money, but that doesn't guarantee any gain in
performance.
