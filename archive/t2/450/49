Looks like an Adventure Wagon conversion??  Even with a bad engine,
$1100 would be good here in the east.  A loss of power in a FI bus (and
it just happened to my daughter's 75) does not always mean bad valve-
did you do a compression test after a valve adj??  It could well be due
to a cylinder not firing- her bus showed spark on a 4 cyl, but it had no
accel poop or uphill verve- our local mechanic listened to it and said
it was not firing on cyl #1-turns out it was not firing that injector-
fixed the harness connector and it now is fine.

allowed how it seemed to loose power just as she was exiting the freeway
near my house.  My guess - and it's only a guess - is that it burned a
valve.  .
