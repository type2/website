Subject: RE: westy trailer

I'd also been musing about one day having a westy again since i sold my 
71 last May and until I find a better place to hide them  from the 
mrs., I am not allowed to have more than 2 non running vehicles here at 
any givin time.

very, very, far fetched, but my idea was to take a rotted out east 
coast westy, and cut out all non-structural sheet metal from the rain 
gutters down, remove all doors, and glass, and cut out the entire frame 
minus 6" in from the outside, then bolt the remains onto a 5.5" by 14' 
utility trailer, and wrap and rivit the whole thing from gutters down 
in  aluminum sheeting ala windstream.  Two sets of Jalousie windows on 
the drivers side, and at least one set on the other.  Tongue weight 
would be a problem, unless the sliding door was removed, so the wheels 
could be more centered.  I figure total weight in this scenario to be 
under 3,000 lbs.  I've also devised a block and tackle system of 
removing it from the trailer during non-camping season, so the trailer 
could still be used.  I guess all I need is someone to tell me it can't 
be done, and I'll get started on it :)

  I guess there's the question of when is a westy no longer a westy?, 
but I'd rather be pulling a shell behind anything and camping in it, 
than letting it sit in a boneyard in shame.
