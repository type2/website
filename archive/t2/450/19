Sounds like the linkage. Although if pushing the stick down helps it might 
just be the stop plate at the base of the stick that has moved? There are 
three parts of the linkage which cause problems - or at least, have caused 
me problems. The ball joint where the stick goes into the long rod - mine's 
worn and a bit loose, but it's ok with the other two fixed. The silly 
little bush which locates the whole thing at the front. The coupling at the 
back which connects the shaft to the box. How much of that lot has been 
replaced?

If it's none of that, it could be the gearbox internals moving. Had that as 
well, but it only affected first, I could still get second.
