Subject: 71 Bus appears to be overheating

71 Westy with stock 1600 DP Doghouse, stock distributor and carb., approx
50K miles since last rebuild.  No thermostat or linkage but the flaps are
there and open.  I installed a set (CHT, OT, OP) of VDO gauges about 2 years
ago.  Since installing the gauges, I have seen CHT at about 300 deg max., OT
at about 180 to 200 deg. max. and OP at about 25 psi (hot), all at highway
speeds.

About 2 weekends ago, I went did a 3 hour or so trip, and suddenly saw CHT
hitting the 400 deg mark, and I also saw rather large CHT temperature swings
from loaded to unloaded (i.e., uphill vs downhill) which I have not seen
before to this degree.  OT and OP are still following the normal pattern of
the last 2 years, and the bus seems to be running fine.

The weekend before this trip, I went on another trip and saw nothing
unusual.  Between those two trips, I didn't do anything to the bus - it just
sat in my driveway.

I have started to investigate, first looking for rags in the cooling fan or
other airflow blockages, but found none.

So... any suggestions as to what to check next?
