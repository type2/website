Subject: friday topic..

Folks, 

Does anyone know of any video's that show more than just a brief snippet 
of any shots inside a vw factory...anything that shows them actually 
making a bug or bus?

Putting in interior parts?...anything like that?

Pmail if you don't think it's worth the bandwidth...

Cheers, dave
