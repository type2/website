Hi Ian,

Check the clutch cable. If the clutch is worn the bus will be hard to 
shift, exactly as you indicate. This is particularly true if you have 
more problems at a standstill than you do when moving. You may need to 
tighten the clutch cable, or you may need a new clutch.

It could also be the rear linkage, the one at the nose cone of the 
tranny.

Happy trails,
