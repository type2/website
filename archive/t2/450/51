Well, nuts.

I'm just surprised it took so little.  Perhaps I should have let it 
warm up more before draining to thin the oil out better...

I changed the brand/weight of oil this change -- PO had used SAE40 of a 
brand I can't remember off-hand... I filled it with Castrol GTX 20W-50. 
  Should I worry about mixing the two, which I apparently am since I 
needed so little of the new oil?

On a related note... before my oil change, I had observed a pretty good 
oil leak around the filter... Engine warmed-up and running (and oil 
under pressure), a drip about every 2 seconds would come off the 
filter.  The crankcase had been overfilled a tad before, as well, so I 
was hoping this leak was just a symptom of an old filter and excessive 
oil pressure.  Now, after the change, the leak is still there.  Before 
I installed the new filter, I felt around the filter sealing surface on 
the engine, and it felt fine - no burrs, scratches, grooves, etc. that 
I could feel.  Put a film of oil on the filter gasket, and then 
tightened the filter with my left hand until I couldn't turn it anymore.

Needless to say, I'm a little discouraged.  Could I just be seeing a 
symptom of excessive pressure again, since my case is seemingly 
overfilled?  Is there anything else that could cause a leak from this 
area?

Is that 3qt total?  I.e. do you put in the new filter dry, and then add 
3 quarts to the sump?  Or do you put .5qt in the filter, and then add 
3qt to the sump?  I guess I'm not *too* far off if that's 3qt total, 
but it sounds to me like you're going a bit more than 3qt by topping it 
off after checking the stick.

Yah, that shouldn't be too hard... it's certainly not going anywhere 
until I can get it running smoothly again. :-/
