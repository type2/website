Subject: 76 bus with push button starting

Hey I started looking into the problem with the bus needing a push button to
start.I figured it out.The positive battery cable looked a little corroded
but when I removed it and looked a little closer,it was badly corroded.I
disconected the wire from the starter and pulled it out.I also pulled the
battery.I cleaned up the terminals and added some distilled water.It wasnt
too low yet,the plates were still barely covered but it definetly needed
some.I spent the better part of an two hours cleaning the battery terminals
and cleaning all the corrosion out of the cable end.I went through 3/4 of a
can of acid nuetralizer on the battery and cable end.After much scraping and
wire brushing I had every bit of corrosion gone and everything was polished
up with my dremel tool.Then I sprayed some corrosion prevetitive paint on
everything and reinstalled.It cranks real good now with the key.Im glad that
took care of it cause I didnt really want to tear into the ignition swith.
    One question though.I removed the deep cycle battery and added a bunch
of water to it and now have it hooked up to a battery minder.The bus has one
of those dual battery relay deals.I guess everything must have been hooked
to the second battery cause now my radio wont work.Is there a way to wire
the relay so my interior stuff will work without the second battery?I like
to keep my deep cycle batteries hooked up to the battery minder when not in
use cause they last  a lot longer if you keep them nicely charged but not
overcharged.So is it possible to wire the relay to make my interior stuff
work without the second battery?I dont plan on using the bus in the winter
time so Ill definetly remove both batteries and keep them on the charger.
