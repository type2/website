Subject: Chipping?

Hiya All,

I was making small talk at a function the other night with my boss's boss.  
He a real Porsche fanatic.  The conversation drifted around to AC engine 
potential.  I had made some remark that the VW engines could be built to 
considerably higher horsepower.  He replied that it used to be that one could "chip" a 
Porsche engine.  But nowadays they were so built that one could no longer 
"chip".  I had no idea what he specifically meant by "chip" and so, not to look like 
a complete idiot, I smiled and comiserated with him.
What does he mean by "chipping" an AC engine?  Anybody out there familiar 
with this term?
