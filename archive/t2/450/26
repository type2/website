Subject: Re: [T2] swing arm bushing

I wonder if after installing the bushings in the housing, it will be a
tighter fit? I know that on splitties, you have to ream the bushings after
installing new ones, but you don't need to ream them on a bay. It seems that
sometimes the aftermarket crap isn't even as good as the old parts you're
replacing, not the first time I've seen that. It sucks, no?

Make sure you have a grease nipple on there, and we are all supposed to
grease the center link every 1 or 2 oil changes. I know I do, having had one
of these break off the beam in the past.

Please let us know how that goes, that job is on my long term list of things
to do.

 < My center pin bushings and the new center pin appear to be loose out of
the box. Is this normal and the grease will take up the tolerance? Is my pin
and bushings defective? Anyone have a new center pin kit they could
check out for me?
