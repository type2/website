1. The bulbs
2. The fuse
3. Voltage at the lamp terminal when the brake is pushed?
4. Voltage at the switch
5. Voltage after the switch when brake is pushed
6. Connections, check those connections.  They may look good, but corrosion 
can prevent an electrical connection even though the mechanical connection 
seems fine.
