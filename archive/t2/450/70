Is the hole in the sheet metal covers or in the exhaust plumbing itself?
If it is just in the sheet metal it is easy to get some 16 ga steel, cut
it about a half inch bigger than the hole, shape it to conform to the
outside of the heater box, and braze it into place.  You can also use the
same metal to fix the box where the exhaust pipe enters and exits.  Make a
couple of half-round pieces, slide them into place, and braze it up!  This
provides a larger bearing surface, preventing the holes from wearing.  I
wouldn't trust any magic glues to do the job, but the brazing can be done
easily even by an inexperienced welder like me with a gas torch.  It
doesn't have to be pretty.  You might even be able to do it with a MAPP
gas torch.  I've done a couple of sets, and once repaired they have
lasted nearly a decade without further work.

_Don't_ trash original heat exchangers even if they are quite holey.  They
aren't making good heat exchangers any more and they will become even more
scarce with time.
