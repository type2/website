I'm catching up on emails from the last few days but I don't think anyone has answered this with a
definitive answer.  Several months ago VW Trends ran an interview with a source from VWofA about this
whole issue and one thing I was surprised to learn is that while VWofA is doing all the chasing it is
actually VWAG that controls who and what products can be produced.

Now if we could get some hubcaps (early or late) that actually fit on our Busses I'd be a happy
camper.  Instead the only ones available end up on the side of the road somewhere because of poor
fit.  But VWAG probably figures that 1 producer of hubcaps is enough so why would they let someone
else have a license so that something a little more correct could be produced.
