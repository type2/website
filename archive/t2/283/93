Hey Steve

Do you remember the 73 Camper at EveryBus,, with the engine case broken around
the mounting studs?

It went about 300 miles south, then 300 miles north with NO fasteners!
It is an automatic trans. so no clutch pressures
The flex plate finally broke, like a tin can that had been wiggled back and
forth tooo many times!

I am guessing,, that engine drove for over 20,000 miles with no lower studs.

Jamie , thinks all 4 is the lowest safe numbers,, Rivers
