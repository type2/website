The stop bracket under the shift rod cover plate needs to be adjusted. The
Bentley manual has a great diagram and description of how to do this. If you
have not got a manual we sell them for $34.95. Every bus owner should have
one. Until then here is me best attempt at explaining it.

place the transmission in second gear (not reverse) loosen the two bolts
that the shift rod mounting bracket and stop plate (under the shift rod
mounting bracket) can be slid back and forth (side to side) with a flat
blade screw driver. move the stop bracket left so that it hits the shift
rode with the stick perpendicular to the short axis of the bus (straight up
and down looking from the rear of the bus forward. This prevents the shifter
from going into reverse with out having to push down on the lever. As well
allows all forward gears to be engaged. Please feel free to give me a call
if you are still having trouble.
