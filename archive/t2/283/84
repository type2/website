i work at an upholstery shop, and when i went to get some supplies, i
noticed some canvas-looking fabric laying against the wall. when i asked
what it was, he said it was like sunbrella... or made by them or for
them... or something... anyway, it is their close-out since the company
decided to stop selling it to suppliers. he told me it was $10/yard and
they have the blue i want, so i just need to know how many yards it takes
to to the poptop for a 70 westy. oh, i plan on putting 3 windows in as my
original was. i had decided, after seeing the price of canvas at
hancocks/joanns, and after evaluating my machine's ability to sew through
THAT much material, to just pay the $200 to GoWesty for theirs, or
elsewhere. but after seeing this fabric for as cheap as it is, and seeing
how thin it is, i have decided to rethink it. and the screen material
stuff is 60 and 70 cents a foot (not square foot), so the windows wont
add to the price... as a matter of fact, it will SAVE me money!!! maybe i
will take the suggestion someone gave me and make it entirely out of
net!!! lol. just kidding...

have you ever made a side style tent? any idea how much fabric that might
take?

i dont know how much you pay for your fabric, but if this is a good deal
and you want some, i will tell you what colors they have and get it for
you, if you want. if anyone else wants some of this stuff, Pmail me and
let me know.

thanks,
chris
