Subject: Re: [T2] Fresh air flaps

I found my fresh air flaps to be black when I started my repair and 
repaint job.  They are now he same color as the body.  I took out the 
plastic screen that was stock because it was in very bad shape. 
 Replaced it with some heavy gauge screen, about 1/4 inch, that I got 
from the local hardware store.  Painted it same color as the body too. 
 The new screen with the larger hole greatly improved the air flow.  I 
live in the tropics with year round bug and have not found any making it 
through to the cab because of the change in the screen.  I  used 1/8 
inch foam weather stripping from the hardware store to replace the old 
foam.  This has stopped the water leak that used to happen while washing 
the bus.

I have asked about sand blasting the body of the bus when I was starting 
the repair.  I was told that it can lead to body panel distortion 
especially on large sections.  One guy said it could the other I asked 
said he could do it without damage.  Never had it done so I don't know 
if it's possible.  If you're going to use a parts sand blaster just on 
the air flap this would be a non issue.
