I'd take a portable grease gun and a "hypodermic needle" injector that
fits it, in case of torn boots on steering parts or cv joints.  Slush is
hard on tears.  On a cross country trip in our 71 Westy, back in 1976, I
started having a creaking front end that traced to a torn ball joint
boot that let water in on long rainy runs- used the needle grease gun to
get grease in there and then covered it with wraps of plastic garbage
bag pieces followed by vinyl tape.  Got me home fine.  This fix for torn
ball joint boots has been in use on my 78 for over 90k mi now!
