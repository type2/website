William et al,

I agree the quoted figures do seem rather optimistic,maybe just an
honest mistake rather than intentionally misleading.
Reasonable fuel economy is indeed possible with these engines if
driven with care,tuned correctly and kept near stock,but given that
so many listees have Westies or other campers loaded to the gunnells,
mediocre mpg figures are inevitable and are going to bring down the
mean mpg values for any survey.

For the record,my '76 Double Cab 2.0l eng. with dual solexes
consistently returned figures of 10L/100kms for many years.
That works out at around 27-28mpg (imperial gallons).This is
however on a usually unladen vehicle,generally travelling at 100kmh
and very little city driving.The tare weight of the double cab is only
1190kgs so it has a distinct weight advantage over a camper,hence
the good mileage figures.

More recently however with the engine approaching 200,000kms
since my last top-end rebuild the fuel consumption has slipped to
around 23-24mpg.It still runs smooth & strong but like the rest of
us,age is catching up with her...;-(

Hi Volks,

  I'm sorry to appear rude, but I have difficulty accepting those figures at
face value.
