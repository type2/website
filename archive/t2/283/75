I thought that the criteria for discarding data points involved
eliminating those points that do not support the researcher's argument! :)

The biggest problems with establishing mileage figures for our buses are:

too few data points
inconsistant methods of measurement
widely variable conditions

The numbers quoted in the manuals are arrived at using methods that
eliminate as many variables as possible.  Vehicles are tested on
absolutely flat circular tracks in conditions of zero wind and as close to
standard temperatures as possible.  The result is figures that are
probably higher than that achievable in normal service.  The intent is not
to decieve, just to get consistant and accurate data.
