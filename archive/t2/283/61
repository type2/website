Note if you are followning this thread that these will *not* work on '72->
type4 engine buses.  The J.C Whitney catalog mentions that they don't fit
411/412 cars, but that applies to any type4 engine!  If you look at the
pictures, all the insulators are the same length, which is fine for a T1
engine but not for a T4, OK?
