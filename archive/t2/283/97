Have you checked out the AIRS link from the homepage? some of those people 
who have their names listed are probably not on this list, i'd suggest having 
a few contacts set up along the way, just in case (you need a cold one!) (or 
some tools, etc). it'd probably be a good idea to be able to give us/them a 
good/better time frame of when you're going to be in the area, just a 
suggestion. And don't forget your clean underwear (sorry, couldn't resist!).
