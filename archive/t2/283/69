Excessive air pressure, large granule blasting material, blasting with the 
nozzle too close to the body or dwelling too long in one place with the 
blaster all can lead to warping of the panels.

If you use an amateur sandblaster you are safe or you can use a commerical 
size sandblaster if you are very careful and keep moving. I've sand blasted 
several cars with never a warp anywhere.
