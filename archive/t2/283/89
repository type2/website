Subject: [T2] Is it feasible with my bus! (Big winter trip)

Since you'll be travelling through snow, and since you have a relatively 
rust-free bus, I thought I'd suggest some undercoating, even if it's 
bar-oil.  It'll keep your undercarriage from getting trashed.  You might 
want to have some spare wheel bearings and grease as well.  Trusting the 
P.O. to have done anything is like playing roulette.
