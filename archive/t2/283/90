Subject: body work done right!!!

hey guys,

long time lurker, first time poster. 

i just wanted to say that this past weekend, my wife and i came up with our restoration plans for our 71 westfalia:  as soon as we pay off our credit cards (about $3000) we're going to get a bank loan so that we can get the bodywork and paint job we need to keep our westy in good shape for years to come!

we've been wanting to do this for a year, and it's good to finally just put it down on paper and get a plan!

anyway, just thought i'd mention it.  i'd love any advice you folks can give.
