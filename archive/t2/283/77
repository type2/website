All valid points, of course.

But let me add that I am running the stock tire size, and last time I
checked, my odometer (and speedo, FWIW) were right on the money, based on
driving a 60 second mile on the local interstate (averaged over several
trials, naturally).

My driving style is very conservative, much to the disdain of those in the
vehicles behind me.

A problem with this kind of survey is that there are variables affecting the
validity of the data reported......
