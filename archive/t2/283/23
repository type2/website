--I think you need to chill out.

My accounts with the Busdepot total maybe 30 bucks, however, Brad, how many organizations out there can you count that serve the busdriving community specifically, and have someone like Ron who lends so much knowledge and loyalty to this list.

I've benefited from asking Ron questions with no intention of purchasing anything, and you know what, he doesn't care, because he supports buses and busdrivers.

Before you copy the list with your (should be) p-mails to the Busdepot, you need to give some consideration to the group you belong to and represent. This list/group is a very supportive one, and I cannot believe for a second that the Depot would completely crapout on you.

I think this is poor business/email protocol on your part.

You're coming off like some kind of sterotypical service-demanding, reality-ignoring modernite.

What are you (and we) gonna do when folks like you make it too much of a pain in the a$$ for folks like Ron to want to deal with us anymore?

Consider the long term...

Get some books on the Tao...Read while you wait for the mail to catch up with your Self.

Hi List,
I am bummed at the Bus Depot.  
I mean what's with these guys?  Or what's with Cheri?  A little harsh don't you think?  So I responded with the following.
