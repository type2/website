Subject: Corvair spark plug seals

Hi List,
	I have read that Corvair spark-plug air-seals are "better" than
original VW style ones.  Where does one go about purchasing them?  Part
numbers? Terminology (what is the Chev* name for them)? I have looked on
various Corvair pages but have not been able to find any mention of them,
let alone pictures/numbers.  Thanks . jon
