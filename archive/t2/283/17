Check out the steel tube used for lamp-posts-about 4" diameter I think. 
I scrounged one once and used it in a 71 bus.  I remember using pvc
piping in a bug, running it from under the rear seat along the inside
rocker edge, up the side of the door, and then to a length along the
windshield-drilled it full of holes - did a great job of defrosting. 
Turned brownish but did not kill me!
