 I'm sorry to appear rude, but I have difficulty accepting those figures at
face value.

 I compiled a summary of list-reported fuel consumption for type 2s a while
back. You should be able to find it here:

http://www.type2.com/library/fuel/specs.htm

 You'll see that the best mileages claimed are in the 25 per USg range (and
those for early (ie light) busses with small engines, usually on the open
road). Getting 23mpIg (roughly 20mpUSg) in town is quite an achievement,
managing it with a loaded bus seems unlikely to me.

 Similarly, the 31mpIg claim for highway use is at the edge of the reported
figures for the economical early busses- It corresponds to about 25mpUSg,
which is claimed by only a few people in my survey. Usually for a
relatively light bus, in good tune on a road trip.

 I could see you achieving 31mpIg on a run, especially if you had an empty
bus and a tailwind or a significant altitude loss, but my gut feeling is
that these figures are optomistic to the point of being misleading. Is it
possible you've fallen victim to the temptation to report your best figures
as typical? It's common practice to check consumption periodically, say
after a tuneup, and in doing so to drive more gently than usual, possibly
disregarding any low numbers because of specific circumstances during the
test.

 Sorry if this seems judgemental. I'm just concerned that someone may
assume that they have a problem because they arn't matching your figures,
when most people's experience doesn't seem to support them.

Cheers,
       W.
