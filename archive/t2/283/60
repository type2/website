These are the blue metallic core (non-radio suppression) ones:

Searches by catalog part # will yield pages with the Internet part #s.  8o|

color           metal core              carbon core

blue            ABR749087R              ABR134436X
red             ABR749088X              ABR134438T
yellow          ABR748030P              ABR134435R
orange  ABR134439A              ABR748031Y

If you order out of the catalog, they're a dollar cheaper.....??

I think the yellow ones would look bitchin' with the chrome coil and 009
distributor they sell..........not to mention the fawkin' kewl chrome 36hp
style fan housing that doesn't have all those stupid air directing vanes that
those stodgy old dudes at VW stuck in there.........of course, then you'd
have to take off your engine compartment door, so everyone could see
your totally sano engine!!!!!  Dude, you might even get featured in, like,
HOT VWs.
