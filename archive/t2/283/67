A problem with this kind of survey is that there are variables affecting the validity of the data reported.

The most significant variable is whether or not the odometer of a particular bus/transporter has been properly calibrated/corrected.

It is incorrect to assume that a speedometer's calibration/correction factor [true 60MPH = indicated 72MPH, for instance] is also applicable to that instrument's odometer readings.  

The speedometer needle is driven by a magnetic field working against a spring - there is no direct mechanical connection to the cable.  As speedometers age the amount of needle motion induced by the spinning magnet changes, affecting the accuracy of the _indicated_ speed at any given _true_ speed over the road.  The spring weakens with age and use as well.  

The odometer is driven by the rotating cable via gears in the instrument.  Once the odometer is calibrated/corrected it's accuracy remains relatively stable until the left front tire size changes significantly due to wear or replacement.

When all these vehicles have calibrated/corrected odometers, the MPG figures reported can be accepted as accurate.  

The reason(s) for the range of MPG numbers reported then moves to other variables such as induction system settings/efficiency, running gear and/or brake problems [dragging brakes or wheel bearings?], driving style, aerodynamics, grade of fuel, etc., etc., etc.....

I expect one could line up a dozen identical vehicles after 2 years of years of rental or fleet use, have a dozen drivers run them through a specific mixed urban/rural course with strict speed controls, and obtain a wide range of overall MPG numbers.  Toss different fuels and lubricants into the mix, and the spread of MPG numbers would be even wider.

I'm sorry to appear rude, but I have difficulty accepting those figures at
