I sandbalsted mine, then sprayed them with Bar-b-que paint. Didn't last.

I heard that brush on high temp paint is better than spray paint.

Cure the paint by short run periods on the engine. Start run 5 min, allow 
to cool, start run 10 min, allow to cool, etc.

This is per a Berg tech article.

Another solution might be high temp powder coating. I know the local shop 
does this.

I'd love to hear about a real solution that lasts.
