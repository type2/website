Subject: needing '76 bus sliding door handle

Hey Now,

I am writing in search of a '76 westie exterior sliding door handle.

I will trade a custom handmade hat to him or her that trades me one!  Just
name your colors and I'll crochet one up! :o)  I know we are already using
them here in cold Kansas!

Thanks Much,

Peace,
Sunshine
