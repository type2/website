Subject: Re: [T2] customer service by Bus Depot

Thanks Billy for the feedback.

I was raised that you said what you meant and did what you said.  I 
 believe in the consumer driven economy - if you build a better mouse 
trap the world will come to your door.  If you provide good customer 
service and a good product you will be successful in business.  Examples 
like L.L Bean and Norstrom of companies that are 90 to 100 years old and 
are known for their service as well as their product.

I have communicated several times with The Bus Depot and have been told 
one thing and given another.  As a little guy 10,000 miles away what can 
I do?  Nothing but tell other people about my experience and let them 
make their own judgment call.

If wanting good service and a pleasant response to what I thought was a 
pleasant question is too much than I guess I am "stereotypical service 
demanding reality ignoring modernite."

Does this mean that I'm delusional to expect good service? ;-)

Laters,

Bradley
