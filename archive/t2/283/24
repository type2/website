Subject: Wing window latch removal

Hello all,

Is there any special trick or tool needed to remove the latch on the wing 
window? I need to take the one off of my "old" bus, as the  driver's side wing 
window latch on my "new " bus is missing the black knob that you grip. Bentley 
offers no enlightement on this particular subject.
Could I just take the knob off, or is that more of a PITA?
TIA
