Hi Mike,

I went through this on my bus this summer. It's a PITA job.

There is no simple way to replace the mechanism, you have to replace 
the entire wing window. First you pull the door panel, the window, then 
the vent wing can be removed.

Or you could drill out the fastener on the latch, and replace it with a 
new rivet, assuming you could find something appropriate.

Happy trails,
