Subject: Take this bug please, listmember discount!

Allright, I am in the process of thinning out my herd of VW's. I have already
sold the 85 Cabriolet to Steve from Missouri ($950, great deal on a nice car!)
Now I really need to move this 66 Bug before winter hits hard here in
Southwestern Ohio.  I have 4 cars and only 3 indoor parking spaces, and guess
what? The bug is probably not going to make the cut! I do not want to leave it
sitting outside in the harsh weather, plus with some new responsibilities I've
picked up at work, all my precious spare time will be directed to my 71 Westy
(it's gettin jealous!)
Anyway, If you come pick up this bug (just north of Cincinnati Ohio) I will
give anyone who is on the type2 or vintagebus list the very special price of
$750! Well worth it for a running, stopping, shifting, driving Vintage VW.
This deal is ONLY for type2 or vintagebus listmembers, anyone off-list will
have to pay the $1000 listed on the ad.
Anyway, heres the link for the ad:

I am also interested in trades. I NEED a Nice lawn tractor (preferably John
Deere of course) and i WANT guitars, buses, and beer! So whaddya got?
Thanks for your time!

Peace, John Baker
