David,

The floor mats are sweet.  Heavy rubber and good quality.  Also the rear 
didn't have the holes cut out for the middle seat - i have the seat but 
have choose not to install it at this time.  I believe that the Bus 
Depot has good products at a fair price.  I have found that the rubber 
seals at Rock Mountain Motor Works are better fitting - both window and 
door.  I know this by getting a complete set from the Bus Depot first 
and then having to buy all the door and front window seal again through 
RMW - better fit.
