Hello,

I dont think Cheri ment to sound harsh in her email.
She was probably just trying to inform you of their
policy so there would be no misunderstanding. Emails
can be strange like that. Some times typed words alone
can be writen with the intent of sounding professional
and clear but be read as being rude and harsh. words
can't express everyting and signals can be crossed.
That is how alot of flame wars happen on the list. 

Any how, I am sure that the email she sent can be
interperted in a different way by each person who
reads it. I would give them the benifit of the doubt.
Any how, how do the floor mats fit? I would like to
buy a set in the future. Did yours appear to be good
quality?

Any way, I understand your perdiciment. Just hang in
there, I am sure that they will get it straightened
out for you. Have a  great day!
