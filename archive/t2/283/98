Subject: distributor noise

Greetings,

Mine is an air-cooled 81 Vanagon, FI, points and condensor, and I am
hoping someone might be able to give me a clue to finding the source of an
ugly noise.

I just noticed a loud whining coming from, as near as I can tell, the
distributor. Its normally pretty quite in the engine compartment, so this
noise really stands out. The ear tells me it is loudest right over the
distributor, so I am assuming it is the source.

It is the original distributor closing in on 200K. I pulled the cap and
noticed a lot of play in the shaft. Never having looked before, I don't
know if it is normal or not. side to side is not what I would call
abnormal, but the up and down play is more than I would expect to find. 

Can anyone comment on what the play should be, up and down, on the
distributor shaft? Any other ideas what might cause the loud whining?

I know its not much of a description of the noise, but that is what is
sounds like :) From the front seat, it is more of a whirring, or a buzzing
sound. 

Any comments would be appreciated.

Thanks much,

John
