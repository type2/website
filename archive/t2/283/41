A shovel and a friend to hold it will get you out of many 'no anchor' 
situations.

Push shovel as deep as you can facing stuck item.  Put strap as low on 
the handle as you can.  Have friend hold handle, pulling away from 
stuck item.  Winch slowly.

I've unstuck 6k lb. Chevy Suburbans using the technique.  The key is 
work gentle.
