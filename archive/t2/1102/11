Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filter location

Alan
If I remember correctly, you have a 79 bus. is it EFi or carbs.
if you have the EFi .. then the stock arrangement filter has fittings that
can't be fitted after the pump... so the filter is between the tank and the
pump.

If you have carbs... quite often . there is /was a filter in the tank
outlet,, and then in the line to the pump,, and sometimes there is a filter
after the pump before the carb[s]

Hope that helps
Jamie
