Subject: horn troubleshooting...

Well I was driving down the road a couple weeks ago, and my horn started
going off when I went over a bump for a block or two, then just started
beeping continuously. So I pulled over and disconnected it.

 

The weather is cooperating today, so I decided to try to figure it out.

 

I disconnected the wire at the bottom of the steering column(the ground?).
If I touch this to any part of the bus the horn beeps.

 

The way I understand it-the horn is always connected to power, and as soon
as you ground it, the circuit completes/ie the horn beeps.

 

So if the horn goes off with the ground wire connected, there is a short
somewhere in the steering column, is that right? Any suggestions on a fix,
or to make sure I am finding the short?

 

Searching the archives, it seems like the solution may be to replace the
wire in the steering column. I can see the top, but the bottom looks
impossible to get at without removing the steering box.
