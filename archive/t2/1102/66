Hi volks,

I heard Jamie Rivers tell a similar story... Once upon a time a bus gets 
towed in... engine stalled and won't restart. They figure it must be a 
bad starter; and the shop it was towed to wastes a few hundred bucks on 
it before someone notices there's a valve stem sticking out where it 
oughtn't be.

Gonna be interesting when Bob gets it apart, thats for sure.

Happy Trails,
