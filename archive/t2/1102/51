Subject: vacuum

All this talk about brakes and vacuum leave me thinking about my vacuum.

How does one trouble shoot that one?

I have heard propane for a sudden increase RPM when you hit a bad vacuum
line.

Me, I thought I should go for a public opinion on that one and the talk
about brakes and vacuum triggered it.
