blocked,, ?  blocked by what? ..... water.. or ... brake fluid. 

and this will cause the brakes to apply themselves.. if there is a heavy 
blockage.. the pedal goes to the floor all by itself as soon as there is vac 
from the engine.
if there is someblockage.. the brakes apply themselves with a little help 
from the pedal ..
the water,, or brake fluid in the booster acts like the diagphrams .. so it 
uses the vac to actuate the brakes. 

undo the vac line at the engine, and plug it at the engine side.. then test 
drive like you have manual brakes.. it should operate fine.. but require 
more foot pressure on the pedal. 

my guess,,
