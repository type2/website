The conventional wisdom here is that the pump is designed to pump, not suck.

If you see large chunks of rust accumulating in your fuel filter, it
is time to recondition or replace your fuel tank.

Small sediments that might enter through the filler neck are not big
enough to hurt the pump like they would the carb or FI. Some electric
pumps do come with screens on the inlet side.
