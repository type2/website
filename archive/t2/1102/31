LOL I don't think I'll live long enough to locate and drill out all of those
welds, or save enough money to have someone else do the resto!!

Yeah I think the line is something like, if you want to take any type 2 of
any vintage off the frame, you just got to merely drill out 2-3000 spot
welds, etc, etc.  Oddly it can be done for a super $$$ restoration of you
hopefully to be $50000+ 23 window (isn't Gerson making complete chassis) but
you sure wouldn't want to try.
