Subject: Re: [T2] engine woes....

thanks I've been kicking myself around the block trying to think what I 
missed what I could have done or didn't do.....and I'm drawing a blank.

I investigated and researched and asked everyone who made the best engines 
and went with Bob Donalds.

the engine that this one replaced was a short block that I built up 10 
years ago and got over 100k out of it, and I didn't take that good a care 
of it.   this engine was supposed to be the one that lasted for 10-15 
years with TLC.....

am not holding anything against Bob, my late wife fought cancer and I've 
seen what those drugs can do.  this was one of his last engines and he may 
have been a little off his game the day he put this one together....I 
don't know. I want to see what the inside looks like.

I don't expect a freebie but sure hope Gary gives me a break, especially 
since hopefully most will still be "like new"

right now waiting for a snowstorm so not much will happen in the next two 
days.
