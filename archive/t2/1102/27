this must be somewhat of a weak spot in the fan hub design.  My 78 bus did the
same thing with the previous owner and the local shop was able to epoxy a new
woodruff key in and put a new hub on it and he was good to go.  Now that I'm
the owner and the engine is otherwise tired, it's getting a thorough rebuild
including a replacement crank.
