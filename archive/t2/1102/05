Subject: Left Turn Signals Don't Work

I have a '69 VW SC Truck and after it went through inspection here in Virginia
I was driving home and the left turn signals stopped working.  When I got home
the hazards all worked, the right worked but the left would blink twice slowly
then stop. Also the speedometer stopped working too but that's not a problem
because it was never right anyhoo.

As for the inspection I still failed but it was because the tail pipe had
fallen off the muffler.  I have on coming so it's not a problem.  Both the
guys that inspected had VW Bugs and one of them had never seen a truck
before.
