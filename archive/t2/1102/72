BadLuck Bob has all our sympathy.  To explain the seizure will need 
some unusual cause.

	Could a bad batch of this synthetic oil have broken down very 
suddenly, first in anti-oxidant properties and then in lubrication 
value?
	Not to open old arguments unnecessarily, but I suspect 'real' 
oil (distilled from petroleum) is less likely to vary so widely in 
quality as I'm postulating this Mobil 1 did.
	Anyhow these 'thin' synthetics can get pumped upstairs too 
readily in old generous-clearance OHV engines, and burn too fast. 
Not that I think that will account for turning black in only a few 
dozen mi.
