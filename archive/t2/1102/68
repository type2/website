Subject: Re: [T2] VW Microfische question?

Hey Kevin,

    I don't know of any source for the films, the reader was supplied to the 
dealer by VWoA, through the parts department. The films were sent on a 
regular basis to the dealer (every 6 months IIRC) to keep their shop up to 
date on any information changes. I'm sure a reader could be found, maybe not 
that particular one, but one that would work just fine.  I just don't know 
where. The films were dealer only, and surely no longer available. In fact, 
I don't think they sold them to the public in the day.
    The reader was made in the good old USA, and parts are still readily 
available. The only thing I had to replace over the years is the bulb, Radio 
Shack, $8.49 a few years ago.
    The reader and films I have is about the most complete set I've seen in 
a while. It is complete with service, wiring diagrams, parts, paint & body, 
campaigns, product circulars, warranty, labor, special tools catalog, etc, 
on and on! These films cover Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche'.
    I dare say it would be hard to duplicate a service manual or system with 
this much complete information. The great thing is it's all factory!

Cheers

Howard
