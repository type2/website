Hi Heather,

Long time no "see"! Sorry it is under these circumstances.

I had a similar experience to Mike's. I bought a billet aftermarket
master cylinder for my 62 that did exactly the same thing. After
checking around, it turned out the manufacturer was aware of the
defect which was exactly as Mike described. This could explain why you
get relief when lifting up the brake pedal. An adjustment of the
actuating pin could have the same effect.

Otherwise, the one-way valve problem suggestion could be on the right
track. I also wonder if it is possible for it to deliver too much
vacuum, thus sucking on the booster diaphragm too much constantly. To
test this, I'd plug the line on the engine side and leave it open to
air on the booster side. You will lose your "power brakes", but you
can still test drive it with a little more pedal effort to see if your
symptom disappears.

Good luck,

John

  What it was doing was not allowing the brake master
 cylinder piston to come back to its normal resting position (the lever was
 holding preload when there was supposed to be none). This meant that the
 little hole in the piston that lines up with the little hole in the bottom
 of the reservoir was not lining up because there was always a preload on the
 pushrod.  This meant that any excess pressure in the brake system could not
 flow back into the reservoir.
