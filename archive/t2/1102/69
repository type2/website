You can get the engine out with the torque converter on. It's not  
pretty though, and you'll need some (a roll) paper towels to soak up  
the tranny fluid that will come out.  In our case, it was done because  
I did not know the torque converter should have been disconnected.  
Clearance will be a major issue, and you'll need more than a couple  
inches. I had to jack the rear of the bus up enough to get the fan  
shroud the slide under the rear apron.  And ATV was under the rear of  
the engine (rear is rear) and another floor jack was up front where  
the torque converter is.  Have at least one person manning each jack  
with someone else on the side.  If you can pull the bus up on some  
ramps, that may be enough clearance, and IMHO, less stressful than  
jack stands.

Im not 100% sure that I didn't do any damage to parts of the engine or  
transmission in all of this. Later on, we were stranded due to a  
cracked drive plate (http://calivw78.com/2008/09/05/vw-bus-flex-plate-drive-plate 
) but the cause was never determined. After replacing the drive plate,  
its been fine for quite a while now.

There are many pics in the following album, but here is one that will  
give you an idea of how much the torque converter would extend the  
length of the engine.

Good luck.
