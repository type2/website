Subject: engine woes....

did I get Bob Donald's only dud....

6,000 miles on the Boston Bob engine and suddenly without warning it locks 
up. seized tighter than a drum.???????????

have maintained it meticously. by the numbers etc.
has been running like the proverbial top.
gave no warning

Monday needed to run some errands so went out. it started up normally and 
I drove to get myself some fuel.  about 3 miles. pulling out of the drive 
thru it stopped.... I mean literally just stopped. no sound no warning 
nothing.!!!!  would not crank. couldn't turn it with a wrench, called AAA

obviously couldn't check oil presure but engine temps were low in fact had 
not even come up to operating temp...  this engine has not used a drop of 
oil between changes it has been tight and strong.

no oil on the driveway where it was parked.  what oil that is left in it 
is VERY black but that is only sign.  since it is an automatic it is 
pretty much impossible to lug it or overrev.   I have been treating this 
engine with mucho TLC...

have call into Gary who has taken over the business from Bob Donalds but 
it still means a *(&(-at-)$%! engine pull and strip down and shipping and $$$$ 
no matter what happens.  and unfortunately I'm pretty much the last 
chicken with a bus herebouts so no help in the pulling and pushing end 
either..... oh well my wife says she can't stand to be around me when I'm 
working on the bus anyway...so another solo engine pull....


sorry just had to blow off some steam.....
