I can't imagine anything that would force the oil out after the
failure. Maybe a blockage caused excessive pressure and blew something
out, but could it be that this leak is what caused the failure?

I can't think what would cause oil to suddenly go black unless carbs
or FI started dumping a lot of fuel and it ran too rich, with soot
contaminating the oil. This can also dilute the oil with raw fuel,
which could degrade lubrication, but generally this kind of fault is
slow wear and tear, not catastrophic failure. The other thing could be
lubrication failure burning what little oil did get in.
