Don't be too scared of this, some may cower but it is quite doable.  On my
last '70 SC it had the bizzare beige Type4 (I think it's been a while it was a
411 part I think) fuse block.  And it had cracked clean through one end
through about 5 of the circuits.  And I couldn't locate one at the time.  I
took a good '76 or so block and circuit by circuit removed and swapped them
then mounted the "new" block.  It looked quite factory of course.  No reason
you couldn't do the same with a modern block.  Presuming I get the '69 SC
(still in negotiation on this) which has some botched up wiring, actually
replacing the whole thing with a "Painless" wiring system and harness has
occured to me as opposed to factory wiring.  Go for it anyway, just be
carefull, have a good color Bentley going in, and do it step by step.

Hi, hope you are having fun!  I have met a 'snag' in my '74 Westy bus wiring,

that wire goes, and remain cognisant of the original wiring circuit..I should
be able to insatll a complete system, using 'newer' electrical components!  I
