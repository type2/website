oil warning lamp never came on?? does it light up when you turn on 
the key, motor not running?? bad bulb or pressure switch hung.

Did the drain plug fall out?? It is a type IV engine?? Oil filter 
loose?? Non-spec filter?? Loose oil pickup sucking air?? Blocked screen??

do you mean oil level was low?? that figures. If it's black, it 
wasn't anything like "meticulously maintained". You say you changed 
the oil. How many times in 6000 miles?? Very strange the oil in a new 
motor would be black in 3000 or less miles. That doesn't add up. 
Unless it was daily short range heavy traffic dusty steep grades or 
other form of servere use.

except checking oil level. breaking in a new motor will use quite a 
lot of oil and needs to be checked until it's rate of use is known.
