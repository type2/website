I agree. You have a very anomolous failure. Highly likely that you 
did nothing wrong
and everything right. It is even possible the builder did nothing 
wrong and it is just
a freak part failure. It is beginning to sound like a 1 in 10,000+ event.

As to the oil loss, if the leak sprang from a point under pressure, 
it wouldn't take a
1/4 mile to pump it all out. It takes no more than that to pump the 
whole 4 quarts
through the system. I still haven't a clue how the oil got black.
