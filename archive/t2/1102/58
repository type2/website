Subject: Re: [T2] VW Microfische question?

Is that stuff available on-line somewhere?  I think Richard has some of 
it but I'm not sure.  That reader and the films are worth more than my 
bus is worth!  Right now, that is.  But just wait 'til I the paint and 
body work done.

On a side note, it sure is good to be home for vacation during the 
Olympics.  Too bad I'm not camping out up there in my bus.  I'd sure be 
burning up the propane!  And I'm enjoying being back on the Type II 
list.  Each and every post.   Ciao...KR
