Subject: Re: [T2] '71 Bus Brake Woes

Well the bus was in the flood of 2007 in Vernonia, OR. The bus was basically
fully restored (new paint, new window seals, body seals, etc) before she was
in the flood and the owner was so devastated that he couldn't look at her
(he had to watch it fill up), his son pulled the bus and put a dehumidifier
in the bus for several months then it just sat until i bought her last
November.

Being though that the flood was only about 4 hours and the water went up and
down 6ft in that time (one of the fastest floods that Vernonia has seen for
a long time) considering she was under water the damage is really quite
little. So far the brakes have given me the hardest time. And the interior
is actually quite nice, the only real damage to the wood is the spice rack
on the side of the fridge (not including mechanically or electrically)

Thank you again for your note, maybe i will just replace the lines and NOT
the booster until I try it out again after I replace the lines.

Thanks!
