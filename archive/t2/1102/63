First day back and already ripping on people who don't deserve it.  Nice.

Bob, I experienced one engine failure that fits your description many 
years ago.  When I tore down the engine it turned out to be a dropped 
valve - the engine was a total loss.  I did not hear any horrible 
noises, the engine just "stopped".  I wouldn't rule out 
piston/head/valve interference as the reason the engine won't turn (not 
that it matters at this point).

Good luck,

-David
