	Vacuum guages on the dash were a brief aftermarket vogue in 
Pop Sc  & Pop Mech  ads back in the 1950s.  They do indeed have 
several valuable uses, of which Greg rightly mentions one.
	Actually Holden (the Australian GM subsidiary) slapped them 
on the dash as OEM for a brief period instead of a rev counter. 
Didn't catch on.  Should have.

	To my way of thinking (my version of prejudice ;-)) the top 
priorities for extra guages on the T2 dash are
		cyl head T
		oil P
		inlet vacuum


	Oh, and did I mention my camper is purring along the road 
again, recovered from a mechanic who delayed for months saying "a 
friend" might like to buy it? (An unpleasant version of blackmail.) 
Now, just to get into 2nd gear smoothly and I'll be over the moon  ...
