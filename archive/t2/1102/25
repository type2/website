Hi Heather,

Replace the rubber flex lines. It's not uncommon for them to decay from
the inside, and when they do they act like a check valve and hold the
pressure.

In fact, it sounds to me like you need to replace ALL the rubber on that
vehicle. How did it come to end up under six feet of water anyhow?
