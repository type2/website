Subject: Re: Body off resto

To make it easier, some bus restorers have built a rotating cage that turns 
the bus like a potato on a spit. That way, they can more easily get at any 
surface except the front or back. I think it was being used for painting 
when I saw it. Probably works best when the wheels and engine are out.

I've looked through the Bentley book to find out how to take bus body off
the chassis. I know it would be easier to replace items on the chassis
without the body in the way. Any suggestions.

Thanks for any advice.
