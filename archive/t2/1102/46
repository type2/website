Subject: Bus Fuse panel

Hi, hope you are having fun!  I have met a 'snag' in my '74 Westy bus wiring,
and I think I am ready to 'implant' a fuse box for 'spade' fuses, and
think....if I take each wire off of existing 'position', and research where
that wire goes, and remain cognisant of the original wiring circuit..I should
be able to insatll a complete system, using 'newer' electrical components!  I
have the Haynes, and others, and just believe that "glass tube", or similar
"hardtube with metal strands", are ...like..'way beyond usefullness, unless..
you are an aficianado, and want to keep your bus totally stock, or have not
got to this stage in your 'love' of these 'beauties"! I will wait for positive
input from others on the list!
Cheers
SQUID
