Some suggestions from the Haynes Manual for "Brakes overheat or bind when car is in motion": 



Reservoir air vent blocked 



Connecting rod needs adjustment 



Caliper piston seals swollen 



Unsuitable brake fluid 



There were a couple more that either do not apply, drum brakes, or you have already done.
