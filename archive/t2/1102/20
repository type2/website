hello Steven I have fixed this problem before. find a new hub, key ,  seal 
and o ring and bolt. make sure the threads in the crank are good. get some  
locktite quick metal. use it on the key and take a sharp punch and dimple  
the crank on both sides of the key to lock it into place. install the o ring 
and  seal. put some quick metal on the hub and slide it onto the crank. use 
blue  locktite on the bolt and torque it to 22 ft lbs . reaqssemble 
everything and let  it set over nite . then pray   :) later  mark  d
