well gotta give the guy a break, I'm sure his dying was not in his plans.

well my HOPE is that most of the parts are still "like new" and can be 
reused.  "assuming a seized bearing" maybe it didn't damage the case, so 
we are talking a reground crank and new bearings ....other parts should be 
able to be reused...

(I can dream)

uh, do you know how heavy they are as a unit!!!!!!  you know what an 
engine weighs, the auto tranny is dern near as heavy maybe even 
more...haven't weighed it. but those buggers are HEAVY.

my other problem is I will probably have to do this solo.

I suspect once I get to em getting them apart wont' be that difficult, the 
tranny side will spin free even if the engine is jammed.
