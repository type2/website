hey guys  I just had this happen on the 80 vannie single cab I just  got.  
we were pulling it into the shop to put on the lift to do the shocks  and 
wheel clys and it just quit.  no noise, no lite ,no nothing. just  locked up. 
Motor was suppose to have less than 100 miles on it. pulled the motor  and 
took it apart. small main bearing had seized.  they were new mains on  old 
crank. case had been linebored(unusall motor kinda more like a type1 than a  
type 4)  called the guy I got the vannie from and couldn't get any help  from 
him. Stay away from shade tree builder in ashland Ky.  probably a good  
thing as the cam and lifters were wore out and other stuff was used other than  
the new 94mmP&Ls.   I put a type 1 bug motor in there for now and  I am 
rebuilding the old motor right.  I still don't know what happened but  I 
suspect that the linebore was off as when I rebored it it cleaned up that  
journell and didn't any of the others  later  mark  d
