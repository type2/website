Subject: '71 Bus Brake Woes

What Jamie says rings true with my problem.   In fact I already tried the
brakes without the vacuum line attached and the pedal is fine (except of
course much more effort required).

So the question now is, assuming I don't cure the problem by venting the
reservoir, how do I get the fluid out of the booster?

Heather, have you got any further toward a solution?
