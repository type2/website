Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone used paintforcars.com paint??

While I agree you usually get what you pay for, I did some research on the 
paint and it is HawThorne paint. Do a search if you're interested and see 
what people have had to say. It may be surprising. I am not interested in 
doing a restoration on my baywindow westy, just get it to where I'M happy. 
This may just be the ticket for me, after looking on various car and paint 
forums. I remember the time I went into Napa and the guy said I could pay 
the price for the Oil filter I had in my hand, Wix??, or buy their Napa Gold 
for 2/3 the price, as they were both made by the same company, Dana, and 
were identical except for the outside paintjob. Anyway, this is just food 
for thought.
