Subject: Re: '71 Bus Brake Woes

I have a similar problem, but because it's not exactly the same symptoms it
may not be relevant.   I rebuilt my calipers, fitted new master cylinder, rear
wheel cylinders, new Goodridge hoses all round and even a very expensive new
booster.   (' 72 RHD Viking Camper)

Everything was fine for just over a year when I let the front pads get a
little too thin and at the same time stopping distance and pedal effort went
up to unacceptable levels.   New pads restored things but left me with a pedal
with a mind of it's own.   Now, if I brake gently all is good - but if I apply
any real force to the pedal (although it stops exactly as it should) it will
stay down, perhaps with a little less pressure through the system, but with
enough to hamper acceleration and like your van the brakes heat up.   I
constantly have to hook my toes under it and pull it up in order to continue.
Occasionally the pedal will actually go down slightly all on it's own as if
being affected by vacuum somehow through the booster, not enough to stop the
bus but enough to be a nuisance.   I've replaced all the hoses in the vacuum
line with the correct grossly overpriced OEM replacements and replaced the non
return valve - all to no avail.   I'm afraid my expensive new booster may be
the problem but I don't know how or if I can check/test it and of course it's
now 9 months out of warranty!

Not much help but perhaps someone out there can help both of us?
