Uhh I've emailed Bob by pmail my thoughts on this thing, and will say in his
defense, he's been on this list a long time and I'm sure knows how to check
his friggin oil.  I've built more T4s than most on this list in the last 15
years and heck I would have not changed oil even 3 times in that time.  I
typically do breakin, 1000 miles, then factory interval which for me with good
oil means every 4500 miles or so, never 3000, I'm cheap.  My engines never
seem to use much oil though, but I've not built one in 4-5 years, parts
quality gets crappier every year.  Anyway that was a babied engine, and I'm
sure well checked.  The sudden failure I get, he either seized (a main) likely
or a piston, and probably a main if it truely doesn't wiggle at all.  The
sudden discoloration I don't get oddly.  Got to be hot, make carbon, then
clean the carbon into the oil to turn truely black, black.  Anyway a bit
berating and harsh on Bob here I feel.  Perhaps a
 bit harsh on Bob Donalds as well, but I hope whoever is running BE now days
makes a bit good on this.  I do wonder about the fact "that things seemed to
tight" when he built it.  Perhaps it should have been align bored and wasn't,
align bore T4 bearings of good quality were scarce a few years back, and maybe
maybe Bob D convinced himself it was a better setup than it actually ended
up.  Anyway he would have made it right, I hope they still do.

used a fair amount in the first 1,000 miles very little thereafter.
