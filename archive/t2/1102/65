hmmm, I've dropped a valve or two and they always made a terrible racket. 
well these are brand new heads engine has not been overheated (I have 
guages)   not that it matters much, even if there was a warranty it is 
probably expired.  and what good is a warranty if the company is no longer 
there.

I've heard and experienced some pretty bad quality control problems in 
recent years so ?????

yeah and as I was reminded, if it doesn't turn how do I get the three 
"jesus" bolts off the torque convertor so I can drop the engine.

wonder if I can loosen the bolts and pull the engine straight back an 
inch or two to get those bolts off with a thin wrench. then take it out 
normally.  has anyone here tried that?????

any suggestions on getting them apart while still in the bus and unable to 
be rotated.
