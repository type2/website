Subject: re:horn troubleshooting

Ok, I've been reading your suggestions and checking the archives as well.

 

I took the horn button off, and disconnected the wire there. 

 

I disconnected the wire at the base of the steering column(somewhat
stupidly). When I first got my bus, this wire was loose, and I somehow was
able to reconnect it from underneath. I am no longer able to do that.

 

To access this connection from the top, you need to take the plate at the
bottom of the column off, right? I see two screws holding it on, I take
those off, and now it seems like the whole sleeve of the column needs to
come up, and for that to happen, I need to remove the steering wheel. I need
some sort of puller to take this off. But the wire coming up the column, the
ground, does not want to get out of the way of any puller. Ie I can't seem
to jam it down the hole without damaging it. I don't mind damaging it, and
replacing it, my concern is if I can't replace it.

 

Anyway at this point I think I am looking for tips on removing the steering
wheel. I have put some penetrating lubricant on it, and it seems like it has
moved a bit.I went to a my FLAPS to find a puller, but had no luck, the
stuff they had would not/did not work. I think I'll try my mechanic today,
to see if he has anything.
