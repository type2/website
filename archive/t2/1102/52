Hi Alan,

You can get a vacuum gauge from Canadian Tire for less than $20 IIRC. 
Tee it into the line from the plenum to the distributor and then you can 
watch the gauge as you increase/decrease RPMS and check connections, etc.

A bad intake valve is VERY easy to see with a vacuum gauge... the needle 
flickers to zero on every fourth cylinder. It's quite obvious there's a 
problem when you see that happen.

Happy Trails,
