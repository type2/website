If you remove the 4 engine to tranny bolts/nuts, and remove the 2 
bolts holding the top of the tranny, (if you got, I still don't know 
what year yours is) then lower the back of the motor enough to clear, 
then support the back of the tranny so it won't fall, then pull the 
motor, the torque converter will pull right off with the motor and a 
quart or two of tranny fluid will fall out (rig a pan best you can), 
but it will be apart. It will then be easy to remove the converter 
from the flex plate. However, getting both splines to mesh putting 
the converter back on the tranny will be danged near impossible in 
situ. Could be a 6 pack or more. If you haven't got it back on there 
by the time you are too drunk to pick up the converter anymore, pull 
the tranny, set it verticle, then drop on the converter, wiggle a bit 
and plop, it falls right on.
