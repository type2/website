Right. I've had them hammer a few divots into the piston. They prevent
360 rotation, but allow some back and forth.

Just depends on what his feeling is about past warranties. Some will
just say they are a new business and not responsible. Some will want
to help. If it's been a long time, and is even out of Bob's warranty,
even though we know you and your level of competence, they don't. The
first thought they will have is what the engine has been through since
you've had it. If most of the engine is still like new, it will be
evident on disassembly as well as the failure, so you may well get a
break and parts may not be much.

Drop the engine/tranny as a unit. Once it's out, I've had some success
moving a frozen engine with a pry bar on the ring gear though the
starter mounting hole. As you say, if you release the engine to tranny
bolts you may get enough movement to access those bolts through the
slot.
