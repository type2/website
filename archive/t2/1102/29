Yeah I think the line is something like, if you want to take any type 2 of any
vintage off the frame, you just got to merely drill out 2-3000 spot welds,
etc, etc.  Oddly it can be done for a super $$$ restoration of you hopefully
to be $50000+ 23 window (isn't Gerson making complete chassis) but you sure
wouldn't want to try.

The bus is a unibody construction. There's no pan or frame to remove
the body from.
