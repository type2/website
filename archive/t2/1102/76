yes, I can't explain the black oil. as for burning it.  I use synthetic, 
anyone who has used synthetic knows that when it burns it SMELLS horrible. 
you will notice, I can't imagine it dripping out and not noticing the 
smell when I got out of the car. and can't imagine burning a quart or more 
in three miles (at least a quart) and not laying down a smoke screen....

I haven't slept much lately just tossing and turning trying to figure out 
what I did wrong...... what I missed that it was trying to tell me..?
