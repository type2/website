Subject: Re: [T2] '71 Bus Brake Woes

First, thank you everyone for your responses....Ok so after many peoples
suggestion of it being the rubber brake lines, it is not. I replaced them
today, re-bled the brakes and there is no change.

Current situation:
- rebuilt calipers (using kit)
- new master cylinder
- new disc brake rubber lines
- new rear wheel cylinders
- old booster that had fluid & water in it for a couple years... but had
drained fluid
- greased brake pedal joints (pedal does not seize/hang up when booster rod
unattached)

 I can drive the bus for about 10 or so miles, pulling the pedal up each
time i use the brakes to fully release them, then wheels and brakes start to
heat up and drag a lot

Any more suggestions?
Anyone have any experience on failing boosters?
Anyone in portland that has a known good one that they would like to sell?
I am feeling like this is the last possibility?
thoughts?
