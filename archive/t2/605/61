yep, it is sometimes a tight fit, time to get out the file and sandpaper and
drill bits and wire brushes

If I am really on top of things, when I am installing a different
transmission, I take off the shift coupler and try to slip it on the
transmission shift shaft. Sometimes I have to chamfer the end of the
transmission shift shaft with a file and polish it up with sandpaper to get
them to slide together. Or fix the hole in the shift coupler with a big drill
bit.

You do not have to take out your transmission. You can file/sandpaper your
trans shift shaft while laying under it. Put a rag or tap at the trans seal
to keep abrasives out of the transmission and fit away. Do not cut away any
significant amount of shaft diameter because you will create a leak at the
input seal; just chamfer the tip end and polish the shaft. You might need to
clean up the shift coupling hole to get the parts to fit.
