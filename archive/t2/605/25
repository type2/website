I believe that the Westfalia poptop seal will work. We often sell it to
owners of busses with non-Westy poptops, by the foot, for that purpose:

As for getting a replacement canvas for an ASI/Riviera, Sportsmobile,
etc., the only one I know of who makes them is Dawn of PLF:
http://www.plfvw.com/ . She has historically been very slow to ship,
but has always made a quality product.
