Subject: Leak Down Test

I would like to do a leak down test on an engine I received this week. I had 
some posting saved a few months ago on this but they have since been lost. I 
tried searching throught the archives, I don't have the time to search 
through almost 2000 posts to find them. The library has a refference about a 
leak down tester and then it heads into talking about water cooled autos. 
Anybody have these posts saved or know how to do a Leak Down Test on the TIV 
engines. Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
