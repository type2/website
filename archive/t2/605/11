You don't think this sounds a lot like a certain vehicle we're all into? :-^

Well, maybe not error prone and flaky, but they do require lots of
patience and maintenance to run right...

What is the difference in results between an oxy sensor and a gas
analyzer? Seems to me they test different things to arrive at the same
result. Or am I missing something?

BTW: Here in Cali, it's easy to find shops that will do an analysis
for $20-40 thanks to our smog laws.
