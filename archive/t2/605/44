Subject: Compression Test Results

I just finished doing a compression test on the engine in question, here are 
the results:

Cyl. #     I      II      III       IV

Test1   94     143   122     125
Test2   90     144   117     121
Test3   91     145   115     120
Test4   92     145   116     119


Now I know that they all should be over 100 PSI and within 15% of each 
other. Is that 15% of the average of all of them?

The average being 118.69 PSI.
Range would be 100.88 PSI(Min.) to 136.49 PSI(Max.)
That would show the #I and #II cyllinders to be way out and something is 
stinks.

Am I just looking at this wrong? If this is correct then I guess I better 
start planning the tear down and rebuild. Any suggestions or comments?

Should I try adjusting the valves and start the test over again?
