| That's interesting. I too have been using Castrol since the purchase of my
bus. I have gotten the yellow stuff on ocassion, mostly in the winter
months. Has anyone else seen a difference after switching brands?

Perhaps it would be interesting to note what the yellow stuff is?
Is it something that is good for the engine, but disgusts the owners?
Is it something that really doesn't matter?
Just what is this oil snot?
I too have the mayonnaise before, but don't recall the brand of oil or even
which bus it was on.
I am in the south with lots of humidity and heat.
Thanks.
