That voltage range is right around stoichiometric. Every though the values are on the rich side of the curve because of the hysteresis function, any reading between 80-800mV is basically 14.7:1.

The Bentley says to set the AFR with the O2 sensor disconnected. It doesn't sound like you are going to follow that advice.

Have you ruled out a vacuum leak at the injector seals and have you tested the injectors? What if you have a clogged injector and that's causing the cylinder to run too lean?
