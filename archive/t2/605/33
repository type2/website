So far so good and well even though so far so good i am running into a couple of problems since i am not familiar with pop tops and the canvas....?
 
the wood slats at the bottom of the canvas...? they have some screws that are partially screwed through them..? where do these slats get screwed to? to the body of the top of the bus or to the sides of the mounting frame for the top? i dont see any previous holes in the frame so i am guessing the body of the top?
 
so far heres the pics on what it will look like when done with top down anyways...? 
my first thought was that i would put it all on and then cut the hole but that has changed i got to cut the hole and then slide it all on and make sure it is correct...and straight...
 
the frame it's self i can tell screws to the body of the top but those slats of wood on the canvas ..hmmmmm>?
 
heres the pics... IMO it is going to look awesome....
