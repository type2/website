Hi,

I checked the site and the announcement that the domain has just been sold
indicates that the former owner no longer has the domain name. Of course the
ISP sold some ad links to other automotive related firms knowing that the
previous owner was automotive related.

The gastester vendor has moved to:

http://www.aep.bigstep.com/

The gastester info page is:

http://www.aep.bigstep.com/digital1.htm

There are lots of links on this page for info on the product.

Price is up to $169, but check ebay. He often lists for less there.
