Subject: scrapping a bus (was steel prices)

I'm picking up a bus this weekend and basically stripping it before it 
goes to the wrecker.  This will hopefully include cutting out body pieces, 
etc.  (a lot of this bus will live on in other buses, including mine)

Question though: do I need at least two wheels on it for the wrecker to 
come and pick it up?

I know that it will vary depending on the wrecker, but a knowledgable 
former listee mentioned that I should consider grabbing both the front 
axle beam, and, because it's a camper, the torsion bars as well.  I could 
do this, and end up with it on blocks, but will I be able to get someone 
to take it away in that state?

This is new ground for me, any advice is appreciated.  Oh, and I'm in 
Baltimore, MD.

And yes, I'm willing to pay someone to take it away (well, up to 
$50-100...)

Thanks, 

	Tom
