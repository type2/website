>o = after a squirt of oil into the chamber.

I am really surprised that your number one cylinder had such a small change
when you squirted in oil. I always had a change of  around 10+ pounds with a
used (20,000 + miles) engine with -good- rings.  I wonder if you squirted in
enought oil. I don't know the exact amout to use, but I squirt in about 1
teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of 30w oil. Yes, it makes a mess, but I want to
thoroughly coat the rings and cylinder wall. If the rings are really worn, I
can get a plus change of 50 pounds. I also notice a change in the rate of
compression build up. With badly worn rings, smoking like crazy,  I get a low
reading and it builds up slowly with each compression stroke: e.g. 60, 65,
70, 75, 80, 80, 80. When I squirt in the oil, I get something like : e.g. 90,
110, 110, 110, 115.  That tells me, that the rings are worn, but I probably
don't have a significant valve or head leak problem. If I have a low reading
<60>
and then when I squirt in oil I get a new reading of <70>, then I suspect my
one
of my valves is leaking (or loose head) and the rings are okay or unknown.

I don't worry that much about bad rings and I drive it and add oil as
necessary. It just means the enging is very old or the PO didn't change the
air filter enough. If I have a low reading that stays low with the added oil,
then
that indicates a bad leaking valve, or a loose head;
then I don't trust that engine one bit, because the valves are getting ready
to bust loose and do a lot of expensive damage; and I do not even want to
start that engine. I diagnosed a bad valve on a friends engine and we tried
to get the car to my garage a couple of miles away and it didn't even make it
down the driveway before it dropped a valve and destroyed the head, cylinder,
piston, rod. I know that was an unusual case, but when a valve breaks off it
sure does a lot of damage and you cannot predict when a known burnt valve
will break off.
