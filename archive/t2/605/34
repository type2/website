Sometimes. They usually sell this model:

I wouldn't buy that one unless I was looking on eBay for a deal. Look for leakdown tester or cylinder differential tester.

Check out www.manleyperformance.com or www.tavia.com for a better brand.

Whatever you buy make sure it's got a 14mm thread at the end of the hose. Some are for motorcycles (12mm) and some for aircraft (18mm). Make sure it goes to 100 psi as well.
