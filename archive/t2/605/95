Subject: Bus for sale in South Jersey

Hey everybody-

If any of you are interested, I saw a 70s HighTop for sale in a gas station 
parking lot on Rte 541, between Church Rd and Rte 70.  I guess this is 
Medford.  Looked like it needed some work, but a good starting point.  I 
didnt stop, so I dont know what its like inside.  Oddly enough, this is 
about half a mile from where I picked up my 73 Westy.  Must be a popular 
area for them.  Have a good week everybody.

-ToM
