I have this problem, but I can't boil the tank so I installed a second clear
fuel filter with a removable element in it between the pump and the tank.  I
clean it out every few weeks, and seem to be doing okay.  The rust and water
(?) build up in the filter and are easily cleaned out.  I've got another
filter between the pump and the carb.
