The way I get frozen drums off, big hammer,outside hub
puller,big screwdriver. Take the 11mm bolts out of the
hub, remove lug nuts, squirt some WD-40 in the lug
holes around the hub, tap the center of the hub with
the hammer, go to the brake adjusters and loosen them
if you can, put the puller on the hub and put tension
on it and knock the crap out of the hub center with
the big hammer, most of the time the hub will come
off. Phil
