Subject: Re: Re[2]: [T2] scrapping a bus (was steel prices)

You are doing pretty good with those steel prices.  That usually is for cut
up structural steel.  Cars usually bring a lot less, for they are crushed,
and go to a shredder.  Then the steel gets loaded in a rail car and off to
the mill as number 2 steel, generally a place like NUCOR. A lot of steps are
involved for the old junk car to be returned back to new metal, thus junk
yards do not pay much.

If you walk away with $20 bucks you will be lucky.  Easier to call someone
that hauls off cars for free for their scrap value (kidney foundation) or
just in the phone book, or call a tow company. Or, call the junk yard and
ask for the name of someone.  I bet you anything the scale man can pass your
name an number on to someone who comes in regularly who will haul it off for
you.

PS...I use to run Charleston's biggest scrap yard, so I know what i am
talking about!
