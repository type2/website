Subject: clutch cable

Hi Volks!

I drove the Bus all the way from Wilmington, NC to NYC and back without any
problems whatsoever (except for my buddy's son who opened the side door while
I was gassing up). The trip was very fun, and saw another bus on Long Island
--- patchwork, mostly orange --- and got 20 mpg.
I survived another hurricane here since then, and went out for my traditional
beer run. In the parking lot my clutch pedal went to the floor and stayed!
After an hour trying to jerry-rig things, I did a 'Greg Potts' and jammed it
into gear to get home. I'm really glad that I read that thread from Greg about
him jamming it into gear towards a Bus event.
I found that the 'fork' that attaches to the clutch pedal broke through on one
of the tongs, and there's nothing to secure it onto the pedal.
I'm certain that I need a new cable, but is there a trick to attaching the
fork to the pedal? Do I attach the cable to the pedal before securing it at
the tranny?
