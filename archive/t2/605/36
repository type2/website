Subject: scrapping a bus (was steel prices)

TOM--- Best thing to do concerning your 62 (below) is to talk with the guys who 
would be doing the picking-up.  If you have two rolling wheels for them, they 
can use an old-technology wrecker; with flat tires they can use a dolly.

I had the easiest time as your last responder suggested -- cutting up the 
vehicle with a Sawzall or maybe putting an abrasive disk in a circular saw.  
Then you can take the bits to a scrapyard at your leisure.  Don't be tempted to 
trade for something there.  I picked up an old mailbox, thinking it would make 
a good place to store charcoal and barbecue tools -- the wife hated it ;-))

Since this is Friday and you are in Baltimore:  I am looking for good, solid 
metal just below the windshield for my '69 Bay.  If you have this, and would 
like to sell same to me, I'm interested.... thanks.  Possibly I could help with 
the scrapping process.  I am in the Queenstown, MD phone book.   Good luck,  
Glenn McComas

I'm picking up a bus this weekend and basically stripping it before it 
goes to the wrecker.  This will hopefully include cutting out body pieces, 
etc.  (a lot of this bus will live on in other buses, including mine)

Question though: do I need at least two wheels on it for the wrecker to 
come and pick it up?

I know that it will vary depending on the wrecker, but a knowledgable 
former listee mentioned that I should consider grabbing both the front 
axle beam, and, because it's a camper, the torsion bars as well.  I could 
do this, and end up with it on blocks, but will I be able to get someone 
to take it away in that state?
