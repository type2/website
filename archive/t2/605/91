Other than loosening the rear brake hoses for a minute to let out any 
trapped pressure (If the wheel will turn by hand this may not be it) , if 
the drum is really stuck to the hub another thing that will work is to put 
the wheel back on but leave the lug nuts loose. Just hand tight. Take her 
down off the jack and drive back and forth a couple of feet quickly 
applying the brakes each time. Don't drive around the block or anything, 
just 10 feet or so. It has broken mine free before.

But, it sounds for the most part like you have a machined ridge or a rusty 
ridge inside the drum. Pry inward on the metal part of the brake shoe 
through the inspection port. Slow and firm will also move it inward enough 
to clear the ridge. For the price of a new set of shoes (cheap enough, 
considering) just assume you will trash them.

Plus, I am going to pile on and say that once you get in there, just go 
ahead and replace the brake hoses, springs, etc. The e-brake cable might 
also be a good thing at this time.
