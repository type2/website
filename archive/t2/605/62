Hi,

We arrived at home about 4:30 AM on Monday. I took a bit of time but 
I sorted out the pictures and reorganized the web space.  Please 
visit the link below for pics of Buses of the Corn 2004 which took 
place in Whitby Ontario Canada.

A big thanks to the Potts family for hosting the a wonderful VW 
camping event. Thanks to Jamie and family for putting us up and 
putting up with us at his house and in the carabus! Thanks to John 
and Marc for hanging in there on the road.  There is no finer group 
of folks and many more thanks are in order.

I will start working on a full blown trip report this weekend.

Thanks
Chris
