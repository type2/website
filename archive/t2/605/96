Subject: 1700 upgrade to 2000, difficulties

Ok 1700 engine, top end to be rebuilt very soon. I am putting together a 
shopping list.

Question:

Is the bottom end, ie short block of a 1700 suitable or interchangable with 
P/C and heads for a 2.0L?
If I strip down the engine to a short block and replace the P/C and Heads 
from the 1700 with the 2.0L  P/C and Heads, would this be a direct bolt on 
application?
Would the rods, crank and cam be suitable for use without modification?
Is there a difference in stroke fom the 1700 to the 2000?


Thanks,
