Jamey --- It helps to keep a bit of tension on the cable so that the pedal end 
doesn't fall off, while you are bringing up the adjustment at the transmission 
end.  Attach a couple of rubber bands, maybe an easy-to-stretch spring to keep 
tension on the trans end, then place the eyelet on the pedal end; then go back 
to the trans end and bring the adjusting net to its correct position.

Of course, this is after you have fixed the broken fork problem with a new part 
and/or the help of a welding buddy.   Glenn

...I found that the 'fork' that attaches to the clutch pedal broke through on 
one of the tongs, and there's nothing to secure it onto the pedal.
I'm certain that I need a new cable, but is there a trick to attaching the
fork to the pedal? Do I attach the cable to the pedal before securing it at
the tranny?
