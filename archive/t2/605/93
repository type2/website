Subject: Jerome ...who's a-coming? <Sechrest- OUT>

Thanks Jim Ellis for the kind words regarding Jerome  Well over  $60,000+
has been donated by the Arizona Bus Club through this event. Lucky for Lady
Magoo and i   we have been to every Jerome and have seen it grow, It has
been due to just a handful of people, taking a doomed bus and placing it
back on the road   This year an original paint and original interior camper
could be yours for just a .50 cent ticket !!  Last years winner bought just
$10 worth of tickets and drove away.
In my Many years attending numerous VW events  there is NONE that compare to
Jerome. Try the Jerome Experience  you will never forget it !!
