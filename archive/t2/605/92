Subject: 78 VW Camper Bus for Sale

Hi,
 
About a week ago, I asked if anyone was interested in a 78 VW Bus.  I have listed the bus on ebay, if you want to see pictures and the details, the item number is # 2486981877 on www.ebay.com or the link is http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2486981877&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT.  
Any questions, please email me.
 
Thanks!!!!
Andrea
