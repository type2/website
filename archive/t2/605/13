Subject: Re: [T2] Used Rotor question

You can have them turned down so that they are smooth again and as long as they are thicker than the minimum spec, keep them for a spare. If they are too thin, recycle them... 

Also good for homebuilt stands for grinders, lights, fans, speakers as a base. Also good for a wheel on the back of an engine stand to help rotate and engine upside down. GREAT paperweight for yuor deska t work, though maybe a bit of overkill... Also those brake dust smudges and grease stains on the memos going to your boss might not be well recieved.
