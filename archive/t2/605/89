Subject: interesting fuel lines in photo

Several times in the photos of engines that appear in VWT mag, most 
recently on page 94 of the September issue, I see what appear to be 
braided steel lines with compression fittings delivering fuel to 
monster carbs.

All the carbs with which I am familiar have the simple nipple fitting 
to push on braided rubber hose.

How does one adapt a stock nipple fitting to these compression 
fittings? Is this a custom weld job done by the individual builder?
