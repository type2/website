ALL,

A lot of people asked me about the fate of my 1968 HiTop bus. I sold 
it (total sell out for now) in May to a nice fellow who lives about 
50 Km for my house. He was a really nice fellow that had had a bus 
for about 9 years before it died a few years ago. When I got back 
form BOTC I got a voice mail from him telling me to check out the 
members gallery at www.fullmoonbusclub.com to see what the current 
state of the bus was. Check it out!

You may have to cut an paste the link above or just go to

on the first page.

Thanks
