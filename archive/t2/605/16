Subject: Re: [T2]Penthouse canvas and seal ?

hey thanks jason thats cool it will be awhile before i can afford it anyways$$$$ just need to make me a note... just got the top today from a fellow fullmooner for free and the canvas is pretty shot but it is still useable for the time being.... the seal is bad but i was going to try to cut some gas line in half and wrap around it for the time being.. i know its jerry riggin but i dont mind for now just tickeled to have some expansion and a roof.. its ever bit as high as a hightop when lowered..or almost close enough for me lol.......
 
question though.... i got to mount the brackets and such first how do i know exactly where to mount them so that when i install the top(fiberglass) it isnt crooked or off...?
i thought this was going to be fairly simple till i got it and realized hold up lol.....i plan to re do the canvas later on after install and also will cut the hole in the roof after install....
thanks
peace
chris
going to take pics......post them up later......
got to finish cleaning it up and such as well before i try top install it goodness that thing is heavy.... it is detached fromt he mount..... the canvas is still attached to the fiberglass top though...
