Tranny in but the coupler is kicking my butt.

If one disconnects the shift linkage up front can the shift rod be shoved
back further/harder? 

The shift shaft on the tranny itself is all the way in as if it were in
1st/3rd and I can't shove the gear shift far enough forward to get the
coupler all the way on the shaft. It's a tight fit so if I pull the tranny
shaft out to neutral or 2nd/4th it just shoves right back in when I try to
get the coupler on far enough to tighten the grub screw (grub screw out
BTW, so it's not causing a bind).

Ideas?

Thanks,

Gerald
