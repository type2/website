Subject: Re[2]: [T2] scrapping a bus (was steel prices)

Around here junkyards won't take a vehicle, or will charge you to take it,
if there are no sellable parts left on the vehicle. Getting ready to haul a
'69 to a scrapyard. We pulled everything useful including all brake parts.
Just put the drums back on to hold the wheels.

Scrapyard requires gas tank and tires to be removed before they will take
it. I have a 12 volt impact to pull the wheels/tires/drums when we get
there. Going to use a towbar to haul it (about 30 miles).

Current steel price is $3.50/100 pounds ($0.035/pound) so on a completely
stripped bus I figure $35 - $70 -- maybe.
