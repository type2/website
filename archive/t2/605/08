I was advised to read the manual by someone who didn't find the tester
useful before making a purchase. The manual is full of caveats:

 - requires 8-30 minute calibration every time unless you don't care about
the reading drifting
 - you have to make sure it's draining water properly otherwise the gas
reading with be affected
 - only accurate to 0.5% (even the pro model with the fancier display is
only accurate to 0.5%)
 - you need to watch the reading for a 2 minute period
 - you need to purge the device with a breeze for 5-10 minutes when finished
 - you are limited to checking the mixture at lower rpms and have to feather
the throttle at all times so you don't damage the unit
 - admittedly poor RFI shielding
 - mechanical pump invites break down

Here's my favorite quote from searching the web: "the Gastester that I had
calibrated in clean air for 25 minutes went from the starting setting of 2.0
to negative 1.5%! I am not sure how that is possible".

This tester simply sounds too error prone and flaky while requiring a lot of
patience and high maintenance. And it seem in this case you get what you pay
for. If you search the web you'll find plenty of complaints about the Gunson
tester.
