Subject: Fun with spray paint

While waiting for my fuel tank to be finished by the radiator shop, it
was raining so I couldn't do all the engine compartment cleaning I
wanted to do while the intakes were out. Various bits and pieces were
hanging out in my garage giving me the evil eye.

I decided since it was raining, I could play. :-)

Carbs off the intakes. Removed the residue of the various attempts at
getting those (-at-)#%^& diaphragms to stop leaking. Layers of silicone and
JBWeld came off. Took forever too since silicone is quite resistant to
scrubbing. I then scrubbed the intakes inside and out with Purple
Power and steel wool. There was a surprising amount of rust on the
manifolds that all had to be removed. Some spots required a grinding
wheel on my dremel too.

Out comes the JBWeld. Instead of putting crap on the outsides of the
diaphragms I decided to fill the openings from the inside. Mixed up a
batch and filled the two small openings inside the intake manifolds.
This also served to block off the ports on the back so I didn't have
to make block off plates. (A good thing since I'm out of metal...)

While the JBWeld was hardening, I grabbed the balance tube and the
linkage bar. Before pics of balance tube:

Steel wool again with a sanding disk on my dremel to get all that rust
and spray paint and gunk off. Slapped a coat of Ford Blue engine
enamel on there. Actually 3 coats...

Once the intake manifolds were ready I painted them as well.

Not a big thing, but gave me something to do and hopefully added a few
months to the life of these parts... =)

BTW: One thing that really sucks so far about living in Colorado. It
seems to rain nearly every day! Yesterday I was racing the rain to get
everything back together. Hence the still nasty engine compartment. It
started raining 30 minutes after I buttoned up. Apparently this is
normal for spring. Sigh.
