Subject: T4 Engine Pull Newby - planning

I'm pulling a 79 cal engine from a 76 bus Saturday Morning.

Richard Atwell's site is my script.

Not Removing transmission.

For those of us with only one jack, and access to a second one mid-morning, is
there a set height you can mount the bus at and remove the engine without
raising the body during the procedure?  Even if it means laying the engine
flat on the concrete?

More to come...
