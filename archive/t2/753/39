Cool. thanks Richard for the info.

My bus passed New York State inspection this morning with no problem.
Woo hoo. Luckily I'm emmissions expempt.

I just went out and re-gapped and re-timed my '71 1600 dp. The points
rubbing block was already showing wear after only 400 miles. Beware
"Bruck" points!

After doing the valves (noted one exhaust valve was slightly tight)
and timing she seems to be running smoother. Still need to take her
out for a test drive.

I've noticed a little popping sound at idle and when decelerating. Not
consistently, just every few revolutions or so. put put put put put
pop put put put put put put pop.

What the usual suspect - exhaust leak? valve issue? The exhaust is new
and I did notice a slight pulsating leak around where the dampener
goes into the muffler - would this be a likely culprit?

Happy Friday and many happy bus driving weekends
peace
