Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Replacement - HELP!

Hey guys,

What year are we talking about here?

The biggest problem by far, that I have found, with this type of symptom is 
that the return spring in the electrical switch actually breaks the plastic 
casing.

Look at the flange to the outside of where the notch for the mechanical 
switch enters the electrical switch. There should be the end of the spring 
sticking out of a hole, this is where the crack occurs. The lock mechanism 
rarely fail. Replace this electrical part with wires on mid '74 and 
earliers. no wires on later models. This is much easier done on earliers 
than late. (some are metal housing so don't freak out if you don't find a 
plastic one.

This is easy to do on early buses.

Be careful with the operation, if you just replace the electrical part it 
isn't a problem.  Please don't drill any holes into anything other than the 
shear bolt on '74 and later buses. There are many one and two year only lock 
mechanisms and they are getting scarce. I can help you through the whole 
process and tell you how to make homemade tools to get out the ignition 
switch. NO DRILLING PLEASE.

-Joe
