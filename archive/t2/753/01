Invest in hearing aid technology. There is going to be a whole generation of deaf people when the current teens and 20-somethings reach retirement age! <grin!> 

BOOM Bumpa BOOM Thump BOOM BOOM BOOM "Babbeeee I wanna **** your **** and **** then we'll go get some ***********" BOOM BOOM THUMPA BOOOM BOOOM.... (goes the Civic sitting next to me at the traffic light).
