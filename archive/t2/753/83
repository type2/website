Subject: Re: [T2] timing mark on fan

From Randall Carpenter:

I think that timing is a mechanical thing.  An efficiently
 running motor is a chemical thing.  What I mean is that there is
 nothing wrong with my timing.  I can set my timing where ever I want.
 That doesn't mean my engine will run at that setting.  I checked for
 vacum leaks (couldn't find any, doesn't mean there aren't any),
 checked dwell (48 degrees), set valve clearences (all were dead on).
 But I don't have a stock set of carbs.  The fact that I am running
 way rich is probably the carb (duh).
So the next thing for me is to get ahold of that Weber and go
 through the tuning steps.  I'm assuming that as I lean out the
 mixture the timing will come closer to TDC.  I've seen some folks
 mention that they have their timing set at 7 degrees BTDC with their
Webers.  Once I get the carb set and the motor runs good (no ping,
 power, not lean) then the timing will be what it is.

You are correct that timing is a 'mechanical' thing. But it is controlled by point gap and engine rpm's. No 
matter how you set the mixture, rich or lean, it will NOT change the timing. At idle, you have to physically 
turn the dist to change timing. Yes, vacuum changes timing at idle if you switch it from ported to manifold 
vacuum...... but no way are you doing that by carb adjustments.
