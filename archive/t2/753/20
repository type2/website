Subject: RE: [T2] gasket sealer

I will probably need to order some more, but for now I am going to try some
gasket sealer. I have not heard anyone tell me not to use the ultra black, so
I will pick up a tube. I figure that it can only help and it will help me to
verify that the gasket is not the source of the leak.
