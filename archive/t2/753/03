Subject: gasket sealer

What type of gasket sealer is everyone using on the intake manifold were it
attaches to the head? We have metal gaskets from BD and I put them on with no
sealer. I think we might still have a very small vacuum leak. What is a good
hi temp sealer to use here? What about the RTV gasket maker (ultra copper)?
According to the rtv site, Ultra Black (gasket sealer) and the Ultra copper
(gasket maker) can be used for intake manifolds. Opinions?

Thanks,
Corbett
