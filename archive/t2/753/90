Hi,

I am trying to get my heating working back to condition as I have a
bus that came from Australia and is now in the UK (a little bit colder
in winter). I have read a great deal on getting it to work
effectively.....increasing insulation, secondary fans etc. Am I
wasting my time, should I go for an old petrol  Eberspacher ?

yours

Charles
