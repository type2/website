Subject: cd player and gauge wiring diagram

Hi,
I need to connect my cd  player  and since I removed my dashboard   ,  
I'd like to prepare the wires to accept a CHT and oil temp gauges.
CD PLAYER:
- I found the radio connection + (track 46 on Bentley  diagram - p97.14
- I found the radio connection - (track 72 on Bentley diagram - p97.16
WHERE should I connect (or take the wire from ) to connect my ACC 
(accessories) wire , this one should be on  with the ignition on ?

CHT GAUGE:
- I think I found the wire that can be on when I switch on the lite  , 
it is in track 47 (p97.14) GY/BL  color wire,   is  that correct ? I 
can  use it  to  control the gauges lite at night ?
- how about the other wires ?

The position  7 (accessories)  in my fuse box is unused,  how could I 
wire it to use it for accessories  like  guage and cd player ?

I manage to read  the R. Bentley Current flow  diagram (p97.14), so 
could you please tell me which  wires I can use accccording to this manual ?
thanks a lot guys
