ps i dont like big crowds either and when the crowd starts closing in its time for me to find another place unless its around the fire with the fullmooners.... now thats always alll good...
my bus is pretty psychedelic and well i get ask lots for drugs and even though i love my grass i keep it in the family LOL... i just turn my head lots of times from the way it makes me feel...

Give me a nice campout in the woods anyday. I will make my own music. I dont
like huge crowds of inmature kids asking me for drugs constantly just
because I have a bus.
