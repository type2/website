Hi,

I have just bought a 1977 bus and am trying to rebuild the heating
that was disconnected. I am reconnecting the blower fan (all the wires
were cut and removed). I have one final wire to find:

please see http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-77-78.jpg

If you scan along the bottom of the diagram for earth/ground
connection 68 this is for the blower fan. Now scan upwards and you
will see two live 12v feeds on the other side of the J14 relay.

1) Why are there two 12v feeds,  one from the coil (N) and one from
the alternator (D)?
2) Which should I use?

yours

Charles Durrant
