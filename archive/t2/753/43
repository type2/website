With continuous pressure bleeding from the reservoir end, I will agree
with this.  If you are bleeding using the "pump the pedal" method, the
fact that fluid is coming out through the threads also indicates that air
might be getting in the same way.  As long as you make sure that the
brake system is always under pressure while the bleeder is open this won't
be a problem, but if your helper relaxes from the pedal before you get the
bleeder closed air might make its way in.
