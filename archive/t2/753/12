Change of thread direction...

Reusing the metal intake manifold gaskets? Or replace with paper ones?

I didn't think to order any and I need 'em tomorrow morning. I've got
a roll of high temp paper gasket material that I was going to use
(asphault impregnated, fuel resistant, etc..)

Debating which to use now.
