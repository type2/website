Subject: RE: [T2] gasket sealer

Things feel pretty tight to me and I think the leak is either the brake
booster connection that is not being used or the manifold is not seated right.
We also had to grind the manifold down some on one end to clear the egr bolt
and washer also. It seemed to fit pretty good, but maybe not good enough. I
will try to aim the carb cleaner better this weekend and see if we can figure
out exactly what part is leaking.

Other than that , these cb carbs seem to be doing ok. Of course we synced them
and tuned them with a leak, so we will have to do it all over again, but the
practice will be good. I think I might remove my stock ones and put my set of
cb carbs on. A lot less bulky that is for sure.

so far they have not been to bad to get these carbs working. Mainly our
inexperience in dealing with duals. I had someone else sync up my duals, so I
missed out on some knowledge.
