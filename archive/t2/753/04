Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Insulation

I was at a traffic light the other day and a toyota pulled up behind my bus.   I rolled the window up and the boom boom literally hurt my ears.  And he was all the way in the back of me!  I looked at the guy to my right, thinking it had to be his car, and he put his fingers in his ears.  Plus he was way to old to be listening to that crap.  I wish the police would crack down on it.  
But no, they've got to look for unbuckled seat belts!  I'm going to have to get around to insulating the bopmobile!  Cheers...KR

Invest in hearing aid technology. There is going to be a whole generation of deaf people when the current teens and 20-somethings reach retirement age!
