Subject: Re: [T2] gasket sealer

imho i wouldnt use any gasket sealer between manifold and heads but thats just me... if you are still having a vaccum leak look for any obstruction that might be in the way?
i found one of my bolts was barely hanging over on the manifold once causing it not to seal...
the bolts are where the FI use to run for EGR tubes<wrong name but you get the meaning....
(please dont fuss about my terminology its what i call them and most know them by even though thats not politically correct)
 
i have used the little metal gaskets an they do well and the paper ones are ok but i dont really like those...
the meatl have always did very good for me...
good luck
peace and love

What type of gasket sealer is everyone using on the intake manifold were it
attaches to the head? We have metal gaskets from BD and I put them on with no
sealer. I think we might still have a very small vacuum leak. What is a good
hi temp sealer to use here? What about the RTV gasket maker (ultra copper)?
According to the rtv site, Ultra Black (gasket sealer) and the Ultra copper
(gasket maker) can be used for intake manifolds. Opinions?

Thanks,
