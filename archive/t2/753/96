Peter, It sounds like you need a hug, bad days are no
fun.If you have another distributor put it in, if not
change back to the points and condenser. I have found
it is always good to carry a good set of points and
condenser to use as a backup for the electronic parts,
very hard to find the electronic parts on a weekend.
(see your wife for the hug)  Phil
