I had a loud system growing up, so the loud system does not bother me to much.
I enjoy listening to a well tuned system. Especially if you take a look at the
work that goes into them. Most places do have laws about the decibel level and
will enforce it if they get enough complaints. I went through that as a kid
and we ended up having to only play full blast at "special events".
