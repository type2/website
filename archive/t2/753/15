Subject: RE: [T2] gasket sealer

if you sprayed carb cleaner down there and got a reaction then it is possibly the manifold leaking...?
as far as the bolts for the (EGR tubes) if you have them at all?
they wont do that but i can tell you they will sound like you got the worst exhaust leak ever just wen through that recently.....even took to muffler shop and put up on rack to find the bad bad whole in exhaust but was coming from one of those bolts up top in engine bay LOL had wiggled loose and came out....
 
 
make sure you tighten the manifold down even on all the 4 nuts.... as well like putting on a tire ...
back and forth not side by side maybe it will seal leveler...?<if thats a word.....?
LOL
 
my manicold i had to snip the corner off carefully with hacksaw just to get it to go down right over the hole there and not hit the EGR tube bolts...
 
that carb cleaner tells the truth....
 
have you checked your brake booster connection? possibly...it will do the same thing if the carb spray hits it as well if i remember correctly...?
 
btw if it(manifolds) isnt sitting correctly there possibly? the sealer wouldnt help anyways....'
wiggle the manifold till it feels like it seats ....~!~ wished i could take a look and help... i went through T tottal h double L with my carbs so i gained something out of it even though i said the heck with umm and got rid of them.....
 
 
good luck
peace and love

They work fine on mine, but I am thinking that they might not be as good on
this bus. It may not even be the gasket, it could be the plug used in the
holes for the vacumm. These carbs have holes in both intakes. I am unable to
determine if it is the base of the intake leaking or the plug. I just figured
since I have to take it off again anyway that I would use some sealer on it to
make sure. It is a very small leak and only noticed by a chance spray of carb
cleaner.
