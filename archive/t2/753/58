Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Replacement - HELP!

I usually find that the pot metal shaft that fits into the plastic
electrical switch wears and will not throw the switch far enough to
make contact for starting. I tried shimming the first one I
encountered and the fixes weren't durable, so I finally ended up
replacing the cylinder.
