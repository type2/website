Bleh. This is getting tiresome.

No power at WOT. Low power the rest of the time (making me go to WOT
more often).

Distributor wasn't flipped. I must have clipped the timing light to
the wrong wire. The distributor gear is offset so it would take a
sledge to get it in there wrong. ;-)

Dwell from Pertronix is nearly 60. I wasn't going to worry about it
since I'm also running a Hyfire and the Pertronix is just a trigger
(right?), but maybe once this wave of rain lets up I'll go move the
sensor.

I haven't done a valve adjustment so that's also to be done once the
bus has sat for a few hours. No vacuum leaks. I triple-checked the
gaskets and lines, and took a loose finger from my nitrile glove
around the carbs and gaskets to see if there's anything I missed. At
least there's no rust blocking things. ;-)

Carbs appear balanced (ball is within 1/8" of each other). I don't
know what else to check. Sigh.

Any ideas of what I missed?
