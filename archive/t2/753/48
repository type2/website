A few days later my long-suffering wife was available so I had her pump it
a few times.  No bubbles emerged and the pedal remained at the same
height.  The fluid was coming out nice and clean, so I declared victory
and buttoned things up.

The week after, the original master cylinder on our '69 bug finally
expired.  That one wasn't quite as easy!
