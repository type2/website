Hmmm, now that is a puzzler.  If pressure bleeding from the reservoir end
then there shouldn't be any pressure to push fluid past the threads of the
bleeder.

I take it you are attaching a hose to the bleeder and putting the end in a
container to prevent air re-entry.  You might try a wider container that
limits the depth of the brake fluid.  Pushing air bubbles several inches
down into a container will result in a bit of pressure at the bleeder.

The last time I had my brake system open on my bus (rear wheel cylinder
replacement) I noted that fluid was dripping slowly from the disconnected
brake line.  I made sure that the reservoir didn't get empty while I
installed the new wheel cylinders.  I also left the bleeder screws loose
in the cylinders so that the cylinders would fill.  After I was done, I
closed the bleeders and found that the pedal was nice and firm, no
bleeding required!  Some days I just live right!
