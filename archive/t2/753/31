Subject: Friday - Stupid Question

I know this is probably a stupid question, but since it is Friday.... I have
one of the engine analyzers that look like a multimeter but have an RPM/dwell
gauge on them. How the heck do you use the RPM part....... All I have is two
metal probes. Where can I put the hot probe to get an rpm reading? I was
hoping it would be like some timing lights and have something that goes around
the plug wire, but it does not. Do I need different leads?
