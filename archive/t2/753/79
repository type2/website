Subject: Re: FI Fuel pump runs. And runs, and runs.

I think I have a fried double relay.  The fuel pump was running on this
morning (even without the key in the ignition) and the bus started right up. 
I installed the Pertronix set,
adjusted the timing, and it idled and revved good.  I went inside to get my
wallet, and then the bus either wouldn't start and/or wouldn't idle.  Later
in the day I ran Mike Benthin's suggested tests on the double relay and 
everything
looked ok, except the fuel pump wasn't getting any power at that point.  I
plugged the double relay back in, and it clicked when I turn on the 
ignition, but I got no fuel
pressure.

Then I tried to work around the relay by doing a piggy-back splice on the
fuel pump feed wire just below the point it enters the double relay (using
one of those plastic crimp things you use to wire trailer lights) and
running a wire to the pos. coil.  I couldn't get immediate fuel pressure
with this setup (I got some pressure eventually, but the bus wouldn't run
for more than 30 seconds) so I must have not made a good splice, and the 
intermittent/delayed pressure must have been through the relay.

At this point it looks like my double relay is fried - it keeps the pump
running on sometimes, and at other times it won't make the pump run at all.
Could there be other culprits?

I'm hoping that replacing the double relay will get me back on the road.  I
tried to buy one locally but couldn't locate one at the local dealer or Peak
Performance (closest VW shop).
