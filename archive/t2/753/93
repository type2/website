Thoughts off the top of my head:

1) mixture too rich
	- mixture adjustment off
	- clogged air filter
	- bad float valve in one or both carbs

2) Distributor not advancing
	- verify distributor is advancing to 35-42deg BTDC at full advance 
using timing light

3) fouled spark plug

4) fuel pump not delivering adequate pressure

5) distributor going south (this can sometimes result in loss of power 
at high RPMs)

6) Other electrical issue:
	- bad ground somewhere


What I'd test first:

a) dizzy advancing
b) air cleaners: try driving without them and see if it helps - i've 
gotten caught on this before
c) check spark color coming from Dizzy.  It is unlikely this is the 
issue, but i'd check it because its easy to check.
d) plugs

Then I'd move on to the carbs, which are more of a pain.

Remember, it's all about fuel and spark.

If you have spark (dizzy/timing/plugs) then its gotta be fuel related 
and it sounds like a "rich" issue (not enough air or too much fuel).

Good luck.
