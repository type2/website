Have you thought about further cross-pollenating this to thesamba.com?  
There's a bunch of "us Portlanders" who hang out over there in the Bay 
Bus Forum that I never see here .. and vice-versa of course.  

After Colin/Amskeptic's whirlwind pass through Portland last year, some
of the Samba-haunting Bus owners were gathering at the SE Hawthorne
Lucky Lab brewpub on "Miser Mondays" .. utterly informal, whoever felt
like showing up.  I need to get that restarted now that the weather is 
turning decent.

Suggestion duly noted in the subject line. :-)
