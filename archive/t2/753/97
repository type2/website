Subject: HElla Relay Wiring Schematic / Diagram

Hi Volks:

My friend and I each got the Hella relay kit from Ron at BD for setting 
up a second battery to run the inverter and 12 volt stuff in our 78 Westy;s,

This weekend we wanted to set them up.  I bought wire, terminals clips 
etc and opened the bag.  The instructions only show how to wire it to a 
trailer plug!  I am using it to charge an auxiliary marine deep cycle 
second battery.

Can anyone point me to simple instructions or even better a diagram on 
how to do this?  I've downloaded a couple of old posts form the archives 
but they don't seem to address the Hella relay kits only a Bosch.

Thanks,

BEN
