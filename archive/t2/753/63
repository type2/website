Subject: Why is my governor seal still leaking? (please help)

Hello all - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon with automatic transmission.  I'm trying to get it to stop leaking.  Anyway, I replaced a bunch of seals that were leaking, and everything is going well except for this stinking governor!
 
I ordered a new govenor seal (it's actually an O Ring) which seemed a little strange, because it is larger in diameter than the governor cap.  Anyway, I pulled out the old O ring, which seemed fine, replaced it, put the cap and that metal spring thing that holds it all together.
 
The (expletive here) cap leaks worse than before I started.
 
Please help!  And, by the way, should there be automatic transmission fluid around the govenor?  Seems odd, but hey, what do I know?
 
Thanks as always -
