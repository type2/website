My wife has suggested the same thing, only involving the whole bus and 
with me inside it.

At over $400 I might be happy, but I couldn't go home.

Agreed.  Right now I'm just trying to get the thing to move under it's 
own power.  If I can get it so that it runs reasonably and I can take a 
few short trips, it will help the lobbying at home.  I have seen the 
kind of time and money people drop into project cars.  If I can get 
this carb to run in an acceptable fashion, then I'm looking at 
replacing the rotten tires ($250-300), then rusty brakes ( $who knows). 
  I've got quite a list after that.  So after I do the graduation party 
for my youngest tomorrow, I'll get back to the carb, try tuning it up, 
and I'll let you all know how it went.

If I go missing just look at the scrap metal places for an orange cube. 
  I'll be the gooey center.
