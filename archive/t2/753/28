True, so true. And environmentally friendly too... <grin!>

I've wanted (for several years now) one of those old GE electric lawn tractors. Supposedly has pretty of juice for a 2 acre yard and there were dozens of electric attachments including a welder. I'm tired of the B&S racket. Now adays I have a tiny yard and trees so a reel mower would be perfect.
