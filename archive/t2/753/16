As you know (possibly),

The metal gasket cannot be used again, they crush when they are installed 
and therefore cannot be reused.

 

its not good but i have reused them and even got 8000 miles on a set of used ones once .....

it can be done but no i dont reccomend it... always almost always make sure your sealing is new.....

the reason i usd mine used so loong was cause thats all i had and said i will change them tomorrow and forgot until 8000 miles later ooops....

peace and love
