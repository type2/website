Good advice. Also remove all the reflectors, signal lenses, headlights, etc.
They're a pain to mask and the job looks better if they're off when you
apply paint. Just cover the silver bowls in the light housings, the ends of
the headlight cables, etc., with masking tape so you won't be scraping paint
off them when you're done.
