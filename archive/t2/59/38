there were 3 types of 914s. The 914/4 914/6 and 914/8

The 914/4 had the same basic engine as the VW 411 and 412 even following
the displacement through the years 1.7 1.8. Which is why keeping my
411 on the road is so expensive since I can sometimes only get odd parts
for it with the label "Porsche" on it increasing the price.

The 914/6 had a few different configurations. The 911T engine was used in
it at one time and I think some had the Carrera 6 in it.

The 914/8... well, if you ever come across someone saying they have an
original 914/8 they are lying or owns the Porsche factory museum as only 2
were made.

So, yeah, either the 1600 upright was something the 914 owned finagled
into his 914 (how he did it is another question. Why someone would do that
is well, just mind boggling.) or the guy is mistaken.
