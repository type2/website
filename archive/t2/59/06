Theodore,

I would advise you to hold off on the possum business.
while that may be a hilarious story, how was your bus
really involved? don't rush it man. give it time,
inevitably something will happen, and you'll know that
that is it's name.

i remember i had my vanagon, the "dirty twinkie" for a
year before i actually named it. i was at school in
Vermont(an awesome place to be). my buddy and i used
to take it off roading often, so it was usually
covered in mud, or dried dirt. one day we were walking
out of a mall in rutland. as we approached the van i
made the comment, "look, at her." simply reveling in
it's beauty as per usual. to which my friend
responded, "she's a dirty twinkie, bro." it was at
that very moment that her name was revealed to me! so
you see, it's all a matter of time. don't force a
name, or it will wear off, and you'll be disatisfied
in the end. a name should apply to a specific
experience or time that involves both you and your
bus. just a thought.
