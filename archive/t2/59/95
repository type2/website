Nope..its a bus thing.  The traditional method of making a bug muffer fit
involves one of two things.

a: add cutouts to the bumper.

b: stand on the tailpipes till the muffler fits.

of course, the correct thing to do is to use a bus muffler...if your hatch
seal is anything except perfect, you can expect to suck exhaust fumes into
the interior of the bus with the bug muffler.

i think the single most important reproduction rubber should be the
windshield seal. is there any hope of seeing these done properly? jeez,
since bogus wcm windshied rubber is flubber, isn't a spanking new floor mat
encouraging floor rust? seems like painting the walls before the ceiling...
