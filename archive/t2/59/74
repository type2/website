Subject: Re: [T2] 76 teardown

Hi Billy
Chuck here, catching up between power outages.
my 2cents
if your not sure of p&c size check your eng# and cross reference it for
cc's. If you dont have a book give me the # and I can look it up for you.
(wilsons how to rebuild is good) of course you can find the # on the piston
but that kinda slows you down.

personally if it was my head, I'd look for a rebuilder unless my head was
junk. The problem with exchange is you never know whos junk your getting.

Bakersfield is a hotbed of buggys and offroading, shouldn't be too hard to
find someone, been too many years since I've been there, the 3 day trip to
Fresno not withstanding.

good luck

Chuck

Mind you, my other bus is a 79 with the same 72-74 type of exhaust, which
would be nice for interchangeability.

in the Fresno-Bakersfield california area?
