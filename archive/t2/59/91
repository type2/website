Why would that seem odd, everything I have learned about heads on my 2.0L
indicates that (to be safe) you should replace your heads before 60,000
miles to keep from dropping a valve or seat. Once that happens you have a
much greater problem ($$$).

Are there some of you out there who have gotten more than 60,000 miles out
of a set of 2.0L heads??? (without dropping a valve or seat)
