Subject: Re: [T2] '72-'74 exhaust on a '77

I'm confident that your swap will work as i did something similar on my 77 
bus.  The difference on mine was that i used my heaterboxes and header pipes 
coming off of the heads of my 2.0 and i installed them on a 1.7 i bought. i 
used a 4 tip exhaust and everything worked very nicely with the exception of 
having to use very short bolts on the 4-tip exhaust flanges to heater box 
flange. good luck with your project.\
