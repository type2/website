Subject: More looking at vans....

Hi,

I just spoke with someone about a van and wondering what you-all  think:

1982
50k overall miles
new heads by owner who has engine shop?
Ivory, pinstripe, brown interior, no rips, cracks, a couple little cracks
Poptop might need pain or jelcoat as is stained?
Door panel has crack - use hard board?
Has all the stuff like tables, etc
New truck tires
Has one mechanical problem - bushing at end of gear shift linkage might
need adjustment? Is he talking about the throw-out bearing? Has
intermittent clicking...
$3000-$4000

That's all I know so far. three owners - first, then the dad, then the
son.

Thanks!

Andree
