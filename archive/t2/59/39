Wow,

Thanks for all the replies.  I'm going to check the archives and follow up
on each email.  I'll post my progress.

Another thing I'd like to do is paint it.  It's the original white and if
you wipe your finger on it some of the paint comes off on your finger as
powder.

I've never had to paint a vehicle before.  Does anyone has any advice on
what's best to do for these old VWs?  I want to strike a balance between
cost and returning it to it's original lustre.
