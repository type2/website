Really??

On a 50k engine?  Seems odd.

Sand it, patch it (Mar Glass) prime it (PPG DP 48 (white) with DP 401
catalyst) paint it VW Cloud White.

I think this means the plastic bushing at the very front.  If so, it is
easy.  The others are hard.  Ask him which.

Rust is a major factor you haven't mentioned.  Look under the windshield and
other windows for bubbles, holes bondo or plain old rust.  Look under the
mats, look at the corners, look at the door bottoms, and look at the front
axle.  Bring a piece of cardboard and some latex gloves so you can do this
without getting too dirty.

If you live in the Southwest, $3,000 is tops for a rust-free primo straight
bus with lots of bells and whistles.  Supply and demand, you know.  In other
parts of the land, where rust takes higher casualties, you might pay more
for a bus in said condition.  But remember, it's 20 years old, it's not
sexy, it's not fast, it's not an investment, it has an engine that requires
lots of owner involvement (not a bad thing, but uninteresting to lots of
folks) and if you walk, there's probably not a long line of other takers at
$3,000.

Look for rust, and if none, and everything else is good, offer $2,200 and be
willing to give $2,500.  If you're not in a hurry, spend some time scanning
ebay and the classifieds just to get a feel for the market.

Good luck,

Grant
