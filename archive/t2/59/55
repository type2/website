Patrick:
Duh? Bus boys doesn't know it the engines are the same width?
I assure you, they are. (I've got one on my 80 Vanagon.)
This is really a situation where you need to search the archives. There are
several parts you need to change, the ducts going into and out of the heater
boxes, the alternator bracket, the corresponding hanger for the left side, the
lower front engine tin on both sides and the underside tin on both sides. I
recall a good post from Karl (aufever) listing all the parts. I'd try to get
them used from a list vendor.
