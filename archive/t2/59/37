Subject: Sierra Nevada advice, pls.

Pls excuse this off-subject, but the co-owner of my
bus is driving from Sonoma to Salt Lake City, this
weekend. (the bus is safe in SLC, whew!).

Looks like snow in the Truckee/Reno area. I know
several list members are familiar with that
troublesome moutain stretch.

Any advice for getting through or around?

Again, sorry about the off subject question.
