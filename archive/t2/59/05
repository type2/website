Subject: Re: [T2] My first Bus Depot order

Paul & List,
I, too made my first Depot order a week ago, 4 fold-down cup holders.
 Though considerably smaller, my order arrived within 3 days, much better
than7-10 days, I'd say.  I'm quite pleased, and I foresee spending more
of my dead presidents with Bus Depot.

So far I have had exemplary service from Aircooled.net, Old Volks, and
Bus Depot.  Again, more of my cash will definitely be flowing in those
directions.  As soon as I have need to, I'll be tapping BustedBUS for
duty as well.  Support the listees, I say.

BTW Ron, these cupholders are waaaayyy better than any of those RV Made
In ??? caca holders.  A friend is making me a new center console, which
will incorporate these new cupholders recessed into the face, I'll be
sure to post pics online.

Later,
