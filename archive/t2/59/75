Richard
isnt the speedo marked in both mph and km? Just looked at my 77 US spec and
its marked in both? Also looked at my 69 and 72 Can spec buses didnt see a
whole lot of dif in the brake warning lights. I know in the reverse
situation when I imported my US spec chev astro to Canada, the only thing I
had to change was to add DRL's. The speedo was already marked in both. If
you've got a knit picker, do what some have sugested and junkyard a light
and speedo.
