Hey gang,

My bus has been needing some company of other air-cooled vehicles for a while 
now.  She had to leave all her friends back in Colorado when I moved and it's 
been a slow process of meeting new kids out here.  I haven't heard of (maybe 
I just missed them) any bus events in San Diego for a while now.  I've been 
thinking of putting together some sort of camping/social event after new 
years.  Anybody who has some ideas on location or events pmail me.
