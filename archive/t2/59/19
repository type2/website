Subject: Re: [T2] mystery e-mails from the list?


I've gotten 2 of these already.  One from that VW restoration shop & one
that came from a Karl I believe.  The subject line was a question I had
asked the type2 list over a year ago!!  I deleted both emails, but keep an
eye out.

happy busing to those who still can (mine are stored until spring),
