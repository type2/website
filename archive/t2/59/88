It will work. The 1700, 1800, and 2 liter engine blocks are identical. There
is absolutely no possibility of the engine being wider or narrower.  This is
common knowledge and I'm sure Bus Boys knows it too. Perhaps you
misunderstood what they were trying to say. The only difference you will run
into with regard to the engine is that the shape of the exhaust ports on the
heads is VERY slightly different between the '72-74 and the '75-78. The
difference is small enough that the 2-liter metal exhaust manifold gasket
will fill in the difference.  Another difference is that the '72-74 setup
does not accept an EGR filter, which was stock in '75-78. Most busses I've
seen have the EGR either disabled or missing anyway. A properly running bus
should pass the emissions test without it. Theoretically, they could fail
you for emissions simply for not having the EGR filter, even if the bus
passes emissions. However, I have never heard of this happening anywhere
except for California. Like I said, most busses I've seen are driving around
without an EGR filter anyway; many bus owners (and inspection stations) do
not even know there ever was supposed to be one to begin with! Finally, you
will find some minor differences in the way the engine tin fits and the
shape of the tubes to the heater blower. It is not difficult to fabricate
something to take care of this, or you can pick up the "correct" little bits
off of a '72-74 bus in a junkyard.

Why do this?  To recap, many of the '75-78 exhaust and heat exchanger
related parts are no longer available. Converting your '75-78 heat exchanger
and exhaust to a '72-74 setup does away with ALL of the unavailable parts,
meaning that after you do the conversion, you will be able to use off the
shelf parts that are both much cheaper and readily available. In the long
run this will save you a ton of money and a lot of hassle.

Simply put, nobody else can offer you what I can. From me you will get a
German left heat exchanger, a Danish right one, and a Stainless Steel bodied
muffler.  From anyone else you will pay MORE money, the left heater box will
NOT be German, and the muffler will NOT be stainless.

Since there has been a renewed demand for this conversion due to the
upcoming cold weather (people are thinking about heat exchangers), I think
maybe I should put together a complete kit for the conversion, at a
discounted "package price."  This way you will only have to order one part
number. I'll post it later today as a separate email once I work it out.

Right now we're shipping ahead of schedule. While we always say to allow
7-10 working days for delivery, most orders are getting there sooner than
that. You're only one state away; you should have the system by the middle
of next week if you order within a day or so.
