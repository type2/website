We now have Gift Certificates - part number GIFT CERT .

You can have a gift certificate mailed directly to a gift recipient by
putting their name/address in the "ship to" address. Order in multiples of
$10 - i.e. order a quantity of  2 if you want one $20 gift certificate.  If
you want, say, two separate $10 gift certificates rather than one $20 one,
order each gift certificate on a separate line (put it in your shopping cart
twice).   Listmember discounts do not apply to the gift certificate itself,
but when you redeem the gift certificate the appropriate listmember discount
will apply to the items that you order with it (if you are a listmember).  A
gift certificate can be partially redeemed; any balance will be applied as
an in-store credit.
