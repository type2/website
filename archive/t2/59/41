You wont find non-bus seats that will slip into the tracks on a 72.

You could possibly take a seat, any seat, and add a bracket and matching
tracks to it, OR you could weld an appropriate mounting system to the bus
for your new seat.

Be warned that seat selection should be done carefully, to fit you, the
driver, as well as the bus.  You could end up to high, or unable to
recline the seat, or unable to back away from the wheel far enough...

Me, I'd spend..oh..50 bucks if i recall? On an aftermarket seat heater and
add that to the existing seat.  I dont recall if it was 50 bucks for the
pair, or 50 each, last time I bought some...they were not for me.  Most
any aftermarket auto-accessory shop should be able to order these, or you
can have them installed by a professional auto upolstery shop.


But then, I LIKE bus seats. (when they are covered and padded properly,
with good springs.)
