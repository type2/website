Subject: Bus interior walls

Well folks I finally did it ...pulled the entire (minus driver/pass 
seats) interior of the bus out. Well not exactly what I expected. But I 
was only discouraged for about 30 mins. I am now left with a completely 
empty bus. I even took most of the white speckled vinyl type material 
that was glued onto the posts and around the windows . I was wondering 
what I will replace this with. I really do NOT want to consider putting 
this ugly stuff back and I was hoping the list could give me a few ideas 
as to what some of you have done or seen in the past. I will consider 
anything if it means I don't have to go with the stock option. I am 
wondering if there are materials I don't want to have in my bus for some 
reason and maybe some of you guys can help me here as well. Well thanks 
for the advice

P.S. - A Special message to anyone on Long Island or in NYC .I have two 
parts busses that I will be moving out of my shop .. so e-mail me with 
any needs you may have and I'll be glad to set the stuff aside for you.
