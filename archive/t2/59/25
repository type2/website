i read the digest so i usually get in later on the conversations...

my first bus, with a rebuild from strictly foreign in Oregon, was named
blue - cause it was blue... i know it's not very original... i bought it and
put a new engine in and redid the brakes, clutch, and suspension for a trip
across the states... had to sell it when i got back to pay for the trip...

my second, which i bought from a friend (the same one who i drove cross
country with - eric - and who got hooked on campers with me... he's on his
6th, i'm on my 5th, but more on that later) was named the great pumpkin - i
got it around halloween and drove my IM soccer team around town in it in
college and even though the name is silly it stuck...

well the pumpkin switched engines with another bus, that was named
"further"... i fell asleep at my friend's going away party and they decided,
while i was asleep, to get out all the left over paints and paint the bus...
among the many designs (i painted over the "if this bus is a rockin" part...
sheesh) was the backwards "further" across the top... apparently one of my
friends had just finished reading keasey...

fourth bus had no name as i had it for only a very short while...

now i'm on my fifth and it just received a name, though it hasn't been on
the road yet... i've completely rebuilt the engine and have been working on
tracking down an oil leak before i drive it extensively... this rebuild has
taken around 6 months though, and has been on the top of my mind quite a
bit... so i have a dream one night that i am driving across country again,
with my friend eric, and he turns to me and says "lucy's running nice"... i
assumed, when i woke up, that dream-eric was refering to the bus so... she
now has a name...

just my addition to the story
