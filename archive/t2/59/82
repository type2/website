Joshua,

Well don't know if you've been able to confirm if the pedal was the problem 
or not but I thought I'd pass on the solution I came up with when I first 
got "Janis" 18yrs ago.  The pedal actually became unmounted to the body 
because of rust, I still have swiss cheese floor.  But what I did was bolted 
the pedal to a huge gate hinge! Haven't had a problem with it since;>)

Good luck, perhaps a little greased lightning?
