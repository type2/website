Fans are out of a 74 Canadian Deluxe Westy....covers are the Lime Green from
that year, but can be repainted to suite your interior easily...or use your
existing covers, and drill a 1/2" hole for the wire and grommet using this
cover as a template...have seen these go for over $200 on ebay...they're
pretty rare to find in working order...

Also have an original 74 air pump and piping for the exhaust air blow system
in mint condition if anyone is looking for one to score those extra points at
shows...make me an offer, they could be yours...
