Does sound like a super idea. If you're really worried 
some #$(-at-)&!& will rip it off you could just pull it off 
and throw it inside when you park. 
I'd tend to agree with other listees that this wouldn't 
be a high priority item for you average thief, though 
you never can tell with #$(-at-)&!&'s. (A #$(-at-)&!& slashed the 
$1300 top on a friend's Honda S2000 to grab maybe $10-15 
worth of CD's)
