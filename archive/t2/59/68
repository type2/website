Help!

I recently replaced my windshield on my 71 bus.  I welded the usual rusted-out area at the lower edge of the windshield, then put in a brand new windshield with a brand new seal.  This evening, after about 1 hour of light rain, I went out to my bus and, to my horror, discovered about 1/4" of water pooled on the dash board along the bottom edge of the windshield.  Some details: The bus is parked on an inclined driveway, front facing downhill, rear wheels about a foot higher than the front wheels.  
I fumbled around in the dark looking for an obvious leak, but couldn't find one.  Anybody have any ideas??  I put too much tender loving care into putting in this new windshield to have a %$#(-at-)(-at-)%^% leak!!

Thanks!
