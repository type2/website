Hello All  3M has a windshield sealant that comes with a needle to inject it 
under the gasket. I have been using this stuff for years to seal rabbits and 
golfs which had problems leaking onto the fuse box and relays. Works better 
than anything I have tried.   Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va.
