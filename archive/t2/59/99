all of mine have gone more than that.

the original set on my current 78 2L got to 214,000 before being replaced
(without dropping a valve), dropped a seat on a replacement but I lucked
out and it did no damage (my spare engine, unknown mileage, but lots it
was obvious)

the set I have now had Diesel seats put in and an interference put in to
physically keep em from coming out.
