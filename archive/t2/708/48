Subject: Dash needed...

Hey guys,

    Does anyone have an unmolested dashboard they would like to sell? I don't
know if they're different throughout the years, but mine is a 73. I don't need
anything but just the actual dash itself. (well the metal dash frame with the
dash pad glued to it! heh).


Thanks!

Todd
