Kevin,

The best way to paint the poptops is to use marine gel coat. When you 
see one that is shiny and stark white, that's probably because it was 
refinished with gel coat, which is made for fiberglass.

There is a lot about painting poptops in the archives. Do a search, and 
you will have lots of opinions to consider.
