Richard asked:


 I need to pick up some valve lapping compound next week. What grit is
appropriate for this job?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Clover brand comes in a nice 2 can attached bottom-to-bottom coarse on one end and fine on the other. Start
with coarse, finish with fine.
