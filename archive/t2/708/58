Not true.  I won't bore you with defining
trademark and copyright.  For our purposes,
let's call it intellectual property.  There is no
"non-profit" exception.  There are "fair use"
 exceptions, none of which I believe apply here.
 
However, it is true that you are much more likely
to attract the attention of the interest holder
if you are making a money of the potential
infringement.

Disney has ALWAYS been aggressive, but they are
more friendly to their customers in enforcing
their rights.  I knew a guy with 7 dwarves
painted on the side of his green deluxe camper. 
He got a cease and desist letter but also got
some sort of free license to continue with the
dwarves on the bus so long as he didn't add
anything too the mural and painted over it if he
ever repainted.  I think they also wanted the
name of who did the work for him. 

The guy didn't know how Disney came to know that
he had the bus painted.  This was in the early
80s and he was driving the bus around West
Virginia, not Orlando or Southern Cali.

I disagree wholeheartedly.  If that were true, we
could copy Disney movies at will and pass them
out  for free to everyone we knew.
