Subject: Square pots

Help!! I am in need of some of the connectors for the heat exchangers for a
square port head. What I need are the connector pipes for the later heat
exchangers..the part that actually bolts to the head and has a flange that
bolts to the curved pipe, which in turn connects to the heat exchangers. Make
sense? I don't need the heat exchangers or the curved pipe, just the 2
connecting pipes that mate to the heads.

My engine is a bit of a hodgepodge..it's a 1700 case bored out to a 2 litre
with Vanagon heads. I was given some good, original heat exchangers (the later
kind with the bent tube type setup) without the connecting tubes. I figured no
big deal I would just rob them off of my crummy heat exchangers. But!! I found
out today that my heat exchangers have the OVAL connectors which are wrong.
All this time I have been driving with an exhaust leak probably. I never
noticed it really, but I have to think that the mismatch would cause an
exhaust leak.

Anyway if anyone has some of these they would part with, especially on some
bad exchangers, I could really use them. They are found on the 79 bus or the
aircooled Vanagon. I have PayPal. Thanks for any leads!!
