I would have to concur with this. I LOVE it in hidden places, but
seems too thick to do it on outside panels. Except for maybe certain
places, like the rain gutter,and around the windows. I'm gonna be
applying the heck out of it their. If need be, I'll just sand,
re-apply, sand,  etc, etc, etc, until it comes out nice and smooth.

It tends to be difucult to get an even thickness. And it gets little
grains in it when I've used. Prolly' just dust. But still a PITA. But
if your not going for a showroom quality paint job, if your gonna
spray can it, or brush on latex or something like that then by all
means use POR 15. Or if you think you CAN get it smooth enough, just
go with straight POR15. it's glossy, and durable. Should be a snap to
keep clean. Lol
