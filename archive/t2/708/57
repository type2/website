Subject: Re: [T2] Engine alternative in '71 bus?

Craig,
I run a 1904cc with 40 mm dual Dellortos.  Gas mileage is around 21 mpg 
but the torque makes it pull like a mountain goat ;0)  I had it built 
because I commute 110 mile in my hightop. I cross the Blue Ridge 
mountains daily.  When I got my Double Cab a few months ago, it was 
quite the adjustment driving a 1600!


Joy thru air,
