Subject: Which would you choose?

Hi volks,

This season I need tires for sure so which would you choose? I am not
concerned with the cost, I just want to best tire for my '77 Westy.



Michelin Agillis 185R/14C

or

Yokohama Y356 185R/14D



Personal experiences welcome heck any advice welcome. Sorry for the
"another tire" tread but I wanted the most current advice from folks
driving on these tires now.



Thanks,

Meg
