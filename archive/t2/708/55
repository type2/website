IANAL, but IMHO if you a) don't publish the images, b) don't
make money with the bus (such as lending it away for shows or
events), and c) don't try to impersonate anyone ("I'm from
Disney, give me money" :-), then Disney don't have a say in 
the matter.  At least that's how it'd be here in Germany.

Airhowlingly yours,
