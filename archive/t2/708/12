Subject: RE: [T2] Auto body/rust Q (long)

Mark,

in stripping my bus last fall prior to paint, I used no chemicals.  the 3m
epoxy-impregnated scotch-brite-type wheels wore out too fast for me--not
sure about the product you are describing.  I had 5 layers of rustoleum and
other enamels and latexes over the factory paint--this bus was a deadhead
tour-weary warhorse.

Ideally I would have had my bus sandblasted--but this was impossible for me,
especially since I had no intentions of taking it completely apart.

What worked the best for me was a heavy-duty radial (not axial) wire wheel
($18) on an angle grinder.  makes a lot of noise at 10k rpm (my neighbors
weren't happy) but much more powerful stripping action and leverage than any
drill.  Safety goggles a 100% requirement, I had a friend give up on his bus
due to getting a wire wheel shard in his eye.

Took about 30 man-hours with that mean tool to get the bus 60% stripped
(westy-no roof).  this paint was extra thick and muddy even.

On the subject of priming, I am NOT a fan of POR-15 for surfaces that will
be getting a pro topcoat (after painting a friend's bus entirely with it),
among other reasons topcoat supposedly doesn't stick well if you let it set
too long.  It is very good for undercoating and floor pans.  I would like to
reiterate that the products I describe below are formulated to bond well as
a layering system, whereas POR is more of a one coat product.  I realize
others may have other opinions or better experiences with POR-15, I don't
intend to start a flame war.

If you have access to a spray gun and air compressor, including organic
vapor rated mask and proper line moisture filter (took me a while to set
that up):

the pro recommendation I would like to pass along is PPG DP40LF lead-free
Epoxy Sealer Primer.  Comes in gray I know for sure.  with hardener it is
around $60 a quart which should do your roof with plenty to spare.  need pro
mixing cup to get measured accurately, make sure you have enough pressure at
the spray gun so it atomizes properly otherwise it can pebble. likewise if
it is too warm out.  make sure the epoxy is adequately cured before
topcoating or sanding.

I have used a zinc-chromate etching primer (Dupont Variprime) as a bare
metal primer but prefer the epoxy for 2 reasons:  the variprime is not a
sealer--can still rust through if not topcoated--and the variprime lifts the
edges of any surrounding remaining paint.

on top of the DP40LF I used a PPG filler primer (K36) before wet sanding
because the epoxy doesn't sand well.  depending on the finish desired this
may not be necessary. $50/qt.

I topcoated with PPG Delstar acrylic enamel (3-part, base+reducer+hardener)
with excellent results except for some preventable overspray and defects due
to dusty driveway work site and the time limitations of my prep work.
Before all of this, it helped to borrow a "how-to" video on how to do auto
prep and paint.  all these paints can be purchased at your local auto-body
jobber.  Pmail me if you have any questions.

best regards and good luck,
