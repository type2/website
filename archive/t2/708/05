Subject: RE: [T2] 30/31Pict on a 1600DP?

Hi Arnaud and Volks,
 
"18-19 mpg with 1600dp, 30/31, 009, non working heat riser tube."

I am getting basically the same thing, with a working heat riser tube and same setup.

"I thought you could use the same SVDA with a 30/31 and a 34 ? If not how big is the difference ?"

On aircooled.net's site when you select 30/31 Brosol when looking at the ACN SVDA Distributor it says 
"This does not work on the 30 PICT-1 and 30 PICT-2."
I assume that means that the SVDA distributor can not be used with a 30/31 carb. 
 
Anyone have better insight?

Thanks,
 
Max Bronsema
