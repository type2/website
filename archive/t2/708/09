Thanks for contributing the detailed analysis, but I beg to differ: if the
riser tubes are not clogged, the exhaust flow itself is not symmetric or
even static.  it comes in pulses.  there will still be flow and heat
exchange through a  symmetric riser tube.  maybe not as much. . . more
important for the tubes not to be clogged!
