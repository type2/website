Don't paint it, use Penetrol instead.

I got this tip from someone on the list a year or two ago. I don't 
remember who posted it, but it was very helpful. Get any crud off the 
top, and then wash it down with a solution of bleach and water. Rinse 
it and let it dry. Then wipe on some Penetrol, which gets absorbed into 
the fiberglass. Very easy to do, and it lasts for quite a while. Makes 
the top fairly resistant to stains, but maintains the original look. I 
do it once in the spring and once in the fall.

It works very nicely. I think it looks better than a painted top.
