I would like the following silly little EMPI label on
my dash board.  View it and smile.

It says something like....Caution, do not open windows
above 120 MPH...   I don't have the facts, but for my
bus, which is akin to a loaf of bread plowing down the
freeways, would not achieve 120 MPH if driven off the
cliffs into the grand canyon.  :-O
