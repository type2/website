Subject: KONI Shock Group Buy - They're In!

Just a quick note that the rest of the Koni shocks from the Group Buy have
arrived at The Bus Depot! 

We will be working on getting all of them out the door early to middle of
next week.  If you were part of the group buy, please expect your credit
card to be charged for the balance due within the next few days.

Also, for those who missed out on the buy, I should have some extras
(although the price will be slightly higher price than those who got in on
the deal).  I'll post some info on this after all of the spoken-for ones
have gone out the door and I see what's left.
