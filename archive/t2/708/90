Subject: EGR valve

Hi there!

Spring is about to arrive in Montreal, Canada. This means, I'm about to move
down to San Diego. In an effort to prepare my 77 bus for the trip, I start
checking everything up and I found out that my EGR valve
(http://home.att.net/~giffk/egrv.htm) was completely clogged. So I cleaned
everything up, to find afterward that it got corroded with time and I suspect
that it might create a vacuum leak. My question is the following: is it
possible to find on of those. Does anyone of you have one to spare (of course
I'll pay for it)?

Thanks a lot group

Anton
