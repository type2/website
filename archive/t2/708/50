Subject: Copyright issues?

     I am thinking of trying to do a Disney themed paint job on a bus.  It 
would feature some of the Disney characters, which I was hoping to have hand 
painted by an artist friend.  I was wondering if anyone knew if this would 
infringe on Disney's copyright.  If so, how could we go about getting 
permission from Disney to use these images?  Is there such a thing as a 
copyright department?  Is that even possible with such a large company, 
getting permissions to use images on old car?
     The alternative is to use vinyl decals from an online store, which we 
would rather not do.
