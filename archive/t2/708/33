Subject: Friday Funny - Blond Joke

A blond brings her bus to the local mechanic because it's sputtering and
running poorly. The mechanic tinkers with it for about ten minutes, then
tells her it's fixed. "Nothing major," he reports, "just crap in the
carburetor."  The blond furrows her brow for a moment and says, "how often
do I have to do that?"

With apologies... ;-)
