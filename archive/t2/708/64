Subject: Copyright Issues

 I am thinking of trying to do a Disney themed paint job on a bus.  It
would feature some of the Disney characters, which I was hoping to have hand
painted by an artist friend.  I was wondering if anyone knew if this would
infringe on Disney's copyright.

It almost surely falls under "fair use" but it never hurts to get a letter
from
them granting permission before the fact.

images?

Send a letter to their Permissions Department

>Is there such a thing as a copyright department?

Yes, Disney absolutely does have a copyright and permissions dept.

>Is that even possible with such a large company, getting permissions to use
images on old car?

It's probably as easy as getting someone to pull up Linoleum from the 40s.
Probably end up doing it
yourself and don't tell a soul.
