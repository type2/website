I had 16 wheels, a Beetle gas tank, 1.5 sets of engine tin, a propane tank, and some little items blasted for about $50. Get yor price up front.

Check the yellow pages for a monument company (makes headstones). I would not let them blast body panels (too much pressure) but items like I listed above were fine.
