Document everything you do to your bus that is not 100% stock. If you 
change from hydraulics to solids, or from solids to hydraulics, 
document it. If you install an aftermarket alternator, document it. If 
you go out to the hardware store for nuts and bolts to replace rusted 
ones somewhere, document it.

Everyone who reads this message has access to a computer, so there is 
no excuse.

The simplest way to organize the documentations by date:

3/12/05: Cut massive hole in side of bus, installed woodstove

3/14/05: Added Koni shocks

And so on. If you sell your bus, provide a print out of this file, as 
well as a CD of a text file (the latter will be searchable).

It's the smart thing to do, and it increases the value of a non-stock 
bus.
