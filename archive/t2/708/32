Subject: Friday post -- busses in movies

I rarely post to the list, but since It's Friday, I figured what the hell.

As Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, one of my heroes, fatally shot himself in the
head recently, I became somewhat glum over the last several weeks.   Anyway,
In an attempt to displace my funk, I rented the two films that make an
attempt to depict his antics: Where the Buffalo Roam, starring Bill Murray
as HST, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, starring Johnny Depp as Hunter.

In both films there is at least one or two busses driving around -- I didn't
keep count.   At least one splitty and a couple of bays.   I highly
recommend either film for anyone who would like to see the busses or maybe
catch a glimpse of the Dr. who had a true genius for living life.
