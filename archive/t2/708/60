Subject: how do I get mold off the inside of the pop-top roof?

Hello all - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon Westfalia.  Thanks largely to information from this group, she is mechanically nearly perfect (only problem is it takes about 15 seconds of cranking to start the engine when the air temp is below 50 degrees)
 
Anyway, I'm moving on to the interior.  There are spots of mold, quite a few, on the inside of the pop-top.  I would like to remove them, and I'm nervous about bleach, because I don't want to have a bunch of white spots on the roof.
 
Any suggestiong from the sages out there?
 
Thanks - 
 
Marc
