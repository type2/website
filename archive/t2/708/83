Subject: Re: [T2] more on Square ports

Ok I think I have it now for the most part. Thanks Karl!!

Karl said  "If you want square port flanges and blower fan inputs, YOU NEED 
79 49-STATE HEATER BOXES!"

It appears that in the pics these 79 only heat exchangers/exhaust have 
round, not oval, blower fan inputs and I would need the entire heat 
exchanger setup, including the stove pipes to the engine tin. I know that 
this comes up on the list frequently, but I didn't analyze it as much 
because I didn't realize I myself had this problem. I do remember that most 
suggest scrapping the 79 only exhaust system. I will reread the archives on 
this subject but I think I will have to go another route.

I guess I have 4 choices:

1) Find an entire heat exchanger setup from a 79 in good condition (not 
likely).

2) Use Vanagon heat exchangers and eliminate my blower motor (not good) Is 
there a way to route the vanagon exchangers to my blower motor? I have 
access to the exchangers/muffler but I am guessing I would have to fabricate 
a fix to use my stock blower motor.

3) Swap my good square port heads for some oval port heads (best I guess as 
I already have the oval exchangers in good condition.

4) Bolt the oval exchangers to the square port heads (poor decision)

Does anyone have a good set of oval port heads they would sell or swap? The 
heads I have are good. One may be rebuilt the other is a good used one that 
works fine.

It's never easy!!

Thanks for all the help,
