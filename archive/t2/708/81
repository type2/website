Subject: Re: [T2] more on Square ports

My question is this....the schematic doesn't make a notation whether the pic
 is for a 79 setup or for the 75-78 setup. How much different physically is
the exhaust system on the 79? Are there major differences aside from the
 square port connections?What I am getting at here is whether I can take the
#34 connectors from a 79 exhaust and simply bolt them to my heat exchangers?
The exchangers have 3 major components (refer to the microfiche link) which
 are #34 (the part I am looking for), the exchanger #11 and lastly the u
shaped connector #35. I have the exchanger and u shaped pipe. What I want to
do is replace the oval port connector #34 with a set of the square port
connectors. Would it be a direct swap or are there more physical differences
 that would keep me from doing this? I am hoping there are some 79 experts
 who have done this before out there. I really need to get my bus up and
 running again and I really don't want to bolt those oval connections to my
 square ports again.

#34 ARE 75-78 ONLY. #34 ARE 75-78 ONLY. #34 ARE 75-78 ONLY.

Now with that in mind, 79 heater boxes ARE ONE YEAR ONLY.

Go back to http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t202410.gif and envision
#10 AS LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE SQUARE FLANGES that are on 34A.

If you want square port flanges and blower fan inputs, YOU NEED 79 49-STATE HEATER BOXES!.

In the web pic, ALL THE PIECES FROM #34A DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE ARE 79 CALIFORNIA LEFT SIDE.

Here is a drawing of 79 Calif:

Here is a drawing of 79 Fed:

Do not look too close at the drawing of the flange gaskets, the part numbers are correct but the artist needs
a better pic to make drawings from:)

Here is Vanagon:
Cal: http://www.bus-boys.com/oemstockvanagon.html
Fed: http://www.bus-boys.com/oemstockvanagon-fed.html#F2

The Vanagon system is wider than a bay. Yes they both have fresh air input, but on the rear ends. Like the
left one on 79 Cal.
