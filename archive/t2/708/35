Subject: Friday Topic: Dashboard art

Over the years, this is what I have accumulated and added to Lurch's 
"Mojo" (somewhat in order of appearance).

holed cylinder
hair thingie (looks like a chopstick)
macrame bracelet
vintage Pepsi bottle opener (I use that a lot)
champagne cork from when Surge turned 200,000 miles
champagne cork from when Lurch turned 300,000 miles
deer antler
dash plaques from a coupla VW shows
2nd place award from one of those VW shows
Mister Bubblehead (BOTBR door prize)
little plastic mud shark (for my mythology - also my traveling 
companion)
coupla turkey feathers
hackey sack
fibula, probably from a dog
plastic Buddha
plastic Jesus
Gumby
air horn (bicycle variety)

hanging from my rearview I have a heart-shaped crystal and a trinket 
from the Mexican Day of the Dead (it's a skull attached BWO a noose)

There's prolly more, but I am begging for a disaster if I get 
rear-ended, no?
