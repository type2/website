Subject: 1974 Westy up for sale

It is with deep regret that I put my 74 Westy up for sale. It has had 
the doglegs, sills, door track , lower rear quarter panels, rear 
corners, rear jack points and that cross piecebetween the rear corners 
replaced. It has  a new orange paint job on the body and the top was 
painted gloss white. This work was done by a reputable body shop using 
panels from our friends at Bus Depot. The axle beam was replaced with a 
used unit  a few years agoand the battery box was replaced as well. It 
comes with a BN-4 heater, I have never dared hook it up though , as well 
as new canvas for the pop-up. The old canvas is so gone i ripped the 
shreds out. I will also include my collection of tech manuals, Bentleys, 
Clymers, Chiltons and Motors Manual and a copy of the BN-4 manual. I am 
getting into making wooden ship models and need to set up my shop so the 
Gr8pumpkin is in the way. I am asking $4,000.00. The vehicle is located 
in the Augusta, Maine area any interested party contact me off list. It 
does run, but leaks oil onto the head I think so the engine compartment 
gets smoke up in a hurry. The standard VW heating system needs alot of 
work. I do have heater control boxes, new ferrom B.D. I haven't 
installed as well as passenger door seal. Please somebody, give him a 
good home.
