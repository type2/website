Subject: Re: [T2] buy across the border

Hi Patrick,

It's not difficult, it just takes some planning.

1. Don't even think about bringing back a vehicle without a title. If 
the seller can't produce a title just walk away.
2. You must send importation paperwork along with a copy of the 
ownership to the border crossing no less than 72 hours before you cross 
the border.
3. You must pay the import duty at the time of crossing. This includes 
air conditioning tax if the vehicle has AC.
4. You must cross the border during business hours.

Our family has imported or assisted in the import of 5 buses; it isn't 
hard to do.

Happy trails,
