When it's done, I will double-coat the entire roof in POR-15 before priming and painting.


Hi Mark,

I've used POR15 very successfully in places hidden from view, however 
I've had questionable results using it to touch up body panels. I 
thought I would try it on small rust spots on the side panels. When I 
first brushed the POR15 on, it looked like a thin coat that would work 
great. But as it drys it seems to either (1)expand slightly or (2)flow 
downhill or (3)both, because at the end it had built up slightly into a 
noticeable dimple. Now you are doing an entire panel so if it expands 
uniformly, you should be ok but if it doesn't and drys into high and low 
spots it would probably be very difficult to sand.

Another problem I had with it is that it is a 3 step process and the 
POR15 itself is preceeded by a cleaner and an etching solution. I'm not 
sure which of these preliminary steps was the culprit but when I applied 
it over the spot that I was working on it flowed downward and streaked 
the paint below it. I tried to keep this lower area rinsed with water as 
I was applying the chemicals but it streaked anyway - and I haven't yet 
been able to remove the streaks. (My paint is original and definitely on 
the thin side so that could be part of the problem). Since you are doing 
the roof it might be difficult to keep these preliminary chemicals from 
affecting the lower areas of your bus.

I think POR15 is great stuff for floor panels, gas tanks, etc but I'm 
not so sure if it is the best product for body work. Maybe my technique 
was not so good and I've been meaning to ask the list if there have been 
good/bad experiences using POR15 on exterior bodywork.
