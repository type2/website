Subject: Re: [T2] more on Square ports

Ok from reading a bit in the archives I have deduced one thing, but still 
have some questions.

It appears that some people questioned whether you can use oval exchangers 
on square port heads. The answer is yes. Although I was ignorant of it, my 
bus had this setup when I got it and I have been running them for more than 
a year now. I never noticed an exhaust leak, but that doesn't mean there 
wasn't one. The exchangers bolted right up no problem.

My question is this....the schematic doesn't make a notation whether the pic 
is for a 79 setup or for the 75-78 setup. How much different physically is 
the exhaust system on the 79? Are there major differences aside from the 
square port connections?What I am getting at here is whether I can take the 
#34 connectors from a 79 exhaust and simply bolt them to my heat exchangers? 
The exchangers have 3 major components (refer to the microfiche link) which 
are #34 (the part I am looking for), the exchanger #11 and lastly the u 
shaped connector #35. I have the exchanger and u shaped pipe. What I want to 
do is replace the oval port connector #34 with a set of the square port 
connectors. Would it be a direct swap or are there more physical differences 
that would keep me from doing this? I am hoping there are some 79 experts 
who have done this before out there. I really need to get my bus up and 
running again and I really don't want to bolt those oval connections to my 
square ports again.

I appreciate all the help!!
