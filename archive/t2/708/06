Subject: Friday Topic: Dashboard art

When you live and travel in the northern part of California, you start 
to see a common theme--many VW busses sport an arrangement of dried 
flowers and herbs on their dashboards. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's 
rosemary to invoke the goddess of victory and sage to cast out the evil 
spirit of a bad oil leak wafting up through the heating ducts.

What's on your dash? Me, I've got an orange rubber squid, a tiny metal 
license plate stamped "Phil" and the Jackie Chan fortune telling 
device. The latter is essential equipment for long trips.

If you send me a picture of your dash via email (OFF-LIST PLEASE!) I'll 
post it on my blog this weekend. ( www.deadbus.org )

Happy bussing.
