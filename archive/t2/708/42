Subject: Need BN-2 fuel pump (or repair)

I never did get around to installing the BN-2 in my bus.  Today I 
thought I would bench test it.  I've had it for 6 months and I finally 
got around to getting a glow plug for it 3 months ago.  Maybe I'll have 
it in my bus for next cold season (I don't know what to call winter in 
Tennessee).  I had everything hooked up according to wiring diagrams, 
but the fuel pump does not seem to want to go (I tested 12 volts across 
it).  I tried priming it, but still no go.  It has points in it and it 
looks like there's some mechanism in there that's supposed to 
oscillate.  Can anyone help me?

Please cross-post this for me as I realize the BN-2 is not a Type 2 
heater.
