Subject: Re: [T2] more on Square ports

Hi Rob,

Option #5 would be to salvage a set of rusted out square port heater 
boxes (79-83) and have a muffler shop cut and weld the square-port 
flanges to your existing heater box. This would be cheaper than finding 
a 1-year only heater box, but success depends on finding a competent 
and sympathetic muffler shop capable of doing the work for you.

If you do go this way I would strongly advise you to be sure that the 
muffler and crossover pipe are properly anchored to the alternator 
bracket to help carry the weight of the exhaust. You don't want to put 
all that weight on the welds and exhaust studs if you can help it.

Happy trails,
