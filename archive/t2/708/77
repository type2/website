When listees recommend a search of the archives as an answer to a 
question, it is not simply because we want to "save bandwidth" or 
because we look their noses down at newbies.

Usually, it is because the definitive answer is usually in the 
archives, somewhere.

For instance, Karl has written extensive on such topics as:

1. The differences between child cots

2. How to install the Hall sender equipment into all busses

3. How to swap Vanagon rear brakes into a baywindow bus

4. How to sort out the small vacuum lines for an FI bus engine

5. How to retrofit hydraulic valves into an engine originally fitted 
with solids.

I don't know why Karl's very detailed explanations of these things 
never end up in the library, but it doesn't matter. You can always find 
them in the archives.

Karl is only one example. There are several very knowledgeable people 
who used to write at length about various topics -- John Anderson was 
one -- but who are no longer on the list.

So: the reason to check the archives first is that there's a fair 
chance that you'll get a better answer.
