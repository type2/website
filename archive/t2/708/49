Subject: Rebuild ..... :-(

It looks like after the work I have done I will need to remove my engine again.  I started it up on Thursday  (first time) and it started to "bog" down when giving it gas.  Then I noticed oil leaking inbetween the heat exchanger and exhaust.  I checked push rod tubes and cylinder heads and all were dry.  So at the least,  it looks like a head job is required, but I'm thinking I might as well do the whole engine.  Does anyone know of a reputable engine rebuilder in the central Texas area.  Or should buy a rebuilt one and play with this one in the garage?  What would you do.
