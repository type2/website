<he said he charged $40 an hour, and that the wheels would probably take an hour each.>

The local powdercoater shop charges $40 an hour - or did the last time I used them. They can powdercoat 16 wheels an hour... However if I want some 1 color and some another color they charge me another hour or half hour (don't remember) for cleanup of the spray line to switch powders (colors). Maybe your sand blaster man is charging for setup, cleanup, and refilling the sand hopper... My powdercoater folks will sand blast for me but at a much higher cost than the monument company. She told me (owner) that they recommend using the monument company that I used b/c it is cheaper and they (the powdercoaters) don't like to sand blast but will in a pinch.

I've done alot of sand blasting over the years and even with a home siphon blaster kit I can do the equivalent work of 2-3 wheels an hour. The times I have had the opportunity to use blasting cabinets or commercial diesel powered compressors (jackhammer compresser trailer) and LARGE sand blasters (continuous blasting) of course I could do much more work - I once blasted my Beetle chassis in less than 40 minutes (as I recall).  

Maybe your guy doesn't really like to sand blast and this makes it worth it... <griN!> 

FWIW I hate to sandblast but love the results. I do it myself when I can't afford to pay someone else to do it. 

Really what it comes down to is - is it worth it to you?
