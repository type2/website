Hi Guys.  Speaking of mold in the pop-top, what are
you guy's opinions of painting the tops?  I see a lot
of them that are painted bright white.  The original
is of course that natural beige or whatever you call
it.  I can park mine under a tree and it's black again
in a couple of weeks.  Hard to keep clean!  I'm
getting ready to paint my bus and I wonder if the top
is going to look out of place on top of a bright,
shiny newish bus.  If one did want to paint it, what
is the best kind to use?  I don't think enamel would
hold up very well on that material. My  bus is all
original except for an engine swap.  

By the way, I've had my bus as a toy sitting under
that tree for almost 5 years.  Due to an idiot
rear-ending my Ford Taurus SHO and the fact that my
other cars are Jaguars, I am using the bus as a daily
driver.  I never dreamed I would enjoy it so much.  It
was a temporary situation until I sell my Jags and get
another car.  Now I'm going to drive it every day.  It
runs great, is dependable, and makes me feel like
Ralph Kramden. If I only had the hat!  Thanks to all
of you for the advice and support.  

Bus on...KR
