Subject: Engine alternative in '71 bus?

I'm looking for a reliable alternative engine for my '71 which I use as a 
work truck, presently running stock with .09 distributor and after market 
exhaust. Primarily, I'd like increased fuel economy and secondarily, a bit 
more power for the hills. Does such an animal exist? Pro's and con's? Cost? 
Please speak from real life experience. After 25 years of VW van loyalty, 
help me not buy a Toyota.
