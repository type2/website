Subject: Kudos to BustedBus

I just got off the phone with Joe at BustedBus.  I had
somewhat of a nebulous request (I couldn't really
explain what I was talking about, but that's another
story.)  Joe took the time to discuss with me
intelligently the shape of the part, the correct
application; we looked at their website simultaneously
and during the conversation it was as if we were
looking at the same part!  He asked all the right
questions so that we could come to a meeting of the
minds.  He responded quickly and professionally and
seems to be an extremely nice guy to boot!  We had a
great conversation.  Customer service like that is
great!  Thanks Joe!  Greg Thompson, Tallahassee, Florida
