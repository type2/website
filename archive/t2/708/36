Thanks all for your input.  I got a lot of feedback between all the list I
subscribe.  All good!    I really think that buying locally is the best
option, given the fact that most who replied indicated that there was
something that required warranty service, which of course involves pulling
the motor, stripping the accessories and sending it back to the builder.
What a pain... Anyway, I'll take all the advice and make a decision!  Thanks
again for great input!

 So far, I think, I would order a 1641cc with
 external oil filter setup, alternator, dual port, deep oil sump, new
clutch,  electronic ignition and header as additional accessories.

I would stay away from using a 1641 in a bus. The thin walled 87mm cylinders
will cause excessive overheating. They are more suited for a bug.

Either keep the original 1600 size or go 1776 which involves machining the
case spigots.

Keep in mind that the 68 to 71 bus engine requires a rear hanger bar that
gets in the way of the oil pump and
new fittings.....   also MAKE sure you get an engine case that has the
hanger bosses machined and threaded for
the hanger bar. It sucks when you try to install a bug engine and you can't
support it!

I believe AVP mainly does typeIV engines?
