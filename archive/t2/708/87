Subject: Sandblasted

I just had two wheels sandblasted for painting. Once they're painted, 
I'll have two more done, and then one more.

I took the wheels to a guy who does glass etching and general 
sandblasting on the side. He charged me $40 a wheel. This strikes me as 
excessive. Should I go shopping for the next two wheels?
