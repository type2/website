Subject: 73 carb issues

I am having carb issues on my 7 formerly fuel injected
bus, it was formerly fuel injected but had weber 34
icts. I decided to replace them with new 34s because
my mechanic said that they are the best carbs to try
and get through smog (not an issue in your situatin)
but also will give the best gas milage, and with
regular already at 2.15 and its not even march Im
worried about the summer. ICTs 429 from the Bus Depot
