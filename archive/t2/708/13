Will,

I sure won't argue with your results. Your bus looks great.

For my roof, I ordered POR-15 plus their entire chemistry set (prep, 
clean, and their primer, which they say bonds with the POR-15). I'm 
going to trust them on this for now. Only the roof is going to get or 
need this treatment, along with right around the headlights. And the 
roof will be under the poptop.

One side of the bus still has shiny original paint, the nose and rear 
end are getting some welding, and the other side of the bus is as yet 
indeterminate. But if you looked at the picture I linked, you know what 
the roof is like. It isn't pretty. And so far the wheel is doing a good 
job. I figure I can go through about a dozen of them before I spend as 
much as the cheapest (and mostly ineffective) sand blasting outfit, and 
I'll have no sand to deal with.

Mark
