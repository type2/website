Subject: Re: opening up heat riser tube

Hi Gary,
You are so right about carbon monoxyde.
I removed the monza muffler yesterday and started to unplug the heat
riser tube with a drill and steel cable from home depot. (manifold in
the car, car lifted).

The carbon is of course right at the middle of the manifold, in the
toughest point to access.It is hell and i need to go get more steel
cable and gloves and maybe a cordED drill but the result will be worth
it, no doubt. Home depot has a nice selection of steel cable...

I'm going to spend the money required to get a stock exhaust. No
useless hacking with a uselessly loud and non-engineered muffler.

Is Dansk the best muffler for 1600 cc ?
