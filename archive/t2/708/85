 Ok I think I have it now for the most part. Thanks Karl!!

 Karl said  "If you want square port flanges and blower fan inputs, YOU NEED
 79 49-STATE HEATER BOXES!"

 It appears that in the pics these 79 only heat exchangers/exhaust have
 round, not oval, blower fan inputs and I would need the entire heat
 exchanger setup, including the stove pipes to the engine tin. I know that
 this comes up on the list frequently, but I didn't analyze it as much
 because I didn't realize I myself had this problem. I do remember that most
 suggest scrapping the 79 only exhaust system. I will reread the archives on
 this subject but I think I will have to go another route.

 I guess I have 4 choices:

 1) Find an entire heat exchanger setup from a 79 in good condition (not  likely).

* Best choice!

 2) Use Vanagon heat exchangers and eliminate my blower motor (not good) Is
 there a way to route the vanagon exchangers to my blower motor? I have
 access to the exchangers/muffler but I am guessing I would have to fabricate
 a fix to use my stock blower motor.

* NOT a good choice what so ever. Unless you live where it is 70-80 degrees all year round [not likely] then
you will have NO heater except via whatever little air the blower motor puts out.
Vanagon heater boxes do NOT have the engine fan blowing thru them. They do not connect to the fan housing like
bay heater boxes. Remember that link I sent of bay boxes?

Look at the inner rear end of each box. See the square channels?  Now look at the Vanagon boxes:

Vanagon fan housings do not have the air channels at the bottom of the housing. look at A here?

Vanagons ONLY use a blower fan at the back of the alternator.

 3) Swap my good square port heads for some oval port heads (best I guess as
 I already have the oval exchangers in good condition.

* unfortunately, this may be your best choice, unless you find 79 Fed exhaust......

 4) Bolt the oval exchangers to the square port heads (poor decision)

 Does anyone have a good set of oval port heads they would sell or swap? The
 heads I have are good. One may be rebuilt the other is a good used one that
 works fine.
