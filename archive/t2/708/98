Subject: Re: [T2] - AIRS List Project - Please Input

Well out of the 24 emails I sent out so far half have come back.

Stan you said you went over the list for Alabama. Cool! How long ago? If
you could PM me that list I would appreciate it greatly. Thanks again.

Anton I am just doing my home state right now. Which by the way I think is
the best way to keep the AIRS list up to date. If one or more depending on
the size of your home state would like once a year email or call everyone on
the list for their state/area we could keep it super clean and up to date. I
will pick up Bama. Like I said if its just once a year that would be better
than piling the whole thing up on one person. Now I am kinda computer
illiterate when it comes to the software for keeping a database so I am not
sure on what it takes to run it but I can email and dail a phone pretty good
then pass that data on to whoever. Anyway just my $.02 worth.
