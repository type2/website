Subject: 76-79 cabinets needed - Philly, Buffalo, VA, MD, GA, NC, OH

I WAS going to philly to get some cabinets from a fella there, but he
bailed on me at the last week ( we made an agreement 1 month ago!).

We are  still coming that way next weekend (18-19-20) because we have a
buyer for the 78 I am selling as well as the extra auto tranny.

We will be going to the Buffalo area at the end of April/1st of May.

The cabinet pieces I am looking for from a 76-79 interior are:

Sink/stove unit (I have sink unit, so I won't need just a sink unit, but,
I will buy a sink/stove)

Dometic fridge with control panel (will take a icebox, however).

Overhead rear cabinet

rear sleeping area cabinet

These will go into my 74 westy.  I am selling it's interior if anyone is
interested


Any leads would be most appreciated.


Mark
