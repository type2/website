 Karl, and anyone else who might have them as I really need them:

 In the schematic I need 34 and 34a on the bottom (later type exchangers).
 These are part of the actual heat exchangers. Sorry for the confusion and
 thanks Karl for the link to Richard's microfiche.

You have a problem!

34A is left manifold for a California 79 engine ONLY.
It has square ports.

34 is the 75-78 oval port manifold. It comes as a left and a right.

IF you have square port AND 49 state heater boxes, then you have #10 heater boxes in left and right flavor
with square ports.

There is NO such thing as a right square port maniold like #34A.

Get a 68-79 Bentley. Go to section 5. Page 15. There is the pics of the exhaust. The whole left side is 75 to
78. On the right are drawings. The top right drawing is 79 49 state. The exhaust pipes are PART of the heater
boxes. The bottom right drawing is 79 Calif. The right heater box is the same as 79 49 state.The left one is
ONE year only, along with the manifold, cat, and crossover pipe.
