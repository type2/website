Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

I picked up a ready heater 55,000 BTU unit the other day. I got it for work
but also to preheat the garage before I do any work..
It would make me nervous to use it if I was in a situation where I had gas
fumes in the air. I did use it today while moving junk around in the Garage.
It works pretty well but my garage is pretty drafty so most of the heat ends
up outside.
