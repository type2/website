Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

From daughter computer- Yes, I know about the hot air poppers- it kinda lets
you stand it on a dash.  noisy though as it puts the heat through a small
area, like a hair dryer.  One difference between heaters is the fan (volume
per time) output varies, and the type of fan influences the noise, as does
the area of the outlet.  Small heaters with 1500 watt output are much
noisier that those with the coils spread out and using a bigger fan- my
favorite is the  squirrel cage fan, they are the quietest and most stable,
as they are flat to the ground- a nice compact one I got from camping world;
it's a ceramic style (don't see glowing coils) and has a good warmth at the
lower (~900 watts) setting.  Warmth I define as the feel on open skin  2
feet away- some of the too high volume fans actually reduce the warmth feel.
Radiant only heaters use red coils or ribbons to warm what the rays actually
hit; I regard these as less safe as they can melt plastic 2 feet away if
constantly aiming at it.
