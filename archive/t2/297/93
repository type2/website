Subject: 1968 Westy For Parts

Hey Folks,
     Sadly, I have had to face the fact that I have neither the time nor the
money to bring this '68 Westy back to life, so I am going to part it out.
Already spoken for: front seats and axle beam, and the mustard yellow cushion
over the engine. The front doors are good, passenger side has some rust at the
bottom. Sliding door in fair shape. Good front bumper but no rear bumper. Fold
out bed with yellow vinyl in great shape, except 6 X 9 speaker holes cut in
the door below the bed. Interior panels shot, but all the odds and ends
(handles, knobs, etc.) still there. Good glass including the windshield. Front
clip in excellent shape around the windshield (one small rust spot), but
rusted badly below the turn signals. I am located in Round Hill, Virginia,
between Leesburg and Winchester. I don't want to get into shipping the larger
items, so if interested you'll have to come and get 'em. Email me with
requests, follow the link below for some pics.
