well because I do a lot of short hops driving around town I generally
top up my batteries about once a week because I don't drive enough
sometimes to charge em up.
  I have semipermantly connected a charger to my batteries (I have twin
batteries)and just plug it in and leave it overnight, in several years of
doing this I have done no apperent damage, I'm either lucky or it doesn't
hurt anything
