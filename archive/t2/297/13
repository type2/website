Subject: Re: [T2] VW Material??

you can find some at any place that sells material if you look hard
enough. i found some at "JoAnn's" not long ago. it was bugs not busses,
but i have yet to find bus material... then again, i dont look very
often. i found that material by just wandering around looking at every
bolt of fabric in the cotton area (as opposed to the fake fur, polyester,
etc). there was this bus at the eureka springs car show the last few
years that had curtains made of white fabric that they just used a vw
emblem stamped all over it... that's an idea. get a bus or vw stamp and
stamp your own things all over it with washable fabric paint. oh, you
could tie dye your scrubs, too, if you havent already...

good luck and let us know if you find any good design fabric!
