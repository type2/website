Check and clean those battery cables - between the cable and body, cable 
and clamps, and clamps and battery. Disassemble all to clean.

Scrape and wire brush until clean.

Also check the plugs on the bottom of the steering column - maybe getting 
ready to fall off. These jack into the switches of the steering column - 
push on/pull off. Possibly the flexing of the steering column mount is 
moving the connections just enough to do the job.

You don't have to take anything apart - at least I didn't have to on my '78.

Oh - and replace your fuel lines while you're at it... Never hurts to do 
that - whatever the job.
