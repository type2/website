Subject: Re: [T2] Portable propane heater report

The Mr. Heater unit has very high ratings on Amazon but it being a 
radiant heater I wasn't sure that it would be OK in the close quarters 
of a bus--that the radiant element might melt something or blister the 
veneer off the Westie table. Is that a concern? Where in your bus do you 
put it?

A lower output alternative is the Coleman Powercat, a reasonably priced 
forced air propane heater. You need D batteries to run the fan--
