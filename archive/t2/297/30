I have run the Portable Buddy, Mr Heater for 2 years.  It does work well in
the bus but you have to open a window to be safe running it overnight.  It
also make condensation all over the inside of the bus, windows all wet in
the am.

This year I went to a Camper Propane furnace and am VERY Happy  :o)  It
vents to the outside so completely safe.  No condensation on the inside of
the bus.  set the thermostat at 80 and it stays 80 all nite. Very good...
Can even use while driving.
