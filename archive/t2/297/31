Subject: The propane heater issue

We recently bought a little propane heater, the round kind where the 
bottle screws in, for our 78 bus.  We also taped off the fresh air vents 
which even tho they were closed, still leaked a huge amount of cold air. 
 The question is:  is it really ok to use propane heaters in the bus? 
 People (especially family members) look at me like we are nuts for 
doing this and are condemning ourselves to a fiery death sometime in the 
near future.  As long as the heater is secure I would think there would 
not be a problem.  Any feedback?  Beth in NJ
