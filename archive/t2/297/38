Subject: Charging the battery

Peace:

On a '78 bay Westy (single battery; no refrig or 12 volt converter), if I am 
going to charge the battery in-situ (sic), 'MUST' I disconnect the battery 
from the system before applying 10 amps charge??  I plan to connect the 
positive charger clamp to the positive battery pole, and the negative 
charger clamp to a ground away from the battery.

What is my possible damage if I do not disconnect my 12 volt battery during 
charging.

Thanks

Barry sends

PS  Regarding the " positive battery pole", I must ask:  Who was Alexander 
Graham Bellinski????
