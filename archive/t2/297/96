Subject: Oil spray Rod modification

Does anyone have some practical suggestions on notching the rods for
more oil spray on a type IV? I have a set of rods that have been
notched, but off center with respect to each other versus the tech
bulletin image. Is this better (i.e., does not weaken the rod)? I want
to do this mod on the better set of rods I have.
