Subject: Phone or web address for Mid Atlantic VW restoration near

Anybody have the web addy or the phone number of Mid Atlantic VW Restorations
in Disputanta, just east of Petersburg, VA?

I drive by there on my way to visit my mom and dad in Chesapeake, and I would
like to contact them and see what their hours might be this holiday season so
I can possibly stop by.

Any leads will be appreciated,

Thanks and Kindest Regards,
