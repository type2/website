By accident, I found a good mini space heater.  The Wearever "popcorn
pumper" hot air popcorn poppers are 1400W, and if you take the clear
plastic widget off the top it blows hot air straight up.  We got a couple
for $5 at the Salvation Army.  We use them to pre-heat and defrost the
cars in the morning.  We've been using them for years and they seem to
be quite durable.
