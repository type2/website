Subject: Re: rod bearings & other diff. in 75 engine

Quoth D. Schwarze: (re mechanic's opinion a 75 engine is more reliable in
the bottom end:)
Oh please.  While it's true that the rod bearings are slightly larger in the
1800, they are not any more "heavy duty" than the ones in the 2-liter.
Think of it this way - the 1800 rod bearings are Lennox Lewis and the 2000
rod bearings are Mike Tyson.
- Jon's point about the 75's reliability goes deeper, ie, he feels the
entire geometry was changed that makes for a less reliable engine in the
2000 cc engine, making it prone to overheating.  The stroke was increased,
ie, so longer rods were used, and his point relates not so much to the size
of the bearings as that they can egg out more from the action of the crank.
Yes, I got 240,000 mi so far on my 78, but I drive with prudence (shift down
rather than drive it floored too long; change the oil, etc), but have heard
enough stories about overheated engines, dropped valves, etc on the later
engines.  75 is unusual in that it was the first to go to fuel injection,
and the last of the more conservative bottom end.   (Not sure what 76 was).
I'm curious to hear from other 75 owners out there- or mare most in the junk
jards now?
