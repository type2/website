Subject: Using  2000 FI stuff in a 1975 1800cc engine

Hi Dr Tim and august list...I posted a question I got no reply to, regarding
putting in a later FI harness, throttle/airbox, AFM, and ECU in a 75 bus,
due to the presumed unreliability of the combination temp sensor/throttle
switch found under the airbox throttle opening in the early 75's.  My
mechanic (who has rebuilt over 2000 vw engines) suggested this, and I have a
7 pin AFM harness and airbox from a junker engine, and a spare ECU from a 77
or 78 bus, and a spare afm from a 77.  Now, what I asked, is regarding the
fact that the latter were designed for 2000 cc engines, and the 75 is a 1800
stock engine......which my mechanic says is a much more reliable engine
(talked about the heavy duty rod bearings compared to the 2000 cc
engines)...and he thinks the 77 afm/ecu will simply note how much air the
smaller engine is drawing and give the correct gas for from the injectors?
What say you?
