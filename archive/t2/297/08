Use Gunk to get off all the heavy stuff. Your paint system will have final 
wash solvents for cleaning off all wax and residues prior to sanding, and 
again prior to painting and between coats. Get a vapor mask for sure or you 
could end up and idiot in a wheelchair. Make sure it has the type of 
elements designed for the volatiles in your paint system.

3M Weather Strip Adhesive Remover or likely the above mentioned solvents 
would work well. Can't use fingernail poish remover because it contains 
suffactants and proteins to feed cuticles. But those too could be washed 
off with the prep-cleaning solvent. Isopropal alcohol in the 98% 
concentration is a good final wash, but I would only use it in low humidity 
conditions.
