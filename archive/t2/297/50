    Great example David, I would add one thing though, Lewis is still rather
low mileage, compared to Tyson's 300,000 mile, "Up hill all the way, pulling
a load, mileage".
    I still wouldn't get in the ring with either one of them for a
$1,000,000.00, would you?

< Think of it this way - the 1800 rod bearings are Lennox Lewis and the 2000
rod bearings <are Mike Tyson.  True, Lewis is tougher than Tyson but Tyson
is still good enough to whup <99.99% of the people on this planet, and
that's "good enough".  The 2000 rod bearings are <also "good enough" - I'd
think a guy with 240k miles on a set of 2000 rod bearings would <agree.  :)
