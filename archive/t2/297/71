You should be able to buy generic freeze plugs for this.
You may have to shop for metric sizes but they should be a generic item
at FLAPS.
Oil gallery plugs simply plug the long galleries that deliver oil to your
the engine bearings.
The galleries are drilled to clean out any materials used in the casting
process and make them uniform in diameter. The ends of the galleries are
then plugged with a thin metal disk that starts as convex shape and
arrives as near flat when it is properly seated making a seal.
On rare occasions these plugs can leak or come out causing massive oil
leaks that can crater your engine very quickly from loss of oil pressure.
The remedy for this potential loss of a gallery plug is to thread the
port and use screw in plugs in their place.
Its relatively easy process but is best done with the crankcase on a
workbench.
I've also seen gallery ends welded up.
