Subject: Re: [T2] The propane heater issue

Hi from Pennington NJ-  Regarding the saftey of propane heaters in the bus:
The catalytic heaters make only CO2 and water, and are rated to use in a
tent with a 2x2" opening to fresh air.  The Colemans (Blackcat or Powercat)
burn a small bottle in 8 hrs.  The surface of the Powercat is broad and if
you lay a tissue on it, it will take about 2 minutes to even brown it.  I
put a digital oven thermometer right against the surface and it held a peak
steady state of 300 degrees F.  I have also used the round parabolic kind
screwed to a bottle; it used it all up in 4 hrs, so it's about twice the
output.  However, this kind uses a radiating metal screen mesh surrounded by
the parabola, and can indeed burn/melt things even 2 feet away if constantly
aiming at it, and if a coat or bed cover is resting against it, bye-bye
camper!
