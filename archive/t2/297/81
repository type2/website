Subject: A note about the Christmas Presents

Hello List,

My pile of "Christmas Presents" is almost all claimed.
Not to be impolite, but I wanted to make somthing
clear. I will happily give these items away to any one
that needs or wants them but I don't want to see them
up for aucion on Ebay or like auctions. I enjoy giving
them away and I am glad to see these items go to good
homes instead of cluttering up my work space. Please
don't claim them with the intent of selling them. That
is all I want to say. I better go now. I have alot of
presents to box! ;)

Have a great day!
