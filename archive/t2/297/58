It will only be "prone to overheating" relative to it's increase in displacement.

"Egg out" more?  I would love to hear the scientific explanation for that.  
In general, the bore/stroke ratio in a 2-liter is still larger than most other engines.  The 1800 is ridiculously oversquare.  Let's see... 

Engine      Bore/Str   Ratio

VW 1800:     93/66      1.41
VW 2000:     94/71      1.32 
302 Ford:    4/3        1.33
Subaru 2.5:  3.92/3.11  1.26
VW 1600:     85.5/69    1.24
350 Chevy:   4/3.48     1.15
351 Ford:    4/3.5      1.14
Honda 1500   75/84.5    0.89
  
As you can see, the increase in stroke is not extreme.  In fact, the 2000 engine still has a much larger bore/stroke ratio than a 1600 type1 engine.  Does Jon think the 1600 is prone to overheating too?

Also consider that VW used the 1800 engine for only two years but they stuck with the 2000 for 7.5 years.  Maybe they knew something that Jon didn't?  :)

I've seen a lot more 1.7/1.8 engines in the yards with dead motors than 2-liters.  Here's another idea - less displacement means less power so you have to use more throttle or rpm to go the same speed, which generates more heat.  Point being that there is no free lunch by going down in displacement.  There are many other factors to take into account.

76 was 2.0, FI, solid-lifter.  A very good engine.  I've had many years with the 1.8 and many years with the 2.0 and I will never go back to the smaller engine.
