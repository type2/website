Subject: intermittent starting  problem

Volks,

My '72 bus has had a weird starting problem for the last few days.
Sporadically, when I turn the ignition key, nothing happens, no dash
lights come on e.g. oil pressure warning, generator, and the starter
won't turn.  If I then turn the pulley wheel manually through around 90
degrees, the lights will come on and everything is normal.  The car runs
fine, once started.  I am running hall effect points and a standard
55amp alternator conversion.  Other than that, my engine is stock 1600.

 

I can only think that it is either brushers or a commutator damaged on
the alternator that are shorting things out with the alternator shaft in
certain positions.  But nothing is getting that hot or bothered.

 

Any help greatly appreciated.

 

Cheers

Tristan
