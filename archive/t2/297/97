Subject: help with engine and trany pull

Ever since I got Bessie running over a year and about 9K miles ago, I
found out she had a whine in the trany. It is worse in lower gears and
almost goes away in 4th. I spoke to someone at a VW show/swap who
seemed to know what it was immediately... but can not remember now.....
perhaps the list can refresh my old man memory. Any way, two things I
really need to ask. (1) Both my Bently and Haynes are pretty detailed
except for where they talk about disconnecting the shift linkage from
the trany. Any pointers on this. I have not yet pulled the boot back
and looked but..... thought I would ask first. (2) Any suggestions on
who to bring my trany to for re-build in the SF bay area. The person I
spoke about above was I think Ron's transaxle in Richmond, CA. TIA
