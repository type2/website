This almost never happens.  At least in this neck of the woods.  Our 
repair shop routinely tows vehicles from the various state colleges back 
to the "home mechanic".  Parents inherently distrust mechanics they don't 
know. Kids typically defer their auto repair needs to their parents "I 
don't know what happened, here is my dad's number"

I would use whatever system makes you happy. I'm not a huge fan of 
microswitches, which always seem to move or quit working, but I suppose 
that has something to do with not getting 3 green lights on a flight home 
and watching them line up the firetrucks on the edge of the runway waiting 
for us to land.

All these injection systems are open loop, air flow based, etc. Pretty 
basic stuff. A little change in engine displacement isn't a big affair.

Judge which system you use by the quality of the individual components on 
hand rather than the year. I will say, the injection system from my 77 
would work fine with any of the parts I swapped in or out of it up to an 
83.  If you have concerns about getting spare parts, go with the more 
prevalent system.  This logic would also dictate that you switch motors, 
though.  Either failure scenario is reasonably unlikey, but at least 
swapping the injection system is fairly trivial.
