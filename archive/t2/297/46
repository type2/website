Oh please.  While it's true that the rod bearings are slightly larger in the 1800, they are not any more "heavy duty" than the ones in the 2-liter.  Think of it this way - the 1800 rod bearings are Lennox Lewis and the 2000 rod bearings are Mike Tyson.  True, Lewis is tougher than Tyson but Tyson is still good enough to whup 99.99% of the people on this planet, and that's "good enough".  The 2000 rod bearings are also "good enough" - I'd think a guy with 240k miles on a set of 2000 rod bearings would agree.  :)

Sounds reasonable to me.
