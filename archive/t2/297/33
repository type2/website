To keep the fresh air vent from leaking cover it from the outside. A sign 
shop should be able to sell you piece of magnetic material to stick over 
the vent. It comes in a variety of colors so you should be able to match 
your bus colors. You can also remove it in parking lots so it doesn't get 
stolen.

People look at you funny b/c they don't know anyone that has to do this in 
their Taurus or their Civic. I'd be worried about fires. Hard to deal with 
in rush hour traffic.

Why not fix your OEM heater?

By the way the flappers can be adjusted under the dash. Move the vent lever 
and look for the moving threaded rod. Most likely the foam on the flappers 
inside the vent out from has gone to pieces. Mine did. Remove and replace 
the foam with something from your local hardware store or your local 
heating contractor. $5.
