Don't understand this question.

have spent a couple of more bucks for premium materials to make the
finished product last.

Dude, I researched my options, the money to get a sprayer, and decent paint 
and everything to do a good paintjob would have been more expensive as my 
whole bus.

What are you talking about? I had a blast taking my bus apart and painting 
it, I want to do it again, I'm thinking cherry red with black 
bumpers......or maybe a dark blue with white bumpers.
