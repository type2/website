   Hello,

Just put new heads on my 2 liter (dropped a seat) and put er back =
together and am experiencing the same crappy idle vacuum i had earlier.  =
Now i installed a gauge to monitor this.  6 in at idle.  Idle is 800 =
rpm, and the timing has to be a little advanced beyond the bentley to =
achieve this. =20

Here is what i have done.

Checked valve lash per Boston Bob site.  Dead on.

Checked for vacuum leaks with Brakleen.  None. =20

Replaced all small vacuum lines.  Done.=20

swapped throttle body with another.  Same result.

CO is dead on at 2 % ( i do not have emissions testing in SC and that is =
optimum per Boston Bob)

What the?  I would like to have more vacuum!!  I feel it is hindering my =
performance.
