Subject: Re: [T2] my $100 paint job

Ok Guys I am going to a VW meet in Huntsville Alabama this weekend, where
once again I will probably be the only Bus, I will get some digi pics made
there and post them. Dang all this talk about $100 paint job, I dont think I
did so bad with 6 cans of Bright Red touch up paint and a can of Black and a
can of White from Wally World......
