>brake pads, blew out the dust and crap, compressed<

    Hi Mike, & list,

    With all the stories of troubles folks have with their VW's that =
come through on this and other list's, its good the hear a story with a =
happy ending! Good job!

    I certainly don't wish to cast a cloud over it (excuse the pun), I =
would just like to remind folks that blowing brake (or clutch dust for =
that matter) can be very dangerous! At one time almost all brake and =
clutch friction material was make with a large  asbestos content. I know =
it has been supposedly off the market for years, but I have read that a =
certain (SAFE) percentage is still allowed in friction materials.=20
    Asbestosis dust is hideous, when in a fine form such as brake and =
clutch residue it can lay around in a shop for weeks. To be stirred up =
every time someone walks or drives through, let along a fan blowing.
    Anyway, I would rather error on the side of safety. Even if it is =
not used any (or much) more. Our cars and bus's were built before it was =
removed. I know most would say there's not much chance of a factory set =
of pads, shoes, or clutch being around, BUT...........................=20
    On any brake/clutch job, wear a surgical mask, never blow =
brake/clutch dust. We have a special parts washer on wheels that fits =
under the backing plate. It has a pump, that pumps through a brush. It =
catches all the fluid/dust, and when it gets dirty we dump it in the =
waste oil tank. The idea is to wet all the brake parts down before you =
start working, to keep the dust from flying up.
    You don't need the special parts washer, just use a pan under the =
backing plate, wash every thing down very well, no dust, no compressed =
air!
    Again good job, keep em running.
