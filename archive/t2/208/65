I watched the Bug Me Video Type4 rebuild last night.  In the video Jake made
inserting the seals look effortless.  When I was under the car doing it, I
had to tap them to go in and be very careful about pinching the seals.  I
didn't think to smooth the edges either.

I pinched one slightly even though I used lots of oil.  Next time I will oil
the contact area more instead of just the seals.

The archive was my source of info at the time:
