Not ridiculous at all....and anyone who's ever done an even medium quality
paint job on a bus would tell you the same.

If you WANT a poor quality paint job, take it to someone who /wont/ spend
a week to disassemble, prep, mask, another week to shoot primer, smooth it
out, shoot it again, clean it all up, remove the mask, remask for color,
shoot a few coats of color....then put it all back together.

Maaco will probably do it in about a day for 500 bucks or so. (at least,
when we had a shop Astro painted, thats what it cost.  Had white window
rubber, a white trailer hitch, white inner wheel wells, white spotted
tires, white radiator, white lower frame rains....good thing I'd removed
everything that bolted on...else we'd have had a white sunroof frame and
seal, a white grill, white tail lights....probably a white license plate
too.  And spots of that paint job (door handle recesses) were peeling in 2
weeks.)

Or perhaps they have a reputation for doing good work and dont want to
spoil it with econo paint jobs.

Nothing wrong with that at all.  I spent a week removing body filler, old
paint, old primer and a LOT of rust from the drip rail on the '66 all
around before I shot it with about 14 dollars worth of paint. (just 8" up
from the drip rail and around it to the sides....a few other spots on the
roof where the rust had caused it to peel back as well.)

I've also got a '79 Rabbit that my brother is learning to do paint and
body on.  It was pretty surface rustyed...had a few pinholes to patch.

I'm sure he'd attest as well to the amount of time even a small car such
as that can consume.
