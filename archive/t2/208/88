hey

 i was lookin in at busdepot.com and they have longblocks rebuilt from AVPOur 
high quality AVP Rebuilt Engines are surprisingly affordable, and backed by a 
12 month, 12,000 mile factory warranty.  Special round-trip shipping rates 
are available, including both delivery of your new engine, and pickup of your 
old core after you've finished the installation. 
We also have brand new 1600 dual-port engines.
are they worth it?
has anybody bought one b4?
