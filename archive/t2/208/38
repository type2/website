The one thing everybody left off.
You need to massage the upper sealing part of the O rinf in the head with
a small screwdriver to get it to slip in without cutting or pinching your
O ring.
Everytime I've had my heads off I've tried to remember to polish that
pesky sharp edge off the heads where the O rings slip in but I never get
it done.
