Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Questions: Bus pulls down in front.

I have done much brake work on my '72.  There is a big difference between a
working and not working brake booster.  With everything working properly, I
feel very confident about the braking in my bus.  I can stop with my toes.

I cannot speak about your nose diving.  Maybe your rear brakes are not
working at all now.

I found the best way to adjust the rear brakes are as follows:

Back the adjuster screws all the way in.  Adjust them out the same amount.
Count the clicks.  10 this one.  10 that one, 5 this one, 5 that one, and so
on until you are completely tight.  Then, loosen up 2 clicks on each one.
Then go do the other side.  If you are going to bleed the brakes, bleed them
before the final loosening.

If your booster is leaking, you are likely also having engine troubles do to
the mix being too lean from the vacuum leak.  Have you noticed any problems
there such as backfiring, poor idle?

If you need to rebuild your booster, I recommend H&R in Dallas.  My rebuild
job cost me $81, including shipping and only took 4 days using US parcel
post for shipping from Virginia.
