Yes, but do you have a heat exchanger connected to recycle the wasted
heat into the hot water system in your house...?-) As with most things,
there's more than enough "energy" to go around; it's the storage that's
the problem. The heat wasted in the summer would probably go a long 
way in the winter...If one could only figure out a way to store it until
needed...
