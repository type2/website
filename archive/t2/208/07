Subject: Brake Parts

Hi all,
I am in the process of getting all the parts needed to fully re-do my brakes
('77 bus). In comparing products and prices I came across the brand Coutts,
apparently from Germany. Does anybody know of this brand, and if they are
any good?
Also, does anything need to be done to the divider that splits the pressure
between the front and rear brake lines? As I plan to do a thorough job, I
don't want to leave anything out.
