Billy,

The top of the fill line has a pretty fancy molded rubber
pipe there.  Clamp on it and the fill pipe and then a round flat
metal ring with several holes in it that match up thru the holes in the 
rubber pipe.  Sheet metal screws thru the round ring , then thru the
gasket looking part of the molded rubber pipe, then into the body.

Rubber part is available from several sources(again).

Cheers, dave
