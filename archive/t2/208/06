Subject: Re: [T2] Identifying

In the checkers catalog make sure they select truck then vanagon (not 
transporter)
In pepboys select truck VW then type 2 (even though it is a vanagon)
In napa vw model vanagon (not transporter)
Depending on what parts you are after be aware that there is some 
crossmodel contamination in their computers.  The providers of the 
databases used were not to accurate in some areas.  I checked with a 
friend that works carquest and he also doesnt know why any one would 
want all the specific info on the vans as the computers only take the 
generic model  i.e.  year, type, make, style,  engine. (1980, truck, VW, 
vanagon, H4 2L)
or  some variation of that. napa, carquest, checkers, autozone, and 
pepboys computers only get into vin number info for vin specific parts.  
which were very few in the AC vehicle parts that any of them stock.  
most vanagon vin varient items would deal with camper stuff which none 
of them stock.
