Subject: '78 Champagne edition has found a new home...

About a month ago one of my neighbors who lives the next road over
stopped by and asked if I was interested in a couple old V-dub busses he
had out in a fenced-in lot behind the house.  ALL my neighbors know I'm
into Busses!

I said sure, knowing nothing about them or the condition...

He tells me that one runs pretty good and the other is a parts bus...

He said when he had emptied them out (is using them for storage) he
would drive the one over and I'd have to tow the other...

I'd kinda forgot about them...

This evening he shows up in a '78 Champagne Edition.  No interior ('cept
for a few odd interior panels), mismatched f & r tires, and the sunroof
has been sealed up with roofing tar...

A quick look at it reveals that the F/I is intact and the Bus starts
better than any I've ever had...  needs a few patches up in the front
wheel wells and the right rear corner repaired, but other than that it
is pretty darn straight and rust free.

He also tells me that the other Bus is also a '78.  Supposedly it starts
but he can't get it to keep running...  He put some gas in it and says
it ran right back out on the ground, so I guess it needs a tank and/or
lots of new fuel lines.

Interior is supposedly complete and in fair condition.  Sliding door
lower track is gone, but looks like there is enough good metal to weld
in a new one.

Both Busses have sliding windows in both sides....

Since I can't attend Transporters By The Tunnel this weekend, I'll have
a chance to start tearing into them...
