Last Air Cooled Vanagon (83 Model Year):

Notes on 81-83 models:  Just because the VINs end with 175 000 does not
mean they made 175,000 vehicles.  In addition, these VIN figures includes
truck and other commercial applications for this model type (normally
known in Europe as the "T3" - third generation Type 2), so it's hard to
determine actually how many were made.  I'll have Jim look into it, he
may find something.

http://www.vanagon.com has been a pretty good source of production info
in the past, but I haven't been there lately to see if the info is still
there.
