Paint job looks nice.
Painting the VW logo as you did makes for a nice touch.
Congrats.

If you are pleased with what you achieved for the effort/reward and 
lessened money spent, you did very well all way 'round for yourself.
You win. Your knowledge and experience win. Your bus wins. Your wallet 
wins. Your tool stash wins.

As in anything that you do economically, remember to not do anything that 
cannot be "undone" or done "mo betta" later on as $$ comes to the surface 
of your life.

If you saved your bus from rust, you invested in your future happiness.
Nice way to bank.
