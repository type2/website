A simple, free 55 gallon barrel. It was originally used to deliver paint.

It was two (or three?) holes in the top which I used for a bottom. I 
removed the bottom with a Sawz-all.

I placed the barrel on 2" thick masonry spacers to hold it off the ground. 
I used 3 to keep it from wobbling.

I simply removed the small and large plugs that were originally used to 
fill and pump out the paint inside.

With paper or wood or cardboard inside and the bottom free of ash it will 
burn very, very hot. If I let the ash build up so it blocks the air flow it 
smokes like crazy.

I try to fill the barrel up with sticks that I collect from the yard and 
other carpentry waste (I do carpentry on the side). I use alot of wood to 
build small projects that other folks would consider to be scrap. I try to 
large burns so it gets good and hot.

To burn the kerosene I simply put it in a metal can like a large coffee can 
in the bottom of the barrel or I use it to pour over the wood and fuel the 
fire start.

Nothing complicated. Maybe a bit of air injection with a leaf blower soon! 
<grin>

We have a county trash "transfer-station" where I can take my household 
garbage. They compact it there and take it to the county landfill. They 
accept oil, metal, and large household junk. They discourage wood and other 
building materials. They have one older fellow that is easy to get along 
with and another that is pretty particular about what you dump - it is his 
kingdom and his rules.

We burned our trash in Italy but the stink was pretty bad. I don't know if 
something fancy like a fan or blower for  air injection would burn the 
trash hot enough to eliminate the stink. Something to experiment with.
