My Brazilian fuel pump has been leaking oil lately so I thought I would change it.  These pumps are no longer available in Vancouver but the German one's are.

The German pumps are almost four times the price but what a difference in performance.  The bus now runs like great.  Should have bought original in the first place instead of three Brazilian pumps and the time to R&R.  I guess the Brazilian pumps don't put out the capacity that a dual carb system needs.

My advice is to buy the German.  You won't regret it.
