Subject: master cylinder or booster?

When I put the brakes on in the westy (1979), I get a hissing noise from
underneath and there is also I tight spot on the brake pedal when you put
the brakes on. It goes down normally and starts to brake a bit, then there
is a harder spot (to push), then it gets past that and is easier to push
again. There is a hissing too so I'm thinking the booster?? The brakes work
great though. Any thoughts on this?
Courtney
