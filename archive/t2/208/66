Subject: $100 - NO VW or not much....

Somebody south of me sent me a nasty-gram telling me to lighten up. 
Apparently my reply was too harsh in that poster's opinion.

I'm worried somebody else might has mis-understood my intentions. I didn't 
mean to be harsh in any way at all.

As for the $100 paint job let me clarify: great, good for you, glad you are 
happy with it.

Like I said: Your idea and my idea and a pro's idea of good are different 
things I'm sure. The pro guy's good is probably closer to a new car's paint 
job than mine or yours. My idea of good is it looks okay, lasts okay, and 
it fit my budget (which has traditionally been pretty small).

My paint job was maybe $250 in materials and the use of a cheap gun and 
compressor. If I had better equipment or more budget then I would hope for 
better results but as I am an amateur - I take what I can get.

I have even used farm implement paint a couple of times with decent 
results. That's less than $15 a gallon.

So for the record I wasn't slamming anyone at either end or the food chain 
or in between. I was just trying to be encouraging. Guess I need to work on 
that style a bit! <GRIN>

$100 for a paint job - congrats....
