Subject: Wanted Fuel Filler Neck Source

Hi All:

I am the hunt for a fuel filler neck for an 82 aircooled Vanagon, VW
part number 251-201-119A (number of of my part). ETKA shows part numbers
251-201- 119 B or 251-201- 119 D. VW states that these are no longer
available.

I have checked the catalogs of Bus Depot, Vanagain and Bus Boys. Any
suggestion on a work around to replace the neck if this part is no
longer available?

Regards,
--Jeff Strickrott
