Subject: RE: [T2] my $100 paint job

Cool - looks good!

I'm painting my '78 bus this weekend with Rustoleum enamel. I'm anxious to
see how it comes out. For any future painters - a buddy of mine recommended
using a marine paint that he described as 'self levelling' so you can brush
or roll it on, and if done right will produce a uniform, glossy gel coat
kind of look.

Alas, it's $85 a gallon and it would've taken me a week and  a half to get
it. I've already been sitting in primer for a week and want to finish this
project.  The paint I found was called EASYPOXY, available from WestMarine
(store name, not company). There were about 20 colors.

If I had the money for a real paint job I woulda done it, but hey, I took 
care of ALL the rust inside and out......I like that I can say  that I have 
a rust free bus!

My first bus, '71 Westy.
