Hello Richard,

     Does your bus have the catalectic converter in place? If so the =
water is the by-product of the catalectic converter. Ever notice cars =
with water coming out of their Stainless Steel exhaust systems since =
1975. Catalectic converters required by EPA starting in 1975. Stainless =
keeps the exhaust system from rusting quickly with all the water. And =
you though the manufacture was trying to save you money on exhaust =
repair. They were just trying to keep an exhaust system on the car for =
the Fed warranty mandated five years or 50,000 miles!         =20
     One small puff of white smoke on start up sounds like a little oil =
residue in the cylinders. Not much to worry with unless oil consumption =
gets out of hand.
     Have a good one!
