Subject: Re: air scoops

For what it's worth---My '68 bay came with FOUR air
scoops!

That is, i have the built-in ones behind the windows,
then at some point, a former owner cut holes in the
side about where the splitties have vents and put
after-market plastic scoops on. I can't imagine a bus
engine with more air flow than mine. 

It probably doesn't help much, but it appears not to
hurt. The bus, with its stock engine, oil cooler and
sheet metal, runs cool under normal conditions.

---I probably lose 5 mpg to the increased air
resistance. :-)
