Exactly. And I do electrical work. So when I rewire my friends houses, it's to the current electrical code and everything is dead on. And there's rustoleum on my bus.

Why? Because I'm putting a wife thru school and raising two kids too. I'm not a bachelor who paints for a living. We've all got our own situations and this list tries to help everyone do the best job they can with their skills and budget.

What more can you ask for?
