Subject: changed aux batt (experimentation continues)

Pulled the little group 42 I was using and changed it for a group 27 
marine Xtra  duty.  It has almost the same amp hour rating of a 
31marine  battery.  Some surgery required on my 83 westy.  Had to trim a 
1 inch notch into the back of the drivers seat bottom swivel plate.  
This battery sits one and a half inches higher than the stock type 
batteries.  Other than that it is an almost perfect fit into the hole.  
I dont use the drivers swivel so no loss there.  Initial testing after 
using with a 7 amp load for 2 hours showed only a 3 amp draw from the 
alt to the batt.  This went down to a 2.5 amp draw in about 10 minutes.  
This is the same activity the main group 41 starting battery after 
starting the vehicle.(with the aux isolated for testing)
