I think that you have a leak in your booster.  Not too big of one, but
enough to hear the hissing.

I think that your hard spot is a worn spot probably in your master cylinder,
but maybe in a caliper or wheel cylinder.  I also could be a worn spot on
the booster that you need push beyond to overcome the leak.
