Terry is a professional paint man and knows good from bad. He also has 
access to equipment the rest of us doesn't.

He is right about everything he says IMHO but you've got to do with the 
equipment you've got.

I got a cheap Campbell Hausfield compressor given to me and I bought a 
cheap gun. Decent results, not good by his standards I am sure BUT I accept 
the limitations of the quality of the job I did and I'm happy. It's lasted 
about 3 years now and still looks good.

Given the access to the equipment I would use a modern 2 part clear coat 
paint and spray it in a booth with a HVLP gun but I don't have that 
equipment... <grin>

Hang in there. Be happy with what you've got, consider it a test. If it 
lasts longer than you expected it to then be happy, if it doesn't then 
study up on what you could have done better within your means. You can 
always do it again later.

Also your idea of good, my idea of good and his idea of good maybe entirely 
different things.
