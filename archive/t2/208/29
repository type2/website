Subject: Re: [T2] my $100 paint job


Yep--rust free---

For how long?

Is this a 20 footer, or a 60 foot paint job?

For all the work that you did to get the bus a uniform color you should
have spent a couple of more bucks for premium materials to make the
finished product last.

I just hate doing the same job twice.
especially one of this magnitude.

Later,

Terry

If I had the money for a real paint job I woulda done it, but hey, I
took care of ALL the rust inside and out......I like that I can say that
I have a rust free bus! 
My first bus, '71 Westy.
