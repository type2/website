Hello All     Let me put my .02 in on this . on my 59 panel that I take to 
the swaps loaded down running a built 1835 dual dell. motor . this thing will 
haul ass. oil temps have been a problem mostly when running 70-75 mph . gets 
up to 250, have been trying different things to see the effect on oil temp 
and pressure. last thing I did was to take 2 baking pans and bolt thur the 
vents,didn't want to drill the body, these scoops lowerd the oil temps by 30 
degrees, pressure has had very little change which is what I expected. As for 
the scoops making it run hot in traffic thats not been seen, it shows that it 
is running coolest at about 55-60 mph, at which it is 180-210. Later and have 
fun   Mark Dearing salem import service  Salem va
