Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line question

I have had some awful problems with the 'bird beak' fuel filler part
eroding, falling into the tank, and blocking the fuel line.  No fun to
pull the tank to get this thing out.  I would encourage people to _not_
use these and remove one that may be installed (even if it may make
inspections more difficult).

See this old post I wrote for complete details:
