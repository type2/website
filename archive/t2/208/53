Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Looking for fuel system parts, 81 Vanagon

For that part you are most likely looking at the parts recyclers.  I 
dont have any on my list for vanagons though.  As a note though i noted 
that the part number stays the same until 1983 where there are two 
filler necks  but the fuel tank for gas is the same.  the part number is 
251 201 129 A,,,,it apears to replace 4 separate parts with one larger 
unit.  the item in the picture is 7c,  It might be able to be modified 
to do the job.  note that i can get that part number all the way into 
1992 and the others have all dropped out of the system in 1985.  The 
fuel tank part number for the CV engine is the same for the MV engine of 
the 1992 era,  but in the 1980 to 84 there were some minor variations in 
the tank that could make a difference on if the hose will work.
