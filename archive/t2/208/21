Subject: '72 or '73 THING

A local retired fellow with an excess of Prowlers and Corvettes is going to 
sell his baby. He keeps it as clean as his Corvettes and Prowlers so you 
can guess how clean that is. I see it regularly running around town.

It is a yellow THING with a black top. It is all ORIGINAL and looks 
EXCELLENT. He is asking $5000 for it. This THING is ready to go to Florida 
or California today with no prep so it's that good.

If you are interested I can put you in touch with him.

Ciao!
