Subject: Extension Tent info needed.

Hi List,
I just acquired a VW extension tent for the rear hatch.  The only info I
have on it is half the the setup directions.  The date is 1973.  Anybody
have any info on the tent or can point me to a source that would?  I've
been to Joe Clark's site but he a little information.  Thanks
