Try and get a brand name on that paint...A buddy of mine has a boat and
looks at the WestMarine catalog first to find out what he needs, then does
a search for the same "stuff" at non-boating prices...In general, although
WestMarine carries quality "stuff", I found their pricing to be masochistic:-(
