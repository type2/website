Well, really high performance cars tend to cause me to collect tickets!

Our Scion is pretty good around corners, but I just hate the way that FWD
cars steer.  Heavy and dead.  The shifter is rather notchy too, and just
doesn't have a natural feel.  It drives like an appliance.

When I want a "sporty" drive, I head for the Bug.  Light steering with
good feedback, and shifting that just seems to find the gears by itself.
No, I don't go to the point that things get sideways, but at least I can
downshift the bug effectively.

The VWs just feel as though I am more "connected" with the vehicle.
