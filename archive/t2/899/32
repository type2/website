Subject: Re: [T2] unknown idiot light in dash

Thanks for all the info guys!

The brakes are working fine and were just bled when the brake booster
was replaced so I don't think its actually a brake failure.

I suspect it to be an electrical problem since the light came on
randomly....I was driving uphill into a mountain pass(no braking at
the time) and went out later.  I did recently replace the alternator
and the voltage regulator but had a short which necessitated the
rebuilding of a portion of my wiring harness.   Since then the
Alternator light and the brake light come on when I start the bus and
stay on until I rev the engine a little bit(like from 800-900 to
1100-1200) after which they go out.

I haven't tried replacing the VR yet but its on the list just to see
if the short may have caused some damage which may have manifested
itself as a malfunction in the indicator circuit as well.
