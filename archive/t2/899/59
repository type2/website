Subject: [T2] Poptop window and southern England trip

Hello all,

does anyone know where to get a poptop window for a '78 westy
(helsinki-interior)? Mine is badly cracked and I doubt that it can be
repaired. I can't seem to get one in Germany, so any help is
appreciated. I also thought of fabbing one on my own, but I thinkt it
will be hard to make it seal properly. Any suggestions?

And now for the fun part:
I'm going to southern England (Cornwall, Devon, ...) for holidays from
1st till 20th of August. Does anyone know if there are any VW-meetings
in this period? Anyway, look out for a nice red/white '78 westy with
rusty bumpers - thats me.

Thanks,

Timo
