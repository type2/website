Another tire thread.
       
Do not trust your local tire suppliers brand and model
recommendations.  Period.  Believe me.  I know how
dangerous the wrong tires can be.
    
Which tires to purchase?  Assuming you have 14 inch
rims:  Hankook RA8's from busdepot.com.  Read this: 
http://busdepot.com/details/tires.jsp 
   
The actual tires are available at
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=RA08
   
There are other suppliers, but be careful.  Discuss
your tire purchase decision before paying your money. 
There are so many false claims about tire features.  I
swallowed the salesmans story, and bought Toyo`s.  Was
I wrong.  I`m now convinced the RA08 is one of the
very few tires in the world for my T2.
  
There are too many people on this list who have had
the wrong tires, and have been set straight BY THIS
LIST.
   
Also look at the dozens of tire question threads on
the type2.com archive.
