Subject: 10th Annual High Country Bus Festival

this may be the last chance to check or send emails before I leave in the 
morning (tuesday) for Boone!

if anyone needs to get a hold of me before the event - you can leave a 
message at the campground office for me: (828) 963-7275

DOOR PRIZES:  If you would like to donate some door prizes for the kids or 
adults we would appreciate it.

Thanks to our sponsors, we have some great prizes for this years' raffle - 
be sure to buy your tickets at the festival and help raise money for the 
Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation.

If you have one of those Herbie RC busses - bring it;  there will be time 
trial races.

The weather this week up in Boone is gonna be pretty good,  there is a 30% 
chance of a scattered thunderstorm through the week and weekend - temps in 
the high 70's during the day and low 60's at night.....................I 
cant' wait to coool off!  :-)

weather permitting we will have aerial photography on sunday along the 
carabus route.
