hello micheaL    OK  can you shift normal with the  engine not running ??   
Normally if the clutch is going bad 1st and  reverse will be hard to get into, 
seeing as they are the lowest gears.  Now  what happens when you put it into 
gear and then try to start the bus?? does it  jump or does it just do nothing?? 
The bay window buses had a problem with the  slector in the nosecone of the 
tranny breaking,but that would make shifting  almost impossible and they 
normally get stuck in one gear when that  happens,  Now if the shift coupling goes 
bad then it nmakes finding the  gears hard but wont cause grinding normally.  
If it grinds trying to get in  a gear and then in the forward gears there isn't 
anything then most likely the  pressure plate and disc have gone south.  Cost 
is depending on where you  are located. $ 400 is normal if they include 
setting the end play and replacing  the flywheel seal, Also use new parts like 
Sachs or Luxs  I recommend  resurfacing the flywheel at the same time and 
replacing the tranny input seal  also       later Mark Dearing  salem Import  Service
