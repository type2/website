Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop window and southern England trip

Hello all,

Here is a detailed picture of my poptop window that needs a replacement.
I used a lot of silver-tape to stop it from falling apart (barely
visible from the angle the picture was taken).

By the way you can see my new colorful curtains that I finished just
yesterday.

Thanks,

Timo
