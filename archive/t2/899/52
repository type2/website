Subject: YES!!! JUST DROVE MY BUS!!!!

I'm soo happy! I just drove my Bus for the first time in like three years!!!

One of the lifters were rattling like crazy. I took it for a slow, casual
drive, and drove to my friends house. When I got back in and started it up,
the engine started and drove perfect. Nice and smooth. I'm really psyched!!!

What can I do about that lifter?


Thanks!

Todd
