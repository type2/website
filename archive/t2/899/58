Subject: Dumb Question about shocks

I am restoring my79 Westfalia, been through the archives and my manuals and
can't find an answer to my query, so I'll try you guys.

Will I be able to remove the rear shocks so I can gain access to hard to reach
areas and keep them off when I put the wheels back on so I can roll the van
around, will there be enough clearance?  Engine and Transmission are out and
the gas tank is coming out next week and being dealt with as per Richard
Atwell's fabulous instructions.

Spent the afternoon with the heat gun removing undercoating, and unstuck my
brake drums from the hubs.

Thanks in advance for your help

PS.  Jerry from Galiano, hope everything was well with you during the fire.
