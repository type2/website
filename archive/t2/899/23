OK, final check as was suggested earlier.  With the engine off, can you
get it into most gears?

If so, your lesson in engine removal begins.

Don't try to run it any more, since more abuse will stick the pilot
bearing even worse, making it very hard to separate the engine and trans,
as well as screwing up the pilot shaft more.
