Subject: 1973 Speedometer/odometer R&R

My '73 camper had been suffering from poor fuel mileage
for a couple of years.  The fault was the odometer
counting only three out of every four miles travelled.
So I took the speedometer/odometer out for repair.


I disconnected the battery ground strap first.

The most difficult and dissapointing part of this work
was the way VW designed the four fasteners that hold
the instrument cluster to the dashboard.  I read in the
green Bentley manual that the early bays had mounting
points that were fixed to the dashboard.  For the late
(post '72?) models there were loose spring clips to
screw into.

The problem I experienced was that the spring clips
have no way to stay in their places when refitting the
instrument cluster.  Spring Clip is a misnomer, as they
do not clip onto anything.  They overlap the opening
in the dashboard and prevent the instrument cluster
from moving back, toward the driver.

To reassemble, I had to feed the screw in through the
front, then reach up from behind with the spring
clip and drive the screw into it.  I must be missing
something obvious here because it seemed much more
difficult than necessary.


Each of the wires to the dummy lights, etc were labeled
and I made a crude map of where they all attach.  I opened
up the cluster to see the guts inside the speedo/odometer.
Aha - there was a broken plastic spur gear on the same
shaft as the number wheels.

Gail's Speedo Service in Costa Mesa, CA cleaned,
repaired and calibrated the instrument for me the same
day.  The bill was about $4 for a new gear and about
$75 labor.

I put it back into service (no smoke leaked out :-) and
the next night, the instrument lights went dark.  So I
opened it up again and replaced two of the little 1.2W 
'wheat grain' light bulbs with Osram brand.
