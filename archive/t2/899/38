Subject: Re: [T2] unknown idiot light in dash

...The brakes are working fine and were just bled when the brake booster
was replaced so I don't think its actually a brake failure.

I suspect it to be an electrical problem since the light came on
randomly....I was driving uphill into a mountain pass(no braking at
the time) and went out later...
---
Mine will light up on occasion too, I just reach over and tap on the  
brake handle and it will go out.  There is a little switch under the  
dash that the brake will press against when it is disengaged.  If you  
have adjusted your brakes recently, then check to see that the lever  
is going all the way back and pressing against the switch. Adjusting  
the cable will pull it back into the right position.
