"VW Camper & Commercial" actually pre-dates Just Kamper's mag.  I've
subscribed to VWC&C since Issue One and highly recommend it.  VWC&B sold me
a copy, direct from JK, with a big, ugly coffee stain on a page about
upgrading to Porsche brakes...  They never responded to my email complaints!

YMMV--
