Subject: Re: [T2] Loaf of Bread

Well, I was pondering the other day why I, an unabashed car nut, enjoy  driving my breadloaf so much.  I've owned several sports cars and  muscle cars and I like going fast.  Especially around tight  corners.  I've been bored sick driving most economy cars and  passenger sedans.  My favorites are actually high-performance  four-door sedans.  My Taurus SHO was hot.  
  
  So why do I actually enjoy driving my bus so much?  Well, I think  it's the feel.  Sitting up high, big wheel in my hands, fighting  cross-winds, trying to keep the body roll down in turns...  It's  just that I love to drive.  And the bus is an especial  challenge.  Yesterday I driving down the 3 lane (one-way) access  road by the freeway.  A guy starts driving right on my tail.   He had two free lanes to pass, but no, he had to tail-gate a VW  bus!  I almost slammed on the brakes just to teach him a  lesson.  
  
  I used to run Autocrosses in my '84 GTI (I bought new).  I'd be  tempted to try it in the Bopmobile just for grins.  Up and down  Lookout Mountain is a blast.  It won't hold the road like my Jags  but it's still fun.   Random thoughts from a (now) VW nut....KR

  Well, I don't know about the shape of the universe,
but I can attest to the fact that I know exactly what
it feels like driving a loaf of bread shape down the
freeway.  And camping in a loaf of bread.  Hey, 2
weeks ago we changed the loaf of breads rear brakes,
and replaced the master cylinder.  So now the loaf of
bread stops quicker.  And in the fall, we will be
changing out the Load Range A incorrect tires to
Hankook RA8 tires, which comply with the original tire
specifications for this model of load of bread.  The
bay window on my load of bread cracked some weekends
ago, so it will be getting a new window too.
