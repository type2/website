Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone out there wth a 1641 engine in a Westy? 

hello Trey  yes I have ran both engines.  I wouldn't stop at  1641cc go ahead 
and do a 1776. I personally prefer single ports as the torque is  better.  
don't skimp on heads as they and a good torque cam can make all  the difference 
in the world.  Remember also that the bigger the motor the  hotter it will run
