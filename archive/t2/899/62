Subject: [T2] Loaf of Bread

I was watching PBS last night, and heard that
physicists now believe our universe is just like a
single slice of bread from a really big loaf.
   
Well, I don't know about the shape of the universe,
but I can attest to the fact that I know exactly what
it feels like driving a loaf of bread shape down the
freeway.  And camping in a loaf of bread.  Hey, 2
weeks ago we changed the loaf of breads rear brakes,
and replaced the master cylinder.  So now the loaf of
bread stops quicker.  And in the fall, we will be
changing out the Load Range A incorrect tires to
Hankook RA8 tires, which comply with the original tire
specifications for this model of load of bread.  The
bay window on my load of bread cracked some weekends
ago, so it will be getting a new window too.
