Ok, I should have been more specific. I've seen quite a lot of busses
(all westfalia '77 to '79) with this particular window. I'll link to a
detailed picture soon, but you can (barely) see the window on some of
these photos:

The nice thing about this pop-up window is, that it can be popped up
straight but also only at the back (no rain in the bus when poptop up)
or front (cool breeze for backseat passengers).

Thanks a lot,

Timo
