Subject: Annapolis MD Mechanic/Body Work Needed

After 2 years of doing just enough to keep the bus "running" (and I  
use the term loosely), my wife and I have reached an agreement that  
allows me to get the bus back in daily driver condition.

So, here I am, recently relocated to Annapolis MD looking for leads  
on mechanics and body repair shops.   I have 2 young kids and a ton  
of other things going on so although I would like to do some of the  
work myself I'm going to take advantage of the budget appropriation  
and let someone else actually complete the work.

All leads in Anne Arundel or surrounding counties welcome.  I'm  
comfortable taking it 30-45 miles if needed.

TIA
