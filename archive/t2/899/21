(If the clutch pedal feels the same as always and the clutch
doesn't disengage you've got a bad pilot bearing, which requires engine)

	Don't be too quick to blame the clutch.  Has the clutch pedal "feel"
	suddenly changed?  If so, you have a bad clutch cable which isn't too bad
	to replace.  If the clutch pedal feels the same as always and the clutch
	doesn't disengage you've got a bad pilot bearing, which requires engine
	removal.
	
	Hope it's the first one!
