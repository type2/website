Subject: Tires?

Hey guys,

    My front tires are nearly brand new, but my rear tires look really really
old. I'd like to order a set of 2 tires from Tire Rack. Do you guys have any
recommendations? And what would the optimal size be if reduction of rpms at
cruise was more important to me than acceleration?


Thanks!

Todd
