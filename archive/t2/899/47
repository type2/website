Subject: Free 68 Bus in PNW

I have a 68 rusty bus, I am moving to Portland this Saturday 7/29, and
can't take her with me. If anyone on this list is interested or know
someone who might be, let me know. I have limited access to the
internet at this time so pics are unlikely but I would be willing to
give as accurate a description as I can over the phone.

It has the transaxle with it, no engine, no middle or rear interior.
It has all front interior and would be a driver with an engine bolted
in. Free and clear title going to good home on a first come first
served basis.

I am in Yakima, Wa. If interested call me on my cell 503-544-0775

thanks,

Matthew
