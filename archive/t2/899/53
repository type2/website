Subject: Oil Fill tube seal

The A/C installation in my '72 Bus is progressing slowly.  The bottom part is installed and a template has been fabricated to make a new piece of engine tin.  I cut the belt off my '82  Vanagon to get the proper belt length for the engine pully to the double pully.  The new belt seems to fit properly.

For those who want or need to know it is:

Napa XL25-7440  13/32" x 44-5/8"  (10mm x 1132mm)

My Microfiche reader blew its lamp.  So I only have one part number.

Vanagon CV Engine
I am looking for a new gasket to go from the bottom of the oil filler tube to the case (021-115-137).
Also, I need a new rubber gasket to seal the oil filler tube to the engine tin. 

New photos soon.
