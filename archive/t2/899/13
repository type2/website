This hose is for the vacuum switch for the EGR. There is a tee in the
booster line in front of the firewall tin and the vacuum switch itself has
two hoses, one to the EGR valve and one to the tee in front of the firewall.
The switch screws into the crankcase between cylinder 3&4, in an odd-sized
(M8 x 1.0) hole. When you assemble a 77-79 bus, you will have one tin screw
that is this odd size, with a large slot head, it populates the hole that
was used for this switch, which is only on 75 and 76 buses.
