I think that I paid "The Volks Home" here in Richmond VA somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 for a new clutch, a new clutch is not that big a deal, I would do it myself now for sure.

But my symptoms were not that I could not get the thing in gear, it was that the clutch was slipping.  No going into gear seems to me to be a problem with something between the gear shifter and the transmission.  Something in the linkages, maybe the trans nosecone.  I would start by having someone try to shift the gears (not running) and get under the van and see what is going on.  It is simple, the shaft rotates and moves fore and aft, if that is not happening, fix that, if that is happening, problem may be in your transmission.
