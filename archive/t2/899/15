Sure it's held in by only 4 bolts, but there is a quite a few bits and 
pieces that must be disconnect and perhaps plugged. Some of these 
include the engine electrical power, charging system, fuel supply, air 
filter connection, hamster, hanger bar, and/or any owner provided gauge 
signal wires, etc. While far from difficult, it can be time consuming, 
especially the first time. I am unsure of std shop time but my guess 
would be around 3hr for a shop to perform the r&r. There is also the 
added variable with these engines, that depending on how one's nose is 
held and the particulars of the knuckle sacrifice on the way out, 
sometimes the engine just doesn't want to slide into the transaxle all 
the way. But fear not, it can be done. Even in dual format. Take a look 
at this shot from a few years ago of me and Troy Wical.
