Tony,

Ahhhhhhh!  Then you've never driven a turboed 68 bug!

Just finished mine up(at least for now) and I need to put better brakes on 
it.  It is a little faster than my modified Subaru Legacy Gt....which 
makes it a <13.2 second in the 1/4 mile bug.  You need to make sure that 
you are pointed straight when the turbo really kicks in<grin> as it will 
catch rubber in 4th gear with 205 tires.

Now *that's* a hoot!

BTW, I got the correct belt on the 78 bus A/C and went for a ride 
yesterday afternoon.  Blows 48 degree air down my neck and after about
6 miles, I was getting goosebumps on my legs...pics to follow later today 
or tomorrow.  Now that is a true luxury...a "loaf" with A/C when it's 91 
outside!


Cheers, dave

    It's easy to drive a fast car fast...But dangerous to drive it at its
 limit...
 (I've buried both the tach and the speedo in a Vette, but I was immortal,
 then... ;-(
 Drivin' my Bugeye at its limit is "safe" fun...(Even if the traffic is
 passin'
 me... ;-)
