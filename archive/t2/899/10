Sorry to leave the basics out.  
 
I drive a 1970 delux bus that I've had since 1999.   Well I was going to a used record store to see what I could find. When I got into the turning lane to the store I found I could'nt get in to any gears.  It was a struggle to get into first just to get off the main road.  I heard no noises nor had any hints of a problem until it happend.  I was able to get home and now sitting in my lot I can't get into any gears.  when I try Reverse the gears grind.  Any other gears no noise and no gear.
 
Any Ideas - Clutch / Transmission.....
 
Hey thanks in advance -  (Very bummed out dude)
 
Michael

	Before you look into more expensive options, have you confirmed that the
	offensive part is the clutch? Several other parts can cause a
	transmission not go into gear, including the shifter missadjustments,
	loose shifter rod parts or bushings. Worth a look at the very least.

	I don't have a price, but you will be paying for a Removal and
	replacement of the engine which should be a good chunk of change. If
	possible it's a great oppertunity for a bus owner to get the feel for
	R&R by doing it yourself. Should be a reasonable job over a weekend,
	with the most basic tools.
