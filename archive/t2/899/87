	A near-equivalent is (given that your lights aren't already 
on) to switch on your sidelights.  The type of ignoramus who would 
tailgate you will not know the difference between your tail-lights 
and your (brighter) stoplights.  S/he will drop back, at least 
temporarily.

	- perhaps not; but unlike them it won't be in the garage for 
repairs most of the time
