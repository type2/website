Yes. There are actually two parts that are found in that location, the other
is PN 039 919 369. This second one is not vacuum controlled, it is a
teperature sensor that is inline with the temp sender in the cylinder head.
It seems to be a modulator for the temp sender. I have not nailed down
exactly what years had the 039 part number.
