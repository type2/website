Subject: Anyone out there wth a 1641 engine in a Westy? 

All,

Running a stock 1600 DP in my 71 Westy. Want to get a little more power and
I've had recommendations to go with a 1641 with a Weber 2 BB progressive..

Anyone out there have one in a Westy or experience with a 1641 setup  vs. a
1600DP?

Thoughts would be appreciated

Trying to gauge difference in engine performance  between the 2.

Thanks

Trey
