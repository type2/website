Peek Automotive in Lanham is pretty good and a tad pricy but they do good
work..
also in Baltimore there is a guy at Old Harford and Taylor ave that works
on all but auto trannys he has a good reputation but his name escapes me
at the moment.

there is a guy in Glen Burnie/and on Fort Smallwood rd (Same guy) stay as
far away as possible, he is a rip off and can't fix anything newer than a
1960.

on the other side is Rick's in Dundalk and a place that is good but
expensive down on the Eastern Shore will give you more info on those if
you want to go that far.

welcome to the neighborhood.
