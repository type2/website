I'm blocking off the fan ends of the HEs and adding a restrictor of
some kind to the fan shroud openings. I know it expects to dump air
out of those, but there should be some small amount of backpressure as
would be there if everything was stock.

Also, I'm looking to wire the blowers to ALWAYS be on when the engine
is running... Though at a much reduced speed. That should take care of
keeping the manifolds cool even in summer. The flapper boxes forward
of the HEs will continue to be used as stock.

I have a great pic from this morning showing how well my windshield
defrosts even with the stock setup, but my site's down and can't put
it up yet...
