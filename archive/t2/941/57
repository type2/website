Subject: Re: [VB] Busavan to BBBXI from north LA County

Earliest I can leave Ventura Thursday 1/11 is around 9am.  Haveta go to my
storage to load the trailer and the earliest they open is 7am.  I will be
spending Sunday (today) actually going through the stuff to organize for the
quickest possible load-up as I have next weekend all tied up with a
previously scheduled engagement that is not cancellable.  If I can organize
the stuff today, I can load up in 45 minutes tops and be on the road at 8am.

My planned route is CA14 to CA138/18 to I-15 to I-40 east.  CB Channel will
be either 2 and/or 19 (switching to Ch 2 if I spot Type 2s w/antenna) and
FRS Channel 1 with the Cobra Walkie Talkie.  I'll be puttin' along at 55-60
myself, no hurry to get anywhere.

I'll keep my eyes peeled. 8-)
