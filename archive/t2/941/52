Bosch is W7CC0 (Long Life) Super Copper.  Alternate is W7CC.

Some 83.5-91's were also equipped with the tri-electrode W7DTC for supposed
even longer life, but this wasn't consistent in the production and they're a
bit pricey.  And I couldn't pass the Calif Smog Test with 'em either.  Went
back to W7CC0 and no problems after than

No Good Kind ;-) (NGK) is BP6HS

Stick with the original Bosch

YMMV
