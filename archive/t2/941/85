Subject: Bus Sighting

Was watching a 1956 Sci-Fi movie titled "The Quaterman Xperiment" [sic]
(British title) tonight and the bus the scientists showed up in was a bit
unusual (to me anyway).

The engine hatch, which they opened as they set up at the crash site, was
huge.  It was about the right width, but it continued up to where the chrome
strip would have been.

But there was no engine.  Instead, there was an "electronics" console where
the engine should have been.  It was supposed to be the radio/remote control
for the crashed rocket.

They drove it up (the bus, not the rocket), so I'm assuming that they
figured no one would notice the lack of an engine if they put the "box" back
there.

I've just never seen an engine hatch that big.  Was it common on older
buses?

to Outlook 2002 in order to sync.  I'm still moving everything over to the
new program.)
