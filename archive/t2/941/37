Subject: chirping in the engine compartment

hey all, talking about a 1600sp 30/2 034dist. on 69 bus.
  i'm in monterey, cal area visiting the fishies. on the way here  
from santa cruz i discovered a high pitched chriping sound. it gets  
louder with revs. my best guess is its either the diz or the carb -  
too close to tell. i have never experienced this sound from either.  
i'm wondering if i should continue on to oakland, my destination.  
other symptom includes hard starting, along with rough idle.  
eventually its gets warmed up but the chirping noise continues. any  
ideas, on the road, tia, steve
