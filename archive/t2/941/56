This is fun present for the VW fan. The look isn't stock by any means  
if that matters to you but the lights work from the remote (you can  
even switch on "high beams").

Unlike the bug, the bus has a speaker in the "ragtop" and an 1/8"  
audio jack behind the rear hatch so I connected an iPod Shuffle  
looping some of the Type 1 engine sounds from this CD to make it  
sound like a bus:

It takes 4hr for the battery to charge up before you can play...
