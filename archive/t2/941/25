If you're gonna take the main duct off to insulate it, just replace it 
with some 4" aluminum ducting from home depot/lowes and wrap it in the 
aluminum covered bubble wrap.  I did that on mine and it send that heat 
up beautifully.

I'm not sure what year bus you have, but I know on a 76-79 that you can 
unscrew the covers from below, just where the heat exchangers attach to 
the cooling shroud.  There is a screw on either side that screws into 
the cover.  Remember the orientation and remember which cover goes on 
which side!

I doubt it.  You might be able to get a stick in there to poke at them, 
but that's about it.  Heh, you could also get the stick stuck in there 
if the flap closed on it!

I'd just Remove the covers and feel with your finger if the flaps are there.
