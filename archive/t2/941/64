Subject: Shipping carrier from Charleston, SC to San Diego

Hey Volks,

I know some of you have used shippers to get buses hauled from Point  
A to Point B.

Can anyone recommend a good, reliable shipper who could handle a  
Charleston (SC) to San Diego (CA) trip for a 1974 Campmobile High Top?

Many thanks, and happy new year.

Anton
