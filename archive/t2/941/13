Ok these little "aluminum flappers" in the engine shroud have got me 
wondering. Anyone got a good schematic to show me these?? Am I to understand 
that they prevent air from the blower fan mounted above the engine from 
entering the engine cooling air?? They are totally different from the flaps 
attached to the thermostat??
