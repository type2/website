Subject: water inlet

Hey guys and gals, I forgot to mention that when I hooked up the water line the pressure must have been too high for the bus to handle and it snapped the plastic inlet right off.  I don't suppose any kind of glue would hold it and I broke the door off with the lawnmower this summer anyhow.  Does anyone have one you want to part with?  I guess maybe Chris up at BustedBus might.  Anybody else had this problem?  I guess I should have only turned the water on 1/2 way. It was under a lot of pressure.  That's why their showers were so good, heh.  Cheers....KR
