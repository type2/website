Subject: carabus to BBB XI from Denver

My plan is to leave Denver on Wednesday afternoon for Santa Fe, NM.  
Leave Santa Fe on Thursday morning for Flagstaff, and then on to LHC on 
Friday morning.

Anyone going that way during those times?  There's strength in numbers, 
and I've never experienced a carabus before.

Looking forward to it all...
