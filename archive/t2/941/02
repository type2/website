I'd be surprised about it blowing air back into the engine cooling fan. 
  The majority of the warm air comes from the engine fan to begin with, 
so I highly doubt that the blower fan will blow air backwards.  The 
amount of air that the blower moves is pretty pitiful, really.. 
especially w/ all the bends in the ducts leading to the heat exchanges - 
plus, the connect at right angles!  I think those flaps are there to 
keep air from escaping when the engine is off and the blower is still 
on.  Now, if you don't have the blower on and the blower is missing 
*its* flaps, that would be bad.

I think it could also melt in the front after reinsulating the main 
pipe.  My vertical pipe up front gets hotter than I can stand to touch 
so I imagine it's even hotter under the bus.  I am working on a modified 
system as described in another email.  I just finished fabricating the 
vent today and I should have it installed sometime this weekend.  It 
utilizes an auxiliary blower (in addition to the one in the engine 
compartment), but is not in-line with the hot air tube.  I will post 
results when I finish.
