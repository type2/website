Many years ago, before I knew the definition of Barn Door Bus.. circa 
1980... i took pictures of a bus..

I wish I could go back and look at it again.. to answer questions ,, but I 
can't .. I have no idea where it went.

my Guess.. a late barn door?  1954.. as it has pivots on the door vent 
windows.. not piano hinges,, but hey,, what do *I* know!

the pictures shows... 
http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/pictures/2172.jpg

typical Barn Door features on the windshield ,, no overhang...
pressed bumpers

strange ,, shorter than normal  "Barn Door"   with VENTS
no vents in the body..

tail lights,, well anything could have happened over the years on them...

and there is a roof hatch of some sort.

anything else.??

btw,, I took this picture,, then lost a hard drive,, but I had loaded it to 
vintagebus.. so I was able to get it back...
that is why it has vintagebus watermark
