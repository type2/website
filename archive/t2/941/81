Subject: Looking for an engine- AVP?

I'm looking to put either a new or rebuilt engine in my 68' (my  
current engine is fully toast).  Since I don't have many local  
options (Annapolis, MD), I've been looking around for some options.   
Can anyone offer some thoughts on AVP?  Others I should consider?  I  
am fully aware of GEX, so that should cut down on some of the email :-)
