Subject: Burning Buses

The request for a fuel shutoff solenoid rekindled an
old "flame" for me. It's something all of us with FI
buses should really consider retrofitting. The Ford
item XF3Z9341AA sells new for about $16.00. What this
will do is shut off the fuel pump in the event of a
collision. I had planned on adding one when I put the
Subey in and just never got back to it. It just moved
way up my priority list. I'll see about picking one at
the local wrecking yard and shoot some pics.

Our fuel pumps are capable of pumping at over 100psi
if there is a blockage of the return line. Whereas it
is highly unlikely that the fuel pump will keep on
pumping once the engine has died, it is possible. It
may also be a good time to add another relay and a
switch easy to reach from the drivers seat so you can
kill the pump in event of fire (no collision.) This
could also be a carjacking safety switch, but even
though carjackers are stupid, I highly doubt any are
stupid enough to jack a VW bus! (Not an insult to
buses, BTW!) -BaH
