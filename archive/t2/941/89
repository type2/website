Oops, didn't know that.  Thanks.

actually 4 doors make a Double Door Bus  The engine hatch that goes from the
beltline down is a Barn Door..

Thanks, Jamie.  I didn't notice in the movie if it had doors on both sides.
They all got out on the right side of the bus.

Does the barn door hatch open to just the engine compartment?  It looks huge
by comparison to my '77's hatch.  And I was wondering if there really was
room in there for that radio/remote thing?
