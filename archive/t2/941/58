First thing I'd do is remove that second battery and any related
wiring and such. If you can take some pics we can help you determine
what's right and what's wrong.

That wire screwed to the side of the engine compartment is what has me baffled.

So get us those pics! And if you post a general location (Like mine's
the "Denver area") maybe someone close by can help out.
