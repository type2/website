Subject: Aircooled rpms and tach - recommendations.

I know this has been talked about before, but I want to hear the exprienced
people give their opinion. I have a tach in my 77 Westy 2.0L aircooled and
going by ear, it sounds like 4000rpm is a good redline number to use when
shifting. I am going by my gut reaction here; it seems like 2000rpm is getting
into 'lugging' so I shift down at that speed, and usually find my shifting
comfort between 3000 and 4000rpm. 3000 on the flats, and 4000 to really get
some steam up for a hill.Does that roughly coincide with anyone using a tach ?
It sounds like above 4000 is really over revving.
Thought I'd ask,
Courtney
