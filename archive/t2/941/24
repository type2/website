Do the cabin recirculation setup and then any warm air will end up in 
the rear of the bus.  heck, you could just put something over the vent 
to stop it from coming up.  Or, you probably fabricate something as 
well.  Regardless, with the recirculation setup, at least you're not 
sending heat back into the engine compartment.

You found a squirrel cage fan that can handle high temps and runs on 
12v?  Please let me know the brand because I was looking for one and 
couldn't find anything.  If my current idea doesn't work, I'll go for 
the inline squirrel setup.
