Get 'em while ya can.  Looks like Maisto has discontinued 'em and Target (at
the stores I checked this week/weekend) are now OUT for good.

I checked w/Maisto last week about getting some for Airhead Parts' toy
selection, but they said Target took most of 'em all and they weren't sure
they'd have any more in the forseeable future.  I picked up a couple
online to donate to the raffle at BBB XI :-)
