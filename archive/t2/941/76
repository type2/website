Subject: Re: [T2] best SIZE 15" tire for a 1971 Westfalia

I was  running 205/75/15AT on my 70 Rivi and now have them on my 68 DC. I
had slight rubbing when making U-turns on the inside of the wheel well neat
the frame not the outer lip. But again the rims are from a 60 split so the
offset tucks them in a bit, unlike early bug wheels that push the wheels out
so far you have to run real skinny tires so they fit under the rear. And
also I am wide 5 and 71 is small five so if you have the correct offset on
your rims 205 should be fine.
