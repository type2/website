Note - The Purple Bus with the "AudioBahn" Graphics online is still showing
at $41.99.  These were very hard to find in the stores, mostly online:

(May have to cut & paste URL)

The Blue Bus that had no "AudioBahn" Graphics were more common in the
stores.  But I couldn't find them online at Target this evening, nor could I
find the Bug(s) either.  But then I didn't do a massive search on their
site.  Collectors have probably bought 'em up to re-sell on EBarf.
