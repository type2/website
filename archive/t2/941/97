On Thanksgiving, I was at the in-laws and a couple of the boys were 
playing the Scarface video game I walked by just in time to see on of 
the boys almost wipe out a bus. I told him to be careful of the busses 
and then another one came around the corner, then he passed another and 
another. About every third or fourth vehicle in the game is a bus. I 
didn't look closely for details so if anyone else has the game maybe 
they could let us know what years there are.
