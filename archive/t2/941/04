I would recommend that you upate/replace the battery charger. It does 
not have a circuit that will prevent your battery from overcharging. Any 
modern basic battery charger will do that.

I also de-browned the interior of our Champagne Edition. I did it by 
recoloring the dash and buying new door panels. Old ones were dead-dead.

Good luck with your project!
