I think at idle (ONLY) the aux blower will be able to push more air 
through the heat exchangers than the engine fan and for this condition 
only there are the little aluminum flappers in the engine fan shroud. 
Then under all other conditions the flappers in the aux fan keep the 
engine cooling air from pushing backwards through the aux fan under all 
conditions. Mine was missing one of the lower flappers and one of the 
upper flappers. The other upper flapper was warped from heat and not 
closing. Thus no heat and some hot weather cooling air lost.

I'd add a bilge blower per heat exchanger but I have not figured out a 
flapper for the bilge blower... Not that I have given it alot of 
thought. Anyhow one bilge blower per side above the engine so they were 
pushing cool or cold air (the box that my blowers came in said they were 
not designed for anything over 176 degrees F). Have them blow right 
throw the stock hose, etc. Might add a recirculation feature to the 
driver's side so it was recirc some or all interior air while the 
passenger side was pushing only engine compartment air (i.e. fresh air). 
3-4 speeds, rubber mounts for the blowers, etc.

If I wanted to suck heat forward (and risk sucking exhaust into the 
system) I'd use a squirrel cage fan with a metal housing and a metal fan 
with the motor out of the air stream. I have one of these too. Might be 
a quieter blower than a bilge blower too mounted above the engine. 
Another idea would be to use two of the OEM VW bus aux fans - one per 
side  blocking the output necks of one side.

Just misc. ramblings.
