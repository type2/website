Chains?!?!? Wuss.

I gave my chains to Troy. (Actually, I had 2 sets... heh)

The Guac did just fine without chains. I just got home after leaving
work and running a couple errands.

I love the SUVs that get stuck though. I have a coworker with a 2wd
explorer and she was wondering why she couldn't get through the snow.
LOL!
