Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel shut off solenoid?

I found this info which my be helpful to you:

The inertia fuel pump shut off switch will shut off
the power to the
pump in the event you have a accident. It also will
shut it off if you
hit a speed bump going too fast. It happened to me
once when I had
the intertia switch under the hood. That is the reason
I moved it in
to the car where I can reach it. That one time is the
only time it has
shut off. The inertia switch has a reset button that
you simply push
to reset it.

The inertia switch is from any fuel injected Ford from
1980-2000. its
in the trunk on the left side behind a panel that is
almost always
marked that the emergency fuel cut off is behind it.
Be shure to cut
the harness as far back as you can when removing the
switch. With
out the 2 wire harness its going to be hard to connect

A anti theft fuel pump switch can be placed before or
after the inertia
switch to cut power to the fuel pump if you want.
