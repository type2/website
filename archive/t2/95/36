=========================>
I did Casper's last April, and did the whole fuel tank thingy.
The POR materials work great, and I am quite pleased with the results.

To hasten drying, I hooked up the (SUCTION) side of my shop vac so as to 
draw air through the tank.

I fit the fuel gauge sender hole with a filter made out of an old pair 
panty hose so as to not suck anything into the tank.
