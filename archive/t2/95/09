Hi,

There have been some minor updates to the EveryBus web site. Of major 
importance are the activities page, the carabus page, and the fees on 
the main page. Please use the link www.mindspring.com/~ncbus/ because 
I am currently unable to access everybus.com. I will try and get 
something going with Steve on that when I get a chance. If you are 
planning on coming let me know and I will add your name and email to 
the carabus page.

Greg Potts has designed a wonderful flyer in .pdf format. Once Greg 
finalizes some details that will be made available from the web site 
for you to download and print.
