Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic.....bus encounters not FS

I know the frustration all too well. I used to comb older neighborhoods =
in search of old VW's (older neighborhoods are less likely to have =
homeowners associations, therefore older non-running cars are usually =
not a problem). I found about a dozen (Bugs, Ghias, and Buses). Some I =
talked to the owners, others I left notes on the doors and some folks =
called me. No one was willing to sell-it was always "I.m going to =
restore it" or "It's too valuable". I kept a log of street addresses =
where I found them. Two years later I drove back by each house-you =
guessed it-EVERY vehicle I asked about was still sitting in the exact =
same spot! One poor '64 Bug was sitting next to the house with plywood =
and other junk piled on top of it-two years later it was still there =
with more junk piled on it. The owner told me it  was too valuable to =
sell, and a "classic". Such a waste.... Jeff
