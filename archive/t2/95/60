No question about it.  Stay with the BUS 2.0!!!  

If you need to repaint the nice solid wooden door on your house, you don't 
replace it with a hollow-core that also needs to be repainted.  

There is absolutely ZERO benefit of a 914 1.7 or 1.8 motor over its 1.7 or 1.8 
bus brethren (unless of course you're putting it in a 914 and then that 
dipstick tube thing becomes very important).  The only benefit of a 914 2.0 
over a bus 2.0 is the redesigned heads that give some increases in horsepower 
(but not much in torque).
