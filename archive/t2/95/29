Jason,

Tow that bus to Boulder and use our garage this weekend. Probably not an
option for you. Seriously, get yourself some plastic drape it over the back
of the bus and tent it off on the ground behind you and throw a small heater
in there. If you don't have a heater then drag some 5 gallon buckets of hot
water out, it is highly inefficient but it will help.

Hi Folks,

Tomorrow is Engine Day!  In addition to being Groundhog Day and the pagan
holiday of Candlemas, I'm putting in my newly-rebuilt Jake Raby 2.0 FI, and
Sweet Pea will be running again!  I'm very excited, except for the fact that
it's expected to be crystal-clear and about 12 degrees (F).

So, as a Friday thing, I wanted to get some ideas from The List on how
cold-weather folks keep warm while they work outside.  So far I've tried to
bundle up, put on gloves and wool socks, drink hot tea, get a heater, and
take frequent warm-up breaks.  Short of having a heated garage, this is
about the best I can do.

Thanks for any suggestions or ideas...

1979 Westy "Sweet Pea"  <-- to be running by next week!
