Hi Chris,

I see the same thing here in the Toronto area. When the new beetle came out
the price of aircooled beetles doubled instantly, they were "Collectible".

They sit unrestored & forgotten until they are too rusty to move and 5 hard
winters later they go off to the crusher without doing anyone any good.

Now buses are going through the same cycle; a rusty wreck that hasn't turned
a wheel in years will still command a US$2K asking price, even though it
will need at least that or more just to get it back on the road. And I have
yet to see a single ad that doesn't mention a recently rebuilt engine.

Well, what can you do? Just be all the more appreciative of what you've got,
that's what. Look after it carefully, tend to its troubles regularly and it
won't wind up in the care of those not-so well-meaning.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
