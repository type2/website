Subject: RE: [T2] Front Spoiler

Hi Robert (et al)

The spoiler fitted to my bus (previously on a '73) does help to keep the
front end steady in windy conditions; didn't notice any change in mpg when
it was fitted though.

The company which make them produce spoilers for
Splits, Bays (per '73 and post '72), and vanagons
The also produce side skirts for Bays and Vanagons and ridged spare wheel
covers.
All of these are in GRP, no coloured gel coat so it's easy to paint to match
own colour scheme

contact details are:-

My Bay fitted with Elite Spoiler, side skirts and spare wheel cover can be

Might anyone on the list be able to direct me in the proper direction in
which to obtain a front spoiler/ air dam for my 1978 Baywindow Bus? I've
reviewed the archived materials, and found that the spoiler offered by JC
Whitney is NLA. I've been very interested in obtaining a similar spoiler to
the one that Mr. Bob Wallace has fitted to his 1998 Brazilian T-2, as shown
in the Library section of the Type 2 web site. Any and all help would be
very
much appreciated.
Regards,
Robert
