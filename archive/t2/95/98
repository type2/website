I would take this very seriously!!!!!
The flaps are at the front of the heat exchangers or boxes.
If you look at where your exaust bolts on to your engine at the front, just
above that flange an accordion looking tube will meet up with a popcan sized
thinga majig with a cable connected to the outside of it.
When you pull dash levers to the "heat" position, the cable opens the valve
allowing warmed air to travel up the tubes to you cab.
When the dash levers are in the "off" position the return spring inside the
valve closes it and directs the warm air out the bypass opening on the top
of the valve.
If you still have heat in the off posotion the springs probably are'nt
closing the valves completely, usually due to cables binding or sticky
valves .
More importantly though, take care of the exaust leak.
It could be coming from a bad gasket at the head to heater box flange or the
muffler donut gaskets or anywhere else between the heads and tailpipe.
Also check that your crankcase breather hose on your generator stand is not
leaking as that would be a silent source of exaust leaking into the engine
compartment, where it will be pumped directly into your heating system by
the fan.
Also check that the seal between your engine tin and body is good, as exaust
from a perfectly sealed system will be sucked in by the engine fan while
sitting at stop light.

I was sitting at a stop light once listening to my rotten exaust going
wack-wack-wack ala Harley-Davidson when suddenly I fainted and woke up when
my head hit the steering wheel-----total panic------light turns
green---------take off with head out window taking deep breaths until I had
room to turn into parking lot where I disconnected my heater tubes and
counted my remaining lives.

Hope this helps.
