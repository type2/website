Well, new belts are certainly good, but remember that the first time you
use them they become used belts!

I have more confidence in a used genuine VW seat belt than I do in an
aftermarket belt.

Certainly, a belt from a vehicle newer than your own will be better, as
long as it hasn't been stressed in a collision.  How do you tell if it has
been stressed?  Well, I checked the vehicle that I unbolted it from!

The same belts and retractors used in late bugs was also used in later
model Audis and watercooled VWs.  You could even get them in colors.

Lefts and rights are identical, so I took belts from the passenger sides
of two Audis for my '71s front seat.
