Something I always find helpful when lying on the ground (and let's face it,
how many bus jobs are there where you don't have to lie on your back?):  Get
a large cardboard box, flatten it and lie on that.  Very comfy.  Ideally you
want a double or triple wall box, the sort of size a flatpack cupboard or
washing machine might come in.
