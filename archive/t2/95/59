Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic.....bus encounters not FS

while adding mental inventory of dead in the water buses in my town i found
a 68 hard-top camper rotting in someone's driveway. it was last plated in
95 or so. i returned near dinner time to ask those in the home if they
belonged to the bus. their eyes brightened. to them i seemed to be asking
for the rig with a money offer. that seemed encouraging as i spoke. i
didn't want the bus though; just the half roof rack. during the course of
my request, their attitude and body language changed for the worse: i got
the feeling taking the roof rack was like taking their dog or something.
perhaps they thought i was turning their driveway into a pick and pull.
restrategizing. any ideas :)   - steve
