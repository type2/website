I saw this thread and before I looked and thought about it I was sort of of
the notion $2500 for a camper kit to put in a friggin bay window!!!!!!!
But now
I sort of agree oddly enough on this one with Steve, although a good DIYer
could certainly make a similar interior for probably $1000 in parts even with
the sink, stove, etc, you got to figure your time into the matter a bit.  And
that kit looks pretty darn slick, as nice as a Vanagon in the pics but it
will be interesting to see what the quality of execution is really like.
Would
I pop $2500 for a kit to put in a bus, probably not I'd just go find a real
Westy
interior, but that can take some time, and in the end may not be as
functional.  His point is fair as well on original cost, I think I recall some
pricing in '76 that even the hardtop interior added about $1250-$1500 to the
price of a new bus, and that is what $5000 in todays dollars.  Not for
everyone certainly but pretty neat.
