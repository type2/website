Billy,

Trot on down to Home Depot and price the flat-pack "Mills Pride" kitchen
cabinets, then over to a furninture store and try to fill your
house/apartment with furniture similar to what you have now.

Particle board and laminate may be cheap, but case work is *expensive*!
If you had the choice in the 1970s, the optional Westy package would have
set you back about what this package will cost you.  I am amazed that they
kept the cost down as low as they have.

I am looking at and lusting after the latest Westfalia package  (the
"James Cook") and figure that it probably will add at least $25,000 to the
base price of the shell. Compared to $25,000, $2,500 soulds very nice :-)
