Dave,
 The stuff is really smelly and it takes awhile to dry. It was four days
before I re-installed mine. I also took my wife
hair dryer(she even offered it to me) and put the dryer on low and stuck it
in the fuel filler neck. I put the tank outside
because of the smell,but because it was cold it kept the dryer from
overheating. The tank felt slightly warm and mean
very slightly warm. It says on the por-15 can not to use heat to help dry it.
I left the dryer on overnight and the tank
was dry to the touch inside. It was still strong smelling inside so I let it
air out a couple more days. I did use the dryer
a couple more times for 1 hour intervals to help it air out which I don't
think it really needed. It just made me feel better.
