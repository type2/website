Subject: The usual question - What Gasheater for my 79 Westy??

My westy has airconditioning but no heater. Living in B.C. I kinda figure a
heater would be more appropriate. What heater came on the 79 Bays, and can
they be retrofitted without disassembling the last nut and bolt on the
vehicle? What electrical mayhem is needed? Will I survive the ordeal? What
price is involved? I know this has been asked before, but I'm 47 and I can
only remember what happened in the last 30 minutes. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
