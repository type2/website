Subject: Re: [T2] Belly pans?

We had a 75 westy for a long time and it indeed had a bolt on pan that went
from the front crossmember between the nonexistent "Jack Sockets" to the
corresponding rear crossmember.
Between the pan and floor was the corroded remains of an in line gas heater.
This seems like a much better way of getting the meagre heat to the front of
the bus .
My assumption was, as already mentioned, that this replaced the structural
integrity lost in the roof .
I also remember being under a split window camper of some sort and seeing a
similar arrangement w/out gas heater, but the pan was smooth and welded as
opposed to "shaped" and bolted on.
Ring any bells?
Brian
