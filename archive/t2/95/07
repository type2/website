Sunlight does 'em in too. And the stuff you spill on them, rough stuff you
might drag them across, the sand on your swimsuit after a day at the
beach...

Old paranoid Jim again: I wouldn't install used seatbelts any more than I'd
drive on used tires, sleep on a used mattress or eat used food. You're never
sure just what those things have been through. I figure that if Dale
Earnhardt could manage to break a new seat belt that's of far higher
strength than the ones we use in our Buses (5,000psi tensile strength
minimum), I'm not chancing it with a used one.
