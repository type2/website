Subject: Friday topic.....bus encounters not FS

Hi all,

     Had to jump in on this thread.  About 4 years ago, a rather nice 68-71 
Westy showed up on the outskirts of town.  This thing looked great.  It was 
parked at a farm, next to the barn, but visible from the road. 
    A few weeks later, we noticed that that bus never moved.  We stopped and 
talked to the owner, and he said he went "down south" to get a clean rust 
free bus, so he would have something solid to work with.  Shortly after he 
trailered it up here (Wisconsin), the motor quit running, so there the bus 
sat. 
    Fast forward to a few months ago.   Bus is STILL sitting in the same 
spot, outside, and when I stopped by to inquire about the bus, the owner had 
the same attitude as the previous story....."Does it SAY for sale on it?!? I 
am sooo sick of you (----) people stopping here....."  and on and on.

       I did manage to sneak a peak at that bus before I was tossed off the 
property.   What was once a gorgeous bus, is going downhill fast.  Sitting 
outside after 4 years on a farm, through 4 wisconsin winters, and, to make 
matters worse, all of the runoff from the roof of the barn lands directly on 
the bus...you can only imagine.

   What prompts some people to do this, to what was once a great bus?
   
     Misunderstanding some folks.
