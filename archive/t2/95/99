Congrats Wade,

Its a strange "copyright" world out there!  Founder Walter Taylor left the 
Taylor winery in NY and started a new label named "Bully Hill".  He was 
prevented by his old company from having his own last name appear anywhere on 
the labels of his new company, even as as part of his signature!
