Subject: Friday.... Not to worry

A cold front has blown in on  us, and that may make my weekend plans of 
installing a new clutch into NewBus a bit less comfy than anticipated, 
but........ I have a new issue...

Just went out to run an errand.
Hopped in NewBus.
He fired right up without so much as even a little bit of a chance to hear 
the starter motor,
.............. then he promptly died !

He continues to crank quite vigorously on more start attempts, and will 
fire right up on some of my attempts, ................... but then he very 
quickly dies.

I suspect an ignition problem, and will sort it out tomorrow.
Need to install some new electricals while the engine is out anyway.

Just the other day, I noticed what I thought was a bit if mis-firing as I 
got quite close to the house from having run another errand.
Figured I would check out the source this weekend.

You know, I have NEVER been "dead stranded stuck" by any of my buses.

EVERY TIME,
If they have some trouble,
it has always been right at the campsite or right at home.

These old wheels are really quite kind to me, and always seem to want to 
warn me of their difficulties when and where it might be easy for me to 
work on them.

Friday problem?
yeah.
Worried?
nah.
Feeling warm and fuzzy about my bus?
You bet !!
