Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Friday - Bus encounter...

Send two like this - sort off.

One is a salvageable 60's double cab along our route to my parent's house.

The house it is parked next to has caved in and the woman is in her 70's 
but she is not going to sell this thing 'cause she is going to fix it up - 
and the other 9 cars on the property. The VW is safe though 'cause you 
can't see it for the bushes...

The other was a '65 Vert that I saw in VA on my trips home from Norfolk. It 
had a few salvageable pieces like the engine lid (I WANTED THAT SO BAD) but 
the rest of the car is a hair from being a big pile of rust.

He said he would sell it for about $1750. I had to try hard not to giggle 
when he said that!!!

Hope your raving old bus owner didn't scare your 2 year old. Our son is 2 
on March 30th.
