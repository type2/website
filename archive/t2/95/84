Sorry I did not read this one and reply last night.
Yes, it is 10mm. About 3" long.
[before the filter and after the pump, it is 7.5mm]
Go to your local Mercedes dealership parts dept. and ask for
part number 112 476 12 26. Maybe they will give you a short piece.....since a
meter of it lists for $15.50 and you don't need all that much [39 1/4"]
