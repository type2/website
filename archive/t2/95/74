This is a good topic, 

My entire VW experience evolved from a situation quite
similar.  My bus is a 73' Westy that my brother
watched for about eight years or so.  It was perfect
and slowly decayed into a weed and rodent condo :-) 
He did some research and found that it had been stolen
from a guy who had had it for a few weeks and the
carbs stripped off of it.  He ran the plates and got
the title from the insurance company, then had to
"resteal" it from the farmer who was trying to sell it
to him to cover "storage fees"... go figure :-)

I brought her back from the dead in 99' and have been
using her as my daily driver for three years now. 
It's been an education that I never would have
imagined getting!  

The only thing that is cooler than being a bus pilot
is geting to know all the other VW folk in their
various states of mind and circumstance.  Overall I've
found everyone to be extremely generous, intelligent
and open (not like the folks I knew in my dads British
car clubs at all, bunch of snotty uptight pretentious
people).

Happy Friday!
Brian
