I will have individual component pricing shortly. Sorry, no way to ship from
the west coast, just from Pennsylvania. However, it is my hope that it will
be able to go UPS, which will keep shipping costs down. It's very close to
UPS's size limit so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I should have exact
shipping dimensions from Just Kampers tomorrow, so then we'll know.
(Regardless, it ships in seven boxes, so we're not talking dirt cheap
shipping here no matter how you do it.)

Yes, it's a lot of money, but not for what you get.  It's not just a bunch
of plywood.  It includes literally EVERYTHING you need to turn an empty bus
into a full-blown camper - the sink (with electric pump and fresh water
tank), propane stove, 12-volt fridge, cabinetry, hardware, and instructions
(easy assembly - think Ikea). Everything is there but the upholstery for the
sofabed.  This lets you put a brand new camper interior with modern
conveniences (a la Vanagon or Eurovan Westy) into a Bus, easily and without
having to pay for professional installation.  It just can't be done for a
grand.  In fact even at the estimated $2300 range it's a bit of a tight
profit margin, believe it or not; allowing for the risk of currency
fluxuations I might have to price it even a bit higher just to protect
myself.

Of course there is also a lower priced package shown on the same page (which
still includes the appliances) if you don't want to go all out.

Again, pictures and details can be found at
