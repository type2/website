Subject: Unlucky sighting (for me) Friday content

Last Monday I was visiting some friends in West Lafayette, In. As I left
their place and turned onto the main road I noticed the local police car
at the light. He followed me a few blocks and pulled me over. He said I
was not staying in my lane. He wanted to search my ride which I agreed
to since I didn't have anything to hide. He looked all thru Roger and
then asked me lots of questions. He said he'd just finished a drug class
and Roger looked like a suspicious vehicle. We talked awhile and he let
me go on. He turned out to be kinda cool. The joke was on him-I haven't
used anything illegal for almost 20 years! He was way too late.
