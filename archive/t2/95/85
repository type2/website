If one does the currency conversion some of Axel Stauber's stuff in Germany
is down right reasonable.
 
I am assuming that the posted prices include the German 16% tax.
 
For example if you subtract the 16% from the price of a front floor mat
(66.08) you wind up with a price of. . .
 
$56 FOR A 68-FRONT FLOOR MAT!!!
 
It would appear that it is a genuine VW part too since the VW part number is
given.
 
Hmmmmm. . . I wonder how much shipping would be?
