Subject: rocker arm spring

Hey Volks,

I'm on the road, stopped off in San Luis Obispo,CA on my way up to 
Mt. Shasta, and when I got up this morning to do my valves, I
found that the spring which holds the rocker arm (#2 exhaust)
in place, had snapped and was in two pieces in my valve cover.

Any recommendations on where I can pick one up locally?
i.e. VW engine builders/shops/parts-shops in the 
San Luis Obispo, CA area which would have a rocker arm spring for a 
1600DP?

Give me a call at 805-441-3529 (my friend Tyler's phone) if you do.

much thanks,
	tom
