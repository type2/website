We'll have these available as well (for left hand drive vehicles of course),
on a special order basis.  Delivery will be about 6-8 weeks from the time
you place your order.  A British pound is about $1.50, so that will give you
an idea of price.  Shipping charges will be from Pennsylvania, not from
England.  However, the interiors are heavy and bulky, so shipping still
won't be particularly cheap.
