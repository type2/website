Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Swat

Folks,

Two years ago I was out doing the same thing. I spotted about 15 buses in an
old lot and found the owner, a retired vw parts business man was now living
in Washington state. A few months later I went back, saw a nice panel with
Washington plates and stopped in. When I asked him (Jim) what was up with
all the buses he told me that they were left over from his closed business,
Recycled Auto Parts. I asked him if he would sell them and he did, along
with his entire inventory of bay window bus parts. That is how BUStedBUS
started.

I was simply a bus owner looking for parts for my 72 camper that I paid $400
for. Know after two years of dismantling fixing, buying, selling buses and
parts and sitting down with Jim for a several months to pass the baton so to
speak and, well, several thousands of dollars and many sleepless nights
later, I know own and operate BUStedBUS. We currently have 17 such buses on
the lot and thousands of used, new and rebuilt parts in boxes and on
shelves.

We are the bus salvage grave yard. The buck stops here so to speak. We never
dismantle a bus before its time and when we do, we don't miss a bolt or a
straight panel. So don't worry the next time you see a dead bus in someone's
back yard, sooner or later it will come home to that little place up high
(5280 ft above sea level anyway) to Beautiful Boulder, Colorado. Where it
can shine next to its old friend from the assembly line and then spread its
love around the world.

Share in that love and support BUStedBUS.com, buy you parts recycled.
Keeping your dream alive,

Joe Mitchell

--We need a T2 list task force to quickly pool money/resources/parting
out/rebuilding skills for these type of situations.

I suggest two squads, one to detain/negotiate with lame owners, another to
remove said volkswagens to a secure location.

Who's with me?!

Names have been changed to protect the innocent.
