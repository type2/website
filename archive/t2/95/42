Boy, I like this idea, having considered redoing my camper interior custom, then I saw the price, then I did the multiplication, choke!

Seems kinda steep for plyboard. I'd be happy even up to a grand, but you're looking at 2,242.50 for the upper end job before shipping it across country. I don't have that furniture value in my living room.

Not dogging the depot at all, of course. I'm glad you're stocking this.

I wonder what the individual components will cost. Does your 5% discount apply here? Any westcoast distributors to help with the shipping?
