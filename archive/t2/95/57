Same here in tiny town Tennessee.

Me neither. I would always plan on a new motor no matter what - look how 
many folks have new motors that croak on this list.

I am careful to grab up what I figure will wear out on my bus when the 
cheap opportunities present themselves - extra transaxles, motors, 
starters, etc. Most of them have value as cores and little else but 
sometimes these old parts will last long enough to save up money or time to 
repair my good stuff (or just rebuild your cores ahead of time).

I just wonder how many VW's have to disappear before they reach collector 
status. I don't expect our VW's to reach mid-fifties T-bird, Chevy or 
Corvette status of course.

180K miles and shooting for 400K miles.
