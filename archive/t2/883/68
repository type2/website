Subject: Interior jalousie seal

Hello to you all.

It has been a long time since I've started the restauration process of my
camper bus. I've been buying parts from all over the world - bustedbus,
justkampers, theSamba, ebay.de..etc.
However, I'm still looking for the interior seal for the a jalousie window
(the one that covers the screws). Is it still possible to get it, anywhere?
Thanks in advance.
Have a nice weekend.
Best regards from Lisbon, Portugal.

Joao
