This isn't quite true. Balljoints on busses go bad and the bus can still be
quite drivable. They do make a pop sound when bad and you go over a bump or
drop. They seldom fail catastrophically, usually people fix them long
before. The ball joints (and the rest of the front end) are very robust and
over designed, so rather than failing, they wear out and funny noises ensue,
but the front end still hangs together.
