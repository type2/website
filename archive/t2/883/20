Subject: RE: [T2] CHT gauge testing

I can't help but get upset every time I read stuff about CHT gauges. 

I purchased a brand new VDO CHT Gauge from some shop online. I don't remember where anymore. Anyway, the CHT gauge NEVER worked. I get so upset over the fact that I blew ~$80 bucks on something that simply didn't work. I did everything as was instructed. I installed the sender under the spark plug, and used all the enclosed wiring. I didn't cut it, or try to extend it in any way. I wired it right up to the gauge like I was supposed to and it never registered ANY reading whatsoever. 

What's worse is that the place I bought it from doesn't accept returns.
