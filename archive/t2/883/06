Subject: Ball joints?

Hi All, 

On my drive home in the afternoons, I pass through a pair of dips in the
road.  I noticed that when the driver's side front wheel drops away from
the body, there's a pretty loud "POP!" sound.  I'm suspecting it's one
of the ball joints, but when the alignment was done around a month ago,
the technician at Sears checked them and said they were fine.  :/  Could
be he just didn't know how to check them.  

My other thought is that I'm hearing it bottom out on a probably badly-
worn snubber and the various heavy metal parts are coming pretty close
to banging together.  

Thoughts?  Do I need to make that special tool to check for play in the
ball joints?  

Sure wish my floor jack would raise up high enough to lift the wheel of
the bus off the ground... as it is I can barely take the weight off the
wheel. Need to build a platform for it. :/
