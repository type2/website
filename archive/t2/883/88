Subject: Body work advice requested

Hey folks... Moved my bus around last night and added a dent to the 
passenger door just below the vent window. Basically the body rib there 
is now flat... UGH!

So how would you get the metal pushed back out?

Already have decided I will need to remove the door and then the glass...

Can I pry it out? Heat and tap? Thanks... Door is otherwise excellent...
