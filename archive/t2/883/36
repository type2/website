Subject: correct vacuum can

Since switching my 74 single cab to FI, I think I should probably change the distributor vacuum can.  It still has the proper distibutor for a 73 CB manual transmission engine, thus it has the dual vac can.  Or can I just unhook the retard side and time it at 7.5 before tdc?  I don't know where to hook the retard to on the engine.  thanks, greg
