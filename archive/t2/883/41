The  rebuilders ship you an engine that is guaranteed to have exhaust

that they won't cover an overheated engine which is what happens  when  
the head overheats at the exhaust port due to a poorly  fitting  
exhaust manifold. Sloppy welding at the exhaust port is  another  
culprit that gives you warranty headaches.

Hey Richard  This is why the only way I will do an engine is turn  key.  
First you are trusting some over informed  person to properly  install what has to 
be one of the worse designed exhaust systems ever not to say  anything about 
all the other parts correctly. I wont start on all the engines I  have seen 
butchered and put together wrong. I had a type 1 come in yesterday  that didn't 
have any clylinder tin work at all :)  or even worse the GEX  motor with the 
deflector tin on top of the clylinders.  Warrenty ya right I  am not going to 
let anybody else do an engine other than myself. turn key means  you bring me 
the whols bus and when you come to get it you get in and TURN THE  KEY and 
drive away.  Later mark dearing  Salem Import Service   Salem va    est. 1980
