Subject: Cases difference

Gentlemen's

I have a few cases (Pancake) in my shop and i was wondering about theirs 
subtle difference, if any.... regardless of the "Dip stik" location 
(Vanagon), closed oil breather box, mechanical fuel pump hole... what 
other more important difference do you know of???

The reason i'm asking is that i bought a few german set of NEW ( from a 
old VW shop that closed) pistons and cylinders (2.0L), i even have 2 set 
of NEW 2.0L square port heads (79-83) and 1 AMC. I have 4 different 
cases, 1700 (CD), 1800(AW), 2000(GD) and 1 Vanagon (CV). I have also 1 
NEW 2.0L crank and rod...

My goal is to built a few hydro 2.0L engine for my customers whan the 
worse happen! i have enough set of hydro kit (pusrods, lifters....) i'm 
missing some cams and cranks but will find them slowly.

Anyway, if anything come in mind, please let me know.

Regards, Ben
