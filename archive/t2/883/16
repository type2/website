Sooo.... One simple and OBVIOUS detail was missed? I wonder what other not
so obvious details were also missed? Little things like degreeing the cam
maybe? Getting the valve train geometry right? Installing the pistons right
side up?

Sorry, but if the obvious stuff is missed, I get nervous about the hidden
stuff. That goes for any product, not just VW engines. If I go to purchase a
washing machine and the door is crooked, do I figure "Well, no biggie. It's
just the door..." or do I say, "No WAY I'm buying that thing!"
