Subject: Re: Interstate 80 from SLC to Reno

Hi Courtney,

May I suggest something different?  If this is your vacation, get off the
dismal turnpike of Hwy 80 and drop down to Hwy 50, which is the only true way
to experience the space of Nevada.  Called the 'loneliest highway in America',
Hwy 50 is what driving the American West is all about: miles and miles of
desert and salt flats, the occasional cow, small cowboy towns, glorious space.
No Wal-Marts, no Starbucks, no truck stops, no Super 8, no homogenization.
Just a lone remaining stretch of refreshing idiosyncracy.  For a place to
stop, you might consider Eureka.  I was through there a few years ago, and it
hadn't changed much since the time I worked on a ranch near there in the 60s.
There was still a bar that served great steak sandwiches.  Someone had taken
over the old ramshackle hotel and was renting the quaintly old-fashioned rooms
to travelers.  You won't be sorry.  Or maybe you will, but you won't forget
it.

See you on the road,
Jerry

Going to be cruising through here in July and just wondering what the
scenery,
little towns etc are like along the way? I plan on leaving early from SLC one
morning so looking for a stop along the way, say in Winnemucca. We are
travelling in our new Mazda M3 so looking for a good little hotel or motel
that is peaceful and quiet somewhere along the way to Reno. Anyone travelled
this way lately with some good recommendations re: place to stay,
restaurants,
things to see? This is our summer holiday.
Thanks,
Courtney
