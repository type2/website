Don,

I would not blame any rebuilder for this.  I expect to have to do this
adjustment on any newly studded head.  The tolerances on the VW
manifolds are incredibly tight (for no good reason, AFAICT) and the
manifolds warp over time. As a result, it's pretty much guaranteed that
your header won't mate with any head right off, even if they put a
factory jig on the studs before the engine goes out the door.  A little
adjustment is par for this particular course. Fortunately, it's an easy
adjustment to make once you know it can be done.
