Did you ever try to switch the leads on the back of the gauge? There was a
problem over the past 2 years or so (seems to now be fixed) where some of
the VDO CHT gauges did not work out of the box, but if you reversed the
sender leads they worked perfectly. We had 4 or 5 like this a year+ ago,
none recently.
