Subject: Free 68-74,79 Exhaust 

Hey guys,

    I hope I got the years right, but I have a free exhaust system that I'm
giving away. It's a good solid Pace Setter dual exhaust system. (I think it
was originally for a Porsche 914???).

Anyway, it's got some surface rust on the tubing, but the exhuast is
completely solid and the tips are good. If anyone in the South Florida area
would like it, please eMail me.

I removed it from my 1973 VW Bus because I just installed an OEM style single
exhuast from the Bus Depot. I'm trying to restore my Bus to look original.


Thanks!

Todd
