Subject: Do not drive with sliding door open, ACHTUNG!!!

Hey guys,

      I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get some of the replacement OEM stickers for my Bus? I recently dissasembled the steering components inside the cabin, sanded them down and repainted them. You know that sticker that goes just forward of the steering wheel that says "Do not drive with sliding door open" (and then again in German), well... I'd really like to get a new one and put it on. Does anyone know where one might be available?

Thanks!!!

Todd
