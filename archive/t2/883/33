I get this frequently with exhaust components for the watercooled Vanagons.
They are even more convoluted than the OE system on the later Busses, and
once removed can be a bear to reinstall - after years of warping and
tweaking, they tend to 'readjust' themselves once you relieve the pressure
by unbolting them.  Every once in a while someone complains bitterly that
his new OEM manifold or pipe is "defective" and bent wrong because it
doesn't line up to his existing exhaust parts or brackets. It doesn't occur
to him that maybe the brand new part is within spec, and what's out of spec
are the decade-old parts he's mating it to. :-)
