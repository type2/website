Subject: Thanks for the advice...

Hi all, thanks for your advice,it makes sense to me now.I'll climbe underneath
and make sure I have no air in there(brake switches).I mustoff got air in
there when I replaced the switches.I get worried when others don't see any
brake lights and get real close when I have to stop!
