Subject: Re: [T2] Timing scale

Speaking of timing scales, has anyone attempted to make an
alternate scale, since these things are NLA?  Seems like you
could take a piece of paper or cardboard, trace the outline of
your fan pulley, and then figure out where 7.5 BTDC is and mark
the case (or whatever degree mark you wish). Maybe I'll dig out
my protractor....
