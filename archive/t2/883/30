Don,

I'm sorry.  I was not clear, but the reason that manifolds and heads don't
mate is far more likely to be a warped manifold than a mis-tapped stud.  That,
combined with VW's insane "DM" insistence on perfect tolerances.

Back a bit I was installing a new engine in my '73 and had the luxury of
having a selection of good used manifolds.  I tried three different manifolds
and not only did none fit the studs, none "didn't fit" in the same way.  I
used to just drill out the holes to a larger size as a matter of course, but
John Anderson showed me how to adjust the studs and I've been doing that ever
since...  the ends on those manifolds are *hard*!

I am perfectly willing to blame a rebuilder for problems of their making, but,
IMHO, this isn't one of them.

I disagree.

If I was building the engine myself, sure. If I'm dropping over a grand on an
engine, I refuse to deal with stuff like that. If it's such a simple
adjustment, it should be done by the builder.

But that's ok. I don't have a grand to drop on an engine anyway. ;)
