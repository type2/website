Will is absolutely correct.  No one should be dissuaded from installing a single 
readily available VDO based CHT guage on their air-cooled ride, even with it's 
known inconsistencies and plug installation hassle.  The aesthetics alone of 
watching the guage on my '71 kombi go up to 350-360F and no higher on the way up 
- and it's rapid drop to 250F once over the crest is worth the admission.  Or 
being able to see that it pegs at 340-350F at 65 on a hot day. Or using it as a 
reference to know when the heads are warm enough to leave the driveway on cold 
mornings.

For instance, irregardless of the ambient air temperature offset - which so far 
I've found to be in the 15-20 degree range at the very most, I was able to 
directly measure the cooling characteristics (#3 temperature differences under 
near identical road and air temperature conditions) between the original stock 
valve semi-hemi 7:1 heads versus the new home p&p'd 40X35.5 8:1 heads on my 
otherwise unchanged motor (except full advance down three degrees at 37 btdc). 
In this case the #3 plug (and by common sense inference the fresh head itself) 
shows distinctly lower temps under cruising or load conditions of about 20-25F. 
  I believe this shows that the better flow and burning characteristics of the 
new heads more than makes up for the increased compression ratio.  Another 
indicator  is a 7-8% mileage increase with no apparent pinging on regular.  Here 
the CHT offers insight on just what this change meant.
