Darren asked:


HI.  Inadvertently deleted the link I had to a bus raffle.  It was 
 posted in this group a couple of weeks ago and I can not find it in
the archives.
This was not for the Jerome raffle but previous to that.
 
 Any one out there who can guide me to the right place?
 
 It was for an older bus.   Wish I could remember more.    Thanks     Darren
