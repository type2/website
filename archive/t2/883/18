Corbett,
My 2E -34 cents on 4CHT gauges : useless. Unless you already have oil
pressure, oil temp, vacuum and AFM gauges installed.

You'll learn way more by having 4 different gauges than 4 identical.

And at the end of the day, I still do not believe in rigging my bus
with gauges anyway. that being said, I have a CHT, which never told me
anything.
