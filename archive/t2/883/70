Subject: Re: [T2] vdo rant-oil temp gauge-make your own

Somewhere in the archives I described making my own gauge for oil temp 
using a digital meat thermometer that reads from freezing to 400 deg or 
so- avaiable at any supermarket for under $20, by Taylor.  Can stay on 
for a year. Remove the sensor tube, extend it with brass tubing and 
epoxy, and run wire from it to the gauge end on your dash.  Great to see 
how long it takes for your engine to go to ambient at the campground, 
expaining why it is SO HOT to sleep if you arrive in the dark and go to bed!
