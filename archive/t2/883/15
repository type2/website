I just installed an AVP rebuild (via Bus Depot) last weekend and had
just this problem.  It's an easy one to fix. Thread a nut onto the stud.
Put a deep 13mm socket on your longest extension.  Put that on the nut
and "coax" the stud into the correct position.  The studs are relatively
soft and can be bent a fair amount without damage (like 3/4 of the studs
diameter in my case).  Work slowly, better to do it in 2-3 try than
overshoot in one.
