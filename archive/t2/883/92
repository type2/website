Subject: Interior Side Stiffeners

The A/C installation in my '72 Bus is proceeding without too many problems.  The hoses and electrical are run thru the floor and the side covers are being installed.  I need someone who has the Drivers Side Middle Panel off their Bus to make some measurements for me.

I need to know, measuring from the metal floor, the distance to the middle of each stiffener.  There should be two of them.  This will allow me to add extra hold down screws for the side hose cover without removing, and possibally damaging, my new interior panel.

I have many pictures of this "work in progress".  Does anyone know of a good place to post them?
