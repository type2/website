Subject: Re: [T2] vdo rant

What's funny is VDO used to have a great rep. What happened to them? I
remember in the 80's, if you had VDO gauges, you were da shizznit. And VW's
GTIs all had VDO gauges. Ooohs and Aaahs everywhere.

Now we hear these stories of craptastic VDOs and I have to wonder what
happened? (I'm not talking about the compensation required for the CHT
gauges, but general inaccuracy and poor construction.)
