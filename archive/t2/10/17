I need new rings, because my 77 Bus just burns too much oil, when 
accelerating.  I have been told if you just take out the heads, you can pull 
the pistons out and put new rings in, then close it up.  Probably put new 
bearing in it.  Is this a possibility, or will I have to tear apart my whole 
engine and replace lots of things?

Thanks for the help
Andrew
