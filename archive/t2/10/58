Subject: Torquing Heads


So I'd pulled the engine on my '71 bus last week
thinking I was going to torque the heads as I have
roughly 550 miles on the engine now.

Saturday morning I got a phone call from the guy I
bought the engine from and we're chit chatting when 
I mention that I'm going to torque the heads this
weekend.  He says, "I'm still not sure you need to 
bother with that, but..."

Well, he called me back about 15 minutes later and 
says that he just talked to the engine rebuilder
he got the engine from, who said something along the
lines of "the heads that are on that engine are Aluminum
and shouldn't need to be torqued", in addition to that,
they are apparently torqued to 28 ft. lbs (as opposed
to the spec 22-23 ft. lbs specified by Bentley).

Surely the engine builder, if he's worth his salt, has 
some knowledge of what works and what doesn't work on 
the engines he's building, but...I'm confused because:

a) aren't all 1600 VW Cylinder Heads aluminum?

b) what would make these heads so different that you'd torque
	them to 5 ft lbs more than spec?


Anyone have any info on this?  

I'm headed up north of Reno next weekend and need to get 
my engine back in relatively soon to make sure there
aren't any other bugs i need to work out before the
trip.  So, I'm inclined to re-torque the heads to spec
before the 1500 mile journey, but another part of me
says: Don't mess with head torque if it's working now
and you're about to put 1500 miles on the engine.

Thanks,
	tom
