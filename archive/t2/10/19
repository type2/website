"top end " only rebuilds have bitten one too many times....These engines are
approaching their 30th birthdays faster everyday....The only way to do it
right is to split the case, main reason being is that the cam starts to
really hurt after you lose some oil pressure to the rod bearings (the  oil
lubes the lobes quite a bit)so the cam wears like mad...take a peek and see
for your self..
