Hello,

I too have a 74 bus. When I first bought it, I knew
that it needed engine work ( carbs, distributor, tune
up, points, push rod tube seals, fluid change, ect),
but I figured that I should fix up the body first then
work on the engine. I went about trying to fix every
problem that it had on the body and I regret it. I
haven't drove the bus since it was driven home 3 years
ago. If I could start over again, I would have made it
road worthy first, then start on the body. I say this
because, My bus got to the point that I couldn't move
it across the yard due to lack of attention to the
drive train. If you choose to work on the engine first
and are forced to remove the engine, this gives you a
chance to fix the rust in the engine compartment which
is a plus as well. This way, when you are finished
with the engine, brakes, ect, you can fix the body a
section at a time and still drive to work. That was my
2 cent worth. Thanks!
