Subject: won't start

List,
 OK heres the deal I have a 79 poptop with a 2.0l brand new rebuild from
avp. I had it running a couple of times and didn't drive it much. I want
to get it going again but can't get it to start sooooo I try to jump
start it. Doesn't work and now when I turn the key no lights come on in
the instrument cluster, so I buy a new battery.. and still no lights
no start no nothing??? did I blow some kind of fuse trying to jump start
it ?? or am I just in need of professional help?? please help I really
want to get the bus running again

Regards
