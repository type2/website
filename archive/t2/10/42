Missy:
No, you have low oil pressure, most likely. Make SURE you are using either
40W (straight 40) oil or possibly synthetic. Owners' manuals are pretty
specific about this. Get a good brand of straight 40 W racing oil. It's made
to withstand the heat. The air in the hose will just squeeze and transmit
the pressure signal to the sender.
No problem.
