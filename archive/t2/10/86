Subject: Sliding Door Woes

Hi All,
My sliding door has been showing signs of old age and needing help, but I'm
not sure where to begin my diagnosis.  The problem lies in opening the
thing.  When I push down on the handle from outside, it just doesn't seem
to generate enough Ummmppphhh to open the sliding door outward enough to
get it onto the rails for it to slide backward.  The door will come part
way out (half inch or so), but that's usually all - and to try again I have
to push the door back inward (i.e. shut it) so that the handle operates
again.  It just doesn't feel like there's enough "grab" in the handle to
get things going.  After 6-10 tries at this per session, it will usually
open after I've found the right combination of weight placement, strength
and wrist action on the handle.  However, I feel like one of these times
the handle is just gonna come right off and the door will really be stuck. 
Does it sound like this problem lies in the handle itself, or is this a
matter of lubricating in a specific location, or a combination of the two? 
(Or is it something else entirely?)  Any clues and advice on what I can do
to help my door open happily again would be sincerely appreciated!
