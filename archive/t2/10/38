If you are running one of the dual senders, that is the problem, they come
on at higher pressres for the idiot light.  If you want to see if that is
the case, try screwing a standard VW sender into your riser where your
current sender is.  Or if you want to be even more convinced, screw an
inexpensive pressure gauge that you can pick up at the parts store on top of
your riser, that way you can read it direct.  Manual rev your engine and
read the pressures.  The pressre gauge is a good tool for the tool box, you
can quickly check used engines for oil pressure.
