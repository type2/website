Yes, Mexico is VW heaven!  We've ridden a lot of VWs around Cozumel and if you look on the back streets you can find the shops that 
keep them running.  Mexican auto repair shops are something to behold!  :)

The two buses pictured appear to be the Mexican watercooled conversion of the Brazilian "square top" baywindow design.  They used 
inline fours  They're quieter than the aircooleds and have a bit more power.

A few years back one of the rental agencies had what looked like VW Things for rent.  The only odd thing was that they were 2-door 
vehicles, not 4-doors like all the "real" Things.  Closer inspection revealed that these were fiberglass bodies that mounted onto a 
conventional Beetle pan.  I was never able to track down the source of these bodies and they have since disappeared from the roads.  Too 
bad, as I would have liked to have one and I figure that I could get away with importing a body!
