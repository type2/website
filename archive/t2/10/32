Sounds like the entire system needs a serious cleaning, if the bleeding passages are so clogged that they will hold system pressure!

Just as a test you might try probing the passage with a paper clip or similar wire.  See if you can poke it through.  Even if you can I would 
recommend disassembly and cleaning of the entire system.
