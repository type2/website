Subject: I'm a buyer for an 80-83 Westy Air Cooled

I'd like to buy another 80-83 Air Cooled Westfalia to resurrect.
I bought the last 81 Westy with the full expectitations of installing my
8000K engine in it and didn't need it.
So I've got enough spare parts; full engine, 4 speed manual tranny and
yada, yada, yada to resurect another 80-83 Westfalia.
If you've got an extra 80-83 Air Cooled Westfalia under the old oak tree
and you're within about 500 miles of Dallas Texas I'd make you an
insulting offer but I'll save the Westy from the boneyard.
I don't have much interest in standard Vanagons unless they are in the
$200.00 range. Vanagons aren't very popular in Texas and it is very
difficult to sell them.
I'm retired and I care for my 93 year old Father and 87 year old Mother
so I have to stay near the house in whatever I do for income.
I very seldom get to leave for weekends anymore for camping and fishing
in my 83 Westfalia.
I'm also entertaining the idea of selling my 83 Westfalia since it has
taken me two months to get 1200 miles on the new engine, it appears that
I'm going to be around the house a lot for the next few years.
I'm sitting here bored to death, I need a project car.
I'll need an asking price, pictures and full description with any replys.
