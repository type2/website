Volks,
	I just had to put in my .02 here. I used to live in Central and South 
America. Costa Rica and Chile, to be exact. I learned most of what I know 
about A/C VWs at a VW repair shop that I worked at in Chile for almost a 
year. Let me tell you, if those VWs that I worked on had even an oil change 
in between the times I saw them, they were lucky. With a little bit of 
preventative maintenance, I wouldn't have seen half of the VWs in that 
shop. And the guys I worked with, for the most part, weren't much better. 
The owner of the shop appreciated VWs, but none of the guys he had working 
for him did. Their favorite tools were a hammer and crowbar.  If the rest 
of Central and South America treat their VWs like people in Chile and Costa 
Rica did.... HA!  Periodic Maintenance (what the heck is that?!?) It's a 
TESTAMENT to the hardiness and strength of our beloved machines (members of 
the family to some).
