Subject: RE: [T2] Best 75-78 Exhaust?

I have had the best luck with an S&S, thunderbird style header with a
replacement muffler.  Order the whole kit including the muffler from S&S and
install it.  Take it down to your local muffler shop (Midas, etc..) and have
them cut the muffler off and replace it with a real muffler.  Make sure to
tell them that you want the muffler supported by steel strap to the header
and not with a rubber strap to the body.

I have used this type on dozens of cars with great luck.  The muffler will
outlast the header.  I have actually done this and had the muffler outlast
the engine.
