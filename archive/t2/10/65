Subject: Help me! I'm using body filler!


Greetings, list:

Consulted the archives, library, but couldn't find anything on this specific subject...Could the
list give me some advice, maybe?

1969 Transporter...

Due to lack of funds and a lack of  bodywork knowledge, I am filling some under-the-windshield holes
with "long-strand" fiberglass filler.  I know this is at best probably a temp fix, but the winter
rains are coming!

I've sort of hammered a nice dent around each hole, figuring that will help me with sanding, etc...I
used "Cargroom" metal patch, cut to size, to cover the holes, laid in a coupla layers of fiberglass
filler...

My question is this: will the fiberglass filler sand nicely enough for me to prime and paint, or
should i top the fiberglass filler with regular bondo?  Stupid question probably, but my repair
seems to be proceeding nicely and I'd like to do the best job I can!

Thanks for any input!
