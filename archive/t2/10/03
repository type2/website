Tangentially (it is Friday), one of my all time favorite places to drive 
has been the state routes
in West Texas -- you know, where there's nothing but you, the dirt, and 
the rolling hills?

It's the only place I've been where the driver of every single car I 
encountered, waved, and
where if someone sees you coming up behind them, they immediately pull 
off to the shoulder
(while maintaining their speed) to let you pass -- no flashing, no 
bumper riding, nothing required.
(a practice i've taken to in my bus where the shoulders are well 
maintained and permit such a
course of action)

happy friday volks,
