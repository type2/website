Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Door won't release

Put a notch into a putty knife and pop out all the black panel holders
on the door.  (You can pry carefully under the panel also). Remove the
panel and any fiberglass.  Look at the cable tranferring your handle
rotation  to the rear mechanism that releases the door. Chances are the
cable has stretched and you are not pulling the release mechanism far
enough.  Look carefully and you will see what resembles the adjustor on
a bicycle brake caliper; screw this out to tighten the cable slack so
the door will released sooner.  If you have no room left, I think I
shimmed up the cable housing with a small nut.
