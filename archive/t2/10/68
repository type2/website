Subject: Re: torqueing heads

Well, let me tell you, my 71 westy a an SIR rebuild (and the engine before 
that, actually) has to have the ehads torqued often. Now some will yell at 
me because I don't drop the engine, I just torque the bottom ones, which 
tend to be maybe at 18ft-lb when I check them (sometimes less). Sucks and i 
dont understand. Those who yell at me will say - it wouldn't happen so much 
if you dropped the engine and torqued all 8. Others say that SIR didn't 
putloc-tite on the threads and the head bolts are slowly coming out (which 
makes sense because last time I had to shim my rockerarms because, after 
torquing the bolts, the studs poked out further and torquing the rocker arms 
back left me no adjustments in 1/2 of my valves.)
So to answer your questions - yes all heads i think are aluminum, i don't 
know why they would have been torgues 5 ft-lbs more, but I seem to talk to 
many folk who have to torque them, so just cayse the are aluminum doesn't 
mean they don't get torqued.

Well, he called me back about 15 minutes later and
says that he just talked to the engine rebuilder
he got the engine from, who said something along the
lines of "the heads that are on that engine are Aluminum
and shouldn't need to be torqued", in addition to that,
they are apparently torqued to 28 ft. lbs (as opposed
to the spec 22-23 ft. lbs specified by Bentley).
