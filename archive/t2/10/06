Hello all...I am in the process of restoring a 1974 bus that I got when my 
brother died.  I used to drive it all the time until it needed work.  Now I 
am in the process of fixing everything that is wrong with it...the problem 
is...I'm eager to drive it...chipped paint and all...My question is...would 
it be out of line to drive it or should I wait until I have it fixed 100% to 
drive it?

All comments are welcome.
