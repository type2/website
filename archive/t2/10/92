Subject: FREE BUS IN ILLINOIS

Hi all - The sad day has come. My bus has died and I can't afford to keep
her.  
So I'm giving her away free to someone who will give her a good home!.  She
is a 1978
Transporter. Very little rust, brand new front axle beam, new front tires,
new front shocks, new battery, her heating system is intact and works - but
there is no additional fans on there to help it along. The only thing is
that cyclinders 
#1 and 2 are dead and so she
will either need a rebuild or a new short block. The estimate I got for all
of this is around $4500. She is in pretty good condition other than that -
and with a real nice paint job. I do not have the money for this and i'm a
little strung out on the unreliability. At the moment - even if I could
afford it I'm not sure I would because I can't take it right now. I think I
need a break from the "vintage VW's" for a while. Please pass this on to
anyone who might be interested. She will need towed but I could store her
for you until you can get here. I could tow her for you for 100 miles.  
I have pictures - just email me for more info.  I'm just looking for 
someone to give Gertie a good home. 
Thanks
Chrissie
