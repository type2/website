you are being robbed, I have an almost blueprint rebuild and it was only
$2,500 or so on my 78,

been there done that, if you have a place to store her for a while I think
you might be sorry you got rid of her,  park it out of sight for a while,
if you still don't want it in the spring you can dump it, but right now
give yourself a chance to change your mind..... believe me I came very
close to walking away from mine and leaving it on the side of the
interstate a few years back,   but gave it another chance and got a decent
engine instead of the GEX lesson I learned the hardway

I'm not very close or I would come by and see if it would be fixable with
little cost, heck I would give you the parts if I had em.  maybe someone
else close by could take a look anyway...

hate to see you make a decision you might regret very soon,
