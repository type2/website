Subject: torquing heads

I believe Berg mentioned increasing the torque on heads a few psi from
factory - I'd have to dig out my tech notes to see fer shure; I do know
at least 2 rebuilders in my town do so as well, and are fairly anal
about getting the torque RIGHT (lubing threads with light coating of
motor oil, running a nut up and down each bolt to clean the threads,
allowing them to cool from that before tightening a NEW nut, etcetcetc.).
