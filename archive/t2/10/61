Subject: dist. vacuum advance hose attachment

1974 bus, (EGR system has been removed)

Can anyone help me out with the correct attachment point for the 
distributor's vacuum advance hose?

It's vacuum retard hose?

I see one vacuum tap on the side of each carb and I see a second vacuum tap 
on the base of the left carb.

I also see a vacuum tap at the junction of the metal pipes that connect the 
vacuum of the two carbs together.
