Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance on fire - 80 Westy

Thanks to all for the help; the insurance offered $3,500 for my 1980. I
think that might be a wee bit low, but don't know if I can get any better.
That is what I payed, but it fell in my lap. The previous owners bought it
for $4500, put $2000 into it ahd then sold it to me....

How do people feel about the Eurovans? The front mounted engine?

I might feel more comfortable if I knew I would smell smoke before I saw
flames....!
