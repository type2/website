Subject: Burney Falls or Bust

Headed out tomorrow morning to Burney Falls (near Lake Shasta and Redding).
 Changed the oil, screen, and acorn nuts.  Everything looks okay.  Taking
the AIRS list with me in the trusty Palm, just in case.  If anyone sees
a savannah beige & white 1970 stroking along I-5 tomorrow, be sure to
give a hey and a honk.  I'll keep an eye out, too!


Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
