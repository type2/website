Hi all,
When I purchased Clementine, in with the owners manual, was an manual
for a Coleman air compressor, that I guess came with the bus for blowing
up your tires, inner tubes etc.

Discovered one at a garage sale yesterday, that matched the description,
and picture in the manual ( found this out when I got home)
 
It works, and even has all the attachment's that are used to blow up
different item's, and the darn thing is as new----couldn't believe it.

Anyone else out there have one of these?

Never have even layed eyes on one until yesterday.

Later,

            ______________
