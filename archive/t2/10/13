All, how about a little careful measuring and using the proper length 1/8"
tube and "T" fitting so you will have the sender almost flush with the
shroud, so you add a pillow of felt or some insulating material under the
sender, drill 2 holes either side of the sender, and wire the sender to the
shroud, eliminating the 'pendulum' effect.

My .02 1/2.
