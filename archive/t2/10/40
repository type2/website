Well, overheating isn't much of a problem in this region.  The temperatures, which may be uncomfortable for humans (90F, 90% humidity) 
aren't all that bad for aircooled engines.  Humid air absorbs heat from hot engines better than dry desert air.  (OTOH, for engines that are 
cooled by evaporation, such as our own bodies, dry air is better.)  Climbing hills isn't much of an issue, as the highest hill on the entire 
Yucatan Peninsula is about 200 feet high.  All in all, it's a benign environment for aircooled engines.  The same is not true for rust.  The 
proximity of the sea, warm temperatures, and daily downpours aren't good for sheet metal.
