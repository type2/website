Latest update......

The bracket that holds the clutch cable to the transmission broke off and 
took most of the threads with it. 

I will either have to fabricate a bracket or get a new transmission. I guess 
since the tranny is about the only thing I haven't replaced on the bus it 
somehow had to get into the act.

I replaced my clutch cable about two months ago when I began having 
difficulty shifting. 

All of a sudden today the exact same problem returned. I have about 4 inches 
of freeplay in the peddle before I feel any resistance as I push it down and 
it is not fully disengaging the flywheel. 

Did the cable suddenly stretch or is there another problem?
