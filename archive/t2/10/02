Hello,

    Thanks for trying to help. It turned out the channel in the caliper =
that leads to the bleeder screw was clogged up. I used a welding tip =
cleaner and cleared it out. I was then able to bleed them. I'm still =
trying to get all the air out. I even wasted some money on a vacuum pump =
to bleed them. Too much air got past the bleeder screw to be of much =
use. I guess I'll use the old method with a friend and pump them allot. =
Thanks again for the response.

Patrick
