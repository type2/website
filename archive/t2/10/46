I have a Coleman Inflatall 150, which may or may not be the same item.  It has a beige plastic case and looks like an electric motor 
mating with a model airplane engine.  It work but inflates anything larger than a bike tire waaaaaaaayyy sloooooowwww.

Mine is not in nearly as nice of shape as yours,  One latch is missing and the case is generally beat up.

I doubt that this particular unit was sold with a VW accessory.  I think that they were sold at sporting good and automotive stores in 
general.
