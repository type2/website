Subject: front curtain needed for bay window

fellow listees:

i am in need of a front curtain for my 72 bus.  it does NOT have to be
in good condition.  in fact, someone is going to make one for me, but
i would really like to be able to provide them with an original one
to use as a pattern.

so, does someone out there have a used front curtain they would
be willing to part with?  it can be tattered & torn - i dont care.

i'm just looking to find an original one to use as a pattern,
nothing more.

TIA!!!!!!
