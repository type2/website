No washer motor, it works off the pressure in the tank.  You must have some
hardened hoses, try cutting a bit off the end, then re-attach them.  The
wiper handle is a valve that lets the washer fluid flow, after you fix the
hoses, the valve may lossen up when the fluid hits it.  Don't put too much
pressure in the tank, I would start with 20PSI.
