Never have icing with icing on dual carbs..

A big resason that progressives Ice is the fact that al the air is being
inducted at a very high  speed, most of the time through on 26mm venturi,
the faster the air, the colder it gets from the process..Most icing I have
experienced came at night, or early morning, when it was damp out, and I
have even experienced it during the summer, after a hug T storm when
conditions rapidly changed...

The progressive being center mounted, over the crankcase, with long thin
runners even makes it wworse...My little 80 dolar part will stop all those
icing problems....
