I thought more than the average number of people had been flipping me =
off in traffic lately and found yesterday that it was due to a lack of  =
brake lights.=20
Crawled under this afternoon to test the stop light switches, shorting a =
screwdriver between either of them makes no difference. all fuses look =
good, gave em a twist for good measure, tail and signal lights are fine. =
Another electrical oddity(related?) is that recently my radio started =
flashing on and off with the turn signal but that only happened twice =
and went away. any help ideas would be great, I'm in the middle of =
moving and dont have a lot of time to fool with it.
thanks
