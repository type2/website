Subject: aux. battery wiring...still

okay, the tech. library has a dead link to the westy
wiring diagram...no biggie, i could figure most stuff
out from the '78 westy diagram i found surfing online
today...

so, i have almost everything in order.  the fridge
works on both city and battery power.  the battery
level gauge doesn't work due to a bad resistor...radio
shack...i know.

the question...where in the he..double hockey sticks
is the dual battery relay supposed to be located?  i
have no extra leads off of the second battery and no
extras off the main battery.  i don't even know what
it is supposed to look like.

i also have an extra white wire going to nothing under
the bus near the engine compartment.  where does the
wiring run for the 2nd battery?  in the compartment,
around, under?

thanks in advance!
