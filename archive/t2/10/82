Kevin,

Most of the pushrod tubes will come out fairly easily, but some are
impossible.  I used to go the crush method with channel lock pliers and
strap wrenches, but I have made a tool that I think works very well.

I started with the idea it is better to go from the inside and push out
than from the outside pushing in.  I had a stick of round soft nylon that I
use for turning bushings on the lathe.  I cut a 3" piece and drilled a hole
through it.  I also bored a hole that was just smaller than the nut I was
using.  I welded a nut to the end of an all thread and slid it into the
hole.  On the other end, I put another nut and washer that I can hold with
a wrench.  When you tighten the nut on the washer down, it "squeezes" the
nylon and swells it into the push rod tube.  I then put a small board with
a hole in it over the head and another nut and washer on that.  Turning the
nut that is against the board pulls the push rod tube out very slowly, but
with no damage.  I have removed tubes that felt like they were welded in by
this method.  This saves a bunch of money by not damaging the tubes so I
have to buy new ones.
