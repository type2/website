Subject: Solenoid Wiring

Here is a picture of wires going to my solenoid (76 2.0 FI Westy). When I turn
the key to crank all I get is a clicking sound. The yellow is a ground. With
the key turned, the red and blue are hot. The black one is dead. I think this
one is supposed to be hot with the key turned because when I touch a wire
between it and the terminal with the battery connection the bus fires.

Is it possible this little box can go bad? If so, what part do need to get?
Also, if you look closely there is an empty place for another female spade
terminal on this little box. Up on the solenoid is a loose green wire. Is it
supposed to connect here?

Anyone willing to crawl up under theirs and tell me what this looks like would
be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
Mike
