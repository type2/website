That seems like the size of the head rather than the screw.

ETKA says N 013 890 5 - tapping screw, hex.hd. ST6.3x13-C

I don't know how to read the tapping screw dimensions...

I'm probably wrong, but I think the belly pan uses a slot
headed screw with the threads that match the bolts
on the engine tin. The belly pan screws are tapered at
the tip and "self tapping" but I'm almost positive tin
bolts fit... ???
