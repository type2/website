Subject: Re: [BP] PEI RUN

We are getting into significant numbers here - damn - I should have been
counting - I would guess we are up to 6 total - that is The Bug Pack plus at
least one guy from Nova Scotia on the Type 2 list - if something was
formally planned we would probably lose a couple because of date conflicts
but firm plans would likely add a few.  What would be the best time of the
year for this sort of thing - I'm thinking August but - I'm open.  Maybe we
need a person from PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND who can tell us if there is
something happening this summer.  Any festivals - or concerts - or
anything - sort of like the Bus Fusion/Arts Fusion relationship.  Any car or
VW shows in the summer hmmmmm.  It would be kinda cool to get buses from all
over converging on some point on PEI - how bout the L.M.Montgomery Bus
Festival ;)   or Buses of Green Gables ;)
