Subject: Hot Item--For a Cool Climate

Hey all,
I have a neat gizmo for any of you that reside in the Siberian climate
that is upon us--and are driver's in the winter---and are interested in
a warm, fast start for your Type 2 Bus, Transporter, Or Westy--

A bolt on to the sump engine heater--

Plug it in at night and let it keep the oil warm ---or you could even
just connect it to a timer so it would go on a couple of hours prior to
you taking off in the morning---
I lived  up in the "Land of Eternal Cold" up in Northern Minnesota for
awhile--and let me tell ya--at -50 below something like this was a
necessity--and they do work well---

Drop me a line if any of you might be interested---

Thanks,

            ______________
