Subject: Belly pan fasteners?

Hi List,
I have been slowly trying to reduce all the drafts in my '71 to make my 110 
mile round trip commute more bearable.  I realized today the amount of air 
coming from the hole where the accelerator exit the cab.  I have a new boot 
coming and found out that I forgot to install the belly pan.  What size are 
the machine screws that fasten the belly pan on the bottom of the 
bus?  Thanks in advance!

Joy Thru Air,
