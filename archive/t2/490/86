 I have a 73 type IV Progressive..how do I know what displacement it is?  I

a 1700/1800/2000?  Can I look up the # off the engine to find out what year it
is and will that be the answer?

an indicator of the displacement:

 The heads are also numbers in them for indentification:

Christopher and Richard,
This is a bad way to identify an engine. Fan housings get swapped all the time. The only thing you can rely on
by the serial number on the fan housing is what engine it came on originally!
A more reliable way is by the serial number in the case itself. 2.0 is kind of easy to find. It is between the
fan housing and the square casting for the crankcase vent. 1.7 and 1.8 are usually a little tougher to find.
Most times it is stamped into the case at the top by the seam split.
But if it is a rebuilt engine, i.e. GEX, you will never know by the case number. Then the only way to find the
size would be to pull a head and measure bore and stroke.
