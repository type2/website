I recently received a radio plate insert for both a bay and a Vanagon from a
listee.  I'm using both to create repros, and will produce a variant of the
bay plate to hold three 1.5" gauges.  Still trying to figure out how to
modify the plate so that the gauges are angled toward the driver, but I
might produce two versions.  One with angled gauge openings and one with
straight "normal" gauge holes.

I'm not too sure about repro'ing the Vanagon plate.  The snap-fit tabs might
not be all that durable in resin.
