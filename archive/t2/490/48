If you're referring to the last picture of the set, top-view of the 
engine, note that you're looking at the engine from the opposite 
direction you would be on a normal Bus (where you'd be standing behind 
the Bus and peering down through the open rear hatch).  Note the 
distributor and breather at the top of the photo, the (disconnected) 
decel valve and the air plenum at the bottom, and the air flow meter at 
the left.

That considered, I think that vacuum unit on the right is for the EGR 
valve (at least, that is the location of the EGR valve vacuum unit on a 
'76 California model) -- the description does indicate that the engine 
has emission control equipment.

That engine top-view photo is interesting.  The throttle boot (between 
the AFM and throttle body) is totally different from a normal Bus's.  
They also must have had a height problem (or maybe just an access 
clearance problem); note the orientation of the air cleaner and AFM.

Also, check out that blue-ish rod or tube that connects the throttle 
boot (bottom left of picture) to something just below the breather (or 
is that just a rubber cap on the end of it?).  I wonder what that is.

And on the right side of the picture, between the distributor and the 
(disconnected) heat exchanger blower port, note the tube that runs from 
the bottom of the picture to the top...

While it might be hard to find some of the strangely-shaped parts for 
this engine, whoever ends up with this Bus will be lucky that they 
don't need that NLA molded hose for the breather :-)
