You might hafta call around, but there should be a FLAPS in your
area that carries fluorescent oil dye (mine is by Wurth)...Comes
in a small jar and a little is all you need. Drop the prescribed a-
mount into the oil at eventide and a black light will make the
dye glow as it starts to leak from the engine...An incandescent
black light bulb is available from your local party goods supplier.
The Eastwood Co. has a kit but it's way overpriced for what it 
is... ;-(
