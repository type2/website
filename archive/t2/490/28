Subject: Seat swap on a 72 bay

Morning Volk's!

I have a 72 Bay that the seats in it need help badly, there out of a 74 and
Horse hair is gone and springs are getting uncomfortable, I have priced out
replacement cushions and covers for around $200, Ouch!
Can anyone out there tell me what year VW bus seats can fit into a 72?
I would prefer doing this with out having to weld in newer mount to make
them work.  
I have heard the Vanagon seat's are much more comfy but you sit up higher
and I'm 6' 6" and headroom is a concern.
Any help in my search for newer seats (Driver and passenger) for easiest
conversion is greatly appreciated.  
I'm not looking for a big project to remount any type of seats that's out
there.

Doug.
