Subject: IRC instructions

Volks,

To get on the all-VW bus chat channel you should:

1) Download MIRC for Windows or IRCLE for Mac;
2) Install the client;
3) enter server irc.type2.com;
4) enter the channel which is #buslist.

In IRC all commands are preceeded by a "/", channel manes are preceeded by
a "#". The command "/server irc.type2.com" will log you on to the chat
server and "/join #buslist" will join in the channel where we are all
talking.

I am off for tonight but will be back on Monday at ~8 EST, I'll post again
as I get on.
