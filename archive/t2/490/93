Jennifer,

You said..."   Only saw two other buses the whole way, both Vanagon
types."..

    If you ever find yourself up NY way again and want to meet up with
some bus folks let me.  It's easy to find us, you drive as far north
as  NY city and then turn east onto Long Island.  This is the home of
the Bus Alliance, whos members drive buses from splitties to Eurovans.
If Long Island is too far out of the way then you could always go to
New Jersey, home of the Bus Guild.
Glad you had a good trip!
