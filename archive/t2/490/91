Hi Everyone,

  We made it back home last night around nine-forty p.m. from Wilmington, DE.

  The turn signals started working again after some fooling around with
the flashers.  What is the deal with that?  The dash knob for the
flashers will turn slightly back and forth and you can hear a faint
clicking sound, this seems to stimulate something and the signals will
work again.  I guess I have a short.

  The squealing noise has almost abated, is this due to the warmer clime? 
I am going to replace the front bearings anyhow.

  The only problem that concerned me was after several hours of freeway
speeds wed pull onto the off ramp and the bus would die when the clutch
was pressed in.  I would let it back out and shed start right back up
again and that would be the end of it.  There is something that is
preventing it from going from full bore to idle.  What is this?

  Several folks have remarked that theyd never have attempted to drive
from S.C. to New York in a 68 bus.  We loved it.  It always started up
no matter how cold it was.  We took the in-laws Lexis suv to Niagra
Falls, Canada.  My husband said it was horrible to drive.  It was
cramped, and I dont know how many rpms went on in the back seat with
the two kids smashed up next to each other.  Did like the heated seats
though.  Only saw two other buses the whole way, both Vanagon types. 
Would do it again definitely.

Jennifer
