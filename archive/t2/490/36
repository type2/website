No way to clean and lube inside without going inside. Also, you must remove 
the latch mechanism to do a good job of cleaning and lubing. No special 
tools are required, just some tenacity. My 72 had the same issues when I 
got it. Removed, cleaned and lubed everything and they now work perfectly 
again. Still all original lock cylinders at 30 years old.
