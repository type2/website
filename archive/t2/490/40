Subject: Re: [T2] cool camper

i have seen a bus just like this at the vintage meet about 6 or so years ago. way 
cool and i REALLY like the matching dinnerware. before i really considered bay 
windows but i was drawn to it. :-) the one i saw also had special front bumpers or 
over riders on the front also but otherwise same physical condition and it ran.  i 
have seen another one in not so great shape so the fact that this one has all its 
components and accessories makes it a plus...
may it go to a good home in the usa so more people can see it and finish giving it 
back its life.
