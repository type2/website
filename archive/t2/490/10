Where about in Hickory for the T2's yard?  Didn't some post some time ago
about one up near Jefferson (Boone area, not sure if town is right) that had
a Singlecab and a couple of Buses.

There's suppose to be a guy north of Wilmington that has some Buses.  I've
never been able to find that one though.
