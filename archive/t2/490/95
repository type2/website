Back when I had a Bug, I was always leery of Type 1 engines bored out 
that much.  I seem to recall stories of engine failures caused by thin 
cylinder walls (poor heat dissipation?).  If I had a Type 1 engine 
again and I did decide to beef it up, I'm not sure I'd go much above 
1800.

(Heh, good timing; I'm currently having this conversation with a friend 
of mine who just traded an old Volvo wagon for a '64 Bug w/ 12V 
conversion and a '71 1600 engine :-)
