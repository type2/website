Karl,

The 181 gas cap is 3 tabs. It is a 211 part number, I know it fits some
busses, not sure which years. It is the same form factor as the big pressed
caps with the logo, I have one of those as a spare. It is also the same form
factor as a porsche 914 cap, in fact the non-locking thing cap is the same
part number as the stock 914 cap.
