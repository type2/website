"$100 for a late-bay lock cylinder" was mentioned earlier, so it's a bit more than an assumption (if I am to believe my fellow listmembers).

You had good luck with Gabe - that's great - I was simply suggesting an alternative.  Steve Sandlin's reputation is top-notch and I will continue to mention his name whenever he might be able to save a listmember some money.  Enlightened shoppers can make their own decisions based on whatever criteria are important to them.
