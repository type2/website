Hey gang,

  Weve pulled off the road for the night here in Wilmington, DE. 
Developed a new and disturbing sound, fore and to the port.  In other
words: sounds like it is under the drivers butt.

  It started as a high whine, kind of like the wind tearing past an
antenna, with a small bit of warbling here and there.  I was hoping it
was simply the speedometer cable but now Im not so sure.  Sometimes we
hear a rhythmicka-thunk ka-thunk when at low speeds.  I now suspect
were losing a bearing.  We feel no drag or pull, the brakes are working
wonderfully, just the noise.

  We lost the turn signals yesterday.  A real bummer in heavy work hour
traffic through Philadelphia.

  Anyhow, we are shoving off for home tomorrow.  Ill be glad to arrive. 
My cow calved today, a week early.  She is having difficulties and we
need to be there.  Glad though that she had a heifer.

Jennifer
