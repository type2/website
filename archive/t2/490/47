David,

<sigh>  There is no way out of this one except the "hard" way.

You really need to pull the panel off the door and pretty much take the 
whole mechanism out and go thru it...yes, you can try squirting lube up 
into it all day long, but trust me....if you pull them out and work on 
them on a bench, it will make you smile.

Did mine during the restore, and I bet they didn't work as good when it 
was new.

Just look it over carefully and do the inside handle and linkage at the 
same time.

Cheers, dave
