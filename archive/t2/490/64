Subject: Type 4 head temp sensor???

Hi all,
Just wondering what the thread size is?
I have just received new heads for my re-build (2L type 4). As mine is dual
carb my old heads never had a cyl. head temp sensor. The new heads have a
thread (blind hole) next to the No 3, No 2 spark plug which I'm guessing is
for the temp sensor on FI bus's???
I just want to know what thread size it is. It looks like M10x1 but am not
sure.
Also these heads have a vent line to let the rocker cover breath. Where's the
best place to hook it up to? The same place as the case breather?
