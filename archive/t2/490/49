I have had excellent and reasonable service from Gabe! He has rekeyed all of
the locks on my 67 Splitty for $50 which I felt was very fair. He is doing
this as his sole means of support and takes the time ( granted it's his
business) to attend many west coast shows. He has many hard to find parts
for Barndoor busses ( I mean keys) and searches all over the world to buy
out of stock items. I would suggest that you get to know him and ask him for
prices before assuming that his prices are high.
