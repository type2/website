Hm, I forgot to address this before...

While I wholeheartedly agree about the Pertronix, the consensus around 
here seems to be that, unless you're drag racing, the 009 distributor 
is not necessarily the best choice.  I've seen a number of people rave 
about the SVDA distributor from aircooled.net:

The SVDA uses a 009 rotor and cap.  Dunno which of the Pertronix kits, 
if any, fit that distributor.
