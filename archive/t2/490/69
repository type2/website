I would also guess a bearing.  If it's ka-thunk'ing, it may just be the
end-play.  Jack up that corner and wiggle the tire back-and-forth.  If
it seems excessive, you probably want to have it looked at.
(Unfortunately, I don't have my Bentley handy, so I can't tell you what
"excessive" means.)

Check for blown fuses.  I'd be surprised if your flasher relay suddenly
went out without showing other signs of failure.  You should be able to
find the appropriate replacements at any FLAPS.
