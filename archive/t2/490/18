But he found that NOS item while at Bad Camberg so it's worth a lot more!

That would probably be from Gabriel Garcia. He's a local VW locksmith who attends the various shows and is constantly placing ads on Samba for key related items. I met him once. He wanted $100 for a late bay lock cylinder and wouldn't bargain on the price because he knows some monkey will eventually pay his price.
