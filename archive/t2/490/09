Subject: FS: 73 Westy 5-speed

I posted this before, but I haven't had any luck.  So here it is again.

I'm selling my 73 Westy.  I've owned this bus since 1991 (3rd owner!) and at
the risk of sounding boastful, this is one of the most solid and dependable
buses I've seen.  It's got a 914 2.0 fuel injected motor and a 901 5-speed
tranny.  Otherwise, it's very original inside and out without a spot of
bondo anywhere!  

If you want a cheap bus to work on in your spare time and maybe actually get
to drive it someday, this is NOT it.  This is the bus you want if you need
to fire it up on a freezing cold morning and have it snap to life
immediately.  This is the bus you want if you're planning a long trip and
don't want to worry about doing 75-80 MPH (or more if you've a mind to since
the 5-sp tranny makes 85-90 quite possible).  This is the bus you want if
you want to drive and enjoy it everyday and not spend half your time
underneath it wondering what's going to break next.

I was asking $3900, but if I can sell it by the end of January I'd take
$3400 for it.  If you're worried about how to get it from Colorado to where
you live, well, just fly out here and drive it home!  It'll take you there
with no hassles (unless there's an ocean in your route).  

For full details (and a list of other goodies available for purchase with
the bus), go to http://home.adelphia.net/~mgensler/bus.html  And if you have
any questions, please feel free to ask.

Thanks for your time.
