What you are looking at is the hot start relay. It's not factory installed
but a good idea to have. Read about it:

First check that the fuse isn't burned out. The relay could be bad. It's
Bosch 0 332 209 150 (pretty common automotive relay with many equivalents).

The extra spade is part of the standard Bosch relay. It's 87a and it's
normally closed vs. 87 which is normally open. You get two relays in one in
a sense.
