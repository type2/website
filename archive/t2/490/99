Subject: Any listies in the LA area?

Hey folks...

I'm going to be in the LA area from Dec 21 to Jan 4, visiting my 
in-laws for Christmas, and was wondering if there were any listies in 
the area that might be interested in getting together some evening for 
some holiday cheer.

I'm also planning a trip out to Wolfsburg West and hoping to hit a few 
junk yards while I'm down there, so if anyone has any suggestions for 
good Bus parts hunting, please drop me a line.
