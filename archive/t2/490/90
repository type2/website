Subject: Air Cleaner  '72 elbow

Den, did you mention that you were looking for the snap  latches on the base 
of the air cleaner that holds the air cleaner to the engine?

*****
Yesterday , I found that I am also missing one of the two snap latches.

I pulled a snap latch off an extra air filter housing I have for the '78 FI.

It fit the '72 air cleaner just fine.  But since the '78 is much smaller a 
snap latch, I jury-rigged a metal loop  that ran from the base plate (the 
base plate(s) that is attached to the engine) and I could catch it with the 
'78 FI AC snap latch.

*****
It is a solid fit, good until a perfect replacement can be found.
