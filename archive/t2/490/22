Subject: Re: [T2] ice on inside?

This is a GREAT poem, but it is only about those unlucky bus owners without
a working gas heater!!!  Just had to get that in, with a gas heater, you can
turn it on a few minutes before you leave and it will melt the ice on the
inside AND outside along with a very welcome warm feeling when you open the
door.  

Nothing compares to driving a bus in the dead of winter with the outside
temps below freezing and you are very comfortable sitting there in a tee
shirt!!

Let me offer up my annual winter poem post.  If you live in a cold
climate I think you may be able to relate.
 
 
Winter in a VW Bus
 
Not a month before Christmas
and all cross the land,
bus owners are driving
with ice scrapers in hand.
