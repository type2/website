Mike,	With your style engine replacing the push rod tube seals is
cake. I would start with that and trying to get your valve cover
gasket to stop. Clean the area up real good and then see where else
the oil comes from.

On the drivers side right above this area are a few other good
candidates for leaking, although not as easy to fix as the pushrods.
One is the oil filter and it's mounting, another is the oil cooler,
and yet another is the oil pressure sender. I'd just try the pushrods
first and see what becomes of that.
