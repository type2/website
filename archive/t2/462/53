Well, can't say that I'll be much help living in Florida, and totally not
in the path of your travels, but I hope everything works out for you!

I've found that.. as backyard mechanics, we often stress and worry about
the condition of our cars far more than maybe we should? I'm really
particular about my cars, I won't drive them unless I completely trust
them. The truth is, if you pulled any non-car person off the street and
said.. "here, drive my car" they'd hop in without a hitch, and drive, and
be perfectly content about it too.. not worrying for a second about
whether or not the car will break down. 

Being a backyard mechanic has both it's positives..... and it's
negatives!

Good luck!

Driving cross country in a totally questionable motor scares the shiza

of me, but ill have my cell, my CB, my AIRS list and all of the tools and
spare parts I own. Not to mention a sleeping bad, a little stove and some
food, just in case. =)
 
Wish me luck.
