Subject: pan below pedals

Zach,

I have that part USED pretty straight, they all seem to take a "rock hit" or
two.
I get $25 plus UPS shipping /handling (need zip code)

the pedal assemblies on the bottom of the car.


"obligatory disclaimer"
I am a "virtual" wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
USED parts.    "HAPPINESS GUARANTEED"
