I just swapped out an 009 for an SVDA distributor from aircooled.net on my
Vanagon. Love it. It's too soon to comment on the claimed mpg improvement
but the throttle response is SO MUCH better. Thanks John

except you would have had better MPG, cooler running, and better throttle
response if you ditched the POS 009 and used an SVDA. If you don't run 15
degrees cooler, get 2-4 mpg improvement, and better throttle response, I'll
refund your $.

The 009 was fine in 1970, but let's move on already!
