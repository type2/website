Hee hee.  Aw, Mark, don't let it get to you.  Whaddya expect from bus drivers?  It *was* pretty funny, especially since your email addy has "brain" in 
it.  And the Python connection was a good one.  I think of it as people having loads of fun over a typo, not a misspelling.  Mispelling.  Misspeling.
