Subject: help quick update

Hi all,

   I have looked for vacume leaks and found one small one tht didn't seem to 
make much difference.  The timing looks pretty good.  Eveeryting seems good 
except no power.  The car will now go over 30 mph but there is no 
acceleartion....

i was wondering if it could be spark plugs or wires... while working on the 
car the other day i accidently forgot to hook something up correctly and got 
a large backfire... could this of ruined a spark plug?...


The bus sounds good idles well just has no acceleartion...

Also the spark plug wires are connected correctly.
