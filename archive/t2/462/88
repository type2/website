Dear list


  I am trying to find out why my bus today won't go over 30 mph but 
yesterday would.  all i did was replace the points which i checked 3 times 
and have the correct gap.  I also noticed that the engine is backfiring a 
little some popcorn sounds every once in a while.  Also when i noticed that 
the right carb "backfired" a couple of times when i would give it a quick 
press of the accelerator.  A small blue flame would shoot out of the top of 
the carb.  This doesn't seem good either.


Someone said that they thought it was the automatic choke sticking.  i don't 
think that is the problem because the engine will come out of fast idle, 
however the slower idle doesn't seem to be nearly as slow as it used to be 
earlier this summer.

I also think i might hear some sort of an air leak coming from outside of 
the engine compartment.  i hear it near the rear driver side tire.  you 
can't hear it from within the engine compartment only if you stick your head 
near that rear tire.

Please help i am thinking it is some sort of adjustment because it was 
running decently the other day before i changed points .....\
