Subject: Re: [T2] Jalousie Window won't close

the splines on the plastic handle are the same as the splines in a standard
rv vent lid winder so if you can locate one of those it would keep the
windows splines nice and work just fine.

Hi Robert,

This is not uncommon. The knob has been turned too tight and the
splines inside have been stripped.

Remove the screw that holds the knob in place, and turn the window shut
with a pair of pliers. If someone has a repair for stripped splines I
would love to hear it, as the sliding door jalousie on my bus is in
similar condition.

Happy trails,
