Subject: fuel line location

The fuel line in my 71 Westy needs to be changed to reduce fire potential.
Right now it runs through a hole directly behind the fan shroud.  On the left
side of the fire wall there is a grommet that is exactly the size of my new
fuel line.  Any problem rerouting the line through that grommet/hole?  Right
now it is braided fuel hose through a hole with no grommet.
Thanks
