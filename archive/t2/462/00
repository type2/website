Subject: Cool Kombi animated video?

BlankNow I have your attention, does anyone have one?
I cannot find a link to a web page I had ages ago that featured a camera approaching the rear of a split bus, through the inside and out the windscreen (animated). It featured a very 'Reggae' looking driver and music to suit.
I think it was an ad from South America and there were a couple in the series.
Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about, or better still a link to the web page that featured it?
I'd really like to find it again if it still exists.
Thanks,
