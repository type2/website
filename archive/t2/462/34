Another possibility.  When this happened to me, the problem was simply that 
the whole turn signal unit was loose in its mounting and also corroded.  I 
disassembled the unit from the steering column and worked some silicone lubricant 
into the mechanical parts of the switch.  Then I tightened up the screws 
holding everything together and replaced it on the column.  That gets me through a 
couple of years, when I have to repeat the procedure.  Good luck.
