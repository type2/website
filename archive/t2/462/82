Subject: Removing clothes closet from '75 W'falia - easy?

I'm in need of more width to move a double bed mattress and box, but the 
left rear mounted closet in my '75 protrudes into the rear hatch opening. I 
fortunately don't have the overhead cabinet, just the closet surrounding the 
spot where the spare was designed to fit. I note there are a couple of 
clamps on the base of the main wall, and one interior clamp on the front 
wall about 8" up from the floor. But I don't see any other retaining clamps 
mounted higher up. Has anyone routinely removed and then refitted their 
similar closet with ease and success? I could work-around this need, but if 
it is reasonable to do it, I'd prefer removing the cabinet temporarily. Any 
suggestions on this, and where to find more attachment points would be 
appreciated. The battery charger panel is there too, but that should be a 
fairly quick unwiring job, right?
Thanks for any input.
