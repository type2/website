Hiya All,

There had been some questions expressed as to the fate of Z Products in 
Wilsonville, Oregon.  Their website disappeared some weeks ago.  Z Products 
manufactured a number of nifty accessories for Baywindow Busses.  Among their 
products were outside steps, curtains and hanging equipment, and a unique kit which 
converted the standard third seat into a folding bed.  Quite a few folks here 
on The List had expressed interest in the Z-Bed kit because when not in use the 
interior of the bus looked completely stock.  No plywood or awkward foam 
cushions.

I stopped by their place in Wilsonville today and found Tim, the owner of Z 
Products, at work on other projects.  It seems that the downturn in the economy 
took its toll.  While Z Products is not officially dead, I suppose one might 
describe it as dormant.  In discussing the situation with Tim he indicated 
that he would still be happy to run off Z-Bed kits IF three conditions could be 
met.
1.  He needs commitments from at least 20 prospective purchasers.
2.  Each purchaser needs to commit with a $50 deposit.
3.  Once the deposits are rounded up (in total) it will take about 90 days to 
get the kits done.

I'd welcome your comments.  Please know that I am not acting in any sort of 
official capacity.  I just happen to be located reasonbly close to the company. 
 And , yeah, I'd like to get one of these kits myself.  The offer Tim made is 
probably the only avenue open to anyone who would like to put their hands on 
this really unique VW related product.
