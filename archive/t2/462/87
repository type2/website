I'd check out the pull off for the choke first--
It sounds like it isn't coming off fast idle--

Dear list,
        I recently replaced the points in my 74 bus. It
was running poorly and idling extremely fast and wouldn't come out of
fast idle so i decided to check the points out. I replaced them and
gapped them at .016. Since then the bus runs smoother but still isn't
idling as low as it was a few weeks ago. I tried to drive it today and i
could't go past 30 mph. When parked it can get the rpms up fine and it
sounds good but when i actually engage the tires it won't go past 30mph.
I was curious if the idling speed of the bus is affected strongly by
point adjustment and what i should do next. I havent been able to adjust
the timing yet because i don't have a timing light with me at school.
If anyone has any advice please let me know
