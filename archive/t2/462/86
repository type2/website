Subject: can't go over 30 mph

Dear list,


    I recently replaced the points in my 74 bus.  It was running poorly and 
idling extremely fast and wouldn't come out of fast idle so i decided to 
check the points out.  I replaced them and gapped them at .016.  Since then 
the bus runs smoother but still isn't idling as low as it was a few weeks 
ago. I tried to drive it today and i could't go past 30 mph.  When parked it 
can get the rpms up fine and it sounds good but when i actually engage the 
tires it won't go past 30mph.


I was curious if the idling speed of the bus is affected strongly by point 
adjustment and what i should do next.  I havent been able to adjust the 
timing yet because i don't have a timing light with me at school.

If anyone has any advice please let me know
