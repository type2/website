Subject: [T2] intermittent loss of power

last couple days has had a loss of power momentarily usually while
accelerating, sort of like when fuel filter is clogged, changed filter no
effect.

FWIW Bob I had a similar problem in my 78 manual a few months ago. My buddy
and I drove to Rhode Island from DC and was getting htis weird occassional
hesistation like water in gas or an occasional misfireing injector. On the
trip home it became a little more persistant but not enough to really
inconvenience us just annoying b/c we could not figure it out. When I got
home I took a close look at my points and even though the dwell was fine as
was timing they were pretty worn. I replaced them and the problem
dissappeared. Doesnt necessarily mean it was points though, I did the cap
and rotor too, but hell it could have been a coincidence or maybe wiring
but I checked all the connections on the road trip...
