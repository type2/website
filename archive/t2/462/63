"Nevermind!"  That was a quick hack done at the shop when the PO took 
it in some time in the past... the wrong engine tin was present, so the 
mechanic effectively plugged the holes that were defeating the airflow 
with that hose.

...and I won't have to look at that hose anymore from now now... Buslab 
is installing the correct tin when the new engine goes in.
