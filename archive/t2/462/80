well went out and tightened all the terminals and connectors and took test
drive, starteed out acting the same but then smoootheed out and ran
normally.

this morning went out and drove a few miles and it acted like one cyl was
not fireing intermitently no sound or other symptoms.

really got me mystified, as soon as it cools off I will go out and pull a
plug or two see if they are wearing or over carboned.

any other suggestions
