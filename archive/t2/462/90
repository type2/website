Subject: NEW Eberspacher BN4 Heater 12v For Sale

See pictures at http://photos.yahoo.com/j_griffin100
under the Eberspacher Folder. This is a never-used,
never fully installed heater that is essentially brand
new.  It came with the bus I bought a few years ago
and had never had fuel lines connected to it but was
otherwise mounted in the bus behind the driver's seat.
 I sold the bus before I had time to focus on setting
up the heater.  It has a piece of exhaust pipe that
someone made for it but I'm not sure whether this is
all you will need to set up the exhaust.  There is
also a pull knob/cable with it which moderates the
heat.  If you're not already familiar with these, they
are the definitive after-market heater for the bus. 
The heater is located in zip 06371 but could also ship
from 10013 if that makes a difference or can be picked
up in either southeastern Connecticut or New York. 
There is an extensive manual with it.  Please make me
an offer as I want to avoid putting it up for auction.
 Get your bus winterized before the cold sets in!
