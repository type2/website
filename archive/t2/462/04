Subject: Re: [T2] Air Vent Covers?

This is your lucky day guys---
I have a brand new set of rear vent winter cover's such as you speak
of---
$25.00 buys them---plus whatever---

 
E-mail message   
 
Does anybody know of such a thing as some kind of cover that goes over
the outside air vents for the rear. Living here in Seattle, it's
starting to get wet outside. I get a little nervous knowing that the
rain is probably pouring into the engine compartment. Or is this a new
idea that could make me rich? Even washing the van would make these
handy...If they do exist...Where can I find a pair? 
I saw these on a webpage once and the owner said he found them on eBay.
He couldn't remember who the seller was:
