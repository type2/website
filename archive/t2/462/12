Subject: RE: [T2] Air Vent Covers?

The large nylon washer goes on the outside of the cover to support the
nylon screws---then there are 4 steel fingered nuts that hold the covers
to the vents---

I just called my parts mgr. buddy at VW, and the cover's are now NLA----

Later,

[T2] Air Vent Covers? 
I also have a set of these covers. I have not used them, but I think
that they use a large washer to go on the inside of the vent and you
just tighten the bolt to hold them on. They are designed for winter. My
thought was to try the set in the winter to help with the progressive
carb preheater issue, but I think that I am just going to change the
carb. They should keep out most rain, but they are also keeping out cool
fresh for the carb and heater system. Not sure if this matters since
they do allow some air in. I think they actually are made by VW, but I
cannot find mine to get the part number off of it. They are advertised
as being made by VW on Ebay.
