Hi Richard,

The site you are referring to is www.banja.com In the beginning they had
indeed the animated video with the rasta man in the Split bus, but they have
moved on with the story.
It is in fact a game and they are now at episode 12. I couldnt find the
Rasta split bus movie back on the site.

However, I am 100% positive this is the one you are looking for. The movie
does still play in my mind too as it is a very nice one.
