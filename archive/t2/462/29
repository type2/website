Hi Robert,

This is not uncommon. The knob has been turned too tight and the 
splines inside have been stripped.

Remove the screw that holds the knob in place, and turn the window shut 
with a pair of pliers. If someone has a repair for stripped splines I 
would love to hear it, as the sliding door jalousie on my bus is in 
similar condition.

Happy trails,
