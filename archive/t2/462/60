I likewise became curious about ETKA because I find extremely useful 
the microfiche.

Through some looking through the web I learned that the ETKA software 
is, as previously described, used by dealers to locate parts and look 
at diagrams of your VW.  This software is updated yearly.  It covers 
every model of volkswagen and audi to the present date, depending of 
course on how recent the software is.  I find it most helpful for the 
purpose of getting a visual dissection of nearly every part on our 
beetle or bus.  Part numbers are also provided, except for parts no 
longer available.

Throughout the internet are traces of attempts to make the CD 
downloadable but they have all been put down, since it is illegal to 
pirate software.

Drawbacks to the software are it's display which make it only viewable 
from a certain resolution.

Other reviews of the software could probably be found looking at Audi 
sites.  It seems they use it a bit more.

I eventually got a hold of the CD through eBay.  It was the US version. 
  (I believe there's a UK version).

Any more questions ask.
