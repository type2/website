Subject: Heater hose configuration on a '76

Can anyone out there snap a few photos of the proper heater hose 
configuration on a '76 (or any year that was equivalent)?

As you can see from this photo of mine:

	http://www.shagadelic.org/photos/pod/liveframe.cgi/76-westy/5

...there is that hose that arcs across the pulley area.  I don't 
remember seeing that hose in other Type 4 engine photos I've seen, and 
I'm trying to figure out:

	- What it's supposed to do.
	- If it's supposed to even be there.

Thanks!
