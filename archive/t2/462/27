Subject: Jalousie Window won't close

I have a little problem with the jalousie window in the sliding door of 
my 78 Westie. The glass louvers are presently open. When I turn the 
knob to close them, nothing happens, The knob turns freely both ways, 
but nothing happens. I tried pressing the windows shut but they won't 
budge. I would like, at least, to get the windows closed. Ideally I'd 
like to repair the defect.

I bought the car yesterday, and the window was open when I took 
possession.

Any advice?  Thanks.
