This happened to me once, and I realized that my studs were loose and a 
couple of them had simply worked their way a little deeper into the case.  I 
unscrewed them a bit and had no problems ever after.  (But now I'm very careful when 
changing the oil.)  Watch out for the long stud that goes through the case 
and to which the oil pickup (?) attaches inside.  If the nut comes off the end 
inside the sump, it's a real pain to fix.
