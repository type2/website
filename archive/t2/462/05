There is a three-wire connector coming from your turn signal switch that
contains a brown/white wire, a black/purple wire, and a brown wire.  Check
the brown/white wire for continuity with the body of the bus.  There
should be none when the turn signal switch is in the normal position and
good continuity when you pull up on the turn signal lever.  If the switch
passes this test check for connection to terminal S on your high beam
relay.  If the switch is working and connected then your relay is dead.

                             OOK!
