Subject: pan below pedals

Does anyone know of where I can et the pan that screws on my 1970 and protects
the pedal assemblies on the bottom of the car. It's starting to cool off here
and I'm imagining all the road grime and salt I have to look forward to this
year. All the VW's in local boneyards are stripped like they're made of gold,
so that's not a good answer for me.

thanks

Zach
