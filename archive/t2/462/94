What happened to the "air leak"you heard in the back of the Bus??? 

Jason---

First of all, you should have tuned up the engine--completely--
Plugs, points, condenser, cap, rotor, wires.
Then you would have eliminated all of the questions on what if?---and
you should do this anyway as part of a good periodic maintenance
program.

Do you have a good shop manual?

Diagnosing this sort of problem over the internet is impossible, if you
haven't done all of the basic's first---
It's just a guessing game.

Spend the bucks--and replace all the worn out ignition stuff
first---then ask some more questions---it sure would be a bunch easier
to figure out--

I still think your carb is messed up---
