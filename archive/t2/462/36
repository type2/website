chris,

good luck.

you are doing the right thing. you could only have lost out selling your bus
for so little.

take your time, keep speed down and watch everything carefully, you'll get
there safely. bring tools, change oil just because you can, make sure the
motor is well tuned before you leave, especially make sure you have a good
mixture, lean running FI systems destroy heads.

you will be really glad you didn't sell the bus!
