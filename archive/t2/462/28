Subject: wish me luck

Well, Ted Kitch of Chicago Ill was going to buy my bus from me. Two "lost in
the mail" checks later and a phone call about a delivery guy that went to
jail supposedly, and I knew id been had. That left me with 3 weeks before my
cross country move to do something with this bus. Last time I don't insist
on a deposit, or just trust someone because they seem like they know what
they are doing or come off as responsible.

Anyway, all attempts at getting rid of ol Jasper this past week have failed.
Local classifieds, thesamba, eBaymotors, no dice. I found a used bus motor
on a local ad the other day. Its a 79 model, and has been sitting for 5
years. Ran great before apparently, so I took the Passat over, loaded it up,
and dropped it off at the Buslab in Berkeley. 110 on #3 and 120# on the
others. 40% on the leak down test unfortunately, but nearly exactly 40% on
all, and hopefully that will come around when it actually fires up for the
first time.

So, I am in the gambling business now. Instead of selling the lot of it for
1k, I dropped another $250 on this questionable motor, $40 for checking it
out, and im waiting for the estimate on removing my current, installing this
one and changing the oil cooler seal and fuel lines in the process. I'm
hoping that it does not go over 1k by much, as I barely have enough credit
card space to cover it. If all goes well, it will work so I can drive my
Passat to MN, fly back to SF, pick up the bus and drive it to WI where I
will store it at my parents for the winter.

Driving cross country in a totally questionable motor scares the shiza out
of me, but ill have my cell, my CB, my AIRS list and all of the tools and
spare parts I own. Not to mention a sleeping bad, a little stove and some
food, just in case. =)

Wish me luck.
