If anyone is thinking about fall/winter camping, and keeping warm, these
might be helpful...

I'm going to try and thin out my Coleman collection...I have lanterns,
stoves and NOS parts as well...drop me a line off list if you're looking
for anything....

First is a Black cat used once...still in the box...noted as suitable
for tents..asking $45

Next is a Model 519 Easy lite Radiant in the box...this is a rare unit
to find anywhere...asking $50

Next is a Model 518C Quick lite catalytic like new, and in it's original
box...$40

Last is a 1977 model 513A708 variable temp Catalytic tent heater
3000-5000 BTU..$40

All are in very good to excellent condition...

Freight extra depending on where you reside...

Please contact me off list if you're interested..

I'm starting to save for Everybus...yes it will take me that long...LOL
