Subject: RE: [T2] Carb Replacement

On a duel carb set-up I have not found the need to go to bigger jets (as
with a single 34 pict 3) to make them work with an 009 dizzy. When we dyno
the engine we will get the jets set first then change out dizzies to see
what difference they make with the same jetting. If we find problems we will
jet the carbs according to each dizzy for true hp and torque readings,

Looking forward to the results!!!!
Do you plan to do the Dyno test on the vacuum dizzy using the stock jets,
not the jets for the 009??
