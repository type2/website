Take the plastic knob off and inspect (one phillips screw).  It may be
stripped.  It probably got stripped because of too much resistance on the
mechanism/windows.

(new plastic knobs are available from all the usual bus part places).

Once the knob is off, try turning just the metal knob post
(cover with a rag and gently use vice grips so you don't trash the metal).

To improve performance,

Remove the entire window assembly (15 or so phillips screws).  Remove bug
screen then disconnect the main louver arms from the knob gearbox (snap
rings).   Wash/clean the window joints, squirt WD-40 into all the joints
then manually move the windows up and down (as a group of 3) a bunch of
times.

Put everything back together, you'll be amazed at how much easier it is to
open/close the jalousie windows with the knob.
