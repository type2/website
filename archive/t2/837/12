Subject: Land Rover Wheels

I was passed by a land rover today.. the wheels look like the early bay.. 
and split bus, wide five.

About all I could find out was .... nice wheels.. look like wide 5.. they 
had 16" tires.. and it is a land rover.. said something like i90 on the rear 
gate....

Has anyone else seen these.. where would I look to see if they are the same 
stud pattern as an early bus?
