George(and all),

One of the best things I ever did(besides this list) was to 
sign up for an online subscription to autospeed.com.

Mostly because I was looking for good serious *tested* articles on
engine and car improvement.  They guy who does the magazine is(in my 
opinion) fantastic.

In one article, he show how to hunt for "negative boost" in your 
intake....in other words, anything that causes a restriction in the
air intake...all the way down to the heads.

He used a Dwyer Magnehelic Differential Pressure Gauge,  which is an 
expensive version of a very sensitive vacuum gauge that measures from two 
different places...for instance, before the air filter, and after the air 
filter.  I actually own one of these devices now.


After looking at the article(well actually a *5* part article, his results 
matched what I had read about air filters before....they just don't 
restrict the air flow that much(infinitesimally actually, as long as they 
are ****clean****).

So, I won't buy them for my cars.

Disclaimer....I *do* own a pair of them because that is all I can find to 
go on webber 48 ida's...and the ones I have, I custom fabricated to fit 
under the deck lid of this car.

Yes, they are nice when you custom fabricate(re-engineer) them and you can 
clean them and re oil them.  I suppose that you could also make an 
argument on the environmental side of the issue for them as 
well...I.E....reuseable rather than use and trash.

Cheers, dave
