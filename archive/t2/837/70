Subject: Re: [T2] Mini-microwave for Westy?

Get a lab ceramic hotplate- no open glowing surface, 600 watts will 
cook/fry anything, compared to the 1000 watts of a microwave!  Better 
yet, we use the Coleman folding LP gas cooktop that screws to the top of 
a small fat propane bottle and stand it anywhere, even the floor of the bus.

  Has anyone come across a REALLY small microwave for our westies? I 
can't seem to find anything smaller than about 17" long by 12 wide. I'm 
after a super small one that can just boil water, or cook a simple small 
supper etc. Name, and place and price would be helpful too.
  Thanks,
  Courtney
