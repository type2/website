Subject: "Mexican longblock" - CR?  HP?

I've heard tell that these new "meximotors" have domed pistons for a 
reduced CR and cooler running temps.  Can someone corroborate?

I am finding that the drive to work is a little slower.  I have a few 
hills on the way, and sometimes on the bigger hills, I have to 
downshift.  I didn't have to do this before.

At the same time that I got the new engine, I also got an SVDA 
distributor.  Could this be a factor?  I am tempted to put the old 009 
back in and see if there's any difference.
