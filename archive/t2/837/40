Subject: Re: [T2] Head Part number

Hi,

Thanks to everyone for all your responses. New head goes on tomorrow.
I'll post some pics of the old head before I find a place to get it
rebuilt.

A few folks recommended I CC the new head. How essential is this step?
What would be the disadvantages and possible pitfalls of not doing it?

Thanks
peace
