Use Good Sam's RV insurance- GMAC (National General).  Very reasonable, 
they will insure all your vehicles besides the Westy (regarded as an 
RV), and at their suggestion, you can drop it for any period (minimim 
one month); we keep only comprehensive on the 78 in winter.

  is garaged for the winter, we said there was no gas
  hooked up in it, and they declined to insure. Anyone
  else have this problem?
