 I would see if you can update the police report, tell your agent and
contact the witness just to let them know what's going on.  Was the guy who
hit you a jerk? Why did he leave?

Guy runs a red light in a pickup and is halfway into the intersection by the
time I see him because I'm too busy verifying the fact that I have a green
light before proceeding thru.
