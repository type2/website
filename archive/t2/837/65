Subject: Re: [T2] Mini-microwave for Westy?

    How about a truck stop? I've seen all sorts of gizmo's in them for cross
country truckers. Never paid to much attention what they had or size/price,
but it might be a winner!
    Also "J. C. Junkney" has an RV section with lots of goodies,
BUT...........LET THE BUYER BEWARE!
