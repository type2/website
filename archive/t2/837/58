Subject: Re: Weber 34 ICT and vacuum

 >Does anyone know what the vac hookup with Weber 34ICT duals should be
for a stock '72?  The brake booster was replaced and it never ran
correctly after that...  Not sure what the mechanic that had previously
installed the Webers did what they should have done with vac then.  The
new owner is asking if there should be a balance tube?  Sorry, I'm not
knowledgeable in this area, so my question may make no sense, perhaps
someone could intuit...  ;-)  Could be just some crap in one of the
carbs, but it seemed to run fine before the booster replacement.

I have a 76 bus with twin weber 34 ict carbs. (As I am in Australia it 
would have originally come with twin Solexes.)  The arrangement for the 
brake booster consists of a metal tee sticking through the left hand side 
of the fire wall. I just joined vacuum hose from each manifold to either 
side of this tee which serves both the brake booster and as a balance tube. 
It idles and runs smoothly with this arrangement

The only other trick is that the vacuum advance on the distributor only 
needs vacuum from one carb so the other carb vacuum outlet needs to be blocked.

HTH,

Martin.
