Subject: Please advise on a weird hot starting problem

Hello all - 
   
  I've got an 81 Vanagon, automatic.
   
  She starts right up, even after sitting for a week.
   
  But when I stop at a store and come back a few minutes later, she doesn't want to start back up.  Oh, she cranks real good - the starter is fine, but she won't catch.  Only way I can get her to start is to floor the accelerator and crank it for thirty or forty seconds straight.  She starts....so far.
   
  When she is running she runs great.  Idles and accelerates beautifully.
   
  I thought it might be the fuel filter and switched that, but it didn't help.
   
  Weird, huh?  Sitting for a week and everything is fine, but two minutes and no go!
   
  I would greatly appreciate any help you can give.
   
  Marc
