Get the witness to detail their account in full detail and get  a Notary to
do their thing on it.  It will help you if you go to court and the witness
cannot be there.  Even if they cannot be on the police report.

Years of watching Judge Wapner pays off!  Though Judge Judy is a tad cuter!

Also, expired tags.  Can you quickly get them paid for?  Does the Bus run so
you can do that if?  It will show the judge/whomever that your trying to be
responsible after the fact.  Sometimes Judges will understand about expired
tags.

I showed up 60 mins before I had to in a case that I ran a Red Light and he
noticed me.  The Cop was late in getting to the hearing.  The judge asked if
it was ok if we waited a few minutes.  I said that was ok..  While I do not
think that was the whole reason he reduced the fine down 75%, but I suspect
it helped.

Witness cannot go on the police report because WITNESS left scene before cop
arrived.

I had expired CA tags.

My insurance has witness info, will get statement.
