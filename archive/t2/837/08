Sportsmobile Camper.

I believe Mine is a westfalia hardtop/sunroof that the Sportsmobile
added their pop-up and roof rack.  I have a westy owners manual and
stickers on the interior.

The Wikipedia doesn't include the term "Campmobile".  Is that just vernacular?
I

Looking forward to the anal details on this one.  I've baffled when
folks cry foul when I say I have a westy but they scream Sportsmobile.
