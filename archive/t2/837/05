Subject: Re: [T2] Head Part number

Hi everyone,

Well, the supplier reshipped what I'm hoping is the correct part.
However its still not exactly what I was expecting. I guess I was
expoecting a part with the VW and Audi logo stamped on it, like the my
original head. They advertise "Brand New, stock 1600cc Dual-Port"
which I guess I incorrectly assumed would be exactly like my old stock
1600 cc head.

Here's the details on the current head:

Stamped:
Auto Linea
010101375 13
G01

What did I get this time?

This is frustrating. Now I'm gonna have mismatched heads. erg.

Where can I get 1600cc OEM heads?

thanks
jules
