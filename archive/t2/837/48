Guy runs a red light in a pickup and is halfway into the intersection by the
time I see him
because I'm too busy verifying the fact that I have a green light before
proceeding thru.

I swerve, but not enough, catch his front bumper on the bottom of my front
door, steering overcorrection brings the rest of the bus back on his bumper
from mid-slider to the last few inches right over the bodywork and paint I've
been doing for the last month.

Impact knocks me over the yellow lines and off the road up onto the grass on
the other side.

CA plates with 'barely' expired tags gets no love from the cop.

Guy seems cool, but later reports a claim to my insurance saying he had right
of way.
Insurances will likely deny each other's claims, and I have liability only so
I'm a$$ out.

I have a witness, but the cop didn't put him in the report because he left me
his phone number before the cop got there.

Thoughts?
