Billy,

From my experiences, I can give you this advice;

Give the witness' telephone number and name to the offending party's
insurance company. Also call your witness and have him call the other
party's insurance company. A non-biased witness is much more effective than
an accident report or your account. I have been involved in several of these
type of accidents and every time the witness/es have been crucial to
assigning responsibility in an accident. Many times the traffic reports are
useless and are only required by the county/city.

Your insurance company should also be contacted with the same information
and they can handle all of the point-to-point litigation. They usually only
charge your deductible to get started.

When they decide to settle (and they will), be sure you mention that your
vehicle is a "classic vehicle" (+20 to 30 years old in most states) and
should be replaced at market value. They will most likely hire a classic
vehicle adjuster to come out and look at your VW.

Good luck and down with liars, cheats and thieves!

Jon
