Subject: Quarter Window Problem Solved

OK, I wasn't going to get to sleep tonight until I thought of a way to fix this. I remembered that the glass is just press fit into the frame. I went out the the garage and c-a-r-e-f-u-l-l-y pried the glass out of the frame. I should be able to find a pin that will fit, and with a little creative grinding with a Dremel come up with a new pin for the window to pivot on.  Jeff
