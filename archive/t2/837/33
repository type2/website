Subject: New 1600 Head Pics and Related Questions

Hi,

I've posted up some pics of my new head:

I have a few concerns with this new head.

First, one of the two of the spark plug threads has some damage. This
is visible in pic

The inner-most thread has a V shaped notch cut out.  Also in this pic
you can see some stamping around the outer edge of the valve on the
head assembly. I don't know from what or why this stamping exists. I
can however see that these stamps have cause a small ridge of metal to
pull away from the head toward the valve. I'm hoping a pic is worth a
thousand words and someone knowledgeable can offer some insight.

Also, a few months back I asked how you could identify sodium filled
valves, and I got a response indicating that "Normally the only way to
tell if to look at the face of the valve for a circule depression in
the center."

From looking at the pics, could someone tell me if it looks like
sodium filled valves or not?

I'm really looking forward to getting my bus fixed up. I could drive
it right now with a stretching (stretched) valve, but I don't want to
cause any permanent damage. Likewise, I don't want to rush into
installing a part that might give me trouble down the road. So if this
part isn't up to spec I'd like to know. Just need a trained eye.

Thanks
peace
