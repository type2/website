Subject: Weber 34 ICT and vacuum

Does anyone know what the vac hookup with Weber 34ICT duals should be 
for a stock '72?  The brake booster was replaced and it never ran 
correctly after that...  Not sure what the mechanic that had previously 
installed the Webers did what they should have done with vac then.  The 
new owner is asking if there should be a balance tube?  Sorry, I'm not 
knowledgeable in this area, so my question may make no sense, perhaps 
someone could intuit...  ;-)  Could be just some crap in one of the 
carbs, but it seemed to run fine before the booster replacement.

Thanks,

Teri
