American Collectors quoted an Agreed Value policy for my '66 Westy.
Basically it can only be driven for pleasure and club events (campouts are
club events, right? ;-), and not used for "camping".....

I got the same "we don't insure RVs" from a dozen other collecter car
insurance companies (and NO ONE will touch a 46 year old 1 ton truck..).

Do note that they DO require that you keep it in a locked garage when its
home, and they have mileage restrictions....though some folks have
indicated that at least in some states these restrictions are not
enforcable.

Oh, and they do want good-or-better condition.

I haven't actually insured it with them since it's only under an open pole
barn...the truck is taking the entire shop at the moment. Heh.
