You really should do this, although unless you cc the other head it's 
mostly useless data. The idea is you want the combustion chamber in both 
sides of the engine to be the same volume, to create the same 
compression ratio on both sides. Otherwise you create vibrations in the 
engine with one side pushing more than the other.
