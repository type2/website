You know, it's funny how those place names are almost magical to me. A few
years ago my family and I did a long bus trek from Toronto to California. My
wife's uncle live in Victorville and in the course of our extended
California tour we visited him three times as we crisscrossed the state. I
wish I were doing it right NOW. For someone who live in the cold north
country, being in the high desert in January seems almost like being
paradise :-)
