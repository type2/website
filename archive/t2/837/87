Jon, and all,

Thanks for all your good advice, it's what I needed.

My insurance has called the witness to take a recorded statement.
They said they will use that to deny the other guy's claim, and also
to try and convince the other insurance co. to make something happen for me.

My company did say they would advocate for me, though their pull is not
binding.

Police report comes out 1/17/06, then we will see what happens with the
claims.
