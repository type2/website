Subject: RE: [T2] Hagerty Insurance

I too had the same problem when I tried to get insured. I tried to add 
insurance to my 73 VW Bus, and also to my 1987 Fiero SE / V6 and I was denied 
for both. They basically just said that they don't insure them. Unfortunately, 
unless it's something like a hot rod, or a custom vehicle... the "classic" 
notion is more on their own perception. They were MORE than happy to insure my 
1981 special edition Trans Am (smokey & the bandit style II T/A), but they 
never responded to any of my e-mails on the Bus or the Fiero. And when I did 
finally call them they just stated that they didn't insure them.

Oh well... I just have all my cars insured by Geico and hope that I never get 
in a crash! heheh.. cause otherwise I'll get blue book value...
