hmmm, I've never heard TC making noise they usually just stop transmitting
power. but I'm sure it happens

a TC should last longer than 40k miles, wonder if he just stuck a good
junkyard TC or actually had one rebuilt.   fortunately the VW TC is
rebuildably and relatively inexpensive, don't know where you are located
but I've had em rebuilt at "Delmarva converter source" with good results.
they no longer have cores so you have to give em one to rebuild but it was
under $150

if you come accross a decent used auto tranny from one that is going to be
parted or junked grab it, but converting to a manual is a real tough job,
it's been done but not easy,  fortunately the later 010 bus auto tranny is
still rebuilable as the parts are readily avaliable, finding someone who
can do it well is more difficult but not inpossible,  prices seem to be in
the $800-950 range for a full rebuild with warranty


good luck
