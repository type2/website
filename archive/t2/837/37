Hi again Dave,

    Just for reference, most all "Flaps" have a chemical dye leak checker
for aluminum. Its a two part substance you spray on/around the crack and it
shows up as a line of different color, a little like the way "Magna flux"
shows up on cast iron or steel. Its a little pricy for a one time use
though, $15.00 to $20.00.
    There is also a "Oil leak dye" chemical you put in the oil, and run the
engine, and then shine a infrared light on the suspected area. Any oil that
is leaking will show as purple or orange depending on type of oil your
checking.
    Its like a 60's bar with a black light system, with the Stones and Doors
on the juke box. While you do your best "Shing-a-ling" in your tie dyed
ruffled shirt and white bell bottoms.
Man these flash backs are killing me!!!
