Subject: Battery light woes

	I have been fighting my battery light for the past couple weeks.
I've looked through the Bentley, Muir, and archives, but was wondering if
someone could help clarify a way to test the alternator and the voltage
regulator.  Both of which I have swapped in the past few days with
previously working versions.
	At idle, I was getting about 12.5 volts at the battery.  Since I had
swapped out the voltage regulator with one I knew was working before, I
believed that the alternator needed to be swapped.  Although, now that I
have done this, I am still getting about 12.5 volts at the battery at idle.
	Or, is there something else I should be looking at that I am missing
or need to look at?
