Subject: Mini-microwave for Westy?

Has anyone come across a REALLY small microwave for our westies? I can't seem to find anything smaller than about 17" long by 12 wide. I'm after a super small one that can just boil water, or cook a simple small supper etc. Name, and place and price would be helpful too.
Thanks,
Courtney
