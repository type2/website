Subject: ECU's California vs. other states

I have a 78 california westfalia that has long since been stripped of 
original exhaust. It has no crossover pipe or catalytic converter or O2 
sensor anymore. Do these modifications affect the performance? Should I 
be using a different ECU? Would it make a difference to use one that was 
standard in other states?
