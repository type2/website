Subject: Re: [T2] k&n air filter

Here is another way of thinking about your air filter choice.

Are you going to see a big improvement in fuel mileage?
Probably not.

Are you going to realize a big boost in performance?

More than likely no.

I run K&N's in everything I drive, be it my bikes, boat or cars.

Why?

I like the simplicity of being able to wash out the filter and reuse it.

I think I'm getting better performance, and in my V-8 vehicles I can
here the howl of the intake--but it's a totally psycohlocial.

I don't think the filter allows that much more abrasive particles into
the engine, if you have it properly oiled.

I do know that the more dirt it capture's the better it filter's---

It's a toss up--

Use what you feel is best.
Use what you like.

Follow your own thought process.

I will mention I have been using the K&N's for 40 some years and never
had an engine fail due to poor air intake filtration.

My Limey Bikes back in the 60's, 70's and 80's ran well with the K$N's
on them, and so do my current rides.


Have Fun-
