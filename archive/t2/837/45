Subject: Re: [T2] Mini-microwave for Westy?

<<Has anyone come across a REALLY small microwave for our westies? I
can't seem to find anything smaller than about 17" long by 12 wide. I'm
after a super small one that can just boil water, or cook a simple small
supper etc.>>

Your going the wrong way here----

Forget looking for the mini micro---

You just need a ride that will fit a normal sized unit.
