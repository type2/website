Alternator and regulator testing is not so easy for the average owner
(as you see in your Bentley manual). Leave that to the professionals.
What you can do is test for results. Voltage at the battery is what
you need. Your flaps can do that, and not much more, as thay too get
befuddled when they see a Bosch component, and often test innacurately.
You can check for the voltages at regulator termimals fairly easy.
You can't have a functional system without a working idiot light,
as this is needed to initially excite the charging circuit.
I suspect this is your problem, from your description.
Your battery is well grounded, but what about the alternator/engine?
Check the ground strap at the nose of the trans.
Accelerator or clutch cables should not be expected to carry the load.
You have voltage at idle, what is it at higher rpm's?
Does a charge hold overnight?

  I've looked through the Bentley, Muir, and archives, but was wondering if
  someone could help clarify a way to test the alternator and the voltage
  regulator.  Both of which I have swapped in the past few days with
  previously working versions.
  	At idle, I was getting about 12.5 volts at the battery.  Since I had
  swapped out the voltage regulator with one I knew was working before, I
  believed that the alternator needed to be swapped.  Although, now that I
  have done this, I am still getting about 12.5 volts at the battery at idle.
  	Or, is there something else I should be looking at that I am missing
  or need to look at?
