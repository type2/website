Gauze filters are a bit of religious argument.

When I was racing motorcycles off-road I used K&N filters.  The reasons I
used them were:

1. They wouldn't clog up and stop the bike from running, resulting in a
DNF.
2. K&N paid a nice contingency prize if I happened to place well.

Now, this was a racing situation where I was running a 2-stroke engine
that was rebuilt on a fairly frequent basis.  I was willing to trade
increased engine wear for a virtual guarantee that the bike would
ocntinue to run in the short term.

For my street-driven cars I wouldn't run a K&N on a bet.  They let a lot
of small particulates through.  In the short term this is not a problem,
but the long term effects are not good.

Now, a lot of folks will say "I run a K&N and I've gone 100K miles with no
problem."  They are telling the truth.  If you stay out of dusty
environments you could probably go 100K miles with no filter at all.

For a VW bus with the air intake at the rear of the vehicle I would
definitely not recommend the K&N.  The proper stock filter is best.
