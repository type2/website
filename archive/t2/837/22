Subject: k&n air filter

Tonight i went out to the garage and i took a look at
the air filter that was currently in my bus oh my god
it was nasty and dirty thank god earlier in the week i
went my local auto parts store and i special ordered a
k&n air filter for my bus. Currently i am using one in
my jetta. Anyone on the list currently using one in
there bus and did they see a improvment in horse power
and fuel economy like k&N proves you get better buy
using there airfilter well take care to all I am so
happy the weather in CT has been so mild it has been
50 for the last 2 days a nd i can drive my bus and
break in the engine with 400 miles on her so far she
has been handling beautifully thank you Bob Donalds at
