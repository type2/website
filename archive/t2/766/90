Subject: Replacement Center Heater Tube

I have a problem with my '72 Bus.  The Heat Transfer Tube from the back to
the front has some rust through places in it.  I have not been able to find
a replacement tube.  The tube for the earlier Buses is too small.  Does
anyone know where I can purchase this tube?  I do not want to cut out my
current tube until I have something I can replace it with.  Even a good used
tube section would be acceptable.
