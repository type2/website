Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of Bruck of Germany

Hello Guys   ever thing I have seen from Bruck has no where on it where it 
was made   I thought that was strange , dont they have to say where things are 
made on the outside of the boxes??  I had a customer bring me a crank and some 
other things from bruck and none of the boxes had anything about where they 
were made  the crank looked like an old crank that had been redone  was std , 
std   but the new mexican cranks come coated in costline (sp)  coating and have 
that new look to them  ,  the bruck crank had that old oil soaked look to it.  
Made me wonder???  later and have fun  mark dearing
