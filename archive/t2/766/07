 Finally fitted ammeter (or more accurately fitted huge power cable from 
rear to front) to my dynamo equipped 73. At idle, definitely drawing a 
couple of Amps from the battery. In fact doesn't really charge up until 
hit about 1500 rpm. Is this why VW changed from dynamo to alternator? Am 
I right in thinking alternators produce more current at low rpm?
