replace it, I had very little luck finding one.>

Yeah Type IV parts are something two hoard I guess. I've got the stock VW Bus engine con EFI, the engine for the Beetle (notice I didn't say IN the Beetle <griN!>) and two spares. All 2.0. They are impossible to find in my town so I keep spares. Were somebody to offer me another one locally today I'd quietly sneak it into the garage and try to hide it from Holly... <griN!>
