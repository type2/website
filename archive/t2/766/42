They don't mention it anymore. OE quality is a joke because the parts while adequate sometimes are definitely inferior for one reason or another.

Case in point: I bought the Bruck Type 4 oil cooler and had to grind away some of the lip on it so the oil cooler bracket would fit. Either the oil cooler is meant for another model (the foam was the first clue it wasn't right) or they've modified it in the processes of copying it.

How well does it work? Seems fine.
