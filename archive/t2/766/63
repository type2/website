Subject: Windshield Install

Hey Folks,
    Before I move on to the subject line, did anyone else find it amusing
today that a billion dollar spacecraft can suffer from a faulty fuel gauge
just like our old buses? Anyway, I installed a new used windshield in my '75
last Sunday, bringing my total windshield installs to 5. It went in easier
than any I've done before, total time less then 10 minutes. I put the gasket
on Saturday, then Sunday I let it sit in the sun for about 3 hours. The gasket
was soft and very warm to the touch, which I believe helped a great deal. My
wife (who has always has the job of pulling the cord from the inside) couldn't
believe it went in so fast, and is convinced it is going to fall out! I know
some consider installing a windshield a daunting task, but it has always gone
fairly well for me-the only one I've  cracked was when reinstalling a
windshield that may very well have been an original, and if so would have been
26 years old. Four of these were on Bays, and one Vanagon, which ironically
the Vanagon was the worst of all. We had to pull it and start over 3 times
before it would seat. So, if you need to install a windshield, pick a sunny
day!      Jeff
