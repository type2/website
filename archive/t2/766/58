The 72 tranny is the same tranny as the '68-71: an 002 tranny (as opposed 
to an 091).

It is possible that the 1972 002 tranny is beefier than the 1968 002 
tranny (it looks slightly beefier side by side), but when they talk about 
bomb-proof, I think they're mainly talking about the 091 trannies.

That said, depending on where you live, I know someone who would be 
willing to trade a running 091 for a running 1972 002 tranny. :)
