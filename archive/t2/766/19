Many thanks to both Mark and Martin. I neglected to poke at the library.

For the record, Tom Carrington's excellent howto is available at:
http://volksweb.relitech.com/cvjoints.htm

I wound up supplementing the information in both the Bentley and Tom's
article with another great article by Ben Cafferty I found via Richard's
site at:
http://www.volkscafe.com/vanagonparts.com.jsp?ps=ip&ip=1150562894

The illustrations in the bentley cleary show the orientation of the
inner hub, cage, balls, and outer hub to put the joints back together.
Ben's article explicitly stated things like the chamfered edge of the
cage goes down, and groove in the outer hub goes up -- very soothing for
a first CV job.
