11 out of 13 buses that have this issue will need a rebuild on the
transaxle soon. (ok, I made that figure up) There is a pretty good
chance that your transaxle is on the way out. However I would crawl
under there first and check a few things that can also cause this.

Check for loose connections, both the rubber mounts and the shifting
connections. Check that your bowden tube is still correctly in place
with the correct deflection in the bend. If these check out the other
typical failure is wear on the synchros in the transaxle. I have known
many bus pilots who have driven their buses for miles and miles with
just a bungee to hold it in 4th. It all depends on how much it bothers
you. The late bay people have to fight with the sand rail guys for
these transaxles, so sometimes finding them can be a pain. Good luck,
hope it's something simple.
