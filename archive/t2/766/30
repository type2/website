Subject: Starter Relay Switch on a 77 Westy

Volks,

Quick question...Marlaina just picked up a 1977 parts bus for our 69 
Westy (quit snickering!), and her dad needs to know where the starter 
Relay Switch is.

Thoughts? I don't have access to my books right now.

Grazie/Danke/Tak

Anton
69 Westy
"Konrad the Tiki Bus"
