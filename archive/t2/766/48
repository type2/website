Subject: Re: [T2] Shifter pops out

I've had this issue with my bus....while we were living in it and broke....

we drove that baby from Texas to LA, to San Deigo, to Death Valley and back 
to LA with it popping out.

It was so bad on the final route back to LA that every time we threw it back 
into forth after popping out, it would pop instantly back out......

SO we bunge corded it to the back cabinet handle under the bed!

Then we worked for a little bit and got a nice replacement for 
600-installed.
