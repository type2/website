Subject: trans swap, '72 into '68

With all the trans talk lately, 73 into 69, etc..... And also, pancake
motor into pre 72....... I have a question.  I have done the upright
conversion (ala Joe's NextGen) and have the good working 72 trans to
replace the lower geared 68 trans.  I am planning on that combo residing in
my 68 Westy.  Now, before I get all the negative response, this is a
conversion I am doing for many reasons, one of which is I like a challenge,
another is my knowledge and love of the type 4 motor, and another would
be...... well, I could go on and on.  From the onset of the project, my
main goal has been to keep it completely reversible.  So far so good.  Now,
I have not actually jacked this new trans up in there to see if there are
any major differences on the nose cone mount side of things, and I was
wondering if anyone has first hand knowledge of the similars and differs.
I am planning on fabbing a custom trans support for the rear, that is bolt
on and completely reversible, but how is the nose cone mount going to shake
out?  Shift rod length?  etc.....  This is the primary camping vehicle, and
we are in prime camping season, so the time I have to r & r, etc... is
somewhat limited.  I guess I'm looking for advice or info, to get my mind
in tune with what I'm up against when I get there.  I'm gonna be there
sooner or later anyway.
Thanks!
Mark
