Subject: Re: [T2] loosening disc brakes

Usually you can open a brake bleeder in the caliper before moving the 
pistons back, unless you never filled the resorvoir and can just drive 
the fluid back up.   Place 2 wedges (cut from 2x4, or splitting wedges, 
or tie rod pickle forks) between the rotor and shoes, and tap on each so 
the rotor is not stressed axially.  This should move the pistons back. 
If the shoes are out, I have pried the pistons back, using a clamp and 
something like a socket that fits into the piston center hole. If it 
does not move, the piston is likely siezed (dirt behind the seal).
