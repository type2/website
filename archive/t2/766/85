Hi Jenny,

The Chilton manual says it can be done by wiggling it out from under,
with a possible necessity of removing or loosening a heater box.

I find it much easier to get it from the top by removing the tin and oil
filler.

  How do I remove the alternator? Does the engine
 need to be removed from the vehicle? I looked
 in the VW manual. It shows parts breakdown,
 but not removal instruction.
