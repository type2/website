Subject: 73 to 71 "found an engine"

Wasn't there a company that made a kit that converted a type IV engine to a type
2 configuration?  They sold a over engine fan (like a bug engine) and all the
tin needed to make a bug type engine with a type IV (72-79) block.
Company was something like: Oregon VW,com or Oklahoma Engine,
