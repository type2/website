A few translated quotes from
http://www.michelin.fr/fr/front/affich.jsp?codeRubrique=2

- Michelin employs 30'000 people in France
- 1/2 of the tires manufactured is exported
- 60% of our people work in industrial activities (60% of employees in
France)

Clermont-Ferrand is where most of this activity is happening.
