Subject: Low vacuum readings when cold: SOLVED!!!

Hi Volks,

I tested and confirmed pretty much every single electrical component  
on my FI system and all the stuff that's easy to get to and could not  
locate the problem: Low vacuum at inital start up that makes the bus  
balky and stubborn for about two minutes or so. After two minutes the  
vacuum would magically rise to 15" and the bus would run perfect for  
hundreds of miles at a time. But if you let it cool down it would be  
hard to start once again.

YesterdaY I decided to pull the plenum and check it for cracks. I got  
as far as the intake runners, and discovered that the bolts were not  
fully tightened. Too tight to turn by hand, but no real resistance to  
my quarter inch ratchet. So I figured it would be better to just  
tighten down the runners properly and see if that would help.

Problem solved. Vacuum is immediately 14" and rises a bit as the bus  
warms. Driveable immediately without balking.


Happy trails,
