Hi Todd,

Wouldn't it be a better idea to put the filter upstream of the pump?

I have two reasons to prefer this:
1.  the filter protects the pump from fuel contamination.
2. A contaminated filter will increase the pressure in the line  
between it and the pump. This increases the chance of a blow-out and  
a nasty fuel leak.

YMMV.

Happy trails,
