Subject: RE: [T2] loosening disc brakes

If you have not removed the rubber hoses, then it probably will not reduce its
pressure. I had the same issue and the brakes remained on until I actually
disconnected the rubber brake line from the metal line attached to the
caliper. The fluid was able to be pushed through the line to engage the
brakes, but was not able to go back through the rubber hose since the hoses
were collapsing.

Try taking the brake line loose directly from the caliper and they should at
least not rub as tight. You may need to pry against the piston in the caliper
to get it to move back a little.
