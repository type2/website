The problem isn't the cooling, IIRC, but the mounting. The type 1 bus
mounting points are drastically different than the type 4 mounting
points.

Since beetles don't use a moustache bar, they're easier to adapt.

Hmm... If I wasn't at work I'd go measure for ya. I have a 73 and a 71
so can compare.
