I figured out how to remove:
 remove oil filler,
unscrew tin (3 screws to engine comp.,
1 bolt to engine), unscrew allen bolt
on adjuster, unbolt pivot from the
front (front is front of van) under the
engine.
 remove belt, pull alternator out
(it just barely clears through the
hole).
 I opened up the alternator, one of
the brushes is worn to the point
of not making contact. I found
brushes at the alternator repair
store.
