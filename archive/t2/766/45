The VW Golf/Rabbit/Cabrio/Passat/etc has a similar oil cooler in some applications. My '84 VW convertible did. Maybe they cross reference close enough to use them. 
 
<Case in point: I bought the Bruck Type 4 oil cooler and had to grind away some of the lip on it so the oil cooler bracket would fit. Either the oil cooler is meant for another model (the foam was the first clue it wasn't right) or they've modified it in the processes of copying it.>
