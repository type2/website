Just a splash of fluid (1/8") in a glass jar (and more as you bleed will accumulate) makes it easier to see the bubbles as they exit the tubing. I use vacuum or wiper washer hose - can't see through it but I can see the bubles as they come out in the jar of fluid. I use an 8 year old jar that once held Picante sauce. Narrow so the fluid column rises quickly (as opposed to a large mouth mayonaise jar).
