Hi John,

I have successfully installed a pair of carbs from a 1.8 onto a 2L  
block. No problems with fit. I upsized the jets with new mikuni jets  
from the local snowmobile performance shop.

Drove it like that for just short of a year, then converted to FI.   
The dual carbs were OK, but the FI is way better.


Happy trails,
