*IF* the engine is wider...
and
*IF* your carbs use the ball and socket linkage you can bend the
brackets in quite a bit if necessary. I don't know about the clamp
style that Richard shows on his site. Never seen those in person...

But PLEASE remove the brackets from the carbs before doing this! I
know it looks tempting, but if you bend the brackets while on the
carbs you're bending the carb, the intake and all the nuts and bolts
that are holding that stuff together.
