I see alot of German quality but no mention of made in Germany... 

<I looked at the ad...... where does it mention Bruck?> Nowhere...

Went to a Cooper/Michelin tire dealer to have a tire patched on the Cabrio on Saturday. Big banner inside proclaiming "American Owned" and the second line said "Quality Made". At first glance my brain read "American Owned" for some reason. Nice way to say that the corporate bigwigs at in the USA while the factories are in Mexico or some other far away land. 

Cooper, Wal-mart, etc is going to have to try harder if they want me to believe they are true patriotic American giants... <grin!>

Used my "Chicago Tool" sander last night on a side note. Made in China...
