Oh OH! You've done it now!

;-)

A top quality build of either engine will be quite reliable. The 1776
design (90.5 cylinders, 69 stroke) appears to be the most robust and
common upgrade.

But power isn't just increasing the displacement.

Heads, carburation, cooling, etc, all work together. You could build a
2 liter and still not have any power. Just read the Performance board
over on the Samba. (Skip all the "What do I need to put a turbo on my
engine?" posts.)

I've got a 1776 still resting in the cargo area of my 73 waiting for
me to clear enough of the garage to move it inside. It will power my
71 deluxe when I get all the necessary schtuff together. I don't think
I'd go any bigger since I want this to be a daily non-snow driver
while the 73 gets some much needed bodywork done. I worry about heat,
durability of the cylinders, and so on.

Some folks prefer just to do an excellent build of a 1600. With ported
and polished heads, and a mild cam, you can get nice power out of that
without spending more than the bus is worth.
