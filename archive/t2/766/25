Don, Chris, Karl, list-

I guess fitting the type IV engine is not worth the trouble.
When my 72 Bus engine exploded I tried to find a type IV engine to 
replace it, I
had very little luck finding one.  In my opinion the type IV engine our friend
has is worth a lot more than the bug engine needed for the 71 Bus.  Sell and
buy a bug engine or trade would be the quickest way to get the Bus on the road
(in my opinion).
