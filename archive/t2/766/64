Subject: Re:loosening disc brakes

Anthony,

	I once had a similar problem with my '71 camper while hundreds of
miles from home.  The front brakes were dragging just enough to feel it but
the bus could still be easily driven.  Of course after a number of miles the
front wheels were too hot to touch.  By chance I realized the pedal was not
coming all the way back up after I'd use the brakes.  It was staying down
about 1 inch.  After using the brakes I'd use the toe of my shoe under the
pedal to pull it all the way up and the problem went away.
	We made it home OK and the next day I took things apart to see why
the pedal wouldn't come all the way back up.  It turns out that the only
problem was the 30+ year old grease on the brake pedal pivot.  It was more
sticky than slippery and the brake pedal spring couldn't overcome the
grease.  I washed the old grease off the bolt, pivot bushing, spring, inside
of the hole in the pedal assembly and the frame mount and then regreased it
with fresh new grease.
  Problem solved!  So don't forget to check the simple things too.
