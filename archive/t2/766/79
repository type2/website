Subject: 73 alternator testing / removal?

alternator is not charging. Light on the
dash is ON....
 How can I test voltage regulator and alternator?
 How do I remove the alternator? Does the engine
need to be removed from the vehicle? I looked
in the VW manual. It shows parts breakdown,
but not removal instruction. There is one bolt
that goes into the "adjuster" side, and a nut/bolt
that goes on the "pivot" side of the alternator...
it looks like there is some tin in the way. If it
comes out underneith the motor, I'll need to
remove the heater box/exhaust/ some tin. If
it will come up from the top, it looks like some
tin needs to be removed.
 any tips?
 thanks, Jen
