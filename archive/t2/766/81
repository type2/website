Subject: No rear lights except amber - 1972

Just so no one gets the idea that I have FINALLY squared away my '72 Westy, 
my rear lights do not work.

None of them work except the amber lights for emergency flasher/turn signal. 
  Not even the side markers.

I hope it is just a simple thing, like a ground wire not attached after the 
engine was installed.

Dumb and dumber!!  when I was trying to start the '72 (dual Solex carbs), on 
the third turn on the key, nothing happened.  I thought I hit that infamous 
dead spot in the VW starting cycle, so I ran to the rear with a 22mm spanner 
and cranked the engine 1/8 of a turn.

Back to the front and NOTHING!!

Well, I noticed that my idiot lights were also not coming on, and the radio 
would not play...

Dumb me.

Back to the rear and the battery.  I have a battery cut off switch on my 
negative ground terminal so I can cut the current whenever I work on the '72 
and this gives me an easy chance [after I cut the ground from the body to 
the negative battery post] to measure any current drain, like at the micro 
level, up to 15 amps.

Well, the cutoff switch got loose.  I just retightened it and all was well
