Subject: loosening disc brakes

I'm trying to straighten out the brakes on my 1971
camper with front disc brakes. This all started when I
noticed that the van drove as though the brakes were
engaged, and the wheels seemed hot after a ten mile
drive. I yanked the booster, which was filled with
brake fluid and who knows what else, and got that
rebuilt. I also got a new master cylinder. I'll get
some new rubber brake hoses as well. I expected that
without the fluid in the system, the pads would loosen
their grip on the disc. Hasn't happened yet. What do I
need to do to back off the pads? Thanks.
