Hi BJ,

It'll work fine, but you should consider rejetting the carbs.

IIRC, the main jets used on the 1700's were 127s.  For the 1.8L carbs  
VW went to 130s, and for the 2L it was 132.5.

I'm not saying it won't work OK as-is, but it might run a bit lean if  
you increase the displacement without compensating with extra fuel.

Happy trails,
