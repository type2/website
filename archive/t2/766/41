Anyone driven a bus with the early tranny bolted to a Type IV engine? I have not. Longer stroke engine than original Type I. I have driven my Beetle with a stock 1500cc gearbox (ratio unknown to me) and another Beetle with only 40 HP but bolted to the 3.88 gearbox (highest Beetle/Ghia gear ratio box) and it was less than thrilling. My Type IV Beetle witht he 1500cc gearbox really pulled but turned "too hard" by my opinion on the interstate. 40 HP bug would have gone 100 mph but it ran out of steam at 100 kph unless downhill with a tailwind. 

Don't forget the gear ratios involved.
