Subject: '76 Camper 1800cc to '72 Transporter?

Dear Guru's,
In searching my local area for a used type 4 engine, I've found a '76
camper for sale. It has a 1800cc single carb (but is missing the carb,
but everything else is great). I've got a seized '72 1700cc with dual
carbs. The guy wants $350 for the engine or $500 for the car. In the
short term, I'd like to take the engine out of the '76, slap my carbs
from my 1700 on it and put it back in the '72.  Is there any reason
this won't work? They seem to be almost identical.

Thanks oh wise sages. . .
