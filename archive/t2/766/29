There's not really that much difference between a 1600 type 1 and a
1700 type 4. To me the main advantage of the type 4 is the sturdier
case and cooler running design of the cooling system. So while few on
the list agree with me, I will be running an aluminum case on my next
type 1 build. Also a counterweighted crankshaft.

As for power, I built my 62 panel motor to 1776 which give you durable
cylinders with just a little machining to open the case and heads. I
used a 100 cam which gives good power without losing low end torque
needed on a bus. Required some machining on the case to clearance the
lifters, but mild enough not to require heavy duty valve springs.
Weber ICT carbs give more power and help run cooler. These are
considered mild upgrades and should not decrease reliability and
longevity.

 Very interesting position. What type of upgrades we are talking about ?
 could you be more expesific in order to determine how much money must be
 spend to acheive a type4 power from a type1 and how about the realiability
 of this kind of engine.
