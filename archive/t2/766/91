Subject: 2.0 1978 engine rebuild  questions

I am in the process of a complete engine rebuild.  I am in no hurry, the 
bus has an engine and is running ok, just burning oil like a 2 stroke.  
The engine has been to the machine shop for work including: crank and 
cam checked and ground, rod work both ends, balanced, end play set and 
assembled, oil cooler cleaned and pressure tested. Basically a short 
block now, so I am ready to put on the heads and finish the assembly.   
But I have a few questions?

1.  Do I need to shim the cylinders?   Stock rebuild here, nothing 
modified.  Same pistons, rods, cam, heads as a 78. 

2.  Do I need to CC the heads?

3.  Is 20-50 weight oil ok for break in?   I have read on the break in 
of the motor and will change the oil very often during the first 500 miles.

Thanks in advance.
