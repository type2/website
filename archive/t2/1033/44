<776713.1333.qm(-at-)web31810.mail.mud.yahoo.com> I am in the process of mating a
Kennedy Engineering flywheel / adapter plate to my '72 002 transaxle. The KEP
flywheel requires a 200mm clutch/pressure plate. The '72 clutch I bought and
installed 2k miles ago is 210mm. So, my practically new clutch and pressure
plate can't be used. Not thrilled, but fine.  So, assuming I have a 200mm
clutch and pressure plate from a 68-71 bus in hand, can I use the throw-out
bearing from the '72, or do I use the '68-'71? The instructions with the KEP
stuff did not say, as they really assume you're doing this adaptation to a
68-71.

Does your 200mm pressure plate have a ring on the fingers?

If no, 71 and up bearing.
This pressure plate:  http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=311141025CBR
Needs this bearing: http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=113141165B

If yes, 68-70 bearing.
This pressure plate:  http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=311141025EBR
Needs this bearing: http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=111141165A

But..... look at how the bearing sits on the throwout fork in the two above.
