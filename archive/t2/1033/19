Does  anyone know if there is a tool to be had that fits the two notches in 
the  dashboard switch (lights, wiper, etc.) mounting bezels so you can easily 
screw  them on and off?? The best I've been able to come up with is needle nose 
 pliers, and that ain't so good.

hey rusty  yes they do make one . it is hollow in the middle with two  pins 
to fit the slots , most are made like a screw driver.  I have been  using my 
leatherman for years  :)  later   md
