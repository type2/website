Bruce,
don't kid yourself with generic ball joints, this is one area where you want the real thing:

Furthurmore, I've been told it takes a special jig/special skills to press them in correctly. . . 

the easiest path to assured success is to order the rebuilt arms from Bus Boys:

Unless you know an expert, don't waste your time having them pressed locally.
