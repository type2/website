Yes, this guy wants your business.

I would get a quote from the shop first, then show them your other 
quotes if you want them to meet or beat another price.

I think it's no surprise he will be somewhere in the middle.

Allstate will tell you to take it to one of their approved shops and 
they will guaranty the work and pay more if it turns out to be higher 
than their quote.  You do not have to take their offer.  Most shops 
will take insurance work.  You just bring in the paperwork from the 
insurance company.  In my opinion this may not be the best way to 
handle it.  You will get mostly cosmetic repairs with liberal use on 
bondo.
