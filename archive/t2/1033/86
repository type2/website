Subject: Fuel Injection and heater boxes

Hey guys, sounds like i will just use a T when i put my fuel injection  
together, thanks for the tips i didnt want to swap tanks.. Now, does  
anyone have a link to a complete breakdown of all the FI parts and  
thier functions?? Also.. I am running a 72 with a 74 1.8 in it. My new  
FI engine, does not have heater box flappers attatched, but the  
exhaust is complete except that, Now my question is.. Will my early  
flapper boxes and tubes mate with the later heater boxes???

Thanks!
