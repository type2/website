Subject: Re: Switch bezel removal tool?

Hmmmm....you're idea has spawned a slightly different idea in my  head.  I 
was trying to figure out how to get my hands on a cheap Taiwanese  deep 1/4" 
socket, without buying a whole set of junk tools.
 
It occured to me that I could try to find a suitable sized piece of steel  
tubing and use it in basically the same manner in which you have done with the  
socket.  I'll stop by the FLHS tomorrow and see if they have some steel  
tubing or a small bore pipe nipple that is the right size.

You will end up with  something like this but it would have a drive end so 
you will have your own nut  driver:
