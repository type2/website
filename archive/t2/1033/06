I understand your concerns as I don't like bringing it just anywhere. 
  The nice part is that I trust my mechanic and he's good friends with 
the body shop owner - they've known each other for 15 years.  This body 
shop also does a lot of restorations and show cars so their work is top 
notch.

The other thing I appreciated is that the Jon, the owner of the body 
shop, offered to talk to the insurance inspector regardless of whether 
or not I had my repair done at his shop.  I will most likely end up 
getting the body fixed at my metal shop when I have the front redone and 
then have Jon do the paint job when it's done from the metal shop.
