Clean  everything again before you tap in the new bushing, lube it 
with just a  spot of clean engine oil, I think.  Something may need a 
heartier  lube in there, can't remember.  Someone else will  know.




hey guys easy way to install the bushing is to electric tape the bushing  
onto a socket that just fits the bushing, attach an extension and lightly tap it  
into place.  the electric tape will peel off as the bushing goes in   later
