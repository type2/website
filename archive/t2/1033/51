Subject: Bad fuel pump??

How can I test to see if my 1974 Westy's mechanical fuel pump is bad?  

I was told by a guy that "seemed" like he knew what he was talking about to take off the fuel line
to the carbs, turn the key for about a minute and see how much gas is pumped.  I did that and
nothing was coming through.  So, I tried pumping the gas pedal ... nothing.  I just replaced the
filter so that's not it.  I spray carb cleaner into the carbs and it fires up OK then dies.

Say it's bad, where do I mount the electrical replacement?  

Thanks.

Steve
