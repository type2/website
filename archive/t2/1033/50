Subject: "beanie" buses and metric taps for sale

I have about 10 left out of the lot  I bought when Rocky Mountain closed down.
  They are a purple/yellow splittie stuffed bus. They have a VW logo on the front,
  new in sealed  bag. They are not made anymore anywhere. About 7" long.
  I sold a bunch of these on ebay for $30.00 and up.
  $25.00 including USPS shipping to the 48 States. Add a dollar for paypal.
   
  I also have two never used industrial grade US made metric taps. Flat nosed.
  M10x1
  M10x1.5
  $30.00 for both
