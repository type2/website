Subject: RE: [T2] electric windshield wiper pump and Escutcheon Tool

As several listees already know, I found the old pictures of my  wiper/washer 
swtcih electric washer switch conversion.  If anyone wanted  the pictures and 
hasn't already got them, pmail request to me.
 
Also, this morning I made an escutcheon removal/replacement tool, using the  
ideas other listees shared and fabricating it from a 1/8" pipe nipple.  I  
have pictures of that little goody too, if you're interested.
