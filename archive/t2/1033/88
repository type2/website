Subject: Sealing exhaust leaks

I finally got my exhaust system on and am very excited to being soooo close
to driving Zoey again.

Two days ago, I got her fired up and felt around to see if I had any
noticeable leaks from where I installed new gaskets. I did.

As I felt around a few of the connections, I could feel a light amount of
exhaust coming out of a few of the joints. Now when I prepped the flange
surfaces on my heat exchangers (they are  pretty beat up) I ground them as
flat as I could and banged them with a small sledge until they were
relatively flat. However, I can still feel a breeze.

Question:

Is there anything I can add to them that will help seal up the gaps? Is is
really even that big of a deal?

I saw that Permatex sells a spray on gasket sealer that is rated to 500
degrees. I am just afraid that it gets to hotter than 500 and that it will
just burn off.

Any suggestions?

TIA
