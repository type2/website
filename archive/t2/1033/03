Subject: Ball joints

Hi,

I asked an aquaintance who runs a local garage where I might find ball
joints for my '71. He said that he expected they could be bought locally as
a generic ball joint if I knew the size. My question is two-fold.

Firstly, are the ball joints really likely to be available as a generic part
(here in Africa)? (i.e. apart from the fact that those of you who have
replaced them report enormous difficulty in pressing them out, are they
"special" in anyway that might make a generic part unsuitable).

Secondly, if I can use a generic part, does anybody know what the
measurements are?

Thanks,
Bruce
