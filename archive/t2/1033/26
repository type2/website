there is a tool to be had that fits the two notches in the dashboard switch
(lights, wiper, etc.) mounting bezels so you can easily screw them on and
off?? The best I've been able to come up with is needle nose pliers, and that
ain't so good.Rusty------------------------------

I take a cheapo Taiwanese deep 1/4'' socket, like a 3/16 or 1/4, and a sharp
grinding stone and make them......

You will end up with something like this but it would have a drive end so you
will have your own nut driver:
