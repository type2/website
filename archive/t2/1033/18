Subject: Switch bezel removal tool?

Does anyone know if there is a tool to be had that fits the two notches in the dashboard switch (lights, wiper, etc.) mounting bezels so you can easily screw them on and off?? The best I've been able to come up with is needle nose pliers, and that ain't so good.
