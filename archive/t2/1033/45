Thanks, everyone, for your info.  It turned out to be my starter AND my relay.  
   
  One question, though.  The starter I installed came with a with a piece and tag, that reads, "WARNING! The bushing inside the bell housing MUST be replaced!  Failure to install this new bushing will cause damage to this starter which will result in a no-start condition on the vehicle."  Yet, there was no bushing on my starter or in it's slot to replace.  Also, the bushing does not fit in the slot, but the starter fits fine.  I only turned the car on to test it out, but am waiting to drive it until I hear some feedback.
   
  Thanks!
  Tracy
