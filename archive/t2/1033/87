Subject: Re: [T2] Custom 1977 Bus exhaust photos

I have never adjusted my own valves, I have my bus checked out and my valves adjusted at Trafton's every 6 months, I am working and going to school and have never taken the time to learn, I am sure it isn't a big deal but too risky to do it half-a--ed or to put it off.

I have replaced leaky valve cover gaskets myself and replaced the oil cooler and thermostat.

I do adjust the valves on my 1978 Honda CB750F Supersport and I am guessing it is similar, but it has solid lifters and I think my bus has hydraulic lifters, is this correct?

I am pretty sure that getting the valve cover off will not be an issue, the muffler is actually way over to the side, almost coming out on the side of the bus, that is partly what I was referring to about not being under the engine.

At worst it will be a minor annoyance like you say, but I wasn't going to be happy with anything off the shelf, I found some to listen to last week and wasn't impressed, my stock exhaust with a hole in it was quieter and sounded better.
