The one in the James' picture is not an Empi or Bugpack, but either an Ansa
or a Pacesetter.  The original version was the Italian made Ansa, followed
by Pacesetter's ripoff of it after Ansa stopped making theirs. The S&S was
very similar to the Pacesetter but considerably more expensive. 

We still carry the Pacesetter, and AFAIK it is NOT Chinese made. A few years
ago they moved production to Mexico, but then actually moved it back to the
U.S. again.  Even in its Mexican incarnation it was (and remains) a HUGE
step above the Chinese/Taiwanese made Empi, Bugpack, etc. ones.  

Given that the stock crossover pipe is not available for '75-79, if you need
an exhaust for that year range the Pacesetter is the way to go. (The other,
far better option - although pricier - is to switch over to 72-74 heat
exchangers and go with an OEM style 72-74 exhaust system.)
