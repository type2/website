Subject: Engine install

Hello all,

I finally had the time to install my rebuilt engine in my bus. Again, I
installed the tranny and engine as one unit. This was fairly easy,
except tightening one of the tranny nuts was a PITA (pics here:
http://tinyurl.com/67t9cy). Did not have time to put the heat exchangers
on, so I could not test whether the engine runs. This will be done next
weekend. Before firing it up, I have a couple of questions:
Since the heads are new, they're not oily. Do I have to pre-oil them? Is
there a break-in period for new heads? Or just drive as always. Should I
change the oil soon? Is there a test procedure to make sure the brake
booster and booster lines are not leaking air? Like spraying carb
cleaner all around?

Help is as always greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Timo
