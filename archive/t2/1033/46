The bushing is recessed into the hole...  If you can get up there with a 
flashlight and a mirror, you can see it.

You will need to remove the old one.

Use a tap - can't remember what size but I can look at mine later - it's 
o'dark thirty here and I don't feel like goin' out to the shop.  Gently 
thread the end of the tap into the bushing, taking great care to keep it 
centered and straight.  It's brass, I think fairly soft, so no problem. 
  Just keep crankin' er in there, gently and it will back the bushing 
right out of the hole.  Be careful at the end that you don't tap thru 
the back of the hole.  ;-)

Works great!

If there's ucky around the hole, first put some paper toweling in, 
taking care not to distrbute ucky inside the bore.  Then you can clean 
the exterior really well.  Pull out the paper toweling and clean the 
hole.  Clean everything again before you tap in the new bushing, lube it 
with just a spot of clean engine oil, I think.  Something may need a 
heartier lube in there, can't remember.  Someone else will know.

Oh, and make sure you have the proper bushing...  I think it's 
relatively common they give you the wrong one.
