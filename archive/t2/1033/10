Subject: Re: electric windshield wiper pump

It looks OK.  But for alot less money, I just used a generic washer  pump 
from the FLAPS, which I inserted in the line between the washer fluid tank  and 
the spray nozzels.  I wrapped it in foam rubber and stuck it in an  empty space 
in the nose of the bus.  
 
I then modified the washer-wiper switch, removing the washer fluid valve  
from the switch assembly and replacing the valve with a momentary electrical  
pushbutton switch (from Radio Snack).  The electrical switch is actuated by  the 
long plastic rod/tip of the washer-wiper switch pushbutton that originally  
actuated the valve.
 
I really like the result - the only give away is the pump motor noise when  
you push the washer button, and the fact that it works every time!
 
Somewhere I have pictures, which show the bracket I had to fabricate to  
mount the electrical switch in place of the valve on the wiper-washer  switch - if 
there is interest, I'll try to find  them.
