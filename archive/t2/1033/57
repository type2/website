Subject: 71 Rear Brake Shoes

OK... I am suffering from, as my wife says, CRS (Can't Remember $#!+) syndrome
this morning.

I am going through the brake saga on my 71 Westy.  First it was the front
calipers, then it was the master cylinder (don't you just love white smoke and
the smell of burning brake fluid in the air from your brake vacuum), then a
rear brake hose won't pass fluid, and now it is rear wheel cylinders...  :)

Oh well, such is life.

I called the local parts store looking for rear brake shoes and was told "In
71, they show two types."  Now, I know there was a change over in 71 and I am
at work now and suffer from CRS.

So... Today's trivia question:  Is my 71 Westy before or after 7/71?

Any help with my ailing brain cells would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael
