<742C1FA33268E748946D90A1F99EECA70AF46B6AC8(-at-)helios.montevallo.edu> OK... I am
suffering from, as my wife says, CRS (Can't Remember $#!+) syndromethis
morning. I am going through the brake saga on my 71 Westy. First it was the
frontcalipers, then it was the master cylinder (don't you just love white
smoke andthe smell of burning brake fluid in the air from your brake vacuum),
then arear brake hose won't pass fluid, and now it is rear wheel cylinders...
:) Oh well, such is life. I called the local parts store looking for rear
brake shoes and was told "In71, they show two types." Now, I know there was a
change over in 71 and I amat work now and suffer from CRS. So... Today's
trivia question: Is my 71 Westy before or after 7/71? Any help with my ailing
brain cells would be appreciated. Thanks, Michael

7/71 would make it a 72.

Look on your m code plate to see the exact date of maufacture.

Go here to figure it out:  http://www.type2.com/m-codes/

1971 rear shoes were 1971 only. 55 mm wide.  68-70 were 45 mm wide.
72 up were 55 mm wide but a different part number.

68-70             211 609 537 C [subbed to E]
71                  211 609 537 J
72-mid 73      211 609 533 B
