Hi Jason,

www.ratwell.com has everything you need to know. Download and read 
through as much as possible before you start the swap; it'll become a 
lot easier once you understand the function of each component.

The riser tubes from the early heater boxes won't mate properly with the 
late heater boxes. You might be able to fill the gaps with small bits of 
sheet metal, but it'll be a considerable PITA.

Happy Trails,
