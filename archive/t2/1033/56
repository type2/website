Hi Jason,

A fuel return line can be adapted with a simple T fitting between the 
tank and fuel filter. I've used one on my bus that way for many years now.

Starting with a complete FI engine you still need a fuel pump and new 
filter. You also need the ballast resistor pack, the decel valve and the 
hoses that lead to it. You will have to fabricate a bracket for the air 
cleaner box and a wiring harness for the bus side of the FI, with wires 
going to the fuel pump, starter, coil, etc.

Without the hole above the engine it will be a major PITA to work on the 
FI. If it were my bus I'd consider transplanting an upper engine hatch 
from another bus or vanagon before installing an FI engine. YMMV.


Happy Trails,
