Subject: UPDATE Re: got rear-ended - need advice

Hey Airic,
Some of you might remember I got rear-ended not too long ago and asked 
for advice for how to deal with the other person's insurance company. 
Well, here's the latest:

So far things are going pretty smoothly.  They had me bring the bus to 
one of their Allstate centers for inspection and the guy said that the 
repair would cost around 800 and they'd cut me a check right there. 
Well, my other quote was for 1600 so I said no because there was such a 
large discrepancy.

I then called my mechanic to ask his advice.  He also does insurance 
inspections to make sure claims are legit so I trust his opinion on 
things.  He thought that my body shop quote was high and Allstate's was 
low, which is kinda what I felt as well.  He gave me the name of a good 
body shop that he trusted so I went over there and the owner of the body 
shop also thought that one was high and one was low.  He told me to 
leave my bus at his shop and then have the Allstate inspector come to 
his shop to discuss the repairs.  I feel that this will be good because 
then I can have a trained eye that I trust to have the discussion with 
the inspector.

So, it looks like they will be sending out the inspector sometime next 
week.  Hopefully this will be resolved at that time... I'll keep ya posted.

Thanks!
Mike
