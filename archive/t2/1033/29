Having the body man serve as your advocate is a good idea.  Allstate
obviously tried to rush you into accepting a check (undoubtedly marked
"final settlement") just to get some money.

I'd emphasize in advance to the body shops involved that you want a
quality repair, not a bondo sculpture.  Have them deal with Allstate.
