Subject: RE: 71 Rear Brake Shoes

I just called my VW Parts store and they told me the same thing the local
generic parts store said.  "There is a rear brake shoe difference starting
between July and August.  What month of production is your vehicle."

So, maybe it isn't just me and my CRS syndrome.

My 71 Westy has power brakes.  I know they started that in 1971.  Does that
make my brakes a 8/71 and after for the rear shoes?  Or not?  What is the
difference in the rear brake shoes between pre-7/71 and 8/71-after?

Thanks,
