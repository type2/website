I hope you had the engine running when you did this test...  if the carbs
are full,,, and you let it run for 30 secs.. the pump should put out at
least 400ml .........   I have always seen almost double that.

Pumping the gas pedal does nothing for the fuel pump....

if you have to... fill up the carbs with a syringe.. or similar idea...  rig
up a container above the carbs,, and get gas to flow into them via
Gravity.... If your TANK it full,, it should already flow via gravity... as
the top level is higher than the top of the carbs.

once you have the float bowls full... put the line from the pump to the carb
into a container that holds at least a liter ,,  start the engine and run it
for 30sec.. if you get more than 400 ml ,, you have good volume

reinstall the pump to carb line... with a fuel pressure gauge.. and you
should get 4-5 psi...

If not.. remove the 2 gaskets in the case,intermediate block,pump assembly,,
and repeat above...
removing the gaskets will show if you have wear on the cam,, push rod, pump
arm ,,,
