Subject: 1957 VW Cab

Hey everyone,
   
  I just became the proud owner of a 1957 VW Cab/ pickemup truck. And, well as you can see by the pics, she is in need of some rebirthing so I need help doing the resto and have quite a few major questions.  First is wiring the engine, as my understanding it should be 6v, but it has a 12v battery.  The distributor is a VJ 4 BR8.  Coil is smaller than a bosh blue.  The generator doesnt seem to have any wires on it, bit has a box above it with a yellow wire going to coil + side. And another yellow wire just hanging there with a ammeter gauge on it with a thick black wire coming from back. And a red wire just hanging out doing nothing as you can deduce, she wont start, but will turn over very well, has new starter underneath. 
   
  The PO had a new muffler for it, but never put it on cause it wouldnt fit, too wide to bolt onto front manifolds and the j tube on left (driver side) is too short to reach (part number of muffler is 113 251 053 BH/ AJ).  I hope someone can help me out here with the wiring, doesnt seem to have spark
   
  The Cab Bus is still located at the PO house in Traver, CA ( just outside Visalia on Hwy 99 Fresno/ Bakersfield area.  IF ANYONE IS NEAR BY CAN THEY COME HELP ME OUT?  I live in Sacrament and will be spending this week registering the Bus and getting insurance, will go there next week on my motorcycle and work on getting her running for a fun drive home.

  PS. I am so excited about this find I can just crawl out of my skin
