I'm guessing you've never adjusted your valves because they're on the 
side of the engine ;)

Unless you have enough clearance to pull the valve covers off, you'll 
probably have to take the exhaust off to adjust the valves.  Shouldn't 
be that difficult with your setup, but a minor annoyance.

I do still envy having a good muffler..
