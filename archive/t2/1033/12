Subject: RE: [T2] electric windshield wiper pump

I was also intrigued and recently bought one.

The CIP1 unit is a real joke. The system's pump needs to be submerged but is
mounted to the SIDE of the tank at the end, not below at gravity level where
the pump needs to be. It is a classic sump style pump. The pump won't prime
without 100 percent fluid contact, so it just whines and whines. I don't
think they had an engineer review the design, or even a 4th grader. A
complete waste of money. I even modified the pump with a hose  and weight at
the suction end and it didn't have enough power to move any liquid up into
the pump. So weak it can't even get out of its own way.

It sucks and should be avoided. A inline pump which doesn't need to be
submerged will work much better. I like the previous poster's idea, and will
modify my system in a similar manner. I already had it set up similarly, but
with a pushbutton switch below the dash and it worked great. The pump I used
was a generic unit sold for classic Jeeps.

There are a couple of good things though. The wiring harness and pushbutton
style switch is nice and the tank, seals and fit and finish is good, too bad
it is all for naught.

It would be kinda nice to have some water to clean the windshield.  I 
haven't had water for.. ohh... 13 years ;)
