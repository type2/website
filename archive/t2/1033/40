Hey  everyone. My old 57 Single cab ahs a 40hp engine cide 7132000. It has 
the VJ 4  BR8 dist and old coil on it. Also has the older generator with the box 
above  it. Can I swap the dist and coil for a 009 with blue coil? And can I 
swap the  Generator to a newer DF/ D+ style?  It appears to have been converted

hello Yes most will swap out.Dizzy doesn't care what voltage it is, coil  
does .  the generator might need the 12V stand as it is larger than the  normal 
smaller 6V stand.  you will need to space the carb up some so that  it doesn't 
hit the generator or bend the manifold over a little to clear. You  will also 
need to add a 12v voltage regulator  later  mark  d
