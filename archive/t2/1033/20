Subject: RE: [T2] Switch bezel removal tool?

I use circlip pliers - forget the correct name for them but usually I can
loosen them with that. You can get a special tool or small needle nose and it
should work but those special pliers for circlips is great tool to have.

notches in the dashboard switch
