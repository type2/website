Subject: Hard shifting

We finally pulled the engine and tranny as one unit this weekend, put in the deluxe clutch kit from bus depot along with fuel hoses and ..., anyway now that it's back together it's real hard shifting into 1st and I have to wait for a while or shifting into reverse makes a real racket and lots of metal. ???? What did we do wrong? "78 2.0 FI, Federal.
