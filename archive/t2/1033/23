Just take an old large flatblade screwdriver and use your handy dandy benchgrinder to round the two sides so it's no longer a flatblade. Then grind a notch in the middle of it wide enough to clear the threaded part of the switch center. Takes about 10 minutes with a file and grinder and you have a nice tool that will last a lifetime.
