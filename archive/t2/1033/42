Subject: which throwout bearing?

I am in the process of mating a Kennedy Engineering flywheel / adapter plate to my '72 002 transaxle.  The KEP flywheel requires a 200mm clutch/pressure plate.  The '72 clutch I bought and installed 2k miles ago is 210mm. So, my practically new clutch and pressure plate can't be used.  Not thrilled, but fine.  

So, assuming I have a 200mm clutch and pressure plate from a 68-71 bus in hand, can I use the throw-out bearing from the '72, or do I use the '68-'71?  The instructions with the KEP stuff did not say, as they really assume you're doing this adaptation to a 68-71.  

Thanks in advance,
