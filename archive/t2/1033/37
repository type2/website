Subject: Holy Cow what a buy!!

Hey guys just got back from the first Utah VW Swap of the year.. and  
boy did i make out like a bandit!!! I was only looking for a  
thermostat, and the retaining springs for the pushrod tubes. .. Well a  
guy shoed up.. He had a Fuel injected 2.0 in the back of his truck out  
of a 79 that got hit in the front.. he bought the tranny (6 rib) and  
the guy said he wouldnt sell him the tranny without him taking the  
engine.. so i tried to convince him to sell me the thermostat and the  
springs.. he said insult me.. make me an offer on the whole shabang..  
i was like.. dude.. i only have like 20 bucks in my pocket.. so  
needless to say.. I paid 20 bucks for a running last week hydraulic  
2.0 complete from top to bottom.. exhaust and all.. now i have a  
question.. Since i have a 72, I will need to re-use my 2.0 heads i  
have on my 1.8 right? since those were square on the 79 am i correct  
here?? im gonna slowly rebuild this engine to make sure its perfect..  
but heck the case is worth well more than that!
