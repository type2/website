Subject: Decel Valve

The decel valve... When I removed mine I got much
crisper
reaction from the engine. With it, when I'd back off
the throttle, the engine would eventually decelerate.
Without it, when I backed off the throttle, the engine
instantly slowed. I liken the decel valve equipped
engine to some of the drive-by-wire horror stories
I've heard where the driver inputs info to the
computer and the computer makes the adjustments it's
programmed for (like Metro transit in Seattle!)
I heard decel valves are pretty hard to find also. -BaH
