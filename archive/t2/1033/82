Subject: Custom 1977 Bus exhaust photos

I got new exhaust put on my bus yesterday, I absolutely love it, it is very quiet and tucked up nicely.

It is weird that it doesn't get louder as I accelerate, the bus purrs very quietly at 60mph.

I had it done at Darrell's Economy Mufflers on 82nd Ave. in Portland, Oregon.

They built me a header from the flanges off a bugpack headpipe.
