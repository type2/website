mike ashley,your particular problem may relate to the clutch (racket and lots of metal suggests that something didn't go quite right w/ the new clutch install--do you have the right TO Bearing?), but anyone looking for improved shifting should look at the various issues described in this article:

Once you have the correct pressure plate, throwout bearing, etc...you also should consider items such as the shift rod bushings and the transmission nosecone.Good luck,
