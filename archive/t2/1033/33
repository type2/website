Subject: To Make Switch Bezel Remove Tool

To make the Bezel removing Tool..(snap-on used to sell
one) go find steel tubing at a good hardware store or
tubing supply house...make sure ID is big enough for
switch rod (Minus Knob)...then file the end down on
both outer sides leaving the middle 1/16th of inch or
smaller...the middle two parts you leave will fit into
the two notches of the bezel(after careful filing to
fit)..then Braze a "T"handle or use vise grips to
turn....Mine has lasted for years after fabricating
one when I was a wrench in the good ol'days....We
would make them from accelerator cable tubes that go
thur the 1971 and earlier fan shroud....we had alot of
extras then.....Tony
