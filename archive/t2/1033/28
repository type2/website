I'll be happy to share this with the list.  It's been a while since  I  made 
the conversion.  I do recall taking photos and I shared  them with the  list 
at 
the time.  I'll have to try to dig them out  again, and if that  fails, I'll 
pull the switch and take them  over.   That thought is what  led me to ask  
about..........the bezel removal tool hah hah.

If you care to   share the tricks used to put the
electric switch behind the original  switch  to use the
long plastic needle....so no extra holes are needed  in
dash  that would be great...luckily my vans are   complete..Tony
