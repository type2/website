S&S Headers also used to sell one also but I haven't seen it in their  
catalog for a few years now.

I installed my eliminator in 2002 and painted it with VHT high temp.  
This is a flat black paint with ceramic components. This $12  
investment has made this muffler last. I expect it to last another 5  
years based on its current condition. Except for some rust at the  
tail pipe and a few of the welds I didn't paint well, it looks to be  
in really good condition.

My main complaint is the quality control which can made fitting it  
difficult: at least the one I bought. For example - the exhaust  
hanger couldn't get close enough to the engine to bolt in.
