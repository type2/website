I can only speak to the vacuum part.  If your unsure of your vacuum
situation, I would toss a vacuum gauge in to check it over all.  Depending
on your values, you may not have to look for a leak, although squirting
small dabs of carb cleaner on the vacuum lines does seem to be a popular
route for sniffing out leaks.  High teens at idle (measuring in inches) is
what your shooting for.  Keep your elevation in mind.

Peace, Troy
