Subject: heated clothing 

I was at the motorcycle show in Toronto Canada this weekend... and came 
across a company with heated clothing...  http://widderca.com

The sales guy said they can sew the heaters into what every you want... 
seats.. pants... so if you can't find an off the shelf item.. ask them about 
custom ideas you may have.

I am not affiliated with this company at all..

I just found it interesting.
