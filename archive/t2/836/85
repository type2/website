Subject: Re: [T2] Dip stick boot I found a easy way

Thanks Andy and all those who have enlightened, educated, and 
encouraged me to change my cracked and leaking dip stick boot.  
While I'm now much more knowledgable concerning lubricants I 
still can't figure out how to get my big fat fingers over and 
around the generator, mustache bar, oil filler tube, et al.  
Apparently, thin hands and long fingers are the most important 
tools in this whole process...
