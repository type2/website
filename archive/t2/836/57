Hey y'all
As I continued to clean the case from the puddlejumper I found what 
appears to be a crack from the #1 top front head stud to the boss for 
the second small case nut.  This could be a result of the missing case 
nut.  Am I wasting my time trying to save this engine?  Pix can be found 
at http://fullmoonbusclub.net/gallery/index.php?cat=10041

I'm inclined to put it back together and see how it does, if the crack 
wants to leak or will everything be just hunky-dory.  I've cleaned about 
all I can, will stop by the FLAPS and pick up about 6 cans of brake 
clean to blow off all the gunkies and diesel then start the reassembly. 

Any thoughts on if I have a busted case or just a "casting flaw"?
