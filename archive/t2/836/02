Subject: Strange little breaker under dash

So my 77 Westy has this cool little "breaker" or fuse under the dash up on the
drivers side. If you peek under there, you can see a little red handle that
obviously resets it. What the heck is this for? The gas heater? This is in a
deluxe westy with the propane and fridge and Eber-V1 . :-)
