Subject: Type 2 Register dot com is done.

hey all,

I just finished the new application.

type2register.com

check it out.  Its pretty simple.

basically this system is simple, and easy to use, and serves only 1
purpose, to show case our type 2 VWs.

You can browse thru all the type 2s in the system, see the pictures,
read the blogs, and with an account, you can even post your own.

Posting to the type 2 register is simple; you create an account and
then register your type 2 VW's. This allows you to show off your type
2 VWs, upload pictures, and descriptions, work that you've done, etc.

First you have to register. Registration is simple, just supply us
with your name and email address (these items will never be shown, or
shared). There is no charge for using this system, I simply ask that
you don't post any profanity, or questionable content, keep it all
related to your type 2 and all will be well.

Once you have logged in to the system, you'll see the "my" type 2's
page. This page will list all of the type 2 VWs that you have
registered here. To register a new type 2, just create a new type 2
registration for the type 2 that you'd like to add, fill out the type
2 registration form completely and it will show up in your "my" type
2's page. Once there, you will be able to add seperate photo albums,
write ups, and blogs for each type 2 registered. How's that for
showcasing your type 2!

It's really pretty simple, and if we all use it, it could be really
cool.  A good resource for pictures of busses.

Im not done with it, there are features that Id like to add later,
but  only if it gets the interrest to make it worth while.

Well..

have at it.

Dave
