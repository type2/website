Hey folks,

Anybody have a line on Ronnie at Old Volks, as far as the availability on 
his new exhaust?  I stumbled across this Samba ad and thought it might be 
tweaked into a bus.  I like the dual outlets and the hideaway appearance.  I 
know Ronnie had worked on a version specifically for buses, but this version 
for the thing looks like it might actually facilitate a cleaner looking 
install.  Can the twin outlets be twisted downward 90 degrees and then into 
the airstream on either side? BTW, I have a '70 bay with a SP1600.

Eron
