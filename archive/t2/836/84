Mike,
As my work supports vessels in the 100K to 100M range, you can be sure 
I've done my research.
Of the two aerosol silicone products currently in my shop (CRC and a 
generic Ace hardware store label), both are designated as safe for use 
on rubber (the CRC product is the one that lists a hydrocarbon as an 
ingredient, and specifically says "for use on rubber").
The SCUBA guys are very concerned with the air they breathe. They do not 
want any aromatics in the mix. The solid grease they buy is absolutely 
the best, and that's because their lives depend on it. FWIW, it does 
work very well in this application, albeit more difficult to apply than 
a spray.
We are, however, talking about a part (dipstick tube rubber) that by 
design is constantly in contact with an hydro carbonic oil. The life 
expectancy of these after market parts has been published to be in the 
2-5 year range. The only rubber parts that I recall changing due to 
failure from hydrocarbon exposure were motor mounts on a '64 Impala and 
a '64 skylark, both more than 18 years old.
My point is that most silicone aerosols do not contain hydrocarbons, and 
those that do are safe for use on rubber. Water soluble solvents (i.e. 
alcohol, gasohol, ethanol) are rubber's enemy.

Respectfully,
