Subject: Using Rustoleum Primer

I'm encouraged to see people using Rustoleum as a method of painting their
busses.  I have two questions:

1.  Should you primer over the Bondo spots

2.  Is it alright to use "Premium Rust-oleum Clean Metal Primer?"  It does not
say if it is for indoor or outdoor

     use.  I did not see Rustoleum Auto Primer.

Thanks!
