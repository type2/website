I can relate. I have 4 VWs in my garage (very crowded) wanting to be driven.
Is not the cold keeping them inside, it's the salty roads. I live in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, they salt the roads here HEAVILY!  For those of you
that live in areas that don't see salty roads or are not near the ocean, you
may not realize what salt does. It's not just rust it causes, but a fast
VICIOUS rust. It gets into every 'nook and cranny' and spreads fast. It can
kill a VW bus or bug in just a few years. I've seen people move here from
the west coast with  near perfect solid VWs and two or so years later its
off to the bone yard because they drove em in the winter.

I'm lucky to get 7 months out of a year of driving. My VWs don't come out
until I can lick the roads and don't taste salt!
