That was a grievous abuse of a perfectly good bus. No decent-running,
driveable bay should EVER be treated like that! On the other hand,
that was also freaking SWEET!!! My wife and I were cracking up!

I actually performed a similar feat a few years ago in my old
aircooled Vanagon, only not intentionally and not into water. It was
at night, and there was a very eery zero-gravity sensation as the
roadway dropped out of the headlight wash and I realized we were
airborne. The impact was enough send the contents of the interior
flying about, but a close inspection the next morning showed no damage
whatsoever. I didn't press my luck after that, though...
