Subject: RE: [T2] Help needed: Installing engine surround seals. 71

Use the first piece on the removeable engine cover(rear), and split the 
second piece to use on the left and right sides of the engine.  That's what 
I think I did.  I could be wrong...it's been a few years.

Hi

I want to replace old broken seals, with engine in place. I have the 2 new 
ones in hand, but no instructions. Do I need to remove any tin? Beyond doing 
while engine is cold, I am a neophyte.

please help
