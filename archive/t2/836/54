to this feeling - just counting down the days/weeks until it is 
safe (and warm enough!) to get the thing back on the road." 

Hi Greg, you really know how to hurt a guy.  I'm down to only 
one vehicle now so I'm driving my 76 Westy daily here in the 
Siskayou mountains of Southern Oregon (rain, snow, ice, more 
rain).  I related my horror story about sliding into the creek 
and banging up my beautiful new yellow paint and body work a 
while back but the bus is still running happily.  Well...that's 
a lie.  It still has the Weber progressive from the PO so it's 
prone to carburator ice and stalling.  Other than that, however, 
it is just as happy in the winter as it is in the summer.  Not 
bad for a thirty year old bus.  Road salt is not legal in Oregon 
so I'll improve the carburator(s), improve the heater, and get 
the rear window defroster working and...keep driving it daily.

Jeff
