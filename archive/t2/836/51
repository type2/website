Subject: Paint new trailer to match my bus?

Looking for some paint expertise here...

I just got a new trailer from Horrible Freight, and am contemplating 
rattle-canning it to match my bus.  It's a typical cheapie Chinese 
thing, the paint is thin in spots and dinged from shipment.  I had 
picked up a spray can of automotive paint at Wally World a few years 
back that was a great match for the Mexico Beige of my bus to use for 
touchup, hopefully they still carry it.

Now, is it even worth spending $$ and time on a few cans to do the 
trailer frame?  Will it just flake off or is there a chance it will 
stand the test of time?  Is there something I can prep the surface with 
that will hold the new paint?  The trailer frame is REDREDRED.  If I do 
paint it, I figure the time to do it is before assembly...

Thanks!

Teri
