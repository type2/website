Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Jump

When I originally purchased my first bus (78 Transporter,) I made the
mistake of taking a turn onto a road where the turn suddenly went up hill.
The bus was on two wheels for about 3 seconds (an eternity it seemed.)  I
was a little more cautious after that.

I actually performed a similar feat a few years ago in my old
aircooled Vanagon
