In my more carefree days, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, in
addition to driving Type 2s all over, I also chose to ride and tour on a
H*nda GL1100 Interstate.  Widder was and still is a very popular,
quality outfit when it comes to heated gloves, vests, jackets, chaps, pants,
socks, etc.  Been using their products for aeons.  Now that I drive a Type 2
with a REAL heater, I don't use them as often tho....
