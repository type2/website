Subject: Re: [T2] longing for warmer weather

Talk's cheap - there are a great many 10 year old cars on the road here in 
Ontario that are pretty much rust buckets. I had an 89 Jetta a couple of 
years ago and the rust was so bad that a hitchhiker pulled the door handle 
off in his hand. That 89 Jetta had way way more rust that either my 78 westy 
or my 60 bus - Why? Road salt and winter driving! There is a reason why 
there are very few early cars around Southern Ontario - and that reason is 
road salt.  IMO - either you are stupid to drive your bus (or any old car) 
on these salty roads or you don't care about your car, or maybe you can't 
afford a winter car.

As I say, talk is cheap - its easy to say to someone buses are meant to be 
driven when it is their bus rusting out and not yours. What kinda person 
would spend thousands restoring an old bus with cheap replacement Brazilian 
panels (becuase they are all you can get). Then drive that bus in the winter 
to replace those same panels again in 4 or 5 years???

Ontario, Maine, New York, are not Missiouri or North Carolina - different 
climates entirely.

I'm not afraid of being cold in a bus. My 78 has a gas heater and I've 
driven my 60 in 30 below weather while holding a propane heater up to the 
windshield so I could see - Know what 30 below is like? But - that was on 
the praries where they rarely use road salt.  I would never do that in 
Ontario - unless I absolutely had to.
