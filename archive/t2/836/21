Tried that. Only wanted to idle when set WAY too high. I'm about to head
outside and check the valves in case there was a lock nut not tightened
down enough and I have one tightening up. If that fails I'll try to have
the guy that synched my carbs look at it when I start my trip to BBB
tomorrow. He's 2+ hours away from me so it should be warmed up by the time
I get there.

Anybody headed to Havasu that's good with dual 40's on a Type4 motor? I'm
slowly warming to the idea of financing a MegaSquirt install when my laptop
is paid off even though the Webers are essentially new. It may just be
break in issues though. This 700 mile (RT) trip was the first time the
engine has been run more than 50 miles in one shot.
