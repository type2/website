You may have just had a stiff throttle shaft that has loosened up and
allowing the idle set screw to finally rest on the idle cam. Ditto a
stiff cable that has loosened up and allowing more slack in the cable
to enable return to lowest idle position. Try just turning in the idle
speed screws again.

See you soon.

 That's what has me stumped about the no idle problem. Seems to run OK at
