our city determines how bad a winter they had by how many thousands of
tons of salt were spread on the roads...  and I ski so get to some mighty
cold places.

well I like to drive my bus and it is a personal opinion, not telling
anyone how to treat their bus,  but I prefer to drive and weld than let it
sit all winter.  some panels are coming up on their 3rd replacement, and
all the frame members have been re-enforced with 1/4 inch angle iron, etc
etc etc... I still like driving it and as long as I can keep it safe and
reasonably dependable I will probably keep driving it.  (besides I can't
afford another car and have no place to keep it if I did)

YMMV
