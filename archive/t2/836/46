well when I needed a home office we found that the living room was the
least used room in the house, so my office is the former living room, and
we expanded the kitchen, since that is where everyone is anyway.

as for a vehicle,  when we bought my wife's S*turn we had to have it
special made because we didn't want power anything seats, windows etc. but
did want traction control etc.  they wanted to give us free all the
"stuff" but didn't want it.

same with my bus, I have several times tried to buy an "empty box" van
from VW.. and it is just not even possible,  you get a "Truck" or a fully
loaded van.  I don't particularly want a "truck" but a van without all the
garbage in it..   at this point if my bus died and I could not find
another I would probably take the city bus, well maybe the Sprinter is
about as close in concept as our old buses...
