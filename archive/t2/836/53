Subject: Re: [T2] Paint new trailer to match my bus?

Hi Teri,

If there's a professional, old-school sign shop nearby, drop in and  
ask if they still do signs with enamel paint. The sign industry uses  
a special blend of enamel that is available in a wide range of  
colors, goes on super-smooth with a brush, lasts a long time and is  
very, very opaque. It ain't cheap, but it's a good fit for what  
you're trying to do.

Otherwise I'd recommend a good gray primer under the beige, and  
expect to use multiple coats of the beige.

Happy trails,
