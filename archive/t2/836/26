Subject: longing for warmer weather

So here I am in Maine freezing my baguettes off.  The Green Monster is in the garage, where it has been sitting amongst empty beer bottles, trash, and a container of salt ice melter that is just far enough away from it so that it can't do any damage (I hope).  I don't have much to do today so I just went out there with the battery that I keep inside on the trickle, fired the bus up, and stared at it.  Which made my day.  I thought you guys could relate, perhaps, to this feeling - just counting down the days/weeks until it is safe (and warm enough!) to get the thing back on the road.  The best part about it is the explanation to the wife.

"What are you  doing?!"
"I dunno.  Staring at it and listening to it, particularly that airbound lifter that is piquing my interest."
"Why?  I can't imagine anything more boring."
"Oh.  And you just got back from shoe shopping right?  I can't imagine anything more boring than THAT.  In fact, I'd rather have the neighbor come over and hop in the driver seat while I lie down in the driveway and have him drive back and forth over me than do what you just got through doing."
"You'd let the neighbor drive the bus?"
"Well, you've got a point there."
