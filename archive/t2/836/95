Subject: Re: [T2] which my buddy heater should i buy

I just got one for xmas - the only models of the mr heater buddy that i saw
was the regular sized one then a "big" mr heater buddy (probably to big for
a bus, maybe for a garage though) - I belive the small ones put out 4-9,000
BTU which is plenty for me, especially because i upgraded from my old black
cat which puts out at most 3,000 btu (and still burns the heck out of you
when it lands on you when rolling a bus).

I used a bungee cord and strapped the heater behind the passenger seat (my
fridge is currently out) it wasnt direct heat on me, but definately heated
the bus up - however even with the dr side widow cracked I still had to use
paper towels to keep my windshiled clear - I want to get one of the small
window squigee things (for the lack of a better term) :)

good luck!
