Anton,

Ya needs to watch the Discovery channel more....

Not as disturbing as coming home and finding your dog dead cause he ate 
one.

The cane toads are absolute pests in Australia *and* poisonous.

The typical importation of non native fauna into a new area and the 
problems that go with it.

Kinda like fire ants here in the "south"  If you could drive over 50
fire ant mounds in your bus in 10 minutes and not hurt your bus and it 
would kill them all, would you do it?

Ever been around fire ants?

Cheers, dave
