Subject: Por15 question

I need to seal a gas tank. I have received the kit and intended to do it
within the next few weeks but the instructions say it works best when done
around 70 deg f. I can warm up my shed with an electric heater but the
warnings on the can of sealer says combustible. Does this mean that it gives
off flammable fumes while curing?

If I warm my shed with electric heat then turn off the heater before pouring
in the sealer, the shed might stay warm for a couple hours at best. Would this
be long enough that I could bring the tank into the house without worrying
about the fumes getting me stoned or blowing up when they get to my gas
heater?

Or must I wait till spring?
