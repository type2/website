Bug wasnt listed in the email - but was it that fact that when you are
creating a new album - and you click "example" - that the page that opens
(new window) is "about:blank" :)

Or is that a new one ...

BTW coming from a web designer, you did a really great job on the site, I am
assuming you are using a database? I am still definately impressed - I may
have to talk with you - once my "Riviera
registry<http://rivieraregistry.com>"
get a little more popular - I am only adding them by hand (HTML/CSS).

GREAT JOB!!!
