Guys,

While I didn't seethe reference tothe original article, I did see/read an 
item last week where VW had sent a team of "engineers" into the states to 
see what it actually *is* that Americans want in a car.

Their conclusion?....wait for it!


Americans want to do everything in a car except drive it.

Eat, drink, watch TV, talk on the phone, put on makeup, shave,
comb/brush hair ...etc.

Their second conclusion was that they were no drivers left that actually 
wanted to *drive* their cars.  A conclusion that I suspect matched their
market group.  They did apparently attend some "local" swaps and car 
shows.


So, they decided to make cars that match what the American market wants
a car for.....and extension of your living room.

I don't guess I will be buying one of those either....

Cheers, dave
