Oh, I think I was taken out of context...

Seeing THAT many Cane Toads on the road at one time was what  
disturbed me...not the dude playing Frogger with them!

More power to him!

I did see a special (on Animal Planet, I think) about those grody  
amphibians, and remember getting a lecture from a friend of mine in  
Hawaii about how many dogs die every year "licking the toad."

As for fire ants here in the South...yeah man, I am a firm believer  
in stomping those suckers flat.
