Heater Buddies are good when camped with no hookups, and you can crack a
window.  For driving, I had one standing on the floor of the front. 
Make sure it can't tip; I tied it to the front seat frame. Downside is
the water vapor it produces that fogs up the windshield and can condense
on metal you can't even see.  I have both a 12v electric blanket (see
truck accessories)and a 120v lap blanket. The 120v one which you use
with a 400 watt inverter is far better; being 168 watts max on high and
80 on low.  Remember to turn it on AFTER the inverter is powered, and
turn it off before powering down the inverter.
  The 120v one on low is still a bit better than the 12v blanket.  You
can sit on it and wrap it around you or use it for rear passengers while
most of the stock heat goes to the front.  My daughter used it to keep
some fish warm on her return to college in her 75. (Lined a box with it,
then had 3 pretzel tubs holding the fish). Her stock heat is great with
a blanket curtain behind her and the heat to the rear shut off. A
curtain rod is very easy to make from either 3/4 x 1/8" aluminum bar
stock or a scrounged piece of camper curtain rod.  Bend it to fit the
roof shape, screw it down at the ends on the door posts.
