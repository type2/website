Subject: i cleaned my shifter (and other ramblings)

i took everything from the stop plate on up off and cleaned the hell out
of it.  the pin and spring at the end of the gearshift lever now move
freely.  i still get some rattling at higher RPMs, but overall it is
much quieter and shifts much better.  when i had everything off i
noticed i was missing the guide sleeve.  is this contributing to my
rattle?  are they still available?

my two major annoyances have been fixed.  two weeks ago i fixed the lock
mechanisms on the front doors.  they work like butter now.  i also sent
the rear hatch lock and my newly acquired engine bay lock to steve
sandlin to be rekeyed.  the shifter is now very smooth as well.  the
only major annoyance is the lack of new interior panels.  those will be
coming soonish.

sorry.  no pics of today's activities.  i got lazy.  besides i'm sujre 
you're all getting tired of seeing pics of my dirty parts ;)

she's becoming a well kept lady...
