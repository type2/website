Subject: Need a brake booster

Volks,

My brake booster has died.  I got in touch with Bus Depot and they have a
rebuilder who will repair it, but after saying "yes" to sending mine in for
rebuilding because I *knew* I had one in the parts stash, I went looking
this weekend and I can't find it.  Does anyone (preferably close to DC) have
a spare they can sell me?
