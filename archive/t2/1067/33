Subject: Swap 77 exhaust to 74 - 2009 version.

I'd like to scrap my 1977 heat exchangers & muffler, and replace them with
the pre-1974 versions of the same.  I've searched the archives, and it
doesn't seem like there has been much activity on these lists regarding this
particular switch since 2002.

The parts list, per OldVolks: http://www.oldvolkshome.com/2exh7279.htm
I haven't dropped the old, but I think I'll be able to use the old bolts.  I
may need new hangers.

Does anyone offer a kit for said switch/upgrade?
What's the difference between the sub $300 heat exchangers and the over $400
heat exchangers available out there?
Any words of wisdom?
