Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 window wiper motor

And watch what grease you use if you're in a cold climate. I used synthetic 
grease in my VW bug wiper motor, and it is too thick, and causes the motor 
to "lug". I would suggest a good graphite/oil lube instead of grease. I had 
to dismantle the motor after I had greased it, and it ran almost twice as 
fast after using the graphite/oil lube.
HTH,
