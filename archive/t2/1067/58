Subject: Replacing outer step vs. replacing entire dogleg - 68 westy

I am doing some sheet metal repairs to the bus, starting with straightening
out the crinkled up nose.  I am now moving on to pulling the winshield,
fixing any issues under there, and then moving to dogleg area, particularly
the outer skin in the step area.  The portion covered by the door when
closed is pretty solid.  It is mainly that area below that, covered by the
bumper.  Looks like it had been puttied up at some time, and it is falling
apart now.  The inner skin looks to be pretty solid, (based on looking and
prodding) so I am contemplating just cutting out the bad on the outer skin,
and replacing with welded in homemade sheet metal patches (from donor VW bus
steel of course ;)).  Then in the future when the entire dog leg needs
replaced, just do the whole thing.  I cannot see any reason to replace the
whole thing when it doesn't all need replaced.  Any thoughts / advice /
suggestions?
