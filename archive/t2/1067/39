Heh... you like that 2.3 watt draw?

Yes, the part number I gave fits the Westy and regular dome lights.

The price is $14.95 each:
http://www.superbrightleds.com/cgi-bin/store/commerce.cgi?product=CAR&keywords=&cart_id=552723.16983&next=50about
2/3ds the way down the page. Not really that bad if they last.

I want to try some of the instrument lights; looks like the *T1.5-A-N
*and *T1.5-x
*might be just the ticket, but I want to confirm the size before I order
them.

Browse the site... they have all kinds of automotive LEDs, even daytime
running lights. I went a little crazy and spent about a hundred and fifty
dollars there on some stuff for my boat (home), including some of this
groovy stuff http://www.superbrightleds.com/specs/FLS.htm in the RGB and a
controller. Way cool, you can make any color of light you want, and the
controller has a wireless remote. I put it up in the valence above my
curtains... looks like a movie theater.

I know, I'm offf the deep end. Somebody stop me!

"To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of
his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose
fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate
arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
