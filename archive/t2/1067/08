I see it a bit differently.  Posting VW parts that one has just put on 
E-Bay says to me, "Hey, I need to sell this stuff and I want to get top 
dollar for it so rather than offer it up first to fellow listmembers for 
a reasonable price, I already listed it on E-Bay and if any of you 
people in this blog or whatever want my parts you can go bid against 
everyone else on the planet for them".

Personally, I have a higher allegiance to the members of this list than 
to the rest of the world and so I (and many other people here I might 
add) always try to give a good deal to someone on this list first.  Now 
I understand that I have no right to ask others to do the same, but we 
did vote on the E-Bay thing and it has been clearly stated in the 
charter ever since.  The charter is a relatively short, simple document 
that we are all required to follow and it never ceases to amaze me how 
many people, even some who have been on the list for years, seem to have 
no idea what it says.

I happen to agree with you and I also voted and lost.  But that's the 
way it goes...
