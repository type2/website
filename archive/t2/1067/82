You need a big socket with a really big handle.  That nut is on there 
very tight and a puller won't do you any good.  After you remove the 
nut, the hub will slide right off.  The bentley describes this process 
if I remember correctly.

Why are you taking everything off?  Now, if you want to take everything 
apart for kicks, you might as well change all the seals... if there are 
any.  I've never done the rear bearings.  But you might as well change 
the bearings if you're gonna go through that much work.
