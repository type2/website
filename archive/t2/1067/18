I have found plenty of fabric shops and plenty of trim shops. Lots of and lots 
of dress and drapes materials. Good shops but few that have any plaid in 
stock. 

Not many upholstery supply places here. Small town life... I could go to 
Chattanooga or Knoxville or Nashville but not being home turf it is hard to 
know where to start. I did look all over Knoxville one day with limited 
success. I brought home about 15 yards of a grey material I thought I wanted 
to put on the seats (color neutral no matter what the exterior of the bus) 
but in the end I still wanted a plaid. 

Wish you lived closer. I might have access to the proper sewing machine but I 
lack the skills to use it. Time to learn maybe...

Do you have any websites you recommend for supplies?
