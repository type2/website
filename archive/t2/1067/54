Subject: Disk brakes for my 68

OK, here goes.  I want to install front disk brakes on my 68 Double Cab.  I
was told I could use some off of a 71 or 72?  I checked the archives, but did
not find any reference to this conversion.  I'm sure someone here has
completed this project or knows what has to be done.  What do I need in the
way of parts and is it a major PITA, any info as usual will be greatly
appreciated.
