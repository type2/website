Subject: '74 Westy rear brake shoes

Hi, upon dissassembly of the rear brakes on my '74 Westy, I did not find any
brake shoe retainers or springs or retaining pins.  Bentley on page 23 of
brake section, shows them in diagram and tells to take them out...but mine has
none, so what holds the shoes to the brake backing plate?  Also the parking
brake cable activation arm, attached to the top of rear shoe, had a bolt and a
nut to secure it..no mention in Bentley.."remove horseshoe clip".  Just trying
to "cypher" what is what.  Cheers.
Syd
