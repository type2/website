The operators of the KOA in Flagstaff are bus people, and really cool.
Contact them.

Flagstaff KOA

"The campground is set at the base of Mt. Elden in the tall pines at 7000ft.
We have 2 bathroom facilities with showers, 2 laundry facilities, a Kamp
Kitchen making breakfast every morning, Free Wi-Fi, on-site store with a
stellar beer selection and a group events building with large fire pit for
all of us to congregate and enjoy!"

Hope that helps
