Subject: New engine help

Hi, hope you are fine...I am in the latter throws of installing my 1.8 L
engine with a "bit" more cam, the same "big" non FI valve heads, 34 Dels,
"oregon" headers, and free flow exhaust...and was wondering about
"megasquirt"...at this time...What ..if any.. performance will I
appreciate...versus creating installation apparatus?  Also...on a different
topic..but since I am here..  what tyres can I put on The Audi 7JX15 H2 rims
that I am installing..that have been tried?  Always open to conjecture..
thanks.
SQUID.
