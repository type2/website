Subject: More Tartan upholstery thoughts...

 had further thoughts about why VW or Westfalia built their campers with
100% synthetic fibers (was it polyester or nylon? Are they the same thing?)

 guess NEXT time I'd buy 100% synthetic fibers for upholstery. The blend I
bought ought to be fine for the occasional use our vehicle will get as a 3rd
vehicle. Not worried about my wool/synthetic blend choice, just want to be
proactive and make sure my upholstery lasts.

Now I'm shopping for upholstery shops. I'm hearing second hand about $125
per bucket seat locally if I supply the materials. I can do the rear bench
myself and I have no idea what the bed cushions will cost...

Not sure what VW used, maybe a blend, but I think they dry rotted a lot of
the time as I recall.  As a rule Polyester won't rot in the sun and nylon
will.  If you get a upholstery shop to do it ask them to use poly thread not
cotton or nylon as they will rot in the sun in short order.

 I wouldn't mind helping you out but I would be charging about the same,
maybe a bit less for the seats, but then there's that shipping thing :-(
Right now I have way to many irons in the fire. By the way about the moth
thing (destructive little creatures), sounds like you have a handle on it.
cedar chips in a burlap bag or the like could be laid on the seats and then
removed when you need to use the vehicle. Smells good to!  You could buy
bulk at a local feed or pet store.   I use moth balls ( really hard to catch
them and then cutem off! sorry, couldn't resist) where I store my webbing
and other supplies, but I hate that smell reminds me of getting old!
