Subject: Heater Control Box Valves?

Hi, Volks:

I have a '79 Cal Westy.

Trying to get the heat going for a drive Saturday to Bus BRR.

 The Bowden cables are both snapped, so I have wired both heater control box
valves in the forward open position and am replacing both insulated heater
hoses.

Is there a difference in the Cal model '79 bus vents on the back of the
control box?  They look really different from Ratwell's graphic and the ones
i have seen for sale here:

.

Also have pics of the process here:
