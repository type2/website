Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning Hydraulic Lifters?

John, there is quite the treatise on this subject by me actually on
type2.com.  All thy questions should be answered with 3 major options
proffered.  Doing nothing might be fine in general as long as you don't
overadjust the adjusters in doing so.  But like I said, many options
descriped.
 
Under Technical, Library, Engine (General), topic hydraulic lifters and
pushrod seals.
 
Bleed them the way the vanagon manual describes BTW for water cooled, not for
air cooled.  If you decide to that is....

Some have told me to just leave them alone, and realize that they will pump
up on their own, I just wonder if there is value in the time spent actually
cleaning them, or if I should even bother just filling them with oil, ala
Bentley.
