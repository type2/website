Andy, 

If you want to change out the instrument lights to LED's, you have to remember something specific about the light emitted from an LED; its "wave-specific", meaning that if the light is to be transmitted through a colored filter, the light transmission will be more efficent (brighter) if you use the same LED color as the filter. I found this out after changing my instrument lights to LED's, bought very inexpensively on the major internet auction site...

I originally purchased clear/white LEDs, and installed them in the instrument pod, hooked everything back up, and switched on the lights...and was dissapointed....not much difference from before. 

I then read more about LEDs and their properties, and decided to pop out the green bulb filters inside the instrument pod, then reinstalling. This mad an awesome difference, and the lights dim with the headlight switch just fine.

So, in essence, if you want to change to LEDs, either get a bulb that is the same color as the filter (green) or pop out the filter and go clear.

I did a write-up of all my parts, suppliers and pictures of before and after on the Full Moon Bus Club;

I still havent put the CCF bulbs in the engine compartment, but will do that within the next few weeks, along with another set of CCF bulbs behind the curtain valance.
