Sorry about that David,

     I honestly wasn't sure. I've had 20 different collector / project cars 
over the past 8-9 years, and have been on a dozen or so different lists. 
Although I have been on here for a while (I don't plan to ever sell my Bus), 
I did genuinely forget, so I apologize.

I know sometimes lists don't like that, so that's why I put it in there, but 
did forget that it was a rule here. I'm sure I won't forget from now on.


Todd
