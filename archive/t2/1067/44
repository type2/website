Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning Hydraulic Lifters?

John, when I rebuilt my engine, and put new hydraulic lifters in it, I didn't
take them apart but merely dumped them in oil and mashed down on the piston
several times until they got stiff.  I then installed them in the engine with
oil holes facing UP so they wouldn't drain back down.  When I fired the engine
up, they were very quiet and remained very quiet from then on.  greg



Some have told me to just leave them alone, and realize that they will pump
up on their own, I just wonder if there is value in the time spent actually
cleaning them, or if I should even bother just filling them with oil, ala
Bentley.

Sure like to hear from anyone with experience and the time to fill me in on
any details.

Thanks,

John
