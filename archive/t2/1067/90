Subject: re:Camping in Flagstaff

Munds Park is a little town south of Flagstaff that should have a good
campground. Also, take the 89A toward Sedona down in to Oak Creek canyon for
some great camping spots. I'd stay clear of Flagstaff for camping, though -
this time of year the temps still drop pretty low (11F) at night.
