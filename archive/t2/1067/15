Subject: Plaid interior upholstery - solved...

FWIW I have not contacted the local guys or visited them. Maybe this week
sometime. They are a long distance call from work so I can't call them during
the work day.

Have you tried any Upholstery supply places?  If you find a good one you can
get all kinds of fabrics, foam, clips, welting, windlace etc,etc,etc.
Upholstery is my first trade and I still have all my tools and machines.  I do
all mine and some other folks interiors to keep my skills honed.

A good upholstery supply warehouse should have a large selection on hand and
can order almost anything in the way fabrics.
