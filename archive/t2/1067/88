Subject: Mexi motor

Hi All,

I need to replace the motor in my '73 Westy and am pretty sure I would like to
go with a Mexican longblock.  I know a few people have gone this route and
would like a little more info before I make the investment.  Pmail me so I
might ask you a few questions.

Thanks,
Tom
