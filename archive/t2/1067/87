Don, thanks for the link. So much information to read and "digest". Thank
you, so much.

My bus has a westy top (it's a similar modification like Gregs "Bob the
Tomato")
The garage opening is pathetically low and already there, the bus will not
fit.
A Touareg almost hits the gate when it's open...
And it gets worse: going deep inside the garage, there are some large pipes
running on the ceiling, making it lower and lower thowards my parking
place....
I will need to use the garage so my bus has to go lower.
A perfect solution, would be an air suspension: I could make it go really low
inside it and
raise it to a stock height when driving it on the road.... but it's to damm
expensive.
Once again, thanks to you all.

Cheers,
Joao
