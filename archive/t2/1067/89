Subject: Camping in Flagstaff

Hi folks,
next week I'm taking a roadtrip to the Grand Canyon.  actually to do a 
few weeks on a private raft trip.

I'm looking for a mellow spot near Flagstaff to camp  with our group of 
11 for a night prior to our trip.  It will be next week so something 
accessible in winter, and not too-high elevation wise!  primitive 
facilities desired.

TIA.
