That's basically the argument put forth the last time this was decided. 
The problem is more with those who would only use the list to 
promote their auctions.  Separating this group from the casual ebay users 
was not possible, hence the blanket prohibition.

The list tends to be friendly, and friends don't invite their friends to 
join a feeding frenzy.
