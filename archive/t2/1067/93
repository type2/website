Subject: New motor opinions, '73 Westy

I know this is a topic that is talked about alot on this list but after Boston
Bob's passing and learning that Mexi motors are only Type I and I need a Type
IV (thanks George) I do not know where to turn.

I know the reputation of GEX, personally.  I have one currently, in a box, and
this is why I am not looking into rebuilding, last year Boston Bob didn't even
want the core.  Also, finding a reputable builder in my area is not panning
out, Central New York, Syracuse.

With that said, do people have any opinions to share on what companies to go
with for a new (crate) engine?

Thanks,
Tom
