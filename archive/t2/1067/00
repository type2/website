Yeah, actually we do mind, and Todd I think you have been on the list 
long enough to know better.

In case there is any ambiguity in the above statement, read this from 
the charter:

--Do not ever refrence an E-Bay auctions or other auctions (whether 
yours or someone elses) on the list. We filter heavily for this. If we 
want to know what is for sale on eBay we will go there and look.  We 
submitted this subject to the list for a vote and the majority of 
listmembers did NOT want to see E-Bay posts, so that's the way it is.
