Subject: Re: [Q] '69 Bay Window Glass

Have you thought about maybe checking out the local junkyards? I got a good 
used windshield off a VW Bus at the junkyard for something like $15 bucks. 
It was at a U-Pull-It. What was especially good about it (and a bit sad) was 
that the donor Bus in the yard had so much rust below the windshield that I 
effortlessly just pulled it out.

I would check BustedBus.com also... I think his name is Chris? He really 
helped me out when I was piecing some things together for my own Bus. My 
entire interior is all from him. He had an immaculate used dash that I 
bought off him. Really good prices too... can't hurt to check.
