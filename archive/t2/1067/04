Not to knock Dave or anyone obvious who this still applies to but...
 
Yet we've been happy to have commercial posts a couple per day or back in the
day 5-10? or more per day shoved down our throats all along.  I mean I'll bet
there have been days in the last couple months when commercial posts are half
the daily traffic of 2 whopping posts.
 
Obviously I wasn't one of the ones who voted against it.  Fine for several
businesses over the years to use the list to make a living, but a poor guy
with a new kid trying to make a buck selling a set of carbs, that we can't
take...
 
I was there, I knew what "we" were trying to avoid, but maybe what is left of
the list now days should vote again.  Me I was always for absolute, no
postings for sale at all, or all postings for sale, never cared for the little
pick and choose game of who "someone" wanted.

Yeah, actually we do mind, and Todd I think you have been on the list long
enough to know better.
