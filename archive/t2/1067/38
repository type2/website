Subject: Re: [T2] Which draws less, fluorescent or incandescent Westy

The single tube fluorescent lamp draws 8 watts. The festoon bulbs can be had
in wattages ranging from 6 to 30 watts each. Light quality of the
fluorescents is largely dependent on the quality and color temperature of
the bulb (daylight, cool white, etc.).

I know that you specifically requested no info on LEDs, but I just tried
these and they are far brighter than even the 30 watt festoon, and color
temp and light dispersal are great:* *
http://www.superbrightleds.com/specs/festoonhp.htm  I used the 4210-WHP6,
and am more than satisfied. Only draws about 2.3 watts.

"To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of
his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose
fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate
arbitrarily the first principle of association, 'the guarantee to every one
of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.'"
