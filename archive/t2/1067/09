Subject: Plaid interior upholstery - solved...

Hello List!!! 

I have a former Champagne Edition van that I have SLOWLY been tinkering with 
forever. I changed the exterior brown/white scheme to a VW Tornado 
red/antique white scheme and the interior I wanted something besides the 
brown. Don't worry it can all be changed back. 

I did want to keep the plaid though but a different color palate to better 
match the exterior.

I know some of our online Bus parts suppliers offer replacement plaids. Yay! I 
wanted something non-stock though so I had to broaden my search a little. 

A long look at fabric stores around here yielded everything but plaids. I 
guess they aren't that popular. 

We gave it a few seconds of consideration the other day and had a little 
revelation... KILTS! 

Those folks use a HUGE variety of plaid patterns. Hundreds. I got on the web 
last night and found that a top notch kilt costs $800+ and the fabric can run 
$150 per yard. 

And then there are mere mortal people who still want kilts and can not afford 
$800 kilts... Like me... 

Found one thread (no pun - honest) where they were discussing cheap kilt 
fabric and that pointed me to one supplier on the web. 

http://www.periodfabric.com/

http://www.periodfabric.com/Wbt101.htm

That's the one I want - the WBT101. $10 per yard. Out of stock...

Either perhaps I can order what I want or they can point me to another source.

In case you ever wondered just how many there were, start looking here.

Are your eyes hurting yet? VBG!

Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this fabric supplier is 15 mins 
from my house in the neighboring small TN town of Sparta!!! REALLY? What an 
odd shop to find in/near our town! (YAY!) Their website shows 5-7 different 
fabrics. My intention is not to aim you to them but just to say - if you want 
plaids and want cheap-er plaids then read the kilt forums. 

FWIW I have not contacted the local guys or visited them. Maybe this week 
sometime. They are a long distance call from work so I can't call them during 
the work day. 

(I'm semi-Luddite without a cellphone... Sort of a modern Mennoite - I have 
plenty of computers, PDAs and handheld computers but they are all painted 
black... Just kidding.)

Hope this helps someone!
