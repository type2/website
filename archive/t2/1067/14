FWIW I have not contacted the local guys or visited them. Maybe this week
sometime. They are a long distance call from work so I can't call them 
during
the work day.

Have you tried any Upholstery supply places?  If you find a good one you can 
get all kinds of fabrics, foam, clips, welting, windlace etc,etc,etc. 
Upholstery is my first trade and I still have all my tools and machines.  I 
do all mine and some other folks interiors to keep my skills honed.

A good upholstery supply warehouse should have a large selection on hand and 
can order almost anything in the way fabrics.
