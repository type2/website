Subject: Rocker Swap

Is it necessary to swap in hydraulic rockers when switching a motor  
from solid lifters to hydraulic?

i am aware they are different, but a full set of hydraulic rockers can  
be hard to find.
I do have a hydraulic cam, lifters, and correct steel pushrods.

Thanks,

Jon Stiles
