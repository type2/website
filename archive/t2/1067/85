Yeah, when I swapped out my rear drum brakes for the vanagon drum 
brakes, I had to take off the hub as well.  My mechanic gave me his big 
breaker bar (about 2 ft long) with the 3/4 socket and he also gave me 
his floor jack handle which was about 4 ft long.  I *still* had to put 
all of my weight into it to get the thing off.  Plus, you might need to 
have someone put their foot on the brake as the drum brakes might not 
keep the car from rolling forward.

Just make sure when you tighten it that you get it really tight until it 
essentially stops spinning, then tighten a hair more until one of the 
holes lines up so you can insert the cotter pin - do not loosen it to 
fit the pin.  Since you're going through the hassle, get yourself a 
couple new cotter pins from the hardware store.

enjoy :)
