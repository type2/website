Subject: Re: [T2] Plaid interior upholstery - solved...

A thousand years ago (2 years ago) when I last did a big hunt for fabric on 
the web i got alot of trim shop websites and very few if any places that sold 
fabric. Whatever search terms I was using just didn't work. 

This time, today I can find fabric at every turn... wow... 

The web is an interesting place. 

Ever do any mail order upholstery work?
