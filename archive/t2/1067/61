Subject: question regarding 72 and 76 brakes

Hey Everyone,
My friend has a 72 bus with warped rotors up front and I guess that's a 
two-year-only part which is really expensive to replace.  So.... I 
wanted to find out if it's possible to swap over front disk brake parts 
from a 76 onto the 72 because I have an extra set of calipers in the 
garage.  Then he could just purchase new (less expensive) rotors and shoes.

Thoughts?

Mike
