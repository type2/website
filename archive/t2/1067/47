Subject: [ARGGH] '69 Bay Window Glass

Group-

Wow, I'm having some difficulty finding glass for my '69 project.
Actually, it's just the driver's and passenger's windows that are causing
the problem.  Anyone know of a source?  I've sent email to a couple of
parts suppliers, but no luck yet.

O.K., I haven't dug deep into thesamba.com just yet.  I guess I've been
spoiled thinking I could just search on-line and find a few choices.  Back
to digging around...
