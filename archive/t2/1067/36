Subject: Which draws less, fluorescent or incandescent Westy light?

Just wondering the merits of trading out my standard 77 Westy light that goes over the sink. It is an incandescent one with two bulbs. I see fluorescents were put in some of the 77 Westy's that look almost the same, but have a 12volt fluor. single tube. 

1) What about light quality for the two, and
2)  Which draws less electricity??

 I'm not asking about LED's so would prefer to stick to my fairly specific question.
Many thanks in advance,
Courtney
