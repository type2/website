BTW many states are now failing vehicles for safety inspections if the
tinting is more than 3, 4, or 5 inches from the edge.  I think it varies
state to state, but you might want to stop by an inspection station and
see what the posted requirement is.  Happened to a friend here in TX, he
had to scrape off the tint on his Ford Ranger that had been on there for
5 years.

Blame it on Greenpeace, I blame everything on them.  (smile)
