Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy rear brake shoes

My '77 bus doesn't have brake shoe retainers or springs or retaining pins.
I can't remember off the top of my head if my backing plates even have holes
in them for the pins.   The shoes end up getting held in place by the
adjusters, wheel cylinders and brake drum.

I've seen shoes with the parking brake arm riveted on (what I've currently
got) and held on with a pin and "horseshoe clip".  I suspect yours used to
be held on with a pin and horseshoe clip, but someone along the line
broke/lost the clip and put a bolt/nut in instead.
