George is exactly right on this, my '77 came with a reflective strip of fully
opaque tint up there, about 4 inches down.  Fine for the 5'8" guy I got it
from but I had to peel it off to see anything, and the tinted are not much
better.
 
Anyone know the current price of the Safelite (they do/did have clear BTW)?  I
have suggested this for years on the list as it was $99 installed for many
years in the 90's, I got 4-5 of them for various busses.  I hadn't gotten one
since about '98-'99 or so and suggested it to a guy up here in AK who looked
into it and was quoted over $220.  Were they milking him secondary to location
or is it really up to that?  Oddly glass is usually cheaper up here as a
windshield typically lasts about 2 seasons, but that is for common no special
order.
