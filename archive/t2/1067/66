Subject: Re: Can I make my bus go lower by re-seting the spring plates? 

If its just a few inches, and the objective is getting the top of the bus 
to clear the fixed height of the garage door opening, then a temporary 
solution that would be easy to try would be to reduce the tire pressure to 
about 10-15 pounds before attempting to enter the garage, and then raising 
the tire pressure to the required value after exiting. This would take 
about 4 minutes going in either direction, and would be highly 
cost-efficient compared to any permanent mechanical changes to either the 
bus or the garage. ..... simple and immediately available.

I would like to make my bus go lower. Not a radical "lowering" job, just a few
inches to, at least, be able to park it inside a new garage.  (snip)
I've already made it, only for a few hours. I don't want to go lower, because
I don't want to damage my new water tanks.  (snip)
