Subject: '74 Westy wheel hub question

Hi, I need to take my drum and hub off of rear of my Westy, and before I tear
into it....once drum is off, can I use a puller and take wheel hub off of
axle?  I assume rear seal replacement will be needed.  Prolly can repack rear
bearing also?  My Bentley doesn't seem to say I can or can't other than taking
axle right out through the bearing housing, which I don't want to do.  Thanks
Syd
