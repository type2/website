Subject: Day Trip to NSF Dahlgren Virginia

I am taking an early morning drive, round trip, to Naval Support Facility
Dahlgren Virginia.

This is via South on I-95 from Springfield VA, and East on US 301, or East
on US-17 / 218 to the Naval facility.

Anything interesting between I-95 and NSF Dahlgren that might be VW
related?

Perhaps a hidden junk yard...

Thanks
