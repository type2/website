Ok.. cool.  I appreciate all of the info.

My friend had been looking around at local prices and I guess it was a 
bit more expensive than he wanted to pay for.  But it seems like it's 
not *that* bad.  I'll just suggest that he spend the extra $ and pick up 
the 72 rotors instead of us trying to swap everything out.  Seems a bit 
excessive work-wise...

Thanks!
Mike
