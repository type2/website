sean,

as far as i know, we are the only vendor who has ever offered a kit  
for this exhaust swap.

http://www.germansupply.com/xcart/customer/product.php?productid=16683

the issue with this kit is availability, many of the pieces of tin  
are getting harder and harder to find, to the extent that our kit is  
almost never in stock - we have a waiting list for it. some of the  
smaller items we are now reproducing. we have been making the 72-74  
alternator bracket for a few years and we are now also making some of  
the small brackets that hold the exhaust to the engine also.

all late bus heater boxes are the same unless they are german made.  
german made ones are better quality and make better heat. any german  
ones you'll find are old stock, the only thing made now are danish.
