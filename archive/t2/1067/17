Hi Volks,

Just a few more days now until the Canadian bus camping season opens up 
with the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout; coming up this Saturday at 
the Valens Conservation Area just north of Hamilton Ontario.

It's been mild the past week in southern Ontario, so I checked the 
weather forecast tonight... looks like the campground will get a nice 
layer of fresh snow midweek and then the weather will clear up perfectly 
for the weekend's camping.

My last bus camping was back in October, so I am REALLY looking forward 
to getting a start on the 2009 season with this event.

Happy Trails,
