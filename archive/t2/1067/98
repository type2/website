The use of Retaining Pins, Springs and Retainer Discs for the Pins was
discontinued in 1974 at Chassis/VIN 2x4 2057 729 and remained that way thru
the 1979 model year.

The Handbrake Lever is SUPPOSED to have a Pin and "C" Horseshoe Clip.  It is
not unusual to find a bolt and nut that a previous owner or installer may
have installed because of ignorance.

This is what the Pin looks like:

This is what the Clip looks like:
