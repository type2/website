I have a huge heavy sportsmobile from 70 with with a 1600 SP and 
doghouse cooling. Due to engine RPMs, I would also suggest 65 as a top 
crusiing speed.
Gearing changed later with the more powerful t4s to gain the extra room 
for more speed.
With a freeway flyer, you could get a bit more, like 70, but with a 
camper and/or stocker upright, you might loose some low end snot, and 
make gear rowing more common on the hills.
Depends where you live, but 58,60,62mph on the highway should get you 
max life and there the fastest in balance.
