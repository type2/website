Subject: Wiper assembly cross compatibility

I think I asked this before but I've deleted a lot of my local archive
while doing some cleanup.

I have a '74 hardtop and the '73 Riviera. If I head out junkyarding for
spare parts what year wiper assemblies/motors/parts will work on these
buses? 

I like to build up my "spares" stash before something breaks.
