Heya Don!

Just to be safe, I want to have CHT installed before trying these
speeds in hot weather. I must admit to pushing my poor bus to top
speed on one of the hottest days this summer. Didn't seem to mind....

Also decided to run tachs. Between Bug o Rama and Seattle Vintage VW,
got 3 priced from $5 to $15 each.

I know I should keep it down, but the bus is just so happy to run at
65! I try to do 55 and he starts creeping up without telling me! 75
takes just a wee bit of extra effort judging by the engine note.

I suppose that my tranny could be an aftermarket "freeway flier" type,
but I doubt it. Too bad there's no easy way to check without a tach in
the dash.

How come there are no cheap tachs?
