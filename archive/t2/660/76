Subject: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

OK, here are some questions that would help me better understand the 55mph
limit (particularly for my '79 bus):

 

1: What is the recommended redline for bus engine?

2: What is the recommended highest cruising rpm?

3: Why would a FI bus have a lower cruising speed than a carb bus?

4: Would a Porsche 944 tach work on a '79 FI bus?

5: Why is a sustained speed bad for the bug engine?  Is it just high temps?

 

Mind you, I'm not that comfortable driving my bus that fast on the highway
with crosswinds and big 18 wheeler to toss us around. I just would like to
better understand the limits on the engine.

 

TIA
