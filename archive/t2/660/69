Subject: cleaning out my parts stash

hello list:

i've decided to get rid of some of my parts stash. prices are *without*
shipping via USPS. please contact me at jwilson2082_at_nc_dot_rr_dot_com if
interested.

--(1) Wiper Motor, 73-79 part# 211955113, German (don't know if it works but
its in great shape) $25.00

--(2) wiper arms, reconditioned & painted silver, one has some slight
scratching: $20.00

--(2) german hubcaps, 72-79 (one is in excellent shape & the other has a
couple small dents) $5.00

--(1) drivers side rear view mirror, looks to be german & in great shape:
$10.00

--chrome 'beltline trim' set, incomplete: (3) 48' sections, (1) 29' section,
(2) 18' curved sections for rear of bus, (1) 11' section for front door.
some of the pieces have small dents, but they are very useable. also
included is a sliding door track cover with one of the 48' sections still
attached. i'll also throw in 9 of the clips that hold the chrome on - these
are very hard to find in good condition! asking $75.00, but make an offer if
you are interested. i would prefer to ship this particular item via UPS or
other carrier, which i am estimating to cost about $25, depending on
location.

the following items i will send out for FREE, the only requirement being a
donation to type2.com:

--(2) chrome headlight rings, (one has 2 small dents)
--(1) 1976 Beetle owners manual
--(1) 1969 Beetle owners manual (missing cover)
--(2) 1972 411 owners manuals

thanks,
