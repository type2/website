> Bosch or Ford they both do the exact same thing. The point that I am
making is that the 50 wire from the ignition switch is not turning the
starter motor. It is simply pulling the solinoid and holding it.

Okay.  I didn't question this and never intended for the WR1 kit to fix
this.  I was fixing the inherent problem with 27 year old wiring.

the solinoid, not the starter motor.

Which, again, is why I installed the kit.

money on these things.

And the $20.00 WR1 kit is an inexpensive method of eliminating a possible
problem with the starter.

> In fact they do more harm then good, adding more potential wiring
problems, loose connections, shorts, ect.

That depends on who installs it and how well they do it.

not go throught the ignition switch.

Of course it doesn't.  I never questioned this, nor did I say that I was
trying to fix the starter itself by making sure the solinoid was getting
enough power to do its job.
