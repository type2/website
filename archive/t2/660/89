Subject: Progress in VSM

VSM? Very slow motion. Opposite of RFN (right freakin' now).

I sorted through all the counsel and advice from the list back in 
September and decided to wait for inspiration before proceeding 
(actually, I started teaching which sucks the life out of me, but 
that's over now).

Last Saturday, I decided it was time to make sure that my initial 
diagnosis of a bum camshaft was correct, since I made the diagnosis 
under duress. So I unlocked and opened the engine compartment for the 
first time in 34 months. What I saw put me back into slow motion. 
Everything inside there is perfect. Clean, neat, everything in place; 
new, never used oil pressure sender bolted to the fan shroud.

I popped a valve cover gasket and put a wrench on the alternator. The 
distributor rotor turned with the fan, but the valves all stayed put, 
frozen in space, dreaming of high octane gasoline.

It's demoralizing to think that in the very center of all that stuff I 
cleaned, painted, measured, assembled with new locknuts and dabs of 
locktite is a bum part.

That's when I cooked up my latest reason to procrastinate: I decided I 
need a compressor to provide clean compressed air for rebuilding. No 
room in my shop for it though. I need to make room, maybe by building a 
lean-to shed on one outside wall and installing it there. (I know from 
experience that a compressor with less than five horses is a waste of 
money.)

At the rate I'm going, by the time I rebuild this engine, Peregrine 
will be the Last Bus Standing.

I should live so long.
