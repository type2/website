You know it sure would help us to look up the parts if
we had the full info on the bus such as the year, Tell
us like "Well ahhh, I am working on my 1975 westy with
a 1.8L engine". Crossing the numbers is so much easer.
this dist is used from 1976-1980 or so Bosch # 0 231
170 093 with a VW # 022 905 205S, does this come close
to what you have. Phil
