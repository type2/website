You make me realize that I was pretty lucky.

I bought my Bus in running condition with an overhaul-due engine (leaking a
quart of oil every 250 miles, totally loose bottom end, no compression on #3,
etc).  The PO had decided to move on to a Volvo, and he hadn't used his Bus as
a daily driver in about 6 months.  When I replaced the engine with a new one
after about 2,000 miles of driving, I found not only charred mouse bedding and
seed shells, but also the mouse itself, tucked between two cylinders,
thoroughly baked and greased.  I was just amused at the time -- friends
suggested that the old engine ran so poorly just because the mouse was dead
and needed to be replaced, and here I'd gone and bought a whole new engine --
but considering how hot and greasy the old engine ran, it's really a wonder
that nothing caught on fire.

If I ever buy another aircooled VW, I'll be sure to drop the engine
immediately, remove the tin, and check everywhere inside the tin and the far
corners of engine compartment for flammable rodent detritus.  It might be as
important as replacing the fuel lines.
