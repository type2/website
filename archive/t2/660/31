I forgot the part about businesses like Bus Depot and the others having to
sell at the advertised retail price.  They have all of the associated costs
mentioned above, as well as the cost of buying the kit from Bosch.  If
things are normal, Bosch sells the kit to retailers for around $9.96 to
$11.97.  Then the retailer has to make his profit off of the 40-50% he gets,
but AFTER he subtracts all of his costs.  That's over-simplifying it, but
you get the idea.

I'm not surprised that the kit costs $19.95.  And I am grateful that it's
available.  It was virtually a plug-and-play thing.  Easy  to install.
