Hi Joe,

I think everyone understands that. I think the issue here is that
professional mechanics like to see things fixed properly. The WR1
would be considered a patch to mask other problems whether in the
starter or ignition switch, or even intermediate wiring contacts. It's
really an individual decision, and some prefer to go the relay route
rather than the other, whether it be the expense of a starter, or the
difficulty of diagnosing and repairing switch or wiring issues.
