Subject: Solo Windshield Installation

Volks,

Just to let you know that if you have to, it *is* possible to install a
windshield in a bay by yourself.  Here in northern Virginia it is a
beautiful day.  60+ degrees and sunny (a true wonder in December). After
failing to contact a couple of friends, I decided to have a go at this
anyway and did pop out the old busted windshield.  Pur the gasket(used) on
the new (used) windshield, dropped it into place and pulled string a bit
on one side, then a bit on the other, running from one side of the bus to
the other side while pounding the outer face of the glass with my palm to
keep it seated.  The glass did want to slide down and out of the opening
but with a bit of persuasion it did go in!  I had previously installed the
rear hatch glass by myself (put in and seat the glass, then open and prop
up the hatch and pull the string (gravity is your friend here :-)) but
thought this was a 50/50 shot.  I am glad t report it can be done.  I
still think the rear quarter glass is a two-person job, but otherwise
(jalousies and front windows) all the glass can be installed by a single
person.
