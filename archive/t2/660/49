Thanks Karl. I had no idea there were so many issues involved here.
Sure makes me wonder what the heck I have and why it worked. My '72 is
badly bastardized so that I'm not sure what I have. The PO put a Type1
motor in it, and I'm not sure what was done to the transmission to
make that work.

I got a 79 2.0 from the wrecking yard and bolted it up the the tranny
with no knowledge of year compatibility issues. First thing that cost
me is that now two years later I have a shot pilot bearing waiting to
be repaired.

But the starter was binding after the install, so that's when I put in
the AT starter and been running fine since. Like I said above, I'm not
sure why I am even running with so much mismatching of parts.
