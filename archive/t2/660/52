Everything I have read indicates the stock FI is more efficient and
powerful than carburetors. I've heard of some high end lean out on the
stock FI, but I believe that threshold is not reached on stock
engines. Just a little reading I've done at Jake Raby's, Tunacan, and
other linked surfing as I have studied my options, especially as I
have reconsidered my preference for carbs in light of list members'
recommendations of the advantages of FI.

Right, but a weber progressive isn't FI, is it? I was thinking not so
much about what you can squeeze out of a VW engine on any given day,
but rather what sustained speeds over 55 mph in FI buses will do to
your engine long-term (which is, I suspect, to shorten it
considerably).
