My bus is painted L20B Brilliant Orange.  It is often rendered invisible by
a combination of factors I find in other drivers.  (Cell phone use and 4WD
seem to be at the top of the list.)

I've bought a Fiamm air horn, but have not yet fitted it to my bus.  
These are
the OEM 130dB air horns found on Ferrari and Lamborghini.  Harbor Freight
has them on sale from time to time for about $30.  The air pump, tubing, 
twin
fanfare trumpets and electrical relay are included in the kit.

Perhaps a good used rear defogger switch could serve as a "city horn/country
horn" toggle.  A relay to switch the different horn's ground too?  Has 
anyone fit
a country horn to their late model Type2?
