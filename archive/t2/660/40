Subject: rebuilding starter

Good Morning,
Can anyone tell me what the difference between a starter for a late bay 
automatic and a starter for a late bay standard is?  Why aren't they 
interchangeable?  Can a starter from a standard be used to rebuild a starter 
from an automatic if they are from the same years?
Thanks,
Kyle
