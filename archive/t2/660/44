One that I saw was no stub after the drive gear to fit in the bell
housing bushing. I used this to solve a problem I once had with a
binding starter.

In terms of your question, I would deduce that you can use an AT
starter on a manual, but not a manual on a AT. For rebuilding
purposes, some parts would be interchangeable as long as your AT
armature is good. Others may have more technical knowledge on this.

 Can anyone tell me what the difference between a starter for a late bay
 automatic and a starter for a late bay standard is?  Why aren't they
 interchangeable?  Can a starter from a standard be used to rebuild a starter
 from an automatic if they are from the same years?
 Thanks,
