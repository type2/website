Subject: Re: [T2] webber vs. original solex's

 Is the consensus to go back to twin Solex or stay with the Webber?


I believe the general consensus is to go stock unless you have money
to spend on something much better. I know my stock dual Solex's on my
73 are quite fine.

However, there are some pitfalls to the stock carbs.  The setup is
complicated unless you can find an absolutely complete kit with the
air cleaner and idle circuit. Also, they're 30 years old now. You'll
need to get the throttle shaft bushings redone ($40 per carb at Rimco)
if that hasn't already been done.

You may be better served saving for a good pair of dual Dellortos or a
FI kit. I know of at least one person selling a complete FI rig for
$200. After rebuilding and rebushing the stock dual Solex's, and
paying for a complete setup, you'll be out that much anyway if not
more. Granted there's more to FI than just bolting it in, but you get
the idea.

If it runs with the Webber, use it until you can afford something
that's a big improvement. Spend your time and money now getting any
other things taken care of: Steering, suspension, tires, etc.
