Subject: more starter interchangeability questions

For many years I recommended that individuals go to their local starter /
generator / alternator rebuilder for their starters.
On my last go around the guy I've been getting Clark, Hyster, Tow Motor,
Allis Chalmers, VW, Porsche, MG, Triumph generators, starters etc. from
handed me a Mexican rebuilt starter in exchange for mine.
The fellow only survived in business a few more months before he closed down
after over 40 years in business.
His price was 25% higher than NAPA or PepBoys for the same Mexican rebuilt
but I went ahead and bought it because he had always served me will on near
impossible parts to find over the counter or in local inventories.
I'm truly sorry to see him close his business, I also closed a business
because of Mexican competition for my services.
-----------------------------
If anyone can use them I have one """new""" BOSCH (Made in Brazil) starter
for 80-83 Air Cooled Standard Shift bought from Bus Depot. Asking $70.00. I
think the going price was about $119.00 + shipping fees.
If anyone can use one used starter core for an 80-83 Air Cooled Standard
Shift $10.00 + UPS
Both starter have solenoids on them.
