Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

The reason I raised this topic is in reaction to what Joe wrote 
yesterday about the problems that the WR1 tends to mask. Just a bit of 
experience with an oil temp gauge has shown me that my bus is tends to 
be a lot happier at 55 mph than at 65 mph.

Joe and others (Dr. Tim, for instance) do a service on the list when 
they urge us to maintain our buses in spec. But that hardly makes much 
difference if we drive them way out of spec.

I think it's safe to say that VW buses are more specification-sensitive 
than any vehicle on the road.
