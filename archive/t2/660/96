Hi Jamey,

You have a lower top speed because a 71 is the last year of the
earlier Type 1 motor instead of the more powerful and sturdier Type 4
motor that started in 1972. How you provide fuel to the motor is
irrelevant to engine longevity as long as either system is properly
tuned and maintained.
