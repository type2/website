I just wanted to say that I am really glad my 1600cc only goes to 70 if
I am lucky and have to try really hard to get there, which I never do. I
cruise at 60mph and am perfectly content with that. When I went back
home for a break from college and drove my Mom's newer Turbo Beetle to
the airport I hardly ever went past 65. I tend to treat everything like
my bus now :-)
