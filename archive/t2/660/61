They also have a suitable substitute for $1.19, or .82 in quantities of 100.

Seems to me that the relay would prevent arcing and associated wear on the
contacts of the ignition switch. Granted, when new  the switch was rated to
handle the load, but that was 26 years ago in my case. I think I'll properly
install a relay on mine as the restoration progresses. It won't be under the
car, though. These relays are not made well enough to go slushing through
puddles unprotected, not to mention the connectors/sockets.
