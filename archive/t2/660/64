Hi Everyone,

I'm new to the list and need some assistance.  I'm
trying to locate a brake fluid reservoir for my 69
bus.  The cap and grommets I can find, but the
reservoir itself just doesn't seem to exist.  Does
anyone know where I may obtain one or will any other
year work on a 69 bus ?

thx,

rudy
