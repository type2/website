Yes, but that's a system that's in good repair. If you were to pick 10 
engines and inspect them at random, I think you'd find that 9 of them 
are running just a bit lean from hairline cracks in the connection 
between plenum and throttle, the elbow to the air meter, and bad seals 
at the EGR among other things.

More pertinent to the topic, higher RPMs decrease engine life, and the 
buses didn't have a fifth speed.
