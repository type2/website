I believe that in cool weather our busses have no problems maintaining 65mph IF:

Oil quality is carefully maintained. Obviously we will need to change
it more frequently due to the higher oil temps seen when running that
hard.

Bottomend tolerances are tight keeping oil pressure up.

Timing and valves are adjusted properly.

Carbs/FI are in good working order preventing a lean condition which
would raise head temps and cause sunken valves.

(Obviously) Brakes, tires, suspension, etc are all in good shape for
safety and handling.

My bus gets decidedly squirrelly over 65. But that is due to worn
steering parts and soft tires on the front.

(Sniff. Me talking about my bus is breaking my heart because it's
still not running due to electrical issues I can't tackle at the
moment... $$ and a problem with my shoulder are keeping me inside.
Sniff.)
