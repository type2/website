Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

The manual in my carbed 71 Westy says that my top speed --- and cruising
speed --- is 65, but I try to keep it between 60 and 65, erring on the slow
side.
I'll have to plead ignorance about something I've inferred from earlier
postings within this thread: is it worse for FI Busses to travel at 70mph
than for stock carbed Busses?

As for speeding for safety, even on I-95 between NYC and Atlanta I
maintained 65 for hours on end without impeding traffic. Only once did I get
the one fingered salute, and that was a merging situation in DC.
