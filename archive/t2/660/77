Hi Richard,

"Hurt" is  just a matter of perspective... My campsite at John Brown's 
Buses cost about 20% less this year than it did the year before. And 
that wasn't due to a rate reduction at the KOA.

World politics and trade disputes hurt the $CDN quite a bit over the 
past three years. All through that time it semed like anything that 
hurt the US$ took the $CDN with it, but anything that raised the US$ 
left the $CDN in even worse shape. The rise of the past six months is 
just the eventual reversal of these affects. If there is ever a 
settlement of the softwood lumber dispute we're likely to see par.

The bad news is that this means Buses Of The Corn is likely going to 
cost our neighbours to the south a bit more to attend in 2005. The good 
news is that it's still one of the most affordable events on the 
calendar, with camping and registration fees at about $25 for the whole 
weekend. Currency speculators can pre-register today if they are really 
worried about the exchange rate for BOTC. Paypal or money orders will 
be gladly accepted. I won't know the date for absolute certain until I 
see the dates for HCBF and Dixie Bus Gathering, but I'm expecting it to 
be August 6th, 2005.

Happy trails,
