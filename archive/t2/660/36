Chris

Both FLAPS and Radio Shack carry just such a relay.  About $6.00
at RS and perhaps somewhat the same at the flaps.

	Model: 275-226

30amp SPST relay with mounting tab.  You can use regular spade lug 
connectors to wire it in.  Wire the coil side in with your regular horn 
and then run a *healthy* positive wire to the "common" lug.

Then another healthy positive wire from the "NO"(normally open) relay lug 
to your air horns.  A good ground on the other side of the air horn and 
you are in business!

I have dual "stock" horns *and* air horns on another vw that I have
and this is the method I used.

You *will* get some serious noise out of them!

Cheers, dave
