Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilding starter

Kyle asked


 Good Morning,
Can anyone tell me what the difference between a starter for a late bay
automatic and a starter for a late bay standard is?  Why aren't they
interchangeable?  Can a starter from a standard be used to rebuild a starter
from an automatic if they are from the same years?

No, 2 totally different starters. IF you had a upright engine, a 1700 with the 210mm flywheel, or a 1800 with
the 215mm flywheel; then you can use the self-supporting automatic trans starter. BUT if you have the 76-79
2.0 with the 228mm flywheel and 091 trans, you must use the longer pinioned manual trans starter.
Here are pics of the different starters, click on Larger Pic on each one for a closeup:

bug and bus, up to 1800 type 4 manual trans. Look at the end of the starter drive. You will see the teeth of
the pinion end at the end.

this is the auto trans self-supporting starter. It will fit bugs and bays EXCEPT the 2.0 228mm flywheel.  The
drive pinion will extend the same distance as the manual trans starter above.

The drawings here http://www.bus-boys.com/starters.html  show it also.

Finding a pic of the 76-79 has been fun!

this is the 76-79 2.0 228mm starter. Look at the starter drive. See the blank section between the pinion and
the sprag [one-way clutch]. It is there to reach the teeth on the 228mm flywheel.

If you try to use either the 1st or 2nd starter above on the 228, they will just spin in the air!
