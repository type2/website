Subject: more starter interchangeability questions

Is it possible to replace the gear and shaft on the manual starter with the 
gear and shaft from the auto starter and use it on the auto tranny?  Or is 
it possible to replace the insides of the auto tranny starter with the 
insides from the manual tranny starter and use it on the auto tranny?

Also, how about the solenoids, are they interchangeable?

Thanks again,
Kyle
