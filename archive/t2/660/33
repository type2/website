Going back to price sensitivity:

The worst price I've seen is $25. The best price is the BugPack version
which I haven't seen up close:

I've seen BugPack 3516-11 for as little as $9.99 but of course shipping and
handling vary. You can always order it for for $13.30 list price from your
local vw flaps that orders from BugPack regularly (or less at racer's price
if you are k00l).

BTW, their HD window cranks, #6004 are pretty good as well. USA made and
designed similar to the original reinfoced german cranks instead of the
brazil pot metal ones that break in 3 months. I won't make any claims other
that they are the best of the crap out there that look stock:
