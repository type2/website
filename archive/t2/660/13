This is right. And I can imagine Joe's retort, which would be: why 
spend $20 for a patch job when you can replace the starter for $90? And 
Joe would be right, too.

Everyone who drives a 36 to 25-year old vehicle, daily or several times 
a week, must deal with the fact that a vehicle this old (and as abused 
as our buses tend to be) can easily eat $10,000 or more if an owner 
were to do everything that needs to be done, and were to do it right.

Most of us start out knowing that we can't do everything that needs to 
be done on our buses all at once. We engage in "false economies" 
because there isn't any choice in the matter.

But the WR-1 isn't in the same league as putting sawdust into the 
transmission case. It isn't a total bodge job. It serves a purpose.
