POs: is there's anything they won't lie about?

043 means beetle and the Bosch number probably ends in 034. It's from a 74
bettle with M/T:

Not for your timing light but it may confuse you when adjusting the valves.

#1 and #3 are 180 degrees apart on the distributor which means they are 360
degrees apart on the pulley and therefore show the same pulley notch when
the light flashes.

Yes, it won't matter unless #3 is retarded. You can check this easily by
using the timing light on #1 and #3 and seeing if there is any difference in
the reading.

I can't remember when beetle distributors stopped building retard into #3
but my guess is long before the 74 beetle dizzy you have.

The craftsman light seems build to last. Buy on a weekend when when you can
apply a $10 off coupon. Sears is always having sales. Sign up for a Sears
card and get $10 off, etc.

$15 Sunpro CP7676 from eBay. Get this style only:

You'll need all that stuff over time anyway.
