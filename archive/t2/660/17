Hi gang,

I had to remove the distributor in order to get a wrench on the new oil 
pressure adapter hose.  I removed the 13mm nut and washer holding the 
bracket to the case, pulled up, and it's stuck!  Arrrrgh!  I didn't 
want to have to mess with timing just yet (I don't yet have a light, 
dwell meter, etc).  Well, in it this far, I loosened the clamp and 
pulled out the dizzy.  It wouldn't come before because the left end of 
the bracket is tucked under the tin!  I'm hoping I can loosen the tin 
enough to get the clamp out for easier future removals.

Anyway, when I pulled the distributor out I found more strangeness.  
First, the it does not appear to be original, though the PO said it 
was.  It has a single vacuum hose attachment and the following part 
numbers:

VW 043 905 205
Bosch 0 231 170 084 (the 8 might be a 3)

Any ideas?

Secind, I'd been using a crude little notch in the normal place 
(pointing at the fan) to make sure timing was in the neighborhood, and 
that's where #1 wire is.  But, the actual notch is 180 degrees away, by 
#3 plug wire!  I assume the PO got something in backwards with the 
distributor drive.  Does this make any difference in practice?  That 
is, do I still time by aiming the rotor at #1 plug wire position, then 
use the timing scale as usual on the fan housing?  I can't quite think 
this through after a long day peering through the hatch...

Also, with regard to timing lights, is there a useful difference 
between the $30 off-brand and the $50 Craftsman?  How 'bout the 
tach/dwell meters?  Sheesh, this gauge install's getting expensive!  
But, I am looking forward to my first dynamic timing.

thanks,
