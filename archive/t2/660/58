Very true.  But I have to laugh, as the person who inspired this 
transgression.  The only reason that I added a .sig to my post was to make 
sure that my reply was long enough WRT to the quoted material from the 
previous post to make it past the List Server, which continually berates me 
for including too much quoted material :-)

Bus Content:  Wish me luck, tomorrow I head to Maryland, which will 
complete my cross country bus journey.  5 days of driving over 13 months 
:-)  (I brought the bus to Chicago from CA over 3 days last November).
