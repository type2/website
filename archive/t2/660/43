Subject: 55 mph speed limit

Just a reminder to many on the list, and a genuine "heads up" to 
younger listees, that when FI buses were produced for the American 
market, the 55 mph speed limit was the law of the land, and was 
rigorously enforced in most parts of the country (states were 
threatened with loss of DOT funds if they did not enforce the speed 
limit).

I have no doubt that VW engineers provided some marginal performance 
characteristics in their design specifications for higher speeds (for 
passing, etc.). But our buses (74 and later) were not designed for 
sustained highway speeds of 65 mph, much less the 80 mph that is 
standard on California freeways.

They were definitely not designed to keep up with today's overpowered 
vehicles.
