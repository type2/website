Subject: Stuck Lugs on the left rear of a 72

Ok I have soaked em down with every known penetrating oil I can find, I have
taken an electric impact and an air ratchet to them, I have bent 2 tire
Irons, my next course of action seems to be grinding the buggers off or
cutting them off, any other suggestions would be VERY helpful.
