Subject: Re: [T2] PAINTING?????? WELDING?? GAHHH

I very recently painted my bus all outside and some inside. I think that you 
should either do it the right way, which is terribly expensive to get a 
sprayer, a good sander, paint etc etc....and you have to be very careful on 
mixing and doing the hardener and all that....or you can do it the cheap 
way.

I decided there was no way i could afford to do it the right way so i did a 
spray can job and am very satisified.  Mind you, I don't have a show quality 
bus and it will never be a show bus nor would i ever want it to be a show 
bus....but i want to to be rust free and in good mechanical shape.

First I took everything off and out of the bus...used a drill with a cirlce 
wire sander thing and blasted away all rust inside and outside....was some 
holes inside and used fiberglass to patch the holes, nothing was so big that 
I needed to section it.

Primed outside, sanded primer, 2 coats of paint. Maybe a little over a 
hundred dollars in paint, primer, sand paper etc etc, rust is gone and bus 
is one color instead of a tiedye red and primer look.

I think it took about two weeks or so. I would be hesitant about taking it 
to a "professional" because they are not likely to know much about buses and 
not value your bus like you do, also as you are taking everything off you 
will see things that you want to replace or fix.

I don't expect my spray can job to last long but figure I might want it 
another color in a year or two anyways or maybe next time i'll do it the 
right way.
