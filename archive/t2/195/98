Well devil's advocate here...

I checked my bently, from what I see the power brake master cylinder was
found on the disc brake vans...the non power brake mc on drum vans I
concour.  Looks as though internally the MCs are no different.  There is
no special valves, increased size ect to the power-disc brake master
cylinder over the non power unit.

My assumption is the disc brakes need more power to use them over drum
brakes.  And the vacumm servo does that.  then the proportions valve is
there to easy down the power on the rears so they do not lock up.

Strange thing is I have heard of folks upgrading earlier split buses and
even beetles to disc brakes....but with no update to the master
cylinder.
Has anyone out there done this?  Updated to front discs with a stock non
power Master cylinder.

In reality the ealier single circuit MC is no different then the non
power `68-`70 MC with dual curcuits...the dual curcuits is just a safety
factor...nothing to do with added stoping power over the single unit. 
And if folks have used the `68-`70 unit with dsic brakes...why not the
single unit?

thanks
