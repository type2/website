Don,

If it runs fine now, the biggest thing is to keep the fuel filter
changed out and to replace *all* of the fuel lines from the gas tank
all the way around the fuel ring and back into the gas tank.

Once you get past the pump, the pressure on the hose runs from 28 to 37 
psi..

Be sure and get the correct filter and the absolute correct hose from
a reputable VWflaps place.  Be sure and let them know it is FI fuel hose 
you need.

Cheers, dave
