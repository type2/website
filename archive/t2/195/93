Anyone else done anything similar?  It's going in the Award Winning Burrito=

the Roadcow solution is out.  Anyone have luck with side mounted=20
radiators?  I'm not above installing extra scoops (got 3 already) or=20
fabricating brackets and such, but I'd like to hear some BTDT and what=20
works and what doesn't.

Thanks!
