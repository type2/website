Andrew... time to hit the yards....  the early 70's SBs had a manifold
vacuum tap drilled into the left DP manifold casting.  If yours is from a
'73 it *may* have it, my '71 SB did have it.  This is for the throttle
positioner originally, but provides perfectly adequate manifold vacuum for
the vac retard port on the dist as well.

Nothing.  Per Karl, if you don't use the vac retard, time to 7.5 BTDC,
tho.

Take a look at the left end casting.  If you don't have the tap, you will
still see the place it goes cast into the end.  Take it to any decent
machine shop with  a section of properly sized hose and they can drill it
and swage in a port tube in 5 minutes or less, honest!
