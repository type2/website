Don,
At tune up time check or have checked the C0 (carbon monoxide) content per 
the Bentley. Keep it at a safe level. I run 2% to 3%. Lean T4's seem to have 
lots of power and zip but a lean engine has a shorter life and can come to 
an early violent end rather than having a graceful old age.

Also read the spark plugs. Have someone show you what a lean running plug 
looks like. All it takes is one leaking injector seal to ruin your day. A 
single lean cylinder can be masked by other over rich cylinders. Three black 
plugs and one white/brown plug needs sorting out.


T4's with stock L-Jetronic (before 1979 and the introduction of lambda 
control) came from the factory on the edge of lean. Add a few air leaks that 
creep into the system over time and your bus will enter the lean zone.

If you are going to run a L-Jetronic bus make sure who ever does maintenance 
on your bus has educated themselves in this system.  Good 1600 VW mechanics 
are often lost when it comes to the T4 L-Jetronic system. The only one that 
knows what is going on I found in my area is out of my price range. I do it 
myself and hope for the best.

A good reference is Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management By C.O. Probst. 
Bentley is OK but Probst tells all.

Chuck
