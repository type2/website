Subject: carpet/pedestal opinions solicited


Folks, I need to make a decsion about replacing my
pedestal rubber on my 78 bus with replacement or carpet.

I am having trouble visualizing the carpet, but can work thru
that one.

Anyone have opinions pro or con on carpet instead of the rubber pedestal 
covers?  

Gets wet?
Fades too much?
Gets dirty too fast?
Carpet looks better than the rubber?
Anything else?

It's been awhile since I drove a bus daily and can't remember...

Cheers, dave
