Hiya Warren,

Truth be told, your wheels and your speedomenter cable are not physically 
connected at any point.  Your speedo cable is threaded through the left 
spindle.  The cable itself (not the sheath) is locked into the hubcap (as 
opposed to a wheel cover).  As the wheel, which is attached to the brake 
drum, turns so does the hubcap and that causes the speedo cable to rotate.

You can mount most any wheel and the speedo cable will still function, 
although, perhaps, not accurately.
