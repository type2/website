Yup! and over time, they got to be a royal PITA.  The cap nuts disappear,
the cap nuts get replaced wiht plain nuts, the studs come out, the studs
get replaced with bolts, the holes strip, the holes get tapped for stepped
studs (cute little buggers :-) etc.  etc.  Even if you have a plug, you
are *supposed* to pul the plate to inspect for bits of bearing, etc. that
will serve as an early warning that it is time for a rebuild. but once you
have the plug... fuggedaboudit!  My '63 beetle had solid plate, my '71
stupid beetle had a drain plug. Your '74 *should* have had a drain plug...
but after 30 years, anything is possible.

Plates with plugs are all over the place.  *Flat* plates with plugs, like
flat solid plates are rarer, but you can buy them new from (I think)
bugpack.
