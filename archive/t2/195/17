Have spent the weekend removing everything from the 79 Westy including =
the canvas & front windshield (extensive rust on bottom).  One casualty =
was the sink plumbing trying to get that cabinet out.  My question is =
this. Should I get the paint done inside & outside? - even though the =
inside is not too bad and am going to try to match paint (mexican =
beige).  Should I remove the poptop too?  I need battery trays too.  Any =
recommendations on where to buy them?

Read the very informative post by Doyt E. on the preparing the body and =
removing rust.  Will check out the Rust Repair website he posted to see =
if I can do the rust removal myself.

Am having trouble finding a powder coater (for the engine tin) and a =
body/paint shop to take the van for this work.  No one here in SE =
Oklahoma or Fort Smith area will take restore jobs. Just insurance =
work...  Please send along any referrals to have this work done if its =
within 200 miles.=20

Hope I can get everything back in!  Took digital pix all along the way =
to see how it looked prior to my dismantling.
