I painted my bus rattle can style, and it is a good 20/20 (looks ok at
20ft or at 20mph)

one of the nice things about rattle can paint is that if something happens
it is easy to touch up, vandals hit mine about 2 years ago and painted
grafitti on the side panels, only took a couple hours to sand the worst
off and hit it with some paint from the same color batch....can't tell
where it happened

well mine has lasted 8 years and still looks decent..but I did use high
quality automotive rattle cans, about 6-7 dollars a can or so...
