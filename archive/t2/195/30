Subject: Hatch seal, rear hatch inside latch???

Hi Volks,

Tonights "fun with a Westy" involved replacing the rear hatch window seal.

Colleen noticed some rain getting in at BBTF, and  she suggested that I
should prioritize this repair as it was leaking mostly on her side of the
bed. I sourced a replacement seal from John's Bug Shop for $35 (The VWFLAPS
of note), and was able to avoid shipping charges since Dad was there this
week getting a muffler installed on his westy. I had noticed a puddle
amidships this spring that was coming from the rear window but hadn't gotten
around to working on it yet. Rainy season made it a bigger priority,

When I got the window out I was happy to see the sill was only lightly
rusted. I brushed away the rust and debris with my wire wheel on the angle
grinder, and quickly dressed the bare metal with a light coat of red
tremclad spray enamel. Then I spent half an hour with a touch up brush
dotting the minor dings it has accumulated in the past 12 months, and
letting the tremclad dry.

The seal went in fairly easily, esp as I had threaded the groove with a
strong peice of 1/8" nylon rope. I pressed the window into place, and by
carefully pulling the rope from the inside I was able to ease the seal over
the inside lip and press the window home. Dish soap on the seal would have
made it a wee bit easier, but I managed OK without. I wouldn't try it
without soap on a larger seal though.

If you've noticed a puddle amidships, chances are the water came in through
the rear door. But don't be afraid, it's only an hour's work and the seal
isn't at all expensive.

While the curtains are off the door I am considering putting an interior
hatch release and fitting a handle to pull it shut with. If anyone has done
this before please let me know what has worked for you.

Happy trails,
