Just finished removing all of mine(78 bus) for a paint job, and the 
Bentley is *no* real help here.  The trick is that the winder will not 
come out without the vent wing frame being out.

The winder mechanism loops *over* the raised area for the bolt that
holds the bottom part of the vent wing frame.

If you have to take out the vent wing frame you need two people as 
you are 99% guaranteed to bend your outer chrome scraper carrier.

I ended up pulling my glass up thru the frame as I couldn't see how it 
could come out thru the bottom at all.

There may be other methods that work.

Cheers, dave
