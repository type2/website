Subject: A new addition to the family

I read Rodney's post on his acquisition this weekend, and figured I better
share my new.
Actually, I couldn't wait until I got to the puter to tell ya all.
Finished tuning HapyBus and needed to cruise, went looking for a gentleman
that is known for restoring VDubs.  Not home, so I cruise on into town.  I
remember someone telling me about  a guy that used to work on aircooled VW's
and thought I would look for his street.  No luck.  Heading for gasoline,
out of the corner of my eye, I see the street.  Then I see this big
building, and I figure that has to be it.  As I park, I see an old bus in
some yard.  Cool, lets check it out.  A littleman practically runs me over
as I am getting out and yells, "Yes!! It's for Sale"  well now, lets have a
look see.  I spend about a half an hour chatting with the little man, and
realize that they had camped at my family's spot for years.  This is THE Bus
that gave me inspiration for getting a bus in the first place.  The family
is needing cash, so they have to sell. Momma comes home, and we talk some
more and she offers me a beverage or two, and I am really looking this bus
over.  I made some mention of an offer, and decided to crawl underneath.  In
that time daddy comes home, we talk turkey, and shazam, I own another bus.
You talk about bus karma, I was meant to be there.  It is a 66 Westy.  I am
so excited.  My wife is another story, but wow!!!

Here is  a question for you all, it has a 1600 DP, and 12 volt conversion.
When I need engine parts, what to do I request??  I doubt it will be by 1966
specs.  I will probably want to replace the 009 distributor, and I will need
to know how to time it and points etc.

Thanx for reading.
