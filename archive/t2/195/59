I agree EXCEPT get a 3/4 breaker. You may not find a 3/4" socket (i dont
remember is it 19mm?) that size but I use a 3/4 to 1/2" adaptor and a 1/2"
socket. You can jump on a 3/4 breaker and it wont bend. I paid 6$ for mine
at a pawn shop. If you spend real money I concur with the lifetime
guarantee being good.
