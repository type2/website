Guys,

In the late 60's I worked at a "service station"....now, I know that
some of you young "whippersnappers" probably don't know what that is, but 
it was a place you could get an oil change, tuneup, flats fixed and your 
car washed and polished....by hand!...all at the same place...oh, and 
they also sold gas for 25 cents per gallon.  That fill-up at 25 cents per 
gallon also got your windshield washed, your oil checked and your battery 
checked...and if you wanted it, your tires checked....just think about it!

There was an "old" guy that worked there that had a 56 Cadilac...his pride 
and joy...and it looked it too.  One evening when he had a hot date, but 
not enough time to wash his car, he washed just the wheels.

I asked him why just the wheels?  He said if the wheels are clean, it 
makes the car look much better, even if the rest of it is dirty.

Try it next time your favorite ride is dirty....no, not 4x4 in the mud 
dirty, but just dirty....see what you think....

Cheers ,dave
