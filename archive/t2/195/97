Hey y'all
I scored a free diesel jetta.  Low mileage '89, wasted body, good=20
mechanicals.  I've got a bro that has a Kennedy adapter kit to put the=20
rabbit/jetta series engine in a bus, and was interested in some=20
barter.  Sound like a good idea?  I don;t care how fast I get anywhere, =

it's the journey not the destination.

Anyone else done anything similar?  It's going in the Award Winning =
Burrito=20
Express (70 Dormobile) and so with a pop top, cooling is an issue.  =
Guess=20
the Roadcow solution is out.  Anyone have luck with side mounted=20
radiators?  I'm not above installing extra scoops (got 3 already) or=20
fabricating brackets and such, but I'd like to hear some BTDT and what=20
works and what doesn't.

Thanks!
