Subject: forgotten friday and vw content


Just gotta remind everyone who reads comic strips.

The last 4-5 days of the "Zits" comic strips are getting pretty good
as the boys start working on their bus.

Especially last Friday and today.  Last friday was transmission
and today is the "magic" engine.  LOL

Ok, the great list admins in the sky may shoot this one down...but it does 
have bus content!

Happy Monday, dave
