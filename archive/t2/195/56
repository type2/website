Subject: RE: [T2] Hatch seal, rear hatch inside latch??? 

>>While the curtains are off the door

Gosh, do the curtains have to be off the door??  I'll have to check.

>>I am considering putting an interior hatch release and fitting a handle to 
>>pull it shut with.

1)  Pop the panel off.
2)  Put a little patch of masking tape on the panel just about where you 
think the hole should be drilled
3)  Put a little strip of masking tape on the lower part of the door, just 
under where the panel would be if it were still on.
4)  Find the hole on the pull tab of the lever that unlatches the lock when 
pulled from the inside, or pushed from the outside.  It is a mommy; a daddy 
(apparent).
5)  Make a pencil mark on the masking tape that you put on the lower part of 
the door, straight down from where the hole on the pull tab is located.
6)  Place the paneling back on the door, temporarily.  Just hold it there.
7)  Using the pencil mark you just made, put a line on the patch of masking 
tape on the panel to show just where, horizontally, the hole on the pull tab 
would be if you had xray eyes.
8)  Measure the vertical distance from the bottom of the bottom of the door 
to the hole in the pull tab, and transfer that measurement to the line on 
the patch of masking tape you just made, to determine the location for a 
hole to be drilled in the panel.
9)  Measure again (measure twice, cut once) and drill a small hole just 
large enough to pull the head of a 1.5" cotter pin through the hole.


Now the trick is to fit a cotter pin in the pull tab hole so that the ends 
of the cotter pin are just bent enough to catch the hole (about 1/4 inch 
bent on both legs).  I split the cotter pin legs just slightly, and wrap a 
bit of tape around the cotter pin so that it does not slip through the hole 
in the pull tab as you attempt to bend the bottom legs of the cotter pin.

Once the cotter pin is fastened to the hole in the pull tab, feed a string 
through the eye of the cotter pin and then through the hole in the panel, so 
that when the panel is put back on, you can pull the cotter pin out the hole 
that was drilled in the panel.

Next to last, with the panel back on, and the eye of the cotter pin peeking 
through the panel, thread a metal key ring through the cotter pin eye.  This 
will be what you can grasp and pull and it will keep the cotter pin from 
falling back behind the panel!!  (which you will have experienced if you 
took the string off BEFORE you fitted the key ring RING!!

Last, take the string off!!

Also::::

Do you know those white straps that the rear seat passengers can hang on 
to??

Well, I put one on the rear hatch, on the panel, just below the glass.

I drilled through the panel into the metal door, so it is SOLIDLY attached.

When I open the rear hatch from the inside, I hang on to the white strap and 
ease the rear hatch open.  Other wise, the rear hatch slams open really 
hard.

And to close the rear hatch from the inside, I just pull the white strap.
