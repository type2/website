If you look carefully at the exterior in the corresponding place you may 
see where (this is usually unstamped on all but the rarest models) the 
cast aluminum arm attached; this enabled the Catamaran feature where two 
busses could be fastened together. This was not available in the US but 
a few were imported gray-market to Canada. Traveling "Cat" enabled the 
use of the optional wind-sail and snorkel, and made passing beers back 
and forth much easier between busses.

You must have a right-handed "Cat"; for some reason the left-handed ones 
are almost unheard of. I've never seen one personally.
