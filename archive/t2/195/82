Hi Glen,
	Does your bus have a dual relief case?  I have a '70 SP, and I added the 
doghouse shroud and cooler offset(as well as the cooler).  I also added the 
type 3 "cool-tin" that goes under the cylinders.  All three add-ons are 
wrecking-yard items, and are well worth the effort in keeping your engine 
alive and cool.  I lived in Sacramento, where it reached 110 regularly in 
the summer.  My cylinder heads NEVER got hotter than 350, and that includes 
driving to Reno NV loaded with camping gear.  I would highly reccomend these 
changes to older upright Type 2's.

	Eron
