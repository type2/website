Steve,

The original spec was an 8x8 stud, as you have found.  The VW-supplied
repair for pulled studs was the 8x9 stepped stud and I have seen a *lot*
of them.  If you still have an 8mm hole, then I would say "thank you" and
head down to a *good* hardware store and buy an 8x8 stud (way easier to
find than the stepped stud in the real world) and install it.
