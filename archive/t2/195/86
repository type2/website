Subject: Too much of a good thing? High voltage output. 

So here is the situation.

The "alternator" light on the dash is glowing and has been since I bought 
the bus 3 years ago. This weekend I decided to get to the root of the 
problem - on the surface it's easy.

Voltage from blue wire (voltage regulator) - 12.5V
Voltage from black wire (battery) - 15.3V

Difference equals 2.8V and the light glows.

So is it a problem that the alternator puts out 15.3V? This is at idle while 
driving it drops to about 14.9V.

Here is what is found at the voltage regulator at idle...

Blue - 12.3 to 12.6 volts
Green - 4.5 to 5.6 volts
Brown - 60 millivolts

Battery - 15.3 volts

As well the regulator becomes hot the the touch and makes rapid ticking 
noises.

From your(s) experience is this something to be concerned about? Am I at 
risk of wrecking my battery? Does the regulator need replacing? What is 
"normal" voltage output for an alternator - I'm pretty sure this is not the 
original alternator.

Thanks for all and any help
