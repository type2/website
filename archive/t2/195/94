Subject: woodwork advice (westy cabinets)

The birch veneer on my Westy's icebox and storage cabinet lids peeled and I
glued them back over the weekend and I also polished up the hinge because it
was tarnished.

I want to put the lids back on but the screw holes in the plywood are
"stripped".  The threads on the screws weren't too heavy duty but there's
noting to hold the screws in the holes now except sawdust.

For you wood working pros out there, what's the best way to "fix" the holes
so the screws catch?
