I replaced the points and condensor in the stock distributor of my '79 =
bus with a Pertronix Ignitor in 1996. It's still working great. It's =
probably the best $60 I ever spent on the bus. (YMMV)

Compu-Fire also makes a version of its Hall effect points replacement =

vacuum-/centrifugal-advance dizzy. I think it sells for about the same =
as the Pertronix Ignitor (~$60).

It is very nice to be able to skip the points/condensor replacement and =

replace the stock coil with it in a few days. I hope that it provides a =

Hey guys,
I was thinking about replacing my points to an electronic igniter.  Is =
this
a good idea and if so what brand should I get?  I've heard that =
Pertronix
only has a 30 month warranty and that not all people have had that much
success with them.  That leaves me a little weary so is this something I
want to do?  Thanks
TARA
