In your position (sudden loss of power, smoke, oil loss) and it still
ran suggests it's not siezed- me, I'd stop immediately and do this:

First, I'd rotate the engine by hand with distr. cap off, start before #
1 comes up-(7/8 wrench on alternator pully nut turned clockwise- and
listen/feel throuh all four compressions- did it sound/feel clunky
anywhere?  was one "looser" feeling than the others?  Did you hear air
coming out somewhere on compression stroke?   Then I'd do the same with
someone turning it over, no spark, please- yank the coil wire. Do you
hear noises by one valve cover?
   Loss of power is probably loss of compression.  Smoke suggests oil is
getting into the combustion chamber- is the exhaust pipe oily?  Oil can
come from engine past a no longer sealing piston or past broken valve
from the valve cover side.  If you broke a valve, it may be stuck in the
piston, you'll have no compression in that cylinder, and the engine may
still run.   Me, if it passed the passive turning test with no noises,
I'd do a compression test.  Before bothering with a compression test,
pull both valve covers and look- a valve stays shut by action of the
spring pulling its end via the keepers- is there a loose spring and
keepers laying in the valve cover or a loose valve stem- or has it slid
into the cylinder?  If it trashed its guide or slipped out, oil will go
up the guide hole and into the cumbustion chamber causing the "smoke
everywhere".  The valve head is usually stuck in the piston top or
breaks it causing oil to go into the cumbustion chamber.  Usually
anything that trashes the piston (valve hit it) will make it sound like
someone threw  bolts into the engine as the piston parts will be
everwhere and the rod will bang around against the cylinder.  Drop the
oil and look at the oil screen to see if it's still clean inside the
engine.  Head gotta be pulled no matter what.        
     If you got some compression, then a burnt valve, loose seat is more
likely- and it will sound louder as compression air is forced around the
valve.  You'd likely hear the escaping air on the compression stroke
coming out the exhaust.  Head gotta come off.   
   Other scenarios -Do you have an oil pressure gauge?  That will tell
you something if if it's suddenly low, like thrown rod scenario.  If you
saw NO loose valve stem- and oil pressure is low, you may have wobbled a
rod, which will mess up the piston alignment, let oil past the rings and
let compression air into the case-  let someone turn it over with no
spark while you listen- open the oil filler cap- is there esxcessive
blowby?   A wobbled rod can break the piston at the wrist pin, or worse,
send the rod through the case if it breaks- any holes on top, or oil all
over top??   Such scenarios usually sieze up the engine, and if you are
still mobile, can still be a final outcome- only choice if compression
is low or gone is to pull the engine and do a look-see!  I may be there
soon, as the game now is to see what will fail firsat (:
