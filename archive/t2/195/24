thanks all for the info. i am out of the closet with no major
repercussions. at my age, having never driven a bug, one wants to keep that
fact among ...bus pilots. i'll see how the innards look and determine if
this case is rebuildable before i go for sump plate offers. thanks all.
prying this one thus far gave me an opportunity to explain some cumbustion
basics to my five year old daughter. she was curious about the tin, so we
got into it. i held her attention well once we found the dog house thing.
visions of dog houses and five year olds go together.  - steve
