I tried. It's way loose.

The stud was already missing when I pulled the manifold off. This is what
makes me uncertain as to what happened. I don't know if the missing
stud was an 8x8 that stripped out, an 8x9 that stripped out, or an 8x9 that
just came loose. If the first, I can tap it out and use an 8x9. If the third,
I can just install an 8x9. If the second, I guess I get to swap heads.

I'll find out soon.
