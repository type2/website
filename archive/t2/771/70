Look for the original factory part number for the engine, either on the box
or on a tag on the engine.  The number quoted on the Cip1 site is not a
proper VW Brazil number.  Most likely it would be something like
040.100.032.15.

There is no real difference in build quality etc, between the Mexican and
Brazilian engines.  However, the specs are different.  Aside from the single
relief, they have different heads (one less fin) and cylinders (one more
fin), so replacement parts (in this respect) would be difficult.
