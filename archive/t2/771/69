Subject: Engine cuts out during deceleration.

I have a 79 type 2 fuel injected bus. It starts alright and runs ok 
except when I'm cruisin and begin to slow to a stop. I will let off the 
gas and keep it in gear (or sometimes push the clutch in) and it will 
die. I've found if I push the clutch in it sometimes will spring back 
(barely) to life.

Some research I've done points me to an idle cut-off solenoid/valve 
which I am unable to locate in the Bently, if indeed this is the problem.

Help
Thanks,
Andy
