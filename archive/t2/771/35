In an earlier message Don said..."In most modern homes the garage barely
fits a bus"

Garage?  What's that?  All my work takes place outside in my suburban
driveway.  I make sure to do as much as I can during the good weather months
but since our bus is a daily driver maintenance has to go on 12 months a
year.  Nothing like having to drop an engine after shoveling a foot of snow
out of the driveway.  Now there's something I won't soon forget.  So if you
have a garage, even if the bus barely fits, consider yourself lucky!
