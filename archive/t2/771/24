my experience has over the years been that (with a few exceptions) the
closer to stock you keep it the less it will leave you stuck on the side
of the road,  top condition stock seems to provide the best reliability,
as you move away from that you raise the odds that you will be repairing
it on the side of the road, and always doing it yourself because no one
else will know what you did...or how you did it..

just my opinion, you get what you paid for it.

YMMV etc etc
