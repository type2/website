Subject: RE: [T2] Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier hippie 

Heck with waving, I see another bus around here and I chase them down :) Don't
see to many in these parts :) Although I have seen a few more in the past
year. Maybe up to 6 in the area. We have a local shop that has been turning
out a few the past few years.
