Subject: 5 speed gearbox

It was not my intension to make this confusion around
this transplant. The unique thing I tried to find
was to know if it was done any time, or if someone has
knowledge enough to tell me to have sense and try a
reasonable work. The balance between use a 4 speed
regular gearbox for a 1972 T2 and the 5 speed T3
Vanagon, has being analyzed in sense to have only one
engine available, the CU 2.0 Lt type 4 engine.
This engine was a bargain. It has only a few miles in
there, and it was all dismounted to be cleaned up a
wile ago. By 50 U$D, who deny it? It was the money I
paid. My T2 had no engine in when I bought It one year
ago. Now, by chance I have one, almost new, and
questions started: should I use the normal gearbox?
Why not to try a 901 Porsche to fit in? Has the T3 the
same size and design? I noticed that exists some with
5 speeds. 
The usage I want do to my Bay, will be ride, time to
time with my wife. Having some accommodation inside as
a fake camper such as it will be. Go to the beach or
forest always I want or need, and stay. Can be to the
next corner, or far away from home. So, why not to use
a 5 speed later T3 gearbox? The intension is ride
below top rev., achieve low consumptions, and have
more engine to use in more time.
To fit a Berg, another option, the final drive remains
the same as 4th. The Porsches 901 should be a good
option, but it is so long, to use the 5th, that I have
to run out of law, unless Im going to Germany, and
even there, that idea of no speed limit is a myth.

The best compromise, using the a.m. engine, and here
subsist the main reason, I think, instead of a 091
gearbox with a gear ratio of 3.80; 2.06; 1.26 and
0.82, from 1st to 4th, I can have, 4.111: 2.333;
1.476; 1.018 and 0.765 from 1st to 5th with a 094 five
speed gearbox.
It was used in Syncros, but with the code 094-4WD, the
094 was mounted in the Diesel engine Vanagons and in
some 2.0 Lt gasoline (petrol) engine also.

The main case design appears the same, except that
side thing instead of the usual nose lifter. The
modifications I expect are exactly there. 

Everything can be done, I know, but there exist a
compromise. And Im trying to make sense, and ask out
there for some knowledge or expertise on this matter.

I have to thank to all that has being send their
opinions, their fears and even their questions.

The books I read until now, were: the Bentley VW
Vanagon 1980 to 1991, which includes Diesel, Syncros
and Campers, ant the Haynes 082 VW Transporter 1600,
1968 to 1979, all models.

The more I can read, heard or see, the more I can
learn. Manuals, papers, articles and Drawings or bad
experiences to will be more than a satisfaction for
me.

For all you around, my thanks.

Luis
