Subject: Mechanic recommendations, please.

I'm looking for a good VW mechanic for a friend who has a bus older than mine. I think she said it was a 70 or 72... she is looking for someone to do mechanica repairs in the Worcester, MA area. I think she would travel most anywhere in eastern Massachusetts or southern NH. Would you please email recommendations to me at one_likethwind(-at-)yahoo.com?
Thank you.
Anne
