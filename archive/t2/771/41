Subject: FS: Fiberglass Front Top from '78 Westy

For Sale.  $$25   Fiberglass Front Top from '78 Westy

Pickup in Springfield Virginia, 22153  Call 571 235 0795 and leave message 
on the cell phone.

This is a pretty decent top, and it could use a coat of primer/paint.  It 
may be painted when you get to pick it up because I am going to paint my '78 
Westy top and I will use any leftover primer/paint for this top.  If you 
want it in the pictured condition, please come over this weekend....

Originally, I picked up the top for a friend, who doesn't need it now.  22 
July 2005
