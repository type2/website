Maybe, maybe not.  25MPH in second on US101 does seem to be a bit slow
for a 2.0 vanagon.  Even my heavily loaded 1600 bay managed to climb the
passes in 3rd on my last blast on US 395 over much higher terrain, and I
don't use WOT.

It would seem to me that some basic checks of compression and timing
(particularly at driving RPM) are in order.  A non-advancing distributor
might be a cause of these symptoms.

Gee, and here I was feeling sorry for my bus on its last trip!  :)
