Try checking with local car dealerships in your area for used lifts. I just
bought one for $750. It is in good shape and works. It has all the safety
stuff and lifts about 6000 pounds. It is the two post type that you see in
most garages. Not hard to set up and runs of 110v. The Honda dealership around
here was replacing all their lifts over a period of a few years and one of the
employees bought it for a friend and then I bought it from him.

Now if I could just get my garage started so I would have a place to put it.
Got all the materials, just waiting for my block laying class to start in
September. I try to do everything myself, so I am pouring my own footers and
laying several course of block.

I went with a steel truss building with traditional siding and shingles
instead of sheetmetal. This design allowed me to have an open ceiling which
gives me only 10 foot side walls, but much more in the center of the roof.
Allowing the bus to be lift up into the ceiling to get under it. Makes the
garage look a lot smaller from the outside and my neighborhood likes that :)
