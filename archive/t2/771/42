A 1971 westy will populate Hwy 1 from San Francisco to San Diego this
week end. Hope it helps:).

I tend to lift one right finger above the steering wheel when I see a
german bus and the meaning is close to "hi, good to see you drive a
german bus".

On my way up here, a vanagon guy who was parked to check the view
started to dance and shout when he heard the T1 engine pulling up the
a steep section of  Hwy 1. That was nice.
