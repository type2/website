When talking one time with one of our list vendors I mentioned getting
a mexican longblock. He asked if it was mexican or brazilian? Not sure
I went out and found made in mexico on many places on the shipping
container. I am not sure, but I think the case has made in mexico in
the casting, but I'd have to crawl under there to verify.....anyway
this person felt that the mexican made ones were of a higher quality.
