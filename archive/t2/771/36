BTDT, no fun, although prefer that to 95F and 95% humidity, like today
my 78 is a daily driver too.

I have the little pad behind the garage, and it is on a public alley, in
the downtown of a major Eastern city..............garage is full of VW
parts, can't even go to the bathroom without getting a "guard" or putting
everything away and locking the garage door.  Oh can't leave it up on
jacks or anything overnight either,  hazard to the local kids.  power is a
long extension cord, or for bigger stuff like welding or air compressor,
fire up the generator.
