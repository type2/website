Clearance is no issue, but I had never heard
that pits passed out of favor because of risk
rather than competition from modern mechanical
conveniences like hydraulic lifts.  I wanted
something I could drive over so that I could
pull things over it even if they didn't have
an engine (think wagon rather than wagen) or
which don't have automobile dimensions (think
tractor).

I guess I could do a double-ended double-ramp,
but then it's timber rather than dirt that is
holding the weight over my head.  The hillside
platform idea is workable, but harder to do
and a mistake backing onto it harder to undo.

Thanks for all the advice.
