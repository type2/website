They are helpful, but they aren't called a "grease pit" for nothing!
Everything seems to collect there and you have to have a way to get the
stuff (debris, liquids, etc.) out.  You also have to provide positive,
explosion-proof ventilation, as gas fumes will collect in the low spot
when you spill gas in the pit.

What you are essentially creating is two parallelretaining walls about six
feet high.  They have to be able to take the sideways earth loads when a
heavy vehicle is sitting on top.  Not exactly a trivial engineering
problem.

For the cost of making a grease pit, you might be better off installing
one of those screw-drive lifts.  Much more versitile and I'll bet the
final cost won't be much more, provided you have the overhead clearance.
