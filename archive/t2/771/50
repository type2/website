Subject: new cip1 1600 longblock

I just got mine today.
Haven't unpacked it yet, but the first thing I noticed is that it is not Mexican. 
It is from Volkswagen do Brasil Ltda. 
The one time I asked cip1 on the phone I was told it was Mexican. 
The website does not state country of origin. 
I've have since been told that the Brazilian engines are not duel relief, tho the cip1 site says "Dual oil pressure relief engine case"?????

The Mexican engines have a good reputation, I'm wondering about the Brazilian???
Any info appreciated.
Thanks
