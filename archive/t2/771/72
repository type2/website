What they are trying to say may be correct but, that is not how it comes
across.  Dual relief cases preceded the doghouse system by one year, which
in turn preceded the larger oil pump but almost another year.  Dual relief
was intended to keep a more consistent oil pressure on the main bearings.

This information is wrong.  It is not Berg Ent's fault (information came in
after Gene died), just the messenger's.  The AS41 currently used is the
original version, now known as AS41A.
