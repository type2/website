Subject: [T2] 1600 Cases rebuild options

I speak as an owner of the `pancake` style 2.0 Liter
engine.  The Bug and earlier bus engines of the 1600
ilk?... there is a plethora of parts and rebuild
options for that style engine, apparently referred-to
as the `upright.`  But as the owner of the newer style
1.7, 1.8 and 2.0 liter engine, it would appear the
parts availability and technology options are a mere
fractional percentage of what is available for the
mainstream upright market.  Too bad.
   
Am I wrong?  Or am I looking in the wrong places?
    
When I will need to replace the bottom end of my 2.0
liter, I will probably just buy a `Cadillac` Boston
Bob rebuild.  But the web sites I visit for parts try
to whore GEX.  I've heard nothing good about GEX, and
choose to avoid them if only because of the bad press.
    
The `How to Hotrod Volkwagen Engines` book I flipped
through at BugRun `05 VW Swap-meet made no mention of
the pancake engine.  At least that I could find in my
30 second review.  Now I don`t want to Hot Rod my T2. 
I don`t want to install a turbo charger.  I only want
to improve it a little.  I would hope during my future
2.0 rebuild, that I will be able to buy a
counter-weighted crank, slightly improved valve
timing, et cetera so I could squeeze more longevity
and power into my current 101hp `GE` series power
plant.
    
Gee, to have the money and time to raise the 101 HP to
the 150 HP that was bantered about on this T2 list a
month ago.   I hope you don't mind me dreaming
on-line.
