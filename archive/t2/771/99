A little of both. There is far less selection but the few vendors that carry
parts seem well stocked.

Money wasted.

Read this book instead. It's Type agnostic and highly regarded:

ISBN: 0895862255

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0895862255/qid=1122155315/sr=1
-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4564075-6948635?v=glance&s=books

It only covers stock engines but it's a good into to all the parts.
