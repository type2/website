Tim -

Airhead/VWG makes the ring that goes on behind the steering wheel as
it fits the 71-79 Bug, 71-74 Ghia and the Late 74-79 Bus (but not the
Vanagon unfortunately).

Airhead/VWG sell dozens of them each month.

The Contact Strip (you call arm) is part of the Turn Signal Switch
assembly, so you have to use your imagination like John Anderson says.
