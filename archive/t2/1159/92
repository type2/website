Subject: points and condensor

if you put the wrong points and condensor in your dizzy, will it run
great for a little while and then crap out?

i just did a tune up on my bus 74, 1.8, 009 dizzy. it ran great for a
short trip i took last night and about a 8 mi run this afternoon when
it spat and sputtered the last 200 yds home. i had some points and
condensor in my stock and i assumed that they were what i needed but
my first thought is that maybe they are wrong. i checked my timing and
it is set at TDC statically and i cant get it to run to check it at
idle.

one thing i noticed when i got back to the engine, the condensor was
really hot, is this a sign that it is wrong? should it be hot?

any other ideas?

thanks,

matthew
