Subject: Battery Charging

Good morning from a rainy England!

A couple days ago I was charging my 85
Amp-hr leisure (auxiliary) battery with my Zig unit.
(similar to
this http://www.zig-electronics.co.uk/products_cf8.htm)

I had it hooked up
overnight.
Then I left for work came back in the afternoon, hooked up the
charger again.
Then we had dinner.
After dinner I was playing with the kids,
which that day, consisted of me fiddling with the bus while the kids ran
rampant through the yard.

I was checking the oil and investigating why the
leisure battery wasn't charging while the engine was running.
Turns out the
30A in-line fuse for the split-charging relay had blown.

Anyways, while my
head was up the bus's arse I heard what sounded like a fizzing noise.
Sort of
like a bunch of soda pop fizzing around.
It was coming from the leisure
battery.  I found this alarming and switched the Zig unit off.
The fizzing
noise died down.

Curious, I turned it back on and the fizzing noise started
up again.
I got my multimeter and measured roughly 16.9V.  Is that too much?
Am I killing the leisure battery?

Thanks,

Josh
