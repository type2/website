Bus content: the 'upright' centrifugal fan engine
in the Typ 1 ('beetle') was retained when the T2
transporter was designed.  The feeble power was
increased in jumps years apart, thru 1500cc,
1600, 1700, ... and then the T4 engine replaced
it  -  still air-cooled flat-4 and the fan still
centrifugal but much lower.  The T4 engine set a
new standard of sturdy bottom end for engines
then fuel-injected and bigger than ever (2000cc).


	Before olde handes get too annoyed at
reading these simple facts, let me state my
excuse for boring them: some on this list may not
be aware of as much VW history as required for a
fully-rounded fanatic :-P.
	My favourite delayed effect of the
Kubelwagen: it had impressed enough in the Brit
army that when Issigonis was told off to design
the Morris Minor the VW engine was specified and
so he made the nose bulbous to accomodate that
'upright' fan.  The VW engine would then drive
the rear axle by conventional clutch, gearbox &
shaft.  But small-minded Poms got cold feet on
this admission of superior Hun technology, and
reverted to a small dismal pre-war cast-iron
side-valve engine (845cc, was it?) able to cruise
no faster than 55 mi/h and needing a valve-grind
inside 10,000 mi.  Such technological chauvinism
cost many an unnecessary hour of valve-grinding
etc in the residues of the Empah  ...  :-(.  I
like the actual Beetle better than the concept
'Morrie Minor with VW flat-4', but I certainly
like the latter much more than the terrible
reality foisted on us by Poms unable to admit die
Krdute  were ahead of them.
	Another war prize which unfortunately *
was * put into mass prodn was the BSA Bantam
which I call Hitler's Revenge  -  sure, a DKW
design and they were the kings of the stroker,
but I have some evidence that it was a 100-km
throwaway paratrooper vehicle (corresp to Pom
Corgi, which nobody regarded as a sensible road
vehicle).  The boys in Zschvpau must have been
chuckling for years at putting across that
slinter on BSA.
