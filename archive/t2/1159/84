Subject: Fuel hose from Gas tank

Two nights ago I smelled gasoline when I stepped outside my front door.
I discovered that gas was dripping from my 71 Bus.
It appears that the fuel hose from the tank to the metal line at the engine
was leaking where it goes thru the firewall tin.
Fortunately I found the leak without a fire and am thankful.
At 10:15pm I laid under the bus and removed the fuel line and drained out what
was a full tank of gas.
For some reason there is a fuel filter in the line before it comes thru the
fire wall.


So hear are my questions:

1. Is there any reason to have the fuel filter in that location.

It doesn't seem to have anything there to really hold the weight of the line
and filter.
So I was thinking of moving the filter closer to the carb like on my Bugs.

2. Is there just a barbed nipple coming out of the bottom of the gas tank.

It appears that the fuel hose is just pushed up on a nipple.
I wanted to be sure thats what it is before I remove the hose at that point.
It seems to drop down directly above the starter.
I will be changing the line from the tank to the engine.

3. Shouldn't there be clamps used.

There doesn't seem to be any clamps where the braided hose meets the metal
fuel lines.
I get conflicting advice here but would appreciate your thoughts.

I did purchase new clamps with my new fuel hose.
I plan to use them unless it will cause an issue with a barbed fitting.

4. Will there be any surprises changing out what appears to be about 6ft of
hose?

Thanks

Neal
