No, you'd have to add a Coleman lantern pump to get up the fuel rail 
pressure up... Honey - pump faster, the engine is starting to sputter! GRIN!

Seriously if I was a person travelling through VERY rural territory 
(such as crossing South America on the backroads) I'd modify the air 
distributor box (where the throttle body is) to create a mount for a 
carb that I could close off for running on fuel injection, and then open 
up in case the F.I. died and I couldn't fix it. Really the most 
complicated part would be a throttle cable lever that would actuate the 
carb and the F.I. or make it easy to switch the cable end over and be 
the right length.

Hey with the way D.C politics and Wal-Street are going (lack of 
cooperation between the parties, all sorts of questionable deals made) 
and all the doom and gloom in the news, we might NEED to make our 
Westies capable of being the ultimate "bugout" vehicles that last and 
last for decades like the Cuban 50s cars/trucks. Just kidding... Watched 
a movie the other night called: "Yank Tanks". Should appeal to any 
gearhead. Shows how the mechanics there make a car last for 60 years 
without original type spare parts.
