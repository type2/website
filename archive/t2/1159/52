Subject: Re: [T2] Timing and mpg

I recently had the loss of timing problem on my almost new SVDA. Not sure if 
it was slip or a worn rub block, but the point gap was almost zero and 
timing had moved to 0. I reset the timing and got back the power. I then 
realized that there was more than just resetting the timing and found the 
gap problem which I of course fixed and lubed the cam while I was at it. I 
used some teflon grease. I'll see how that works out.
