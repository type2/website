Thanks for the recommendation, but I think I have a lead on a replacement Zig
unit for cheap.

If that falls through, then I'm going for a model by a
Swedish firm called CTEK.
Reviews rate them at or near the top and they are
not too expensive.

One of the
best parts is that it is splash and dust proof (higher-end models are rated
for outdoor use) so you have some flexibility for in-vehicle installation.
 They also provide eyelet terminals so you can leave the unit in place,
connected to your battery.  Just wire it into your mains hookup and you've got
hassle free charging wherever you go!
However, there is no jump start
capability.

They also have a North American range of products.

I'll have to keep them in mind
whenever we make the move back to the US.

Yeah... I think it's time for a new charger ;)  I got a charger
that charges, jumpstarts, equalizes, conditions and even tests your alternator
(somehow) and it was only 70 bux or so.  Works great!

Unfortunately, I don't think that one does 220v :(
