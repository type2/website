Yeah, that's a bit high, even for equalization:

You were boiling the electrolyte - something is wrong with your charger. 
  It should really hold a constant voltage (around 14.4) and then shut 
off when the amp draw drops to a certain amount.  It's different than 
charging nicads/nimh batteries because that type of charger monitors the 
rising voltage and stops when the voltage starts going down.
