May this have something to do with the charger being one from the US and using
it in the UK with simply an adapter and no power converter?

Remember their power is not our typical 120V

Just a thought!

should really hold a constant voltage (around 14.4) and then shut off when the
amp draw drops to a certain amount.  It's different than charging nicads/nimh
batteries because that type of charger monitors the rising voltage and stops
when the voltage starts going down.
