Tim, I'm surprised the horn side is shot, it is a pretty thick ring.  Often
you can simply rebend the contact arm, even when worn completely through, to
contact a bit shorter in an unworn position.  Apply some nice conductive
grease if you can find it.  If really shot, I have a couple early Vanagon
switches about perhaps they are similar in the contact area, if not the entire
switch.

Hi All:
The
brass sliding contacts for my steering wheel are totally worn out and need to
be replaced.  THis is a '79 bus.  I need to source both the brass ring on the
bottom of the steering wheel hub and the contact arm that rubs against it. 
Are these parts available from anywhere new or am I stuck finding something
used?
