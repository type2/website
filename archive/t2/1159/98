Which is an example of the extractor style muffler?  the stock system, 
or the one that has individual, equal-length runners that go to a 
collector (i.e. thunderbird)?  If it's the latter (thunderbird), that 
should actually have lower exhaust temps (according to Jake).  The stock 
system (at least the headers/heat exchangers as on a 78 bus), is known 
to have heat issues.

I don't think this is necessarily the case.  Jake's engines produce more 
power and run cooler.  The reason I mention this is because his camper 
special has a higher-than-stock compression ratio, different cam, heads 
(with larger valves), and uses the 72-74 exhaust.  I know the heads 
alone don't make a difference (because mine still runs hot), so the next 
recommendation is changing out my entire exhaust for the 72-74 setup. 
After that, if it still runs hot, I'll pull it apart and change the cam 
and bump up the compression.

thoughts?
Mike
