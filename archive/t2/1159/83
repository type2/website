Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting problems

I had a similar issue with my 71 and I had the shifter plate adjusted.
Unfortunately after the first person attempted the adjustment it found reverse
when I was looking for second.
The man who did the adjustment that wired is a VW man in his 70's.
He said it is a simple adjustment that you just need patients to complete.

There are instructions in the Bentley Manual I believe.
I think the secret was to stat the adjustment with the shifter in second gear
and then move forward into first.

Sometimes the shifter plate may need to be replaced if it has took much wear
on it.
