Subject: left front mud flap on vanagon 1983

Dear List ,

I am trying to find the genuine original German front mud flap  for my 
vanagon 1983 camper, the one which protect the LP tank 
(http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=251821810) !  Bus depot 
has them all ... except the left front ! or I need to order the 4 of 
them... Do anyone know "a hiding" place to order it.

Also does anyone has some experience good or bad the ones from South 
Africa ( http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=J10883) , they 
are cheaper but you need to drill !

Also what about this one ? , only $18 !
