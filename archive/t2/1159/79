Subject: Re: [T2] Ball Joint.."excentrics"

You know let me elaborate a bit on roughly as well.  In point of fact, since
the ball joint is relatively self aligning even as it wears as long as load is
on it, basically on its own perfectly centered axis, it is a real good idea to
in fact carefully mark the eccentric to the arm before removal (chisel a mark
across both, scribe, cut a mark with dremel wheel, thin paint marker after a
good cleaning, whatever you like.)  This is because in reality you can return
it to damn near exactly how it was before you started.  Use 2 marks on one
side, 3 marks on the other so you don't mix them up, multiple marks providing
a bit of poor mans vernier for improved realigning on reinstallation.   Still
a good idea to have the car aligned of course, which makes it a good idea to
do tie rods, drag link, everything at this time.
