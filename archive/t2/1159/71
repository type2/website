Subject: For Sale:Radio Block off plate

While cleaning my garage over the past couple days I came across some parts.
One of them is a radio block off plate for a Baywindow. My grandfather
couldn't remember what year bus he removed it from to install a radio as he
had a few. Part number on it
211 857 233
Has the texture front and rounded corners to fit the factory hole perfect. It
is dirty and the metal clip has surface rust but it will clean up to be almost
perfect. Its just from sitting on the shelf for all these years. $25.00
shipped in US.
