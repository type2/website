Subject: pop pop pop when downshifting on a steep downhill grade

First off I want to say thanks to all the help getting my bus back on
its feet over the last couple weeks.

My trip out to Table Mountain Star Party went off without a hitch and
the bus was a champ the whole way.
exhaust temps barely exceeded 500 degrees, valve covers stayed well
below 250 despite getting stuck in some stop and go traffic coming
home.

one portion of my route involves a 2400 foot elevation change in about
5 miles (lots of switchbacks)
on the way down, when I was downshifting to preserve my brakes if I
let off the gas I would get a little pop pop pop pop.

when I gave it a little gas it would stop.

my wife who was following also reported little puffs of smoke coming
out of the tail pipe.

a little searching makes it sound like it may be due to an exhaust
leak but I have been unable to locate one as of yet.

1.925 ltr w/ fuel injection from a 2ltr, aftermarket exhaust.  Just
replaced points with hall effect ignition.

I took a video of it:

I don't have a cylinder head temp gauge yet, but I will have one by
the end of the year.
I took temps of the exhaust header, jtubes, and valve covers using an
infrared thermometer.
the engine does not appear to be getting overly warm based on temps I
am reading.

500-525(-at-) the header  300-360(-at-) the Jtubes and 200-240(-at-) the valve covers
(the 240 reading was after I climbed up the steep grade on my way to
my destination.

I thought exhaust leaks would cause the engine to be hotter than it
should be but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

thanks again

-Zach
