Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Charging

Hi Josh,
           Charger tech has dramatically improved since your camper was
built.  I wouldn't bother reinstalling one of the original Zig chargers.   I
call (most of) that period charger tech-"battery boilers". Those CTEK units
would treat your batteries much nicer.  They also offer load/source sharing
units that would keep your house and start batteries in good shape from
multiple sources.  For (infrequent, hopefully) jump start capability it is far
better to wire an outside hard mounted, dedicated, high-current plug direct to
your start battery terminals with good wire, and plug in another running
vehicle for 15 minutes. Or, use the same connection to jump start another rig
now that your batteries are better kept.  See links for some that are fairly
inexpensive, neat, and polarized so it's hard(er) to reverse connect the
cable.  Widely used on tow trucks, emergency service vehicles, etc. for just
that purpose.

Thanks for the recommendation, but I think I have a lead on a replacement Zig
unit for cheap.

If that falls through, then I'm going for a model by a
Swedish firm called CTEK.
