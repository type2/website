Subject: Re.Dual battery setup using Hella single relay kit.

Hi Christophe,
                   I would put this stuff inside the cabinet on the vanagon. 
Mount it where you can see, and get at, it and it wont give you any trouble. 
The vanagon battery is already 10 feet from the business end of the rig so a
couple of feet extra to the house battery wont matter (with good sized
wiring).  Sticking it under the drivers seat is hiding it where it wont get
looked at and it will give you trouble.

Interstate batteries from big box stores seem to have a good rep.  <$90 here
in AK.

I would recommend using a fuse panel from Blue Seas to sort out your house
wiring.  The wiring on the westy leaves much to be desired on that count.

There should be wiring instructions with the kit IIRC or else online.

I actually greatly prefer ACRs instead of the Hella relay kit. No need for a
sense wire, just one from the start switch to switch it out (normally-but can
be over ridden in emergency) during starting. Significant improvement in tech
and can be used to provide a bit of extra boost during starting if you are
down to critical levels and the mongolian death worm is approaching.

I know you have the hella relay kit, however this is a far better kit.  More
reliable, can switch the house battery directly to start battery for extra
start power, real bolt terminals for real size wire, etc.  Very reliable in
marine environment.  Much of the small commercial fishing-boat fleet has
switched to this set up.  Don't have to use a battery combiner switch unless
you need to couple the batteries for high current output.
