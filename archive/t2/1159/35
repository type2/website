Interesting article. I would like it better had they mentioned that
civilian customers didn't get any of those war-year Beetles. They went
to military and VIP use.

Just to keep you properly qualified as a bona fide VW fanatic, I might
mention that the capital letter designations like T2 are used to
designate variants in the Type 2 family:

T1 - Splittie
T2- Bay
T3 - Vanagon, except UK where they are T25
T4/T5 - Eurovan generations. I don't keep up with them, they may be up
to T6 by now.
