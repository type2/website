Subject: Install of "stock" muffler - observations

On the way home from High Country Bus Festival, the old muffler sprung a leak.
It was the second (or third) muffler for the Thunderbird extractor manifold.
The manifold was holding up well.  I could not find another muffler.  Since
Pertronix bought Thunderbird, the availability has gone away.  Could it be
because of the quality?

So I bought a "stock" muffler from Bus Depot..  It's an aftermarket duplicate,
but probably decent enough.  The only problem with mounting was the pre-heater
box on the right.  I worried with that for an hour or more.

Well, it sure does a better job "muffling."  A few other things, however.

I noticed that the cylinder head temperature was 50 degrees higher (400
degrees).
I noticed that the idle was slower.

Is this because of increased back pressure?

When I got back from the maiden voyage (about 40 miles of gentle rolling
hills), I checked the tune.
I had just changed the oil and adjusted the valves.
The timing was spot on.
The dwell was spot on.

I adjusted the idle up about 100 RPM (to 1000). I kinda liked the slow idle -
I could guess the RPM with a stopwatch.

I can't remember the last time I drove a bus (my bus) with a stock muffler.
