Subject: Shifting problems

Hi all,
We have a 77 bus that we've recently gotten running. It's been on the road
for about two months now, and we're gradually taking it farther from home.
At first there was some trouble shifting into first, but after a clutch
adjustment, the problem subsided. Lateley, however, the shifting into first
and second has become a hassle again. When starting the bus initially, it
glides into gear like butter, but it seems like after a little while of
driving / (heat?) there is resistance to get it into first. We have to shift
into second and then straight up into first to get it rolling. Not only
that, but shifting into second also starts to resist.

Does anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening, as well as how it
can be fixed?

Thanks!
