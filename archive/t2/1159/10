Subject: throttle cable guide tube?

I strung a new throttle cable for my 74 transporter yesterday. Used
lots of grease and it threaded in fine. The PO had clipped the old
cable short for Kadrons. I just installed Dell DRLAs.

One question. There seems to be something missing where the cable
passes through the firewall into the engine compartment. The flexible
tube which runs above the tranaxle is about a half inch short of the
firewall.
Is there some kind of guide tube or fitting which runs through the
firewall from the engine compartment and connects to that flexible
tube?

Thanks,
Scott B
