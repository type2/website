Hi Neal,
Hope some of this might help!

1. Is there any reason to have the fuel
 filter in that location."

--- I had two filters on a beetle because of the crud in the tank.  On my
current bus I have one filter, up and under the tank (next to the first fuel
line clip), and none n the engine compartment.  I've only done this because
I've heard it's better for preventing fires and it's were the PO put it.  This
is the first VW I've never had a filter in the engine compartment near the
carb tho.

2.
 Is there just a barbed nipple coming out of the bottom of the gas tank.

--- I don't have a nipple on my 71, but if you do there is nothing complicated
about removing the fuel line.

3. Shouldn't there be 
clamps used.

---Debate goes back and forth on if and when VW used clamps.  I've seen late
60's (67-69) factory photos showing clamps and talked with old VW mechanics
that never used them.  I use them, especially after the fuel pump and on the
carb, heck why not - they're cheap and don't seem to cause issues.  If you do
have a barb, just put the clamp on a little bit behind it.

4. Will there be any surprises 
changing out what appears to be about 6ft of
hose?

-- of course!! Isn't that the nature of our hobby!   (ha ha)   no, seriously
you should not have any issues.
