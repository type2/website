Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting problems

I recommend going over all the components of the shift linkage in 
addition to
Neal's suggestion (before your adjust the plate use a fine 
tipped marker or
awl to mark the plate's original position).  Make sure 
the bushings,
coupling, shifter, and plate are not overly worn.  It is 
easily done and the
parts are not expensive.  If that doesn't help, 
start to think about the
nosecone bushing or selector

Hi all,
We have a 77 bus that we've recently gotten running. It's 
been on the road
for about two months now, and we're gradually taking
 it farther from home.
At first there was some trouble shifting into 
first, but after a clutch
adjustment, the problem subsided. Lateley, 
however, the shifting into first
and second has become a hassle 
again. When starting the bus initially, it
glides into gear like 
butter, but it seems like after a little while of
driving / (heat?) 
there is resistance to get it into first. We have to shift
into 
second and then straight up into first to get it rolling. Not only
that,
 but shifting into second also starts to resist.

Does anyone have
 any ideas as to why this is happening, as well as how it
can be 
fixed?

Thanks!
