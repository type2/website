Hi Chris,

The extractor style mufflers are known for reduced back pressure, so 
that could indeed be a reason for the higher temps and slower idle.

Extractors are also known for making more power, which implies that the 
engine has to work harder to maintain a comparable performance level. 
This too could account for the increase in head temps.

Happy Trails,
