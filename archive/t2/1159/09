Troy.. you captured a lot of the feelings of a campout in those pictures..
I sure hope I can make it next year!

The views from the river look soo relaxing!
It looked like your son had made a friend with the engine in the box.. what
a cutie!

I had visions of wrapping my camper in "watermelon" skin,,  might have fit
in with Zebra, Tiger, USA, and Canada Flag themed buses...

thanks
Jamie
