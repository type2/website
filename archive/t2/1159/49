Did you use the proper lube on both the cam and the wear block?  If you 
did not the wear block will quickly wear down causing the gap to close 
and the timing to be off.  You can buy Bosch lube on line or order the 
GM Delco stuff through a FLAPS, some people just use dielectric grease. 
Sadly Bosch parts aren't what they used to be and I have had Bosch wear 
blocks just break off recently, so I have moved to using Blue Streak 
ventilated points. Time will tell how well they last.  Also make sure 
you lube the other stuff in the distributor as specified by VW.
