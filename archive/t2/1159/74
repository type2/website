Subject: Horn Parts Needed

Hi All:
The brass sliding contacts for my steering wheel are totally worn out  
and need to be replaced.  THis is a '79 bus.  I need to source both  
the brass ring on the bottom of the steering wheel hub and the contact  
arm that rubs against it.  Are these parts available from anywhere new  
or am I stuck finding something used?

Thanks

Tim
