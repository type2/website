Subject: Ball Joint.."excentrics"

Hi, after reading the Bently thoroughly, and being 1/2 way through my removal
of spindles on my '74 Westy, I can 'see' the fact that the 'selflocking' nuts
must come off of balljoints to spindle first, but,the manual sates..then,
loosen the 'excentric', and remove ball joint from spindle,..so..what exactly
is the purpose of the 'excentric"?  Manual does state that 'cut' in it's
surface, has to be facing front at installation..but not much else.  Any
thoughts on this?
Cheers
Syd
