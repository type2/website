Just to clarify:

The charger is part of an electrical distribution unit that
came standard with Viking conversions.
Viking was a UK company and used
UK-supplied electronics in their conversions.

As such mine is rated for 220V.
 However, being 30+ years old, it may not be functioning correctly.

May this have something
to do with the charger being one from the US and using
it in the UK with
simply an adapter and no power converter?

Remember their power is not our
typical 120V

Just a thought!
