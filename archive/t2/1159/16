Hi Zach,
          Thanks for describing the condition precisely. Providing a video, IR
temp data, and "view from behind" is extra good.

"pop pop on down shifting going down a long hill with puffs of smoke".  Sounds
like an air leak into the exhaust, or a rich-at-idle-throttle condition
causing fuel to burn in the exhaust.  You might be giving it a touch of gas
(double clutch shift?) before you shift to make the shift easier and that is
giving it something to burn. If you are down-shifting as engine braking you
are pulling an extra high vacuum that may draw some oil up into the combustion
chamber via several routes.  Once you open the throttle, you increase the
pressure in the exhaust, manifold vacuum drops, and exhaust gas leaks out,
rather than air leaking in, so no oxygen to burn hydrocarbons in the exhaust. 
Main issue (to me) is that exhaust detonations have a way of finding the weak
parts of the exhaust and detaching them from the rest of the vehicle. Try not
to leave valuable type 2 resources along the byways.

My main worry about this situation is over cooling after heating up the engine
to max on a climb.  Easy to rapidly cool parts in high air flow while the rest
remains hot. Slow down/shift down well before you get to the top to keep the
heat build up reasonable, and slowly drive down the hill rather than coasting
and using engine braking. AMHIK

Please keep sending in the IR thermometer reports, eventually we will have
enough to start using them as diagnostics.  IR thermometers are inexpensive
and an under-utilized resource.  I find mine useful for all kinds of data
gathering.  Way more accurate, faster, and better calibrated than a generic
needle auto meter. 

If you are looking for a reasonable $ and calibrated under-the-plug temp gauge
you might look at one of these for $45

You will need to make up a cable (standard K-type thermocouple wire is cheap
from many sources and the plugs into the meter are generic) or purchase a
cable + extension from Dwyer and crimp the end into a ring terminal-available
from electronics stores.  Dakota also sells a suitable cable.

I am probably going to go with the dual version for a little more $;  $79 +
probes  That way I can monitor not only the #3 cylinder but another
temperature, say inlet air temp, or another cylinder, or oil temp, or rocker
cover temp, and see how they interact.  I can even set up a switch box if I
really wanted. This model also stores min-max readings over a set period.

Either of these meters will provide precise, temperature-compensated, data far
superior to a round dial and needle.  The Dakotas are nice too, but blue/teal
light doesn't go with anything I wear.  Dakota do sell an 18 foot long K-type
under-plug thermocouple that will work fine with either Dwyer gauge.

You only really own those things you can carry under both arms at a dead

downhill grade
ssnip>
exhaust temps barely exceeded 500 degrees, valve covers stayed well
below 250 despite getting stuck in some stop and go traffic coming
home.

one portion of my route involves a 2400 foot elevation change in about
5 miles (lots of switchbacks)
on the way down, when I was downshifting to preserve my brakes if I
let off the gas I would get a little pop pop pop pop.

when I gave it a little gas it would stop.

my wife who was following also reported little puffs of smoke coming
out of the tail pipe.

a little searching makes it sound like it may be due to an exhaust
leak but I have been unable to locate one as of yet.

1.925 ltr w/ fuel injection from a 2ltr, aftermarket exhaust.  Just
replaced points with hall effect ignition.

I took a video of it:

I don't have a cylinder head temp gauge yet, but I will have one by
the end of the year.
I took temps of the exhaust header, jtubes, and valve covers using an
infrared thermometer.

my destination.
