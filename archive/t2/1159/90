Hi,
Heres a few photos of some tail light fixtures i finally installed, the old
ones you can see were just crumbling.
On the backsides there is the metal plate that holds all the wires and bulbs,
i re-used the original pieces and they just snap right out, wires and all,
though you have to remove the bulbs first, and they snap right back into the
new plastic housing.
I did this since the new metal parts seemed very poorly constructed, and the
original ones were in well working order.
Joe
