Easy:  T stands for Transporter.  It does not stand for Type.

Type 1 - Bug.
Type 2 - Transporter. Within which T1..T5 denote the generations, 
which the Bug didn't have.  And neither did any other aircooled
Volkswagen model.  Hence the confusion: people had thirteen long
years, 1967 through 1980, to forget that Type 2 and T2 weren't the
same thing.  By the time the T3 arrived, all was lost. :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
