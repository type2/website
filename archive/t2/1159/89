Subject: fuel line change on 79

Hi Folks,
            Just completed a fuel line change on a '79 Federal bus.  Went
smooth, although I greatly prefer the Vanagon size hatch opening.  Used the
#15 ABA Swedish clamps which worked great.  I cant find the message about
changing the under-tank lines without draining the fuel, to give that list
member credit, but that worked well too.  A bit fraught.  No one likes having
fuel dripping down on them while under the vehicle. Fortunately, my cigarette
didn't catch anything alight.   I bet, from the type of clamps used, that
those hoses, and most of the others, were original from the factory.  Way
overdue. I did insist on doing it out on the concrete pad, well away from the
oil-soaked, wooden-floor boat storage building where I normally work on that
bus. Would have really established my rep if that had gone up.  Thanks to the
list for the suggested parts and techniques.  Only real challenge was putting
the rubber hose chafing tube on
 the feed line from the pump back towards the engine where it goes through the
chassis rails.  Tight fit getting it on the new fuel line.  Should have bought
new hose for that, but it was Sunday afternoon and the owner was leaving on
the ferry the next morning.
