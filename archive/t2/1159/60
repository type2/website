Using blue loctite is a good way to go as well, blue is not at all hard to
break with hand tools, will prevent corrosion, and is a good choice where you
might be worried that antiseize will let things creep around a bit , which is
unlikely, I even use it on lug bolts and have for 20 years, but can happen.  I
would use antiseize on the gate bolts, but tend to use loctite on door hinge
bolts.
 
As to getting them out, worst, worst case is you have to carefully
remove the skin over the bolt plate and replace both, on vanagon SC/DC you
often have to repair the area due to rust, and this is needed anyway, bus
trucks seem to fare a bit better even though much older.

Always use
grease or antiseize on the threads when installing fasteners.
Then is is
easier to remove them years later.

Or, if you hate the guy you are sellingthe
truck to, use saltwater.   :)
