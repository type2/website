Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting problems

Recheck your clutch cable adjustment before going after the shifter.Sounds to
me like your cable is about to break.  Though the shifterparts do wear over
time, if it was shifting ok for awhile and then starteddeteriorating.... I
would suspect the clutch cable first.   Larry ............... back at the
