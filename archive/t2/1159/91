Subject: The removal of front suspevsion arms on '74 Westy

Hi, hope you and yours are in good health!  I have arrived at a point in my
'74 Westy front suspension..that I thought..would be 'easy' to do..'replace
spindles',,but alas and alack, has turned into a ..nightmare"..so..now.I am
into 'it', and it seems I have to remove the 'suspension' arms" from the
"torsion" bars, on both left and right ends, to take same, to shop, to have
'new' GERMAN" Ball joints ..imstalled...But..since I am 'unsure'..do the
'arms'..after..I undo the 'capture nuts, suddenly..separate with a "picle
Fork"???, can I expect..that the arms will, 'sparate' from the "spindle"
mounts?  I think in this situation, I shall have to 'remove' both side
'suspension' arms, and then .."pay' the price of .."ignorance"!
Cheers
Syd
