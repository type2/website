I just went through this and went from about 12mpg to just over 20 when
cruising at 65. For me, the screw holding the points adjustment had slipped. I
just tossed in a compufire and have noticed a decrease of about 2 mpg under
the same driving conditions. Not to highjack your thread, but has anyone else
noticed a change that wasn't positive after going with a pertronix or
compufire?
