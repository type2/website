Subject: floppy mirror

Other than adjusting the mirror Just Right and making that
adjustment permanent with JB Weld or somesuch, is there any
way to tighten up the mount so that the mirror doesn't flop
around in the wind?  I mean the arm-to-mirror (ball) connection;
I do not mean the arm-to-body connection.

The permanent option is not so bad -- I'm the only one who
drives my Bus (1978) -- but adjustable would be nice.  It may,
of course, just be better to buy a replacement.
