Hi Zach,

I appreciate your diligence in monitoring temps, but unfortunately
they don't mean anything because that type of measurement has no
baseline reference in the diagnostic community.

Mike sent me this article which explains what kinds of temps you
should be seeing, but the end has this caveat:

"Once again THESE TEMPS ARE ONLY FOR GUYS WITH THE SENDER UNDER THE
SPARK PLUG!!!

If your sender is there, you are not lazy and want the best readings
for accurate monitoring of the engine. If your sensor is not there,
put it there, OR remove the gauge and throw it away, because the
readings you are getting are worthless."

If you look at the article, it says that for a sensor mounted in that
location, engine damage starts at about 420 degrees. So 500 sounds
hot, but I'm not sure how the manifold temps should compare to CHT.
Actually exhaust gas temps (EGT) are more significant since the head
somewhat buffers the temperature, but I would think that the manifold
buffers too, and is further away from the combustion chamber than the
head.

Regarding your puffs of smoke, we need to know the color and when it
puffs. If it does it when you stomp on the gas, it could just be some
normal black smoke from the enrichment. If it is blue smoke during
acceleration, it is rings, if it is during deceleration, it is valve
guides. A puff between gear shifts is probably the same effect, I
would think. If they are black and correspond with your wrap down
noise, it might just be unburned fuel in the exhaust system.
