Subject: Timing and mpg

So noticing that my mpgs were down
And power also down, i got off the lazy rump and did some diagnostics, thus
found my timing was about 3.5 btdc (78 2L with FI svda and points)
Ok so readjusted back to 7.5 and reset idle, power has returned, but so will
my mpg's. ?
Also its been about a year and maybe 1000 miles or less since the last
adjustment. Any comments on why the timing might slip?
Joe
