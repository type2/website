The excentric is used to adjust the camber angle, the in and out lean of 
the tire.  It also affects the caster angle, but that is subordinate to 
the camber angle.  You adjust it by turning it over a 1800 range.  The 
mark on one of the faces should always be somewhat forward of center, 
never rear of center or your caster will be way off and your steering 
will not center.  As John said make a chisel cut on the spindle eye to 
align with the mark on the excentric so you can get it back in the 
original position and thus your alignment should be pretty close.
