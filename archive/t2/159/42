Subject: VW's in Vietnam, etc...

I just came back from 2 weeks in Vietnam with my wife.  I saw about 4
Beetles, late 60's vintage, about 3 white Baywindow buses (mid 70's) being
used as schoolbuses. The best was, we were travelling down a highway in the
Mekong Delta, and passed a nice looking yellow split window van!  What a
surprise!  No rust there, I thought the humidity would rust things, but they
look perfect. I wore my 2001 Buses by the Falls t-shirt around there, got
lots of looks.

Thanks to list advice, I just replaced the two rear flex hoses, along with
the wheel cylinders, on my 70 bus. Thanks to Ron at Bus Depot, for sending
me the right items the first time!! After the flex hoses were off, I cut the
old ones open with bolt cutters, they certainly didn't look very open, I
even had trouble pushing a pointy tool through the middle of them. They
looked great from the outside. It is so wonderful working on a California
bus, the brake lines had no rust at all, came apart like they had been put
on last week!

I installed my stainless steel muffler(from Bus Depot) a couple of weeks
ago, dropped right on  like a dream. Perfect fit!

Has anyone ever figured out how to rivet on a hub cap clip, on a wide five
wheel? Tried yesterday, what a nightmare.
