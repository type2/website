Subject: Re: What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

In one summer trip I drove from Great Falls Montana, 
through Calgary, Banff, Radium Hot Springs and out to 
Seattle.  The trip from Banff to Radium Hot Springs BC 
includes Storm Mountain, not too bad but definitely 2nd 
gear stuff.
We then went down to Washington and hit Hwy 20 out to 
the coast which included Washington Pass.  That req'd a 
couple of cool down breaks.
On the way home we went through Victoria and Vancouver, 
up the Coquihalla Hwy, now there's a mountain pass!
The worst winter trips have to include eastbound I-90 
Snoqualmie Pass in a snow storm.
