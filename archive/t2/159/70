To the List,

I'm  looking for a replacement pop top for my 71 westy.
I pulled the top off my 72 and when put against the green 71 I saw that =
the front of the top was warped by years in the sun.

I was hoping to find a Country Homes or Sportsman top but have not been =
able to find one as I wood like to sleep 4 without doing the cutting for =
the 74 top or newer. I may just sick with the original stile.  but hope =
someone can help.
