Subject: high compression distributor vaccum cans

hah with a strange subject like that you just had to read this right?

doing a tune-up of my 75 solid 2.0L...

I recently replaced the FI temp sensor (but forgot to hook it up so it ran
really poor and rich for a while... now there's an oxymoron). When I tuned
it up this last weekend (reconnecting the temp sensor) I did a compression
check - first one on a newly rebuilt engine. My compression was kinda
strange:
1 144
2 150
3 139
4 141

These are all plenty high, but are they too high? Are the differences
(though high) bad? I've never seen compression numbers like these leading me
to believe that either the engine was put together really tightly (done by
Northwest Connecting Rods, after they accidentally sold me 2.0L pistons and
cylinders for my 1.8L engine - which I built and then ran with terrible
compression and power for a week before tearing it apart and realizing, when
I saw all the untouched silver in the pistons, that I had the right size),
or my compression gauge is off.

Also, I had a shop suggest that I remove the vaccuum hoses from the vaccuum
can on the distributor as it is pretty much shot, plug them up (FI side that
is) and then set the advance to 28 at 2000RPM, which put it about 8 deg ATDC
at idle... I did it and it runs pretty well, though it seems to be flat in
third gear... does this sound ok? Should I look into getting a new
distributor? Should I start another distributor war over which would be the
best for my engine?

Thanks much!
