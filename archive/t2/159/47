Subject: Potential Trailer Hitch Info

I put a used trailer hitch on my van a few years ago that  I got from a 
good friend.

It is a 1 piece hitch that requires no new holes to be added to your van. 
You sandwich the hitch brackets between the body and bumper brackets.

Very good for light duty towing (stamped for up to 1500 lbs. I think).

The label that  I recovered from it when I painted it says:

TRAILER HITCH VW Type 2 Part Number 210

Manufactured by Gibbes Machinery Company, P.O. Box 648, Columbia S.C. 29202

Hope somebody will find this useful. I don't know how current this 
information is (or if   Gibbes still exists)

I did do an Internet search and everything I saw was pointing to 
the  Gibbes Machinery Company as being a relic from the past...
