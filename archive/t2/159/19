Just wanted to voice my frustration about the engine compartment seal.  S=
pent quite a while wrestling with it, and decided to have another go at h=
er tomorrow.  Anybody got an easy way to do this?  Read what was in the a=
rchive, but it is a simple explanation at best.  I have gotten my muffler=
 to seat.  Does not push all the way on, but seems to be ok.  Got the cla=
mps on with no problem, and they are on tight.  BTW, this is on a 71 bus.=
  Such wonderful fun!Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download :=
