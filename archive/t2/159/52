Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy


	Trey,
Just about any VW oriented retailer can sell you one.  Pick up a Vee-Dub 
magazine and browse the ads.  If you need extra juice, Kymco makes a 75 amp 
alt. for uprights.  Anyone out there using a Kymco alternator?  I'd like to 
see how they hold up(reliability).
