That's an easy one.
The right shock is dead ( the bolt holding it in is loose ).
Something near the steering box has too much play (not the swing lever) .
The steering box probably needs adjusted.
Once the steering box ( and steering wheel ) are adjusted,
the remaining play will be equal to both sides.
