Subject: RE: [T2] VW Adventure: My engine fell out! (long)

So I finally got my bus back today and wow does it feel nice.  For a little
over $600 parts and labor I got a new motor mount and bracket, a new muffler
and tail pipes, a new set of oil cooler seals, a new clutch disc (apparently
I was driving around with a rabbit clutch disc instead of a VW bus disc), a
new set of rear brake shoes, a new set of rear wheel cylinders, and 4 new
pushrod tubes!!  And to think that when the engine first fell out, I was
envisioning thousands of dollars just to fix the engine and remount it.
Ahhhhh, life is good.  It looks like I might make it out to Yosemite
sometime soon after all.
