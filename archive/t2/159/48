Subject: Ball Joint Removal (?)

Has anyone tried the ball joint Press from Harbor Freight?  Will it work for
our intended use?
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=38926

Only $25.99 before freight.

Let me know if it will work I will order one.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
