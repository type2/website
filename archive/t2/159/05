UPDATE; I was just informed that the bus also has a new top canvas.  The bus
has been in the owners possession for years and she has spent 1000's trying
to fix it up , but due to personal problems wants to get rid of it quick!!!

ps, she said she wants 1000 dollars, this bus looks awesome

   73 camp mobil, NEW PAINT, orange and beautiful. I will take some pics. No
engine (I might be able to get the one out of it, it's in pieces). She is
looking to get 800 to 1000 out of it!!!!!! The paint alone was over 2300
dollars!!!!
