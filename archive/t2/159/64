Subject: Late Bay passenger bus sale

List:

The folks I bought my 79 deluxe sunroof from for 150$ are selling the bus they stole the engine out of my 79 for. 

The for sale bus is a 76 I believe, has a new paint job white/green original, interior's nice, has factory ac blowers, but the compressor resides with me now, due to the engine swap. Very straight body/bumpers with overiders, missing middle seat, but I have an extra.

If someone on the list bought this bus, we could do right by two busses by putting the right engines/components in the right places.

I know it's a long shot, but I just thought I'd see.

Bus is in Visalia, CA  93291 asking $2200, but she could be talked down.

email me for details.

Billy
