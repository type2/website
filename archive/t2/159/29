Sounds like the roller is hanging up.  Remove the screws holding the cover
on (carefully, you don't want to mess up their mounting) and use a wide
blade putty knife placed under the cover in the crease where the cover is
bent to match the body.  I use my favorite 4 inch taping knife that has a
brass end for hammering and alternate tapping the front and rear of the
cover.

Good luck,
Bill
