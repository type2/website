Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds

Acceptable speeds are a tradeoff.  I don't like to fix things, so I limit
cruising speed to 58-60 in my '71.  I'll push it to 63 for short periods
if I have to for safety.

Climbing hills, I try to keep it in a gear where it is spinning healthily
(not lugging, not screaming) at partial throttle.  I try not to climb at
WOT.

I have no non-stock guages.
