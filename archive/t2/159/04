No.  The air correction jet passes air, not fuel.

No, the numbers correspond to jet size just as with a main jet.

That part is correct, but for the wrong reasons.  Here's the only way I can 
think of to explain it:  The air correction jet is more or less a "leak" in 
your main jet which allows air to displace some of what would otherwise be 
fuel.  It only really comes into play at higher rpms (say, 3500rpm and up 
depending on application) and a larger air correction jet allows more air 
in, which increases the A/F ratio which causes the mixture to lean out.  It 
is to compensate for a tendancy for carbs to run rich on the top end 
otherwise.

If anyone else has a more accurate or clearer description, please jump in.
