Subject: Acceptable speeds

Since there are no gauges (tachometer or temp) in my bus that help me
determine how hard my engine is working, I was wondering if you guys have
any suggestions on roughly how hard is too hard to push my bus.  I'm driving
a 71 Westy that supposedly has a recently rebuilt 1600cc engine in it
(although I wonder about the craftsmanship involved considering my engine
just fell out due to a previously cracked engine mount that finally just
sheared off completely).  Any rough ideas would help, like for instance "on
a straight away, 70 mph is probably an upper bound", or "when climbing a
hill in 2nd gear, I don't usually push it above 25 mph", etc.

I'm probably going to try and install some aftermarket gauges, especially an
oil temperature gauge, but for the time being, I'd like to be able to feel a
little bit more confident that I'm not unknowingly abusing my engine.
