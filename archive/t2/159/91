Subject: Re: [T2] Re: What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

	I think the toughest climb made in my SP 1600 1970 loaded to the roof with 
camping supplies was right outside of Susanville CA, on a stretch of hwy 395 
I believe, headed to Eagle Lake.  Not too sure what the grade was, but it 
had me in 1st gear in some places.  I was pi***ng off the truckers I was 
movin' so slow.  Even at 100 degrees out, she ran like a top, and got us all 
home too.  Anyone else camped out here?  You can see the UFO's plain as day 
it's so clear at night.  :^)
