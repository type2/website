Subject: Re: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?) 

Sorry, I forgot you didn't already know what is was thinking...  I would
follow Bentley.  I wouldn't heat the trailing arm.  I would remove the arm
myself (did a couple weeks ago).  I would try to remove it myself
(unsuccessfully).  I would take it with the new joint to a place that knows
what their doing.

Good luck,
Bill

I'm not sure what you're saying regarding the connection between any of the
above and the safety of your loved ones. Can you expound a bit?
