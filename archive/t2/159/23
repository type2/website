Hi There!

Well, I'm finally getting around to getting this valve job project =
wrapped up.  While the heads were off, I put new rings on the pistons.  =
I checked the archives for info on start up procedures but all I found =
was info on a start up after a total rebuild.  What start up procedure =
should I use to insure good piston ring wear-in?

Thanks in advance,
Erich Elmer
