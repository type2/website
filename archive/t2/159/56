Subject: Re: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?) 

this is one of those jobs that if i had to do over again i would
just shell out the dough to a mechanic & have it done.

whether or not you do it yourself, i would recommend replacing
all 4 while you are at it. the Bus Boys product is excellent & some
others have mentioned it.

& yes, some aspects of this job can be dangerous. be careful.
