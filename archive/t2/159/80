Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit 

Is there a kit that will convert a generator TO an alternator, whereas it
looks like the stock generator, but performs as an alternator?

Both my Busses have alternators, but this would be handy for another car (at
least it is German) that I have.
