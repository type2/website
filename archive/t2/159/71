Subject: Electrical issue?

Having a problem with my oil warning light. Bulb will light when grounded on 
the backside of the instrument panel but inside it's slot the light is dead. 
Battery light works fine, but it seems that oil warning light won't come on 
when it's inside the "island" where it fits in its slot. Any ideas?

Thanks in advance for any help with this.
