Jack up the spindle so the upper arm is off the rubber stop.  Remove the
clip holding the rubber stop on.  Lower the spindle.  Beat on the inside of
the arm and it will be off in under 10 blows (using a 4lb hammer!).  Then it
will slide right off.  Putting back on be sure the seal is properly seated.
Don't mangle as all my research shows they are currently NLA.

Good luck,
Bill

The VW shop's jig lets the control arm sit in those 2 notches while the
press exerts pressure on the ball joint.  So today I will pick up my 2 lower
control arms with new ball joints
