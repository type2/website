Since you're styling this a "rebuild" I assume there's lot's of new parts.
Maybe you could detail these new parts in your next post.  It sounds like
the valve train geometry is fouled up but it's hard to know where to "look"
at this point.

The fact that both valve settings on the 3/4 side are "too tight" suggests
to me the pushrods are, in effect, too long, which really means that
something else is too short.  Was there a compression cut on the head on
that side without compensating shims?  Did you not shim the 3/4 side or use
shorter shims than on the 1/2 side?  Were there spacers under the rocker
pedestals on the 3/4 side that didn't get installed?  There's other things
that can cause the a valve train geometry foul-up, but these are common.
