just a suggestion ...
crank it up and once running try to take only one of the wires  from the battery post like maybe the positive wire and see if it cuts off.

if so it could possibly be the alternator but then again might be the voltage regulator also.

a bad voltage regulator can cause it to act like the alternator not saying it isnt the alternator.

also check around for somebody that does rebulilds on alternators and regulators you can buy new brushes for it and have them installeed cheaper than buying new alternators.

hope this helps.
peace
Cha
