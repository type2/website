Subject: Re: [T2] gas smell.....

Hey-
If there gas in your oil, or does you bus just smell like gas? My Kombi had
a gas smell until I replaced a small piece of rubber fuel hose in the vent
system located in the engine compartment, left side, up under the spare tire
well. I believe it is a vibration link in the steel vent lines, and mine was
cracked through.
Cheers,
Matthew
