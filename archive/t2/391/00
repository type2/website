some years ago I picked up an electric tool called a "power file" really
makes quick work of those tight spaces jobs,  problem is it is a
discontinued Black and Decker tool, even when avaliable it was over $100
and the belts are about a $1 each but I wouldn't trade mine for the world,
especially since I have no air compressor or air tools.   it's gotta run
on a long extension cord or on my generator
