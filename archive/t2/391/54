Subject: still installing 2l

does anyone know in the bentley manual for the wiring diagram it shows the 
heavy black wire leading to one side of the coil, Im guessing that is positive 
and the other side is negative, know I have a heavy brown wire which I found to 
be coming out and hooking to the heater blower fan, does thie get connected 
to the negative side of the coil. thanks
