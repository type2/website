Wow, I didn't know my post was going to generate such traffic! Nothing
like stirring the pot. In addition to the Corvair engine and tranny, my
69 has 71 vacuum assisted brakes. Disks up front and drums in the back.
The Corvair engine seems to generate a decent amount of vacuum,
especially when coming off the throttle at high RPMs. Still though, I'd
love to find out if there are larger boosters , disks, and calipers that
could be modified for the bus. There are disk kits for splittys, but no
upgrade kits that I could find for Bays. If anyone can help me in area,
I'd appreciate it.
