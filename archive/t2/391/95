Subject: gas pedal problems on 72 westy

ok guys, i need your help.  the gas pedal is being quite a pain.  it seems
to not want to return readily and i don't think it is in the tube but
appears to be in the springs maybe or in the pedal linkage itself.  also, i
bought a new throttle cable and it has a small tube on the carb end but the
one in there now has a large end on it.  also, what are the springs
supposed to look like at the carb.  the one small spring goes between the
linkage and the carb and i have another spring between the linkage and the
body.  i'm not sure if the cross bar is the proper one either as when it
has the butterflys open all the way it is hitting the air cleaner housing.
well, i hope at least one of you can make head or tails out of my
description.  thanks!
