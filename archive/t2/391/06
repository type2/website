Subject: A Westy "Utility" question

Hi all:

One of the black plastic covers for the utility connections has a broken
spring.  When I travel down the freeway I can see this cover soar up in the
wind like a wing.  Is there anyway to fix this spring or are we talking
about a whole new utility connection here?

TIA.
