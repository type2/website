I'm not sure that I'd brag about driving a vehicle, that's inherently
unstable at high speeds (cross winds, anyone?), at 80 mph.  Or am I just new
enough to this to not know whereof I speak?  Would it be true to state that
such speeds are possibly beyond the T2's design limits?

Sort of reminds me of those model rockets that we launched with a raw egg as
a payload.  Not all of the eggs survived the ride, or the sudden stop at the
end of the flight...

I always leave approximately one vehicle length for every 10 mph, but only
out of habit.  That's what they were teaching back in my day at high school
driver education.  I try to remember the 3-4 second rule, as it's a better
gauge for safety, but I tend to fall back on old habits.

Hmm... hadn't thought of that one.  Leaves one with rather sober thoughts!
