Subject: fuel hose size (fast and easy) HELP?

I have replaced (overtime) most fuel line 
- 76 bus (2.0L)with 5/16 inch standard fuel line.

It's been a while, but... the piece between pump and
filter is larger, I once used 3/8, but that is too
small.  the hose ruptured (of course!) near the filter
inlet.

what is the correct size (3/8 is too small) for the
exit side of the fuel pump / filter in ???????????

where can I buy it?

3/8 is the largest in all parts stores locally.

thanks!
