I'm not sure where you're at but here in California a Bus tranny is worth at least $50
just as a core. There's a guy that makes a living by running up and down the state to
all the VW FLAPS delivering rebuilt engines and trannys and picking up cores to deliver
to the builders in SoCal. I think that's why its so hard to find a Bus tranny in the
Pick-n-Pulls around here.
