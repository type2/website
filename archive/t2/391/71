Subject: Re: [T2] Pushrods hydraulic lifters with solid rods

ALL typeIV pushrods are hollow. That is how the rocker arms get oil to be lubricated.
The part that confuses people is the definition. Solid lifter pushrods are not solid. They are aluminum tubes
with steel ends. Hydraulic lifter pushrods are one piece steel tubes. When someone says they have 'solid
pushrods', they do NOT mean they have pushrods with no hole in them! They mean they have the thicker aluminum
pushrods.


> I was hoping someone could help me out here. I'm in the midst of a rebuild
 on my 79 Series GE 2.0 and encountered an odd problem. The lifters are
 hydraulic but the rods that I pulled out were the hollow type used for solid
 lifters. The engine ran fine with this setup, but was leaking quite a bit of
 oil, plus I got a tranny issue so I decided to rebuild.

 Anyone have suggestions? Can I rebuild with the hollow pushrods? If not...
anyone got a line on a set of used solid rods that I can use instead?
