I was a model shop machinist, before going back to college to get my
engineering degree, so I've done a little tin bending in my day, and on my
bus

there are of course different levels of equipment for different levels of
need.  most of my power tools are Miwaukee or Bosch,  but if I only nood a
tool once to do a job, a level of quality that gets the job done
accurately without getting something that is overbuilt to do the job
intended

if you don't have the bucks, doing the best you can beats letting the bus
get scrapped

one thing your learn in production and the world of business is that
"better" is the enemy of "good enough" 

you need to have the tools "good enough" to get the job done that you need
to do, if I were making my living fixing VW's rather than my own I would
have S-K (I think their better than Snap On but that is a personal
opinion) but my tool chest contains mostly Craftsman or Powrkraft.

if you are carefull and know how to select tools then you can get some
decent stuff from the harbor freights of the world....I usually suggest to
a begginner buying a Craftsman (or equivalent) "set" of tools and then
upgrade on the tools you use the most,  I have some really good
10,11,13,15,17mm combination wrenches,,  but for 8mm I use the craftsman.

you do the best you can with what you have to work with..  I'm much older
now, when I was much younger and had my first VW I sometimes took the
engine out with a screwdriver and a cresent wrench, but it was a good
cresent wrench.
