Anyway waaay back when--when I worked at the Triumph dealer--the owner
used to be a bodyman--back in the model T and A days.
 For some reason--and I never understood this--the cars were brush
painted with a substance called "Japan"
I don't know if it was lacquer or enamel--but from what he told me a
good paint job took a month. >>

Nitrocellulose lacquer, IIRC...There's still a product around called 
"Japan Drier" for speeding up the drying time of oil based enamels.
And for no particular reason, here's another bit of paint trivia...
Model T's were almost all black because the demand for the car
was so great that the drying time for the paint was causing a
bottleneck in production. The black paint dried the fastest, hence
most T's were black... ;-)
