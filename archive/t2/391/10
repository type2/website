Subject: RE: [T2] noise in rear of engine? 78 westy

It should be ok to run with the alt. belt off. Did you put the spacer on the
fan hub? Check all the tin and exhaust stuff back there. Before you pull the
engine, take off the fan and check inside the fan housing for tools, stray
nuts/bolts, etc. Make sure the four nuts that hold the fan housing to the
case are on good. You should be able to check most of the external stuff
without pulling the engine again.

As for the clutch, I'd try driving the bus around the neighborhood to see if
the squeal works itself out. If not, then see Bentley. Make sure it's
adjusted right. IIRC the pilot shaft (the tranny input shaft) has some
radial play normally.

<SNIP>
Start up is loud and a knocking / rattling noise comes from the rear of the
engine.  Doesn't sound like a rod or a lifter but more erratic and louder.
like something banging around and rattling.  I put the stethoscope on and
couldn't find the noise.  put a pipe to my ear to listen and still can't
tell
exactly but near the fan/ alternator area.
