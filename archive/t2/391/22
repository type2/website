"bad head leak on # 4".
You must consider your lapping technique
didn't include matching the sealing surfaces in 
the same plane, which will still be required,
even with the gaskets.
For longevity, those gaskets will not hold.
They weren't designed to solve this problem.
They have been proven defective by VW in
situations less demanding than this.
Can you guess which one will fail ?

The proper repair would be to make a cut to
match the bores to each other and for both sides.
Did this engine get some replacement cylinders
from another source? Did you check cylinder height?
Was the case deck sealing surface inspected?
Congrats on the in situ R+R. Dark in there, huh :) ?!
