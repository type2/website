I don't remember what the exact specs were, but the Bay Window bus was always
praised for EXCELLENT stopping distances. Part of this is the narrow STOCK
tires with ALOT of weight over them. Wider tires create a larger surface to
slide on and distributes the weight over greater space. The reason you
hydroplane in water is that the contact surface becomes completely smooth.

Dragsters and race cars use smooth, very soft tires so they melt in the
pavement and give added traction - but they don't care about stopping!
