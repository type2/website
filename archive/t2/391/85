Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil

It could be the automatic choke. Happened to me, I was getting gas in my oil
big time. Turns out my auto choke element wasn't working and gas was
bypassing the rings into the bottom end. Needless to say, this is pretty bad
for an engine.

Warm up the engine. Then, being very carefull of the spinning
fanbelt/pulleys, feel the auto choke element. Is it hot? If not, make sure
12 volts of power is being delivered to it from the + side of the coil.
After 3 minutes or so, the choke must be fully open-verify this.
I also agree with your idea about the fuel pump- good idea to replace or
rebuild these things regularly.

btw- change that oil soonest.

<  Ran great for a few days, now more gas in the oil.
I asked him about the Hx of the carb, he was told by PO it had been
rebuilt after being parked.
Would a stuck or leaking float cause gas in the oil?
I've tried the archive and was un successful
