Subject: Re: [T2] 80 MPH Type 2

I wanted to get my word in before the admin stops this thread.

My bus can go fast (for a bus), I've had my bus 75 and it still had some to 
go (on flat of course). That being said, I try to drive my bus at 55, and 
sometimes 60 when i need to merge. I think it's bad karma to drive my bus 
any faster, it works the engine too much and it's just plain dangerous. And 
it's a bus for petes sake, they are supposed to be driven slow, that's the 
only way they are safe.

However, in my Scirocco i speed and accelerate like a bat out of hell. It's 
the closest thing to a sportscar VW ever created. I cruise the interstates 
at 85 plus, that's what it's for.

I have the perfect pair of VWs, i drive my bus when i'm mellow and the 
weathers good and take it camping on occasion, and I have my Scirocco to 
speed accross town to work.
