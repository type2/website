Subject: CHT location change?

Ok, so I have CHT sender and am looking at it and my 3/4 head last 
night.

There is no way that I am putting this thing under the sparkplug.

First, I would have to bend it to get it to fit in the recessed 
	spark plug hole.

Second, every time I change plugs, it would try to hang up on the plug
	or try to come out with the plug...hard to get plug back in 
	properly and then get it torqued without twisting the sender
	wire all around.

So, someone said they had put theirs on a head stud, someone else
said it wouldn't read correctly there.

I'm thinking about drilling a small hole in the fin closest to the #3
spark plug and literally bolting it to a fin.

Any pro's or con's besides it might read a little lower than if it
were under the plug?

Cheers, dave
