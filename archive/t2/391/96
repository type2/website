 or maybe a stuck accelerator pump?

I believe so! I just went thru this w/ a rebuild on some kadrons, and the
motor threw a rod after 700 miles or so. Volks tell me that the oil in the
case from the leaking carb can ruin the lubrication at the bearings in a
heartbeat. This was from a pro? rebuilt longblock & my rebuild on the carbs.
The new accelerator pump stuck & I literally had gas coming out the exhaust.
While tinkering w/ the carbs to get them to run better, changed the oil
after 300 miles, finally figured out the bad pump after pulling the
engine/heads/cylinders, & replacing the rings, & the thing ran great for 30
miles & then thru the #4 conn. rod bearing thru the top of the case.  WTF

Live & learn-its only time & money!

Tom Buese-hope to have new motor built by a real pro for the OCTO run
