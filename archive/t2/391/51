Subject: Rear Shock bolts on 72

Hi Folks,

I still have not got those new load lever shocks in yet.  Took two
evenings to get the old ones off.  I had to let the bolts soak in
loosening oil and heat them.  My only problem now is that my original
top bolt is not long enough for the new load levelers with a spacer as
per Jamie River's web page (Thanks Jamie).  I have tried to find a
longer one around town.  And no one seems to have anything.  I figure I
need a M12 x 1.5 X 115 or 120 adnd the longest I have found is 100's.

Can I use an imperial bolt (if I find one long enough) with a tap?  If
so what size?

Craig

BTW the local VW dealer can order them for 21.95 each!
