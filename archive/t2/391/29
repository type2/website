sometime when no one is around try stopping that beast at 80mph, while you
can make it go faster, getting it to stop is still 4,000lbs and 4 tires on
pavement without antilock etc, especially if you are running stock
tires....I refuse to drive mine faster than 65max and generally leave more
space between me and the vehicle in front, 3-4 second spacing minimum.

and for what it is worth, I won't drive behind a roll off tow truck, that
sharp knife edge of the back end of their truck is at waist level, I just
have nightmares of hitting one and being sliced in half.........  OK some
I'm just a little paranoid
