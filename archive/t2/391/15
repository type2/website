I did two coats of primer, and the bottom half was metalic so that had to
go on a little thicker...probably spent $250 in paint.

didn't do it to save money but it was the only way it could get
painted..divided bus into 9 sections (6 side panels, front, back,
roof) took a day to do each drove it the next day to work...it was all I
had to drive so it couldn't be taken off the road to do it with the good
air gun in the garage...;8*?

you do what you have to do sometimes.   I live in the big city and have no
place to put more than one vehicle.
