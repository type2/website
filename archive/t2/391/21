I love this blue and white paint job.
It reminds me of a camouflage technique they used in W.W.II for battle ships.
They called it "Clutter" if my memory serves.
They painted the ships with bold geometric patterns to break up the outline 
of the ship so from a distance it was difficult to determine the size and 
direction if a ship.
I have considered a "clutter" paint job just for fun but it sounds like more 
work than fun.
I will be following the comments here as I will be attempting a DIY paint job 
my self.
Cheers,
Rusty
