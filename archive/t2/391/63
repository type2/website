Well here is my two cents. But first congratrs on the engine upgrade. 
Upgrading a bus is what I find most challenging and fun about them. As far as going 
fast I look at it like this, how fast you get to a dead stop to the desired 
speed limit (like at a stop light) and stop safely and I emphasise safely is what 
I look for. Accelaration is my addiction. And if you think pushing a bus that 
far is dangerous, your right. But it sure is a heck of a sight to see one go.
