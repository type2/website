Subject: Re: [T2] any interest in 76 f/s in central calfornia?

California is the main place that's kept our beloved VW buses alive all
these years, while our rust belt units rotted out 20 years ago. If the state
makes it impossible for bay window VW's to pass smog, will they eventually
all become extinct? Hopefully the 25 year rolling exemption will help, but
lowering the standards to less than what they emitted when new??
