Subject: Re: [T2] any interest in 76 f/s in central calfornia?

I've seen too many people get California buses home in the rust belt, and
immediately start winter driving them. These buses are no more rust
resistant than they were new, which is hardly at all. Give it a few years,
they'll all rot out. It doesn't matter how much you wash them, they
galvanically corrode from the inside out usually.
 Unless of course, they are winter stored as classic vehicles, like a 69
Mustang or Cuda would be. Not everyone can afford to do this though(some of
us need them for transportation), and year by year our numbers are reducing.
California's dry environment has preserved a pool of relatively rust free
vehicles for us to buy from, but if they make it impossible to register them
there, this cycle will eventually falter. As Karl said, they are now
requiring classic vehicles to pass stricter standards than they did when
new.
