About another 100 years and I'll have my conversion done too. Everything is

I'll be adding 15" tires, swaybars, and eventually brakes. My goal isn't

Congrats Steven. I envy your bus!!!!

I had my bus up to 80-85 mph for about 50 miles one time (winter), empty 
(relatively) highways, daytime. VERY noisy and very thirsty. No harm done. 
We really needed hearing protection! <grin>
