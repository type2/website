 I have two more...
 On the brake subject.  My daily driver, a '70 Transporter has drums all
around, stock. I run a stock ....(not for my year ,I know)..1600 dual port,
carb and oil bath cleaner... I cruise at 55-60 and hit 65-68 on the down
hill during my 14 mile commute. The braking is pretty good, as good as it
will get for stock. But I have had a few arm stiffening braking maneuvers!
 My other type2 is a 1971 Westfalia. Same stock motor, with the disc brakes
up front. What a difference in the braking power on the same commute.
 Now for my question, I just removed a complete front beam and brake
assembly off a 1972 VW Camper. I took everything for the disc's. I am
seriously considering swapping it into the Transporter. I am aware of the
tire rim changes and such. But is it worth all the effort? If its not broke,
don't fix it? I could save all this stuff for the '71 as spares, but I have
a wife..........
