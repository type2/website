Subject: Pre 88 Porsche Cookie cutters on 72 Bay

Hi Folks,

I know, I know this has been done to death.  I don't want to start any
crazy thread here so personal responses to my email would suffice.  I
have got a chance for a set of pre 88 porsche cookie cutters for my 72
westy.  Anybody else out there done this.  I read all the horror stories
re adapters etc.  and even saw something that said that the adapters
will not work with the cookie cutters is that true?

And if I decide to redrill rotors and drums how much am I talking to do
this?

Craig
