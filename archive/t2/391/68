Subject: Fule tank Felt stuff

Hi

I am now replacing the fule tank on Polly.  I have the POR kit etc,. I have
repainted the outside, and I have to remove the felt padding stuff, from
under the straps, which is now more or less destroyed, does anyone know what
it is or what I can replace it with.  My tank also has 2 bit of rubber stuck
to it which turned out to be ofcuts from the drivers seat!

Thanks
