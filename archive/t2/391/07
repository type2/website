Subject: DIY Paint

HI All-

Without opening the can of worms as to whether-or-not a DIY paintjob is
"right" or not to do, what suggestions do those of you that have done this
have to offer?

-What kind of paint did you use?
-Roller or Rattle Can?
-How much paint was required?
-Did you prime first?
-What about the poptop? Same stuff/technique?

Cheers,
Matthew
