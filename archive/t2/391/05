Subject: 2.ol rebuild

While rebuilding our 2.0l engine I got it together to the point of doing the 
valve adjustment, we put a 1 step up cam from eagle in it just in case this 
has something to do with it. so set the #1 valves then turned the engine over 
180 and went to set the #4 valves, and the rocker is within .006 inch from the 
valve bearly enough room to get the fealer gauge in there. the #1 side and 2 
were fine enough room to set the valves nicely, but the 3 and 4 side is 
extremely close, what does anyone think of this. All went well with building up to 
this point. thanks
