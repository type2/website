There was a fellow that had modified vented rotors up front and
solid discs out back on a Vanagon. In my dreams!!!!

A few years(maybe more than a few) ago there was a vendor advertising in Hot 
VW's Magazine that offered a Wide-5 disc brake kit for bays that had vented 
911 rotors and four-piston calipers.  They were about a grand too.  I 
haven't seen 'em advertised since.  ANybody else know what I'm talking 
about?  Anybody order from them?
