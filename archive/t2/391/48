Subject: any interest in 76 f/s in central calfornia?

might sell the bus to get something older

basic hardtop camper w/ fair interior missing some stuff.

engine great, 79 california factory elec. ignition, hydraulic valves, 10,000 on new head rebuild.

one key start everytime.

minor rusty spots, one bad spot under wing window.

lots of spare parts, have another whole f.i. engine core and wiring, lots of exhaust & camper tidbits.

just putting out feelers,

the price would be more than fair, I got a good deal on this bus and I will pass it on.

would help with delivery possibly make a last road trip out of it.

this bus is a "drive it anywhere" all new brakes and fuel lines. Just a pain in calforinia with the smog laws, the ONLY reason I'm parting with it...

maybe.

Pmail please,

Billy
