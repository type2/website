Subject: Re: [T2] DIY Paint

Ok--Now hold on to your shorts----
I am not going to bum rap any bodies idea of a paint job here---
I do understand the economics of refinishing anything--I've been doing
it  long time--

Here is a new concept--and I'm sure I remember someone bringing this up
a while back---maybe it was Tony--

Anyway waaay back when--when I worked at the Triumph dealer--the owner
used to be a bodyman--back in the model T and A days.
 For some reason--and I never understood this--the cars were brush
painted with a substance called "Japan"
I don't know if it was lacquer or enamel--but from what he told me a
good paint job took a month.

All the usual repair work was done, prepped, and painted--with a brush.
Let it sit until dry--and wet sand--apply more paint--let dry--wet
sand--apply more paint--
I think from what I remember this process took 4 coats, and
sandings--and then rubbed out to a deep, durable, finish ( as durable as
the paints were back then )

So in retrospect--if you brush and roller guys apply enough paint--and
wet sand and buff--you could possibly get a decent overall finish---

But the problem here is the UV will eat the heck out of the non
polyisocianated paint skin--the finish will be short lived--unless of
course the vehicle in question is under cover most of the time.

Another note about driving with the primer on the vehicle.
Yes--the talic and clay in most of the lacquer primer's will attract
copious amounts of moisture--which is a bad deal for the metal
underneath--

However--there is a relatively new primer / sealer out there--by Dupont.
It's called Euro Prime.
It is a 3 part urethane primer--in grey--that is actually a rubber based
sealer / primer-- that sands as easy as the  standard lacquer based
filler / primer, and will not attract one iota of moisture--is excellent
on steel, as well as fiberglass.
It will not check--seals whatever surface you might have under it
excellent--with no bleed through---
And is a superior base for whatever final finish you might come up
with--

This just popped up in my walking rolladex of info--and I thought I'd
pass it along to the DIY guys---:>)


Later,
