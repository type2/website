Subject: Gas in oil

A buddy of mine bought an unknown single port, the numbers match a VW
dealer replacement motor and we're trying to trouble shoot it bit by
bit.  
It had sat in a barn for a "few" years,(same old story)
He tried to start it before contacting me.  Complained of gas in the
oil, my first thought was bad fuel pump so I had him replace that, WTH
it's cheap.
Ran great for a few days, now more gas in the oil.
I asked him about the Hx of the carb, he was told by PO it had been
rebuilt after being parked.
Would a stuck or leaking float cause gas in the oil?
I've tried the archive and was un successful
Thanks
