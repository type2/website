The manual says the top speed is 75 mph but you can go faster. Check your
tires to see how fast "they" are designed to go. If the bus was designed to
go much faster it would have a taller fourth gear or perhaps a fifth from
the factory. The engine is loud at 75mph for a reason and you need lots of
horsepower to overcome the wind resistance at those speeds.

I have to agree that the biggest factor is brakes. The hardest stops I've
done was when I broke in my rotors. I feel safe going 55mph and trying to
stop from it. At 80mph the stopping distance in a bus is so dangerously long
that you really need to do something like put 944 discs on. Upgrading one
part of a bus and not the rest is sometimes a recipe for disaster because
the folks in the cars in front of you have far superior brakes.

Anyway, going 75mph with a Type IV is no less or more dangerous that doing
that speed with a Corvair motor so lets stop nagging Steven with our holier
than thou driving habits and congratulate him on his engine upgrade.
