hey folks, I installed my freshly rebuilt (by me) 2.0 GE and got it
running on saturday.  I spun it over for several minutes without the
spark plugs to get the oil moving.  Once I put the plugs in and got it
started there was a bad head leak on #4.  All this after lapping the
cylinders to the heads.  I took time off from it Sunday but today did a
complete teardown back to the long block to remove the heads to install
the gaskets in the heads hoping this will stop the leak.  I'll get it
started tomorrow night.  My point is:  I did all the work today without
removing the engine from the camper.  I know folks say to remove the
engine to do the type of work that I did today and ordinarily I would
have removed the engine.  But, I had no help to lift it up on a stand
nor was the rental place open to rent the good floor jack that I used
friday.  Sometimes an individual's circumstances require that that they
work contrary to conventional wisdom.  I just wanted to share a success
story (so far) going all the way to the long block with the engine in
the vehicle and it really wasn't that bad.  The only remaining work is
to hook up the FI wires and install the fan and belt.  I'll get it
running tuesday night and keep my fingers crossed that my head isn't
leaking anymore.  g
