Subject: Re: [T2] '71 front turn signals do not work with headlights

I am picking up this thread from 10 months ago because I still haven't
fixed my blinker issue.

Issue Summary: When I have my headlights turned on the front blinkers do
not blink. With the headlights turned off the front blinkers work fine. The
blinkers also work with the hazard switch activated.

The grounds appear to be in great shape on the front blinkers. I took off
the turn signal switch cover and took a few pictures.

The faded olive wire spliced into a green wire looks to have lots of solder
on it. I believe that is to activate the high beams. The black/white wire
looks questionable at the solder point. That wire supposedly goes to the
front left blinker.

Does anyone have suggestions for testing the volts through this switch. I
would rather not start unsoldering right away. I would expect with the
headlights turned off, the black/white and green/black wire would have
12volts. When I turn the headlights on, those would drop to 0 volts. Is
that a correct thought?

If that holds true, the large solder blob on the spliced green wire looks
questionable. Would it be a good idea to unsolder that wire and then test
the blinkers. What I do not want to do is end up with a jumble of wires
with even less working.

I appreciate any further ideas on this issue or if my theory sounds off and
I should just go back to double-checking all grounds and fuses.

Thanks,
