you might find these 4 photos helpful. My '71 wires had broken off   
and it took time to work out what went where.  My initial problem was  
different from yours : the signals did not stay on; solved, by the  
position of the switch on the steering column. the gap is about 1/8.  
but trial and error helps .

- but I guess the wires come off what ever is wrong so you may find  
these photos useful:
