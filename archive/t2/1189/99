Subject: Re: [T2] 77 baywindow oil leak

David, look up to where the pushrod tubes are going into the head on one 
end, and the block on the other. There are seals on each end of these tubes. 
They often dry out and crack over time, letting oil drip down quite nicely. 
It could be one of them. They are replaceable by pulling off the valve 
cover, rocker arm assembly, and then pulling them out through the head end. 
Not a big job, but takes an hour or so. I'd look there for obvious drippage. 
:-)
HTH,
Courtney
