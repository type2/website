Hard to say exactly how soon (no laws like in the U.S. mandating a time
period, to my knowledge), but there is no question that this will hurt
availability of genuine parts for German Buses. Many of the genuine
VW/Brazil parts I carry (seals, metal, mechanical parts, etc.) are still
made only because they happen to fit the modern Brazilian Kombi as well.
