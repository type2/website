Most of the usual places where rusted out.
Front rockers, rear rockers, battery trays, some of the floor was 
patched and the window frames fixed, it was all hidden behind bondo or 
window rubber.  There where some also some holes in the rear that where 
bondo and chicken wire.  I had to replace the rear hatch as it was full 
of deep bondo.  Bondo is not structural material, :-(.

The real challenge was the bit under the sliding door needed to be 
rebuilt, he said something about starting on the inside working his way 
out.

I also had him build a tire mount for the front bumper and instead of 
bolting it to the nose(eep!).

I have no idea who painted it brown(YUCK), the orange was the original 
color.
