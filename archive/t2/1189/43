finally had some time to get out there and fiddle with things.
OMG  never realized how sensitive the adjustments in the AFM are. (or at 
least in mine) there was no way I was getting that ajusted without the AFR 
guage.

so hopefully got it a lot closer to the "Ratwell" specs didn't have a 
chance to drive it much but it seems to be idling about 14.5 or so drops 
to 12.5 on hard accelleration so it is probably not "dead on" but it is a 
starting point, will drive a tank or two full and see what the results 
are.

Have Smog test coming up first of next year so this will be a godsend for 
that.

still doesn't say "Why" it is out but maybe "dutchmaning" around it will 
at least let me drive it without sucking the tank dry everytime I start 
it.. I have a brand new AFM that didn't help and am doing all the 
"Fiddling" with an older AFM.

thanks for all the help.
hopefully the light at the end of this tunnel
is not the headlight of the oncoming train.
