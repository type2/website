Subject: replacing heater cable early bay (71)

Ok I am stumped. I thought replacing a heater cable would be, pull out the
old one from the front and install the new one from the front. Trying to get
the old cable out (to slide out from the right rear it hangs on the grommet
that holds the accordion thing to the rear mount). I know the new cable has
to some through it. 

 

Does the plastic (German) grommet come off the mount to install the cable?
Looks like it is glued on it. I thought about cutting the cable there but
the new one has to come through the plastic grommet, right?
