Subject: bluapunkt CR-4096

So I want to install the Bluapunkt CR-4096 there is an orange (power) and a
place on the back to ground  and a wiring harness with 4 wires - red, green,
black, and white - i played around a bit and had speakers powered off of
red/black and green/white (I think)  but the balance is not working right 
It could be the stereo  or maybe the wires  anyone know what the
red/green/black/white are for (ok speakers I know  but?)
