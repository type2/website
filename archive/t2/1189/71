  Take a look at this blog.
  I met Mark on Friday night at a neighborhood car meet.
  Lots of stuff other than VW's, however there were 5 buses, 4 splits
  and one bay, 2 very nice cabriolets and a couple other bugs as well as
  a nice dune buggy.

  See Mark's blog at:
  www.66split.com
  Quite the story driving from Florida to California in a very nicely
  restored bus!
  Don't miss it!!
