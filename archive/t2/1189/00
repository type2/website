Excellent read explaining how voltage drops occurs due to corrosion 
(resistance) and too small wires, and how to measure it in your 
charging/starting curcuits.  Those wimpy relays may charge a spare 
battery, but the small wires mean it will take forever, and if you are a 
weekend camper, that spare will never fully charge and sulfate.  I also 
own a Roadtrek van camper for LONG trips (price of $10K was irrestible) 
and it had a crapped out isolator not allowing charge from alternator;
the  spare battery cable is like a #2 or 4 wire running 8 feet to spare. 
  I bought a battery switch and ran it directly between + on battery to 
that spare cable, and when on, both batteries charge.
