welcome David and if we are a little slow getting back a lot of us are in 
the path of the hurricane so may not have power or internet.

the bus serial number is on a plate that can be seen thru the windshield 
on the left front corner.
the engine serial number is stamped on the fan housing just to the right 
of the coil.  HOWEVER the fan housings have often been swapped so the 
actual number is stamped in the case near the air breather the black box 
on the top right about 4in wide2in deep and 2inch high it is very hard to 
see. the first two letters if it is stock engine for your bus would be 
"GD"

you will unfortunately have a very hard time getting the engine tuned 
ccorrectly because of the changed carbs. it but you can get it close if 
you try hard.

first thing if you haven't is to get the official "BENTLEY" service 
manual. the correct one for your bus will have a Green cover.  you can get 
one from a number of sources. my favorite and they are on this list is BUS 
DEPOT at www.busdepot.com
there are a number of other solid places to get it from plus e-bay and 
amazon.

good luck and ask away but the type 2 list has a very large library which 
should be at least looked thru to get more familiar with the fun vehicle 
you have just aquired

welcome
Bob
