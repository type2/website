Subject: Re: [T2] Carbs and Fuel Injection

Fuel injection ports aren't threaded.... air injection ports are.. M10X1

fuel injectors press into a J tube similar to your single carb manifold,, 
they don't go into the head.

air injection ports are in the head..   they are from a 74 with an air pump 
the port in the middle that used to connect to the air pump was probably 
plugged.. so it would make no difference if you plug the heads,, or the tube 
...  alot of plugged air injection engines I see have the tubes welded 
closed as I suspect the M10x1 bolt isn't the easiest thing to find,,
