Subject: Re: Hard shifting continues...

Just thought I'd update you all (again thanks for your help so far!)

 

Work unfortunately has taken a bit of a priority the past few weeks. I did
order all the seals, covers, caskets and bushings for the shifter connecting
rods from front to rear. I finally had time to take a look at the tube the
clutch cable comes out. You may recall that the metal tab that holds it in
place was not there. I had temporarily zip-tied it in place.

 

I crawled under while my friend stepped on the clutch. I tried to hold the
tube where I think it should go.he pushed it a couple times.then as I'm
looking around trying to see how things are moving, I notice that the whole
tranny seems to be moving. 

 

I'm not sure how I missed this, but it looks like two bolts that are
supposed to be at the front of the tranny are missing. I'm not sure exactly
what this is. I have posted a pic here -
