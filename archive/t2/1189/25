Subject: Re: [T2] Need a patch panel x2

Hey Chris, Schofield in U.K. makes this up. I know Busdepot carries some 
Schofield parts, perhaps he has this part? I know what you mean, mine are 
rusted as well. Did a quick lash up, but really do need to get it done 
properly.
HTH,
Courtney


========I'm thankful to all those who said "no". Because of them I did it 
myself.========


Who makes/sells a patch panel for the outer front seat belt anchor
points? I can make it but if the reproduction was priced right I might
buy and graft it in.
