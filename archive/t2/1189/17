Subject: Free air conditioner

Giving away DPD under-dash air conditioner. It is complete. It was removed
from a '77 bus in Seattle (where they have little use for air conditioners.) 
Compressor and the two condensers under the bus do not work, but the other
components seem to be ok.
New compressors are available, and the condenser
motors may be repairable by Philbin in Portland. 

I live near Yakima, WA and
you would have to pick it up.
