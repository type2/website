Subject: Baywindow rebuild

As i said in my earlier podt, just got this bus, it has the orginal gd
engine code in all the right places.
But it lacks the orginal fi.
I dont think i want to go back to injection, so im considering twin
webbers. Iwant to rebuild the engine ( accordind to paperwork that came
with the bus, orginal miles are under 80k).
my question is, how hard are these little motors to rebuild? ( im a gm
person) and how hard are the engine compartment trim panels to find?
