Tim0 -

You did it partly right.  But you should have kept the 34PICT and used
the 034 distributor, they are perfectly matched - I run this setup on
a friend's 92 Mexi-Bug and another friends 71 Panel Bus.

The 30PICT-1 pulls too much vacuum for the vacuum advance to work
properly.  The 34 PICT has just the right amount of vacuum to properly
work the vacuum advance.

See my write-up based on my experience:
