Subject: 2.0L won't do more than idle

Hello Folks,
I have an air cooled 2.0L engine in a 1983 Vanagon that I cannot get 
to do more than idle.

The story- Here is TheSamba ad 
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=1376415

The engine ran at one point, then the engine sat for several years. I 
put a new fuel filter in and added 3 gal of fresh gas & I tried to 
start it with no luck, shot of starter fluid got it going then it 
died so I went to the fuel system. Using the electric fuel pump I 
pumped a lot of crap out of the lines... I replaced the injectors 
with some I had from a watercooled 1.9 (1984) engine and I got the 
engine to start and idle.
Any attempt to give it gas kills it.
The PO put on a points & condenser distributor, looks new.

I am selling it as a project (hence the ad) but it would be better if 
someone could drive it away or I could drive it to the wrecking yard. 
It going to be gone soon.

Any advice on what I'm missing to get it to run? It's been some years 
since I worked on an air cooled..

Thanks!
