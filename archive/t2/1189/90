I would certainly first verify compression balance and leak down, even
cold will identify apparent problems with valves or rings. I have just
over 80K on my suitcase Type2 and it is still spec, so don't assume a
rebuild is needed until you deterime it's health. Could be just fine.

Either FI or dual carbs will require some work to install and get tuned.
Stay away from carb kits with cheezy linkages which come with all the
lower priced sets.

Rebuilding these engines is not rocket science. It can vary from just
heads and cyl/pistons to line boring and crank grinding. Skilled use of
micrometers and such are quite simply required to prove what is needed to
get back to spec clearances.

If I need a rebuilt, I will just send it to NW ConRod in Seattle and pay
their price to insure quality assembly and long life. Just stay away from
the 4 color full page Californicated sand buggy engines.
