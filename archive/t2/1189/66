Subject: Camper in Olympic Closing ceremony

There is a letter in the latest VW Camper & Commerical mag by the guy (Cliff 
Hilton) who drove his camper in the Olympic closing ceremony. Apparently the 
organisers were looking for "iconic vehicles" to represent a "typical" 
London rush hour.

He shot a video from the cab: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zg7TKwffvA

Brilliant !
