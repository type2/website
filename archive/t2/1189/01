Subject: How to time a vacuum distributor (was engine won't idle)

OK, I took your advice and ditched the 34PICT and 009 distributor, and mounted
a round bowl 30 PICT-1 and a 0 231 170 034 vacuum advance distributor. Now the
question is: what is the base setting for this carburetor and where should I
static time the distributor? Thanks, Timo in Hawaii
