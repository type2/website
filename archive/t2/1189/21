Subject: =?windows-1252?Q?camper_interior_for_a_non-walk_through_bus_=85_?=

so im in discussions with rjcampers and I will likely go for one of his
interiors . customized but based on what he has  i really really wanted
devon but i'm prepared to settle for a few tweaks to rj's  anyway, anyone
have an interior or floor plan that they think is the absolute best for a 59
to 61 non-walk thru bus?
