Subject: Drilling and mounting seats and cabinets to floor

What is the best way to drill and mount seats and cabinets to the floor of
my 74 bus?
I have a rock and roll bed ready to install, and unfortunately the mount
points do not match the existing bolt points in the floor.
Also, I will soon be mounting a Westy sink unit, icebox, etc to my bus, and
they have floor mounts.

Thanks,
Scott B
