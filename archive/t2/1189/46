Sounds about right.

What's your cruise AFR?  In CA that's what matters and I set mine to 
14.7:1 and it passes without issue.

I'd be curious what kinda head temps you're getting.  If you want to get 
cooler head temps, keep leaning your head temps out.  You'll 
unfortunately lean out your full-rich mixture, though.  That's where the 
MS comes in handy.
