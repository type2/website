got all the easy ones, I seems you have serious vacuum leak somewhere, 
check the hoses, the S hose between the AFM and the intake manifold is 
prone to cracking.  also make sure all of em are in the right places.

I'm still putting my money on Vacuum leak somewhere.  it is classic idle 
but won't rev.
  have you checked that the dist advance is actually advancing, had this 
problem and can drive one nuts.

good luck
