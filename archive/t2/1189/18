Subject: Carbs and Fuel Injection

So I drove my bus with it's after market single carb for years until the 
engine needed to be swapped.
At that point I swapped a spare moter in that had double carbs on it.
It ran fine for a while but then started misbehaving. I started checking 
the carbs out and started running into problems. Broken pieces and 
previous owner tweakings. I decided to switch back to my single carb.

I yanked the single off my old engine and when I removed the double from 
the one in the bus I discovered something unusual.

I think it was a fuel injected engine originally because there was a set 
of tubing that connected in the middle and ran down to two threaded 
ports on each side. They threaded into the engine on either side of the 
intake manifold where the J tubes bolt on for my single carb..

Ok so two questions.

1. Am I right in thinking this is left over stuff from the fuel 
injection system?

2. Since I had to pull this all out to make room for my single 
carburetor can I now just plug those holes with bolts or something?

Thanks

Jason
