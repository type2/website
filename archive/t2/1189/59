Subject: Are you ready for the apocalypse?

I've been waiting for two weeks to share this link.I don't know anything
about it-except it looks like a zombie movie. The great part is that in the
trailer it looks like the main character are using VW's for their escape
vehicles. They have a bus, and a convertible bug-(top down on the bug) makes
it easier to shoot the zombies..
