I've recently found that the air mix screw on carbs is pretty durn 
sensitive, too.  like 1/64 of a turn of change counts.

I've managed to find nearly zero detail on tuning aircooleds for AFR.  The 
only thing I've found was this blurb on a product page:

http://vwparts.aircooled.net/Innovate-LM-2-Wideband-Oxygen-Sensor-Kit-RENTAL-p/innovate-lm-2-wideband-rental.htm

In this, John Connolly says in summary:

"We recommend tuning in the range of 16:1 for light throttle (progression 
circuit), and 12.75-13:1 from 1/2-Full Throttle."



On mine (h30/31 carbed 1600) I'm finding that at hot idle, I need to be 
targeting the 16:1 number.   But that's guesstimation so far.

Would love to hear more discussion about tuning by AFR... :)
