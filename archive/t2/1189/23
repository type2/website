Dear friends:

Late last week, my Bus was loaded onto a trailer for it's new home in 
Los Angeles, and ultimately back to Germany for restoration.

It's been a fun 11 years and I couldn't have done it without you folks.  
I especially remember Karl Van Salzen, Boston Bob and Steve Nolan, all 
of who were helpful to me when things went south.  Karl even sent me 
some parts and I had to twist his arm to pay him for them.

Green Bean was my second bus.  She may not be my last, but I need to get 
settled across the country in my new life first.

So this is "so long for now" but not necessarily "goodbye.

All the best,

BEN
