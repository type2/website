Subject: rear suspension

On the rear suspension...Under the rubber axle stop (the rubber cone
mounted to the frame), there is a steel
bracket that the rubber stop hits... There should be a small steel
"dish" at the top of the axle bracket...Mine
are missing and instead of the rubber stop just compressing, it's
getting torn up...Is this"dish" available?
