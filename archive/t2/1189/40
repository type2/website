if they don't modify the van again to comply,  the thought of anti lock 
brakes for our buses!!!   but this is the last place in the world to get 
new parts for our bays...

wonder how long VW Brazil will support the buses after production ends.

of course if one reads between the lines it never says VW is ending 
production only that it will need to comply with new Brazilian safety 
laws.  Crash testing is probably the only thing they wouldn't be able to 
get "real" workaround for.  I wonder what the market (not market share) in 
Brazil and export for these last of a kinds, and if it will be worth VW 
Brazils trouble to make the vehicle compliant???
