David,, most GM guys never get it! so give up now..  ;-)
things are a little backwards in the GM world... but I am sure you will pick 
up in it.
Taking it apart is pretty easy... assembly is getting very difficult!
sooo many parts now do not fit... and unless you know what is supposed to be 
there.. you will have problems
over torquing the oil pan bolt for example,, will break the case, and that 
is sort of a catastrophe..
but don't dwell on that stuff.. sooo many on this list can help you out 
along the way!

What is the "engine compartment trim panels" you refer to ?
