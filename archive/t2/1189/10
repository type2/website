Subject: Re: [T2] How to time a vacuum distributor

OK, I've switched back to the 34PICT, and have timed it with a strobe  to 32
degrees total advance and it revs well, but still won't idle. Question 1: is
this the correct way to do the timing? Question 2: does anyone know the BASE
SETTINGS for a 34PICT carb? That is; HOW MANY TURNS OUT on the mixture screw
and the volume screw? Jim wrote: "The 30PICT-1 pulls too much vacuum for the
vacuum advance to work properly.  The 34 PICT has just the right amount of
vacuum to properly work the vacuum advance."
