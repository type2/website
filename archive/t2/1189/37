I doubt they are avail separate,, as they are welded on the diagonal arm... 
but it wouldn't take much to break the weld off to get a pair,, then weld 
them on your arms,,, or go to the trouble of changing the entire diagonal 
arm.
I bet a good metal fab shop could hammer a washer to the cup shape, and weld 
it on..
