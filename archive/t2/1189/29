Hi Jules,



Thanks for your help..



Where I pointed the two red arrows-I put two bolts in there. They were about
> long. I put a dab of anti-seize on them, and used a washer.



That is all I had lying around the shop, but I think the holes are about
1.5 deep, so I thought I would get some 1.25 bolts. Please excuse the
non-metric dimensions ;). Is this the right approach, or is there a special
bolt for this? And am I supposed to be using a lock washer? Also what is the
main cross tube that this thing appears to be bolted to called?



So the transmission mount is below this thing. But what is this thing
called, Im searching the net and Bentley and cant figure it out.

The transmission mounts are below there - two bolts which mount through the
flat transmission support - they point up. You can see one of them in your
pic.
