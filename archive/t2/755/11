Subject: Re: [T2] Would you like to see the Gilmore AC Install?

<I saw the Gilmore site...pretty weak in terms of info.>

Yeah, according to Ed the owner, they are releasing a new version
shortly.

<What is involved and how much did the rig cost?>

The system wasnt cheap at $1500 shipped.

I can say thus far however, that I gained a great deal of confidence
just talking with Ed, and based on his "good word" went ahead with
the purchase.  I am so far very please with the quality of the
equipment, packing and shipping.  If this packing alone is any
indication of the product im in for a real treat.

The install (according to the directions) is fairly simple, with a
few minor holes in the floor pan, some simple trimming plastic tubes
and cowling parts, and running some hoses.  It doesnt apear to be
rocket science.  Fortunatly.  =)

As I stated earlier, whitnesses or no, I'll be taking tons of photos
and making notes along the way to send to Ed for "padding" to his
current installation documentation.

L8r,

David.
