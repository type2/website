Are there any advantages of analog tach/dwell meters over digital ones?
Also, I have seen some units that do "magnetic timing."  There's one
listed as "#2831 DIGITAL TECH-DWELL MAGNETIC TIMING ANALYZER (s5)" from
the same seller as the CP7676.  Could that be used with a type 4 engine
with the sensor that detects the flywheel dowels?

For a good unit, search eBay for CP7676. Pay about $10. I sent you a pm
with an ebay link for one.
