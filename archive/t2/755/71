Timing light only.

When you remove the old distributor you will leave the drive pinion in place that will show you how to install the new one. Because the new vacuum can distributors are for beetles the vacuum can is in a different spot if you have a Type 4 engine.

If this is the case, before removing the old one, set the rotor to point to the mark on the body, #1 TDC.

Then drop in the new one and you'll notice that you have to rotate the body in order to get the vacuum can to clear the Type 4 fan shroud. The body will move,only, the distributor rotor still points to #1 TDC, so that position now becomes spark plug wire #1 (irrespective of the mark on the body) and the rest wire, #4, #3, #2 clockwise.

If you don't order the plug wires right, the engine won't fire or will backfire.
