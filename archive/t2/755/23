Greetings!  By way of introduction, my name is Jerry Weir and I work
with the Disney Company.  I work for Radio Disney AM 1250 here in
Seattle.  As part of the Disney family, we've got a bunch of promotions
wrapped around Herbie - Fully Loaded.  One of those events, in
particular, had me thinking about your club.

We worked with Chaplin's to secure a New Beetle and dress it up like
Herbie.  I have Herbie on the road making promotional stops and handing
out movie tickets.  But we'd like to take all this promotion
surrounding Herbie and create some community goodwill by hosting the
Radio Disney Bug Blitz!

We are asking Bug, Bus, and new Beetle owners and fans to join us from
Noon - 2:00 pm on Saturday, June 18th at the Newcastle Safeway on Coal
Creek Parkway in an effort to Fully Load Herbie with food items for
Northwest Harvest.  NW Harvest is very excited about this event and
will generate some nice publicity for the event itself.  We will have
games, prizes, and music along with tickets to the Advance Screening of
Herbie - Fully Loaded.  We hope that our audience of kids will
appreciate seeing older, classic bugs along with the newer Beetles
while our adult audience will definately feel nostalgic about the
original movie and the original Bugs!

Let me know if you have any thoughts, ideas or suggestions.  We look
forward to seeing members of your club there for this community event!

Regards, 
jw
