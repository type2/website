 Thanks, Jeremy. I'll check all of those terminals.

 Steve Dolan came by tonight, and we (1) confirmed good dwell to see that we
 were getting spark, and (2) verified that the voltage is good to the pump
 (10.25 volts when cranking), but the "replacement" pump I put in is bad,
 probably destroyed by crystalized gas built up in storage.  We tested the 2
 other pumps I have by pumping gas from one gas can to another.  One pump is
 good (for now), and the other, (the original pump for this bus) was bad.
 Steve says
 junkyard spare pumps tend to suffer from sitting too long, so I"ve ordered 
a new pump,
 in hopes that it gets here by the weekend.  In order to wire a
 replacement pump that has round stud and nut terminals, instead of the
 original spade terminals, I'm going to have to create some very short wires
 with round "washer" style terminals on one end and spades on the other end.
