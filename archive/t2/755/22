Subject: Spraying starting fluids into airbox (was " Runs and Runs")

NOT a good idea to spray into the air cleaner with a starting fluid- we 
did this on a 75 and it backfired, ruining the flow flapper.  Starting 
fluid should be introduced AFTER the AFM, as into one of the tubes 
feeding the airbox.

See if you can get it to briefly fire with a generous squirt of WD-40 or 
other flammable spray. My guess is that all is well except the fuel supply.

  If it will fire with a spray then you can say you've confirmed 
ignition and the mechanical condition.

  Usually takes a long spray into the air cleaner which the engine is 
cranking. Never a problem for us but keep a fire extinguisher handy and 
the bus not in the garage.
