Having the antenna next to the body is a Very Bad Thing.  It will be
difficult to get a good SWR from the antenna, and the radiation pattern
will be very lopsided.  This applies even if the top of the antenna
extends above the roof line.

I suggest a rain gutter mount at the rear corner of the roof with a 4-foot
Firestik antenna (trucker stores).  Run the wire down the cooling air vent
and then through a hole behind the spare tire well.  You can make this
hole large enough to pass the PL-259 connector.
