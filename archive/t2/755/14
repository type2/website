I hate to beat what should of been a dead horse, but here it is...

In minesota....

http://www.ecarcenter.org/MN/mn-brakefluid.htm
"Brake fluids are considered used oil and can be combined with your used 
oil as long as they dont contain any solvents, brake cleaners or 
carburetor cleaners. See ECAR Used Oil fact sheet."

In australia, it is *not* cool to combine with oil as they say if you are 
going to re-use(re-refine) the oil, it is not good to mix the brake fluid 
in....unless you are just going to burn it.

Now, this is interesting...these folks say you can put in the drain of a 
city septic system...but *not* a home one!

Amazing what you can find on the net!

I am still taking mineto the local hazardus waste center once a year...

Cheers, dave

 Bad idea.  Engine oil and gear oil are probably okay, but brake
 fluid should not be mixed with oil for disposal.  I understand
 that you ruin the whole container's worth of oil for re-cycling
 and turn it into expensive to dispose toxic waste by adding
 even a small amount of brake fluid.
