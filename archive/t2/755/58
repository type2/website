Subject: Re: [T2] Fan Belt

You will find people selling VW belts with teeth. I use one with my
alternator setup. It increased the fan:engine ratio from 1.75:1 to 2:1
with the teeth alternator belt.

As far as i can tell, the faster turning fan it did next to nothing to
oil or head temp though.

Oil still at 185F (turkey thermometer) after 12 mile commute in 70F
weather. Starting to think it is normal
