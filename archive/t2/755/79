Subject: CB Radio Antenna install

So .. I recently installed a CB Radio Antenna on the rear bumper of my 78. 
I got this mirror mount thing at Flying J's for like $11.00.  I threw away 
half of it and the other half mounted nicely in one of those holes that are 
on the bottom of my rear bumper.  The mount sticks out about 1 1/2" from my 
rear bumper.  I had a fiberglass antenna that screwed right in.  It only 
goes as high as the rain gutter of my roof and so ... is about 6" or so 
shorter than the top of my pop-top.  I haven't wired it up yet and I'm 
hopefull that I can squeeze the cable through the front without drilling a 
hole.

Anyway - so - will this antenna work properly - or optimally - I kinda doubt 
it but ... if not what should I do ... get a longer antenna that goes about 
my pop-top? ... if so how high should it go ... 6" or 3' or what?

TIA
