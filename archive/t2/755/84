It will probably work fine though not optimally because your bus will
block/reflect some of your signal.

I have a couple of large washers glued to my fiberglass pop-top (PO
job) and a magnetic mount CB antenna that I can just stick up there
whenever I need it. Always fun to hear what the truckers have to say
about the little bus cruising down the highway.
