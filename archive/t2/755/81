Subject: RE  Overhauling Pict 34 dual carbs on a 74 AP 1800 Type 4

Just three (from my experience):
1) Have a clear bench, pull it apart carefully and layout in a manner that 
it's easy to reassemble without forgetting bits.
2) READ the Bentley and set it as per that. The number of carbs I've seen 
wrongly setup is far mare than are correct. It makes them run much better 
set up correctly.
3) Plan to have the throttle shaft re-bushed. Unless it's a low mileage car 
or new carbs they will be worn and leaking.

Regards,
Richard
