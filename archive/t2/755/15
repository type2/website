Subject: Re: [T2] Steve Dolan is right again.  Was Fuel pump runs and

From Andrew Stephens:

 Yesterday, I plugged in the new double relay.  It clicks nice when I turn on
the key, but I get no fuel pump sound, and no fuel pressure when I try to
start the bus.  (at least it doesn't run on anymore, so maybe that was the
double relay?).

 My next step is to check for voltage at the pump itself.

Any suggestions?

To check for voltage without disturbing any of the wiring, you will need to either be cranking the engine with 
the starter or have the key on and have the air flap in the AFM pushed open a little. Preferrably the latter.

Then when you are looking for 12V at the pump, tap the side of it with a wrench or small hammer. If it runs, 
your pump is bad.
