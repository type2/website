It is with great regret that I inform you,

I need to sell my 1974 camper van. My business is off to a great start
but I still need financing money for a building. Yes, it is true......My
camper must be sacrificed for the good of my business and family. 
if you know of anyone that would be interested, please have them call
me at 315-395-8179. 
I have invested over $4500 into her and as the mechanic at Burdick's
stated "she is very solid". I would love to get (-at-)4,000 for her but will
accept a little less in my misfortune. She needs a high beam switch
(lights work but no high beams) a reverse light switch on the transaxle,
front wheel bearings would be a good idea pretty soon and last but not
least, a set of cylinder heads ($250 new if you shop on line). She
currently runs well and was my everyday transportation until the
beginning of the month when my inspection ran out. She has lived an
interesting life, traveled coast to coast a few times from Florida and a
few trips to Canada from Florida also. She has approximately 415,000
miles on her and with the right person to keep her going she will do
quite a bit more.
You have seen her, so pass the word if you would.

regretfully

Tom Brown
