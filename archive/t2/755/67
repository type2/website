If you're fitting a pertronix module, you don't need a dwell meter.  the
dwell meter is needed to properly set points.

I'm amazed that the FLAPS wouldn't have a dwell meter.  While it is true
that most cars don't need one these days, there are still a fair number of
cars still running points.  Google on "tach dwell meter" and you will get
plenty of hits.
