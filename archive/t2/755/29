Subject: oil

Anybody know where to get a quality 50W oil at a
decent price?  The usual suspects don't carry it
anymore.  I use Castrol GTX 10w-40 now but I don't
think they make straight 50W anymore either.  I have
an oil leak that I'm trying to put off fixing and need
a heavier oil.  It'll be fine as it's summertime.  Thanks...KR
