German (Viton, Elring) and the test.

Several problems can exist (sometimes more than one):

- leaky oil gallery plug

No solution here except to remove the plugs, tap the holes and replace with threaded plugs. A big job.

- damaged flywheel seal bore

Sealant might help. In the worst case the bore needs to be enlarged and sleeved.

- improperly installed seal
- missing o-ring

- groove worn at flywheel/seal mating surface

This one can sometimes be compensated for by moving the seal forward or backward of the old seal. Sometimes the groove is so large that the flywheel has to be replaced.
