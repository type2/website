Subject: HD or standard oil pump

Hello,
After a month of lost interest towards my bus, passion is back. Yipee
- 4th of July is coming...

What is the standard oil pump gear size for a 1971 bus engine, 21 or
26 mm ? Engine is 1600 dp with pressure control and relief valves.
Any reason to run a bigger pump than standard size  when no mods to
oiling system are done ? I'm pretty convinced that stock oil pump size
is good enough (dixit Hoover
