Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Gauge/Part Numbers

From Timothy Woenker:

 1.  I'm looking for a working fuel gauge and bi-metallic vibrator for
 my '79 Westy.  Does anyone have these parts laying around to sell?

 2.   It has occurred to me to find the part number and see if VW might
 still have a new one laying around somewhere.  However, I can't figure
 out how to identify the part numbers for these items.  I've checked
 Ratwell's page and found the correct fiche and fiche reference numbers,
 however I don't know how to convert the fiche reference number to a
 part number?

The voltage stabilizer is part # 113 957 099A
https://pointer.webappcabaret.net/busdepot/view.jsp?model=57&category=13&group=84&prodgroup=651
Bus Depot says it fits buses 2/72 and up. But ETKA says it fits buses from vin 2132166508, which is the middle 
of 73. It actually came after the switch over from the cylindrical sender to the swing-arm sender. That was 
from vin 2132138901.

The gas gauge is part # 211 957 063B
Bus Depot comes up zero.
This dealer shows it in stock:
