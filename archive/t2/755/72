Dear Richard,

Drive pinion (I'll look that one up.....I am very new to this).....

Yes I have a type 4 engine....mark on the body for #1TDC...?......its
dark over here otherwise I would check right now.....

As to the wire order, I assume they are the same offset from #1 but #1
is simply in the new position due to the vaccum plate needing to be
rotated.

yours

Charles

p.s. Is that rotor on your site suitable, 5400 rpm limited.

becomes spark plug wire #1 (irrespective of the mark on the body) and the rest
wire, #4, #3, #2 clockwise.
