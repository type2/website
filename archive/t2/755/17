One small thing -- I found that if I combined
all the oils I got from various vehicles that
the people at the municipal hazardous waste
collection point would refuse me on the grounds
that with the quantity I had that I must be a
commercial firm trying to use the taxpayers for
my own profit.  Explaining that I have trucks
and tractors as well as cars didn't impress 
them.  Of course, it may just be that I shouldn't
come with one 55gal drum but rather some odd
collection of milk jugs and cat litter canisters...
