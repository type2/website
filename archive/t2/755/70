Subject: Engine seal.

A word of warning:

Don't but the engine lid seal from cip1.com. It comes in 4 bits and is
the wrong shape and barely grips the metal. The irony is that I ave
just read ratewells article and it says I should but one from
JustKampers which is UK based !! (I am in the UK .....)

yours
