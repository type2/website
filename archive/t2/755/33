Subject: Re: [T2] Help with a picture of the bit below the air cleaner

Dear Dave,

reference: http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t201600.gif

Thanks for the connections. I am beginning to feel like a detective !!=20

1) I have the paper air cleaner bits / plastic and 10a & 5
2) I do ..not... have 26, 24, 25
3) I can't remeber seeing 17,18,19
4) I do have a lovely screw from the garage in 5 to keep the flap open !=20

I'll double check this when the sun is up

Thanks for the help, it is all rather difficult when bit are missing !=20

yours

Charles

p.s. Can the oil air cleaner pipe be replaced with anything of a similiar g=
auge?
