Today, I got lucky.  Richard's new page about thermostats (plus the
one on germansupply.com) got me to looking at mine. I just had
assumed it was working all this time. Nope..open all the time. Crap.

A buddy of mine owns an import FLAPS in town and I remember an employee
of his mentioning the other day about old stock before the computerized
their system. I got to thinking maybe they have a Bus thermostat. I was
right! Only had one...wasn't in his inventory system...but the old
price was in there...$14.29. So I now have a brand new Wahler bus
thermostat in my possesion. It is stamped 85/90 and a production date
of 5/1. Not sure how to interpret that date. I can hear liquid in it.
The part number is 021 119 159 A. The manufacturer number is 1106.85.

I've read both web pages on the thermostats. But I can't figure out
how the cable attaches to the thermostat. Supposedly the cable goes
through the union nut..which screws onto the thermostat, but what
keeps the cable in there? I'm missing something here that the pictures
aren't able to show.

BTW, he has 1 beetle thermostat left..I'll snag that tomorrow.
