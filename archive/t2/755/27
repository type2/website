Subject: Rear Main Seal

About to get a new Rear Main Seal as i'm tired of leaking oil all over the 
place and i'm about to do a long road trip to San Francisco.

Wondering, as I always have this ongoing rear main seal leak, even after its 
replaced....

Are there different makers (brands) of the seal?  If so, what is better? 
Opinions?

also, I read on the list that there may be somewhere on the flywheel that 
keeps causing it to happen.  Or a flaw in the housing?  Any ideas why this 
is an ongoing problem for me?

I looked in the archives but no luck.
