these motors are a little stange to me.  As far as I understand it
the vacuum advance only works in 4th gear and if the temp is 50 or
below.  That would be fine except I don't have the cutoff switch in
my bus anymore and the Weber doesn't have a vacum port.  When I got
the motor the vacuum line was attached to a post on the carb.

The vacuum advance doesn't only work under the conditions you described. 
You can demonstrate vacuum advance sitting in your driveway with a timing 
light and attaching/detaching the vacuum line from the carb (and blocking 
up the port in the carb!). My weber progressive has a vacuum port for 
vacuum advance. Or at least I hope that's what I've been attaching the line to!

Cheers,

Martin.
