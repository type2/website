Subject: Weber 34 ict questions

I bought a set of 2nd hand weber 34 icts from the Samba and have a few 
questions about installing them on my 2l TypeIV engine in a 76 van.

Firstly, it seems to be impossible to tighten the lower two nuts that 
fasten the manifold to each head. The nuts barely clear the manifold making 
it impossible to get a socket on them. Is there a trick to this? One 
possibility I thought of was to replace the lower studs (assuming they can 
be removed) with a screw or a bolt with an allen key head. Any thoughts on 
this?

(The previous installation appears to have been on a head that had a single 
lower stud. The seller didn't know what they had been on.)

Secondly, does anyone have good close up photos of how the linkages attach 
at each carb? I have seen Paul Deatherage's photos, but they don't provide 
enough detail.

Thanks in advance,

Martin.
