Jen asked..."Anyone have any tips on how to press the gear off?  Type I
engine."


The tool to use for this is a Bearing Splitter.  It wedges itself behind the
gear and then use the press to press the crank out of the gear/tool combo.
If you are unfamiliar with bearing splitters an internet search will show
you what they are.
