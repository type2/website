Bad idea.  Engine oil and gear oil are probably okay, but brake
fluid should not be mixed with oil for disposal.  I understand
that you ruin the whole container's worth of oil for re-cycling
and turn it into expensive to dispose toxic waste by adding
even a small amount of brake fluid.

For the environment's sake, please find another way of disposing
of brake fluid.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
