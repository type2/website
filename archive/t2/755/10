Hi Volks,

I'm gonna be a little while getting the trip report together, but
here are my pics from BusFusion 2005:

Sometime over the weekend I will probably post my Dad's pics and my
trip report.  As usual Frank and his team put on another GREAT VW
event. 158 VW's registered is probably a Canadian VW camp-out record.
Congrats and thanks all around!!!!


Happy trails,
