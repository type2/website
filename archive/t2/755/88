Make sure that the throttle shaft isn't worn and loose.  If it is, no
amount of rebuilding will make the carb work right.  You can get the carb
rebushed or you can simply buy a new carb.

Other than that, disassemble carefully, squirt spray carb cleaner through
the passages and jets, reassemble carefully.

The kit you have probably contains a float needle valve.  Unless your old
one is leaking, I wouldn't suggest replacing it.  Getting the float level
right is tricky and involves assembling and disassembling the carb while
using a funnel to pour gas in so that the level can be determined.  Not
fun.
