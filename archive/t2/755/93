Subject: Starter problem in a '71

Well, I spent a few hours trying to trouble shoot the malfunctioning
starter on my 1971 exWestfalia today. Replaced battery cables, added
hard start relay, cleaned all contacts including tranny ground. Starter
works fine using the screwdriver across the terminals method, but it's a
no go at the switch. Sooo.... I've narrowed it down to the switch. Does
anyone on this list know which two wires I have to cross to bypass the
starter circuit in the switch? Just to be sure that's the problem.
before I tear it all apart... Timo
