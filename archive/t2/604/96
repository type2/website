Subject: '77 tranny into a '73 Bus, Solved?

Thanks to all that helped me figure out the "how to" with the tranny swap. 
Wil Anderson, Mark Dearing, Snoopy. I read through the Ness tech article 
about the transmission he freshened up at the end he mentions a nose cone 
upgrade available through a couple of companies. I tried to track down 
Transform with no luck. I did speak with Ron at Weddle Engineering, these 
are the facts that he gave me:

The nose cone does not have to be changed out.
The transmission from the late model is 8mm longer than the early 3 rib.
The mounts must be swapped.
The linkage has to be adjusted for the additional 8mm.
They do not make an upgrade kit for the late model tranny.
They do make one for the later side shift transmisions to convert it to a 
front shift.

Sounds like it is going to work just fine with minor adjustments to the 
linkage. I still wonder if a combination of different shift rods wouldn't 
correct the linkage so no adjustments are needed.

211-711-155GU  Front Shift Rod, 1973 (Chassis #213 2000 001 to 213 2300 000)

211-711-155FU  Front Shift Rod, 1974 to 1975 (Chassis #214 2000 001 to 215 
2300 000)

211-711-155HU  Front Shift Rod, 1976 to 1979 (From Chassis #216 2000 001)

211-711-171DU  Rear Shift Rod, 1968 to 1972 (To Chassis #212 2300 000)

211-711-171LU  Rear Shift Rod 1973 to 1979 (From Chassis #213 2000 001)

Too bad I don't have these laying around to take pics and measurements to 
share with the entire bus community. Any takers? If anyone has any of these 
laying around and can pmail me the information as far as measurements and/or 
pics I would be happy to put it all together.


Thanks,
