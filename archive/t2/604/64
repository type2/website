"Would the fridge work if there is no battery"?

Yes the fridge will work without the battery. On the back of the panel the
wires are "spliced" together on the spades from the battery and the shore
power (inverter). The shore power and inverter, via the city power switch,
take over and revert the power back to the battery so you can charge it with
the egg timer while simoutaneously running the fridge.

If the fridge doesn't work with the shore power I would guess a wire has
come loose or fried itself on the panel or under the z-bed.

Good luck,
