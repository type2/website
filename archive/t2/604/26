Subject: 1978 Auto Transmission bus

Hi All,
  I found a bus that kinda interested me, but I do not have much
experience with what is in this bus.
Does anyone have any experience with the Automatic transmission that was
in the bus, and the Fuel Injection as well. I am used to carb's only.

This is a california bus, so I think it will need to be able to pass smog
for the next 4 years, but I oculd be wrong.

what I am looking for is a bus for a bus-newbie. I am looking for
something to tinker withI am familiar with engines, and am not afraid to
tear into one, but is this a good starting bus?

Thanks,
Matt
