Subject: Help or mechanic in Buffalo, NY

Hello everyone, well my bus broke down outside of Buffalo, NY (West Seneca to be exact).  The starter went and we were push starting it to get by and I fully stripped an already worn spark plug hole.  So I had to leave me bus behind and contemplate repairs.  Also the rear end is sagging far worse than when i left.  
 
So here is what I need to get her home:
1.  New Starter, 2 - Spark Plug insert, and 3 adjustments to fix a saggy rear end.
 
Does anyone know of any good air cooled shops in the area or have any other suggestions, particularly on the saggy rear end problem.  I have made arrangements to return to Buffalo the last weekend in August to fix it myself if need be.  
 
Thanks
