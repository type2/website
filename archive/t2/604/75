Hello Michael      You are probably going to change the front nosecone and 
shift rod.   If I remember right the front mounts are different and the shift 
rod also but they are interchangable so that isn't a problem   Check the 
brackets inside the nosecone  they are famous about breaking   the later ones have a 
better designed shift linkage,   and you should be able to use it .  
Everything else is a straight swap    If you want it right you should do the seals 
while it is out and inspect the clutch  later and have fun   Mark dearing
