Subject: Stupid Elec. Question

Hi all,
    I am in great spirits cause tonight I finished my first (almost)
solo engine pull and reinstall. Despite a little help from a buddy, I
did it all myself. Next time I might be able to go alone, but I
definitely could do it with another set of untrained eyes.
 
I fired her up and she started almost right off. At least as good as she
used to fire up after sitting a week. When I warmed up and pulled out of
my driveway I noticed the next project :)
 
My right turn signal doesn't work. Here's the scoop:
    Works fine with headlight off. Won't work with headlight or driving
lights on. Years back I had a similar problem, but when I would turn it
on, the dash light would just stay on, but not blink (I don't remember
ever fixing this, but my bus has had a lot of professional help since
then). Now I get nuthin. You may recall I posted a little while back
about my brake warning light coming on when the headlights were turned
on. I'm sure these are related as I was recently under the dash
replacing my ignition switch.
 
As little as I know about mechanics, I know even less about electrical
issues. Please help. 
Sorry for the long post, I must be excited about her running again
 
Thanks
