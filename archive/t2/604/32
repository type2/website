Went byt to see the bus for sale up close. The sign said $9200... 

28K engine with an oil slick under it, no oil cap, bastard alternator, 3 or 4 shapes of faded tan, needs tires, needs rubber seals, interior fair, comes with flat screen monitor and DVD player (?). 

To me it was a $2500 bus with $500 of stereo equipment... 

There is another bus just like it here in town for MUCH less I suspect. A real project bus but complete I think. 

See ya! 

Chris
