Subject: crankcase breather questions

>>>>>>> I am now trying to decide
between replacing the oil pressure unit with a new one and some Teflon tape,

Don't use teflon tape. The oil pressure switch needs to ground to the case.

>>>>>>> So the question is: is this crankcase breather equipped with a one
way valve?

This is a PCV valve type of unit. They allow very little throughput, clog
easily, and are delicate and break apart when old. I replaced mine with a
straight through unit from an earlier model bus. If it is constricting your
crankcase breathing, the build up of pressure and also cause oil leaks from
good seals.
