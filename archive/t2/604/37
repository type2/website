Subject: Dual Battery Relay

Recently purchased the Hella dual battery relay for my 76 westy and have a
couple questions about installation.
I gather from the instructions and info in the library that one wire goes to a
lead that is only hot when the engine is producing electricity.
Where is this lead usually found?  I'm guessing the voltage regulator or coil.
My plan is to use a test light to find a lead that is cold with the switch on
but hot with the engine running.  I was just wondering where to start looking
for it.
Also, in reading the instructions it looks like it can be used for either the
fridge or accessories but not both.  I thought one reason for the dual battery
was to be able to run interior lights, radio, etc while parked.  Is this a
truely either / or situation?  It seems like all the accessories are wired to
the starter battery by default which is isolated from the second battery when
parked.  Not sure how the power from the second battery makes it into the
stream under this scenario.
Thanks for your help.
Mike
