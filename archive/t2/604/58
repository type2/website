tim,

i have a '79, and i have an air/fuel ratio gauge on my dash. i use an
autometer gauge connected to the 02 sensor. i have retrofitted my sensor for
a 3-wire unit, and modified the harness to accept the 3-wire and also
connect the gauge to the signal wire of the sensor. in the link you can see
the pink wire which is for the gauge:

you can also make your own air/fuel gauge:

if you google "making air/fuel meter" or gauge, you will get lots of other
results. 

the gauge works. i don't think it is a particularly viable fine tuning aid,
but it will tell you if the system is grossly out of adjustment. when the
dash gauge is working properly and the engine is correctly tuned, the gauge
led's flip constantly from lean through stoich to rich and back, about once
per second. this movement means you are never getting an accurate
measurement of the air/fuel ratio, but just an idea that the engine is not
"rich" or "lean" all the time. you can read load enrichment clearly on the
gauge when you put your foot down. it is possible to adjust the afm with the
gauge, but i'll reiterate that i don't believe it is a very accurate or
reliable way to do it.

the tricky part of afm adjustment is getting the load sensing to work
properly, the afm is very sensitive, so if you make any adjustments to it,
be extremely careful and write down every move of the gear, so you can go
back to where it was. it is not easy to improve the engine's running
condition by adjusting the afm.
