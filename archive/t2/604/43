Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Battery Relay

I wonder if this is why my fridge does not work. Well it maybe other 
problems. I connected the shore power and can use the electrical outlet but 
no fridge. I thought it was supposed to be able to work on shore power, or 
am I just wrong here?

You don't happen to have an additional set of wires over there too do you? I 
still have not been able to locate the ones that Karl spoke of for the fuel 
pump. Maybe the PO cut them out.
