Hello Listees

I've been hearing of all these different ways
of getting a type 1 or 2, all the same except
for weight, onto a floor jack. I've been working 
on vw's for 15 years by myself with maybe a 
friend to help out every now and then if I'm 
lucky. I think some of you guys are working 
way to hard on the install of your motor. For me,
when I'm by myself I use a 14" by 14" by 1" of 
plywood to put under the block. I then grab the 
exhaust and tilt towards the flywheel end and then
with the square piece of plywood between the 
block and jack, I hold the jack with my legs 
and I pull the motor up onto the jack centered 
using the wood the to slide the motor up onto the 
jack. Its worked for fifteen years. Hope this helps.
