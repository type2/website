Subject: Re: Upright engine install

Well, my buddy came over last night and got her in in about 5 minutes. I knew
I was close but DARN.  I had the bottom bolts lined up, but the engine and
tranny weren't parallel. He just put a little pressure on the fan shroud and
PLOP, it was there. We wiggled it around a bit to finish it up, but no big
deal after that.

Thanks for all the quick replies to my post. You guys are great.
