Michael,

I just happened to drop in on a thread I know womething about.  I have a
'73 that sports the trans out of a '79 (with an '80 block).  My comments:

While I think that flopping nose cones will help shorten the shift rod, it
can be done on a direct flop; I know, I have.

If you intend to install the FI (and I HIGHLY recommend this!) then you
need to flop the transmission support bar across the top of the trans.

The length difference between a '73 trans and a '79 trans (and your '77
trans as well) is about an inch.  Half of this is in the nosecone housing
and the other half is in the bell housing.  You *want* to use the later
bell housing and starter if you can or else you are in for a bit of hell
in matching the bell housing, the flywheel, the pressure plate, the
starter, and the throwout bearing support tube(????).  If you go for a
wholesale flop of the '77 powertrain I think you are far better off but I
would not argue if you flopped the early nose onto the late trans but as
Mark said, the later nose is stronger.  You *may* have to flop the shif
rod as Snoopy says but I did not have to; mine just worked out.
