the case and the switch are m10 x 1.0 STRAIGHT. there are no tapered threads
anywhere on a VW, unless they were modified, either by re-threading or by
threading a tapered object into the hole.  however VDO senders are m10 x 1.0
tapered. they will fit into the m10 x 1.0 straight hole, but don't
over-tighten them.
