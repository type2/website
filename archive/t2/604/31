Subject: Got the stripped oil plug

JB weld is good, but I wouldn't trust it in a critical application like
that. Replace the plate, or tap it for oversize.

>>>> My plan is to JB weld
a new bolt in there and just change the oil through the screen.  Sound good?
Probably not permanent but I wonder how long I can expect this to work.  Is
there another way?  I could re-tap the hole, but worry about non-magnetic
case shavings getting inside.
