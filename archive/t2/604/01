the pilot bearing is the same for any type iv engine from 1.7 to 2.0. when
you ask about seal, i am guessing you mean the main seal on the flywheel end
of the engine. all the engine seals are the same across all type iv's, with
a few exceptions, mostly pertaining to different induction systems (carbs,
fuel injection).
