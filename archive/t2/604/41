I tried the website you listed and could not find this product.  Do you 
have a more specific URL?  Also, can you offer an opinion of this 
exhaust analyzer?  Have you used this exhaust analyzer?  How well did 
it work?  Are you happy with it?  Do you feel like it gave you accurate 
results?  etc.

$125 is inexpensive enough that I might spring for it.  It would cost 
me nearly that much to take it to a shop and have an analysis done.
