What about the difference between the two? Is one tranny better than the 
other. The reason I ask is that we are going to take out the 1800 and swap 
in a '77 2.0L that is stock and with the '77 tranny.

What kind of head aches are you speaking of? I have not compared the two 
trannies side by side, I do not have the '77 stuff yet. I thought the 
difference was basically the nose cone. Would the be a difference in the 
shifter rod aswell?

BTW the guys name is Marty Lyons, any relation?
