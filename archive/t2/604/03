Subject: SF East Bay Machine Shops?

Hi all:

I pulled the head off of one of my vehicles due to somewhat low compression
on that side and notice that one of the spigots (head/barrel interface) has
an irregular wear point.  Otherwise the head looks to be in pretty good
shape.  I'd say this head needs a compression cut here to clean things up.

Anybody in the SF East Bay area do good work on TypeIV heads?

TIA.
