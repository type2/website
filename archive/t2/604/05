Subject: [T2] Westfalia Wood Stain- Pictures are up.

Ok, so I stained all of the freshly cut panels with Olympic Interior Water Based Polyurethane Crystal Clear Satin finish. I am most pleased with the results. I would like to thank you all for the advice you've provided. I have pictures of everything here: www.cardomain.com/id/deathead777 Go to page 9 for the new pics. They'll be somewhere near the middle. There is one picture of the final result, panels installed. Thanks again!             -Paul Deatherage
