Hey thanks Steve,

I didn't read this until after my first post this morning, but that is a 
very incouraging post. What kind of differences did you notice with the 
swap? If this one goes through the engine will be an increase as well. More 
power, better highway performance, better city driving, anything that would 
be considered a worse than before point.

Did you change out the shift rod/s?

I would too, but it is not my bus. I am curious in the difference of the 
support bars. How are they different?
