Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Battery Relay

mike if you have the bus depot relay setup this is what i used to set mine up... jamie hit it on the nail and so far knock on wood i have been useing mine by this setup and instructions for a few months now..
 
hope this helps..?
peace and love

Yes, using the #12 awg wire and I reccomend you sleeve it.. ie: put a 
loom over it. Use that
spagetti tube from a north american vehicle or a real high temp loom if 
you can get it,, or some
heat shrink tube, just something to give it extra protection from 
scuffing ,,, look at the wire
from the alt to the starter for an example of what I mean.

#86 goes to the blue wire at the voltage regulator,, or you can connect 
it to coil main power
terminal #1,, but that will allow the relay to connect the batteries 
any time the key is on.
the blue wire connection will close the relay when the alternator is 
starting to make voltage,,
after the engine is started, so there is much less current flow in all 
circuits

To recap
#30 goes to main battery positive terminal,, put loom over this wire to 
be most correct
#87 goes to the Aux battery positive terminal  .. put loom over this 
wire to be most correct
#86 goes to Voltage regulator Blue wire,, or coil terminal 1
#85 goes to ground

You can eliminate the fuse in that relay,, it isn't necessary... if the 
circuit does
overload....the relay contacts inside will only hold about 80 amps,, 
the wire will not start to
get red hot until about 100amps.
That is what the loom is for,, if there is a problem, the wire will get 
hot, the loom stops the
wire from shorting to ground,, and the relay contacts will go POOF,, 
opening the fault.
The #12 wire impedance will limit the amount of fault current 
anyways,,,

So you protected without the annoying fuse blowing frequently when you 
aux battery is low.
That current only flows for a few minutes then the lead acid taper 
charge comes into effect and
the voltage rises, the current drops off,,
But if the fuse blows then you have a dead aux battery,,,
you don't need that fuse,,
YMMV

Recently purchased the Hella dual battery relay for my 76 westy and have a
couple questions about installation.
I gather from the instructions and info in the library that one wire goes to a
lead that is only hot when the engine is producing electricity.
Where is this lead usually found? I'm guessing the voltage regulator or coil.
My plan is to use a test light to find a lead that is cold with the switch on
but hot with the engine running. I was just wondering where to start looking
for it.
Also, in reading the instructions it looks like it can be used for either the
fridge or accessories but not both. I thought one reason for the dual battery
was to be able to run interior lights, radio, etc while parked. Is this a
truely either / or situation? It seems like all the accessories are wired to
the starter battery by default which is isolated from the second battery when
parked. Not sure how the power from the second battery makes it into the
stream under this scenario.
Thanks for your help.
