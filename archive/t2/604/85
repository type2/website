I am wondering myself about the timing...we set it and it was good..but
maybe not perfect or maybe it has changed on me...but I have been borrowing
a timing light and can't check it just yet.

My fuel pump has a dial setting for psi and I have it set at 3...it has
worked great for a year now at set at 3 psi.

PS the weber was on the bus when I bought it...an engine fire fried the FI
and it was removed.

Thanks!!
