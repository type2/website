To the List:

The situation - 73 bus needs engine, tranny is on it's way out. So if all 
removed just a 73 bus.

Solution - 77 tranny and engine all parts in between included, even the 
starter.

Questions - Will I have to change out the nose cone on the newer tranny to 
make it mount properly or will it work as is? Are there any other problems I 
might need to address before trying to install this setup? Linkage, shifter 
rod, etc.

Any takers that would like to share their knowledge or experience (Mr. 
Dearing)?
