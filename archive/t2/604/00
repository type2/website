oh yeah, I think everyone does that the first time they drop an auto
tranny bus engine....most people catch it before significant damage.

right, and whatever you do be carefull with the ball at the accelerator
linkage end,  break that and you will be practicing your welding skills.
and the (*(-at-){ &%$##  socket always seems to get stuck on the blang thing,
lots of PB blaster/WD40/CRC/pick your favorite

Be very careful with how you put on or remove the shift linkage cable,
follow Bentley instructions EXACTLY no matter how dumb they sound. it is
the only way to get that thing on or off...and it is easy to break and of
course NLA.
