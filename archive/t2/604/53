Subject: Replacing a side panel on a Type 2

Hello,

I am looking to purchase a 1970 Bus. The bus in question has a bad side 
panel, right behind the drivers side door (below the side window). Is 
it possible to buy the panel and have someone weld it on. It looks like 
it is possible to get a panel for it, but its a pretty big area. The 
current panel is all wavy and needs to be replaced. Also any ideas on 
what that would cost?

Thanks,

Blake
