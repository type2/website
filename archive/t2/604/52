Subject: Check Air/Fuel Mixture Using Oxygen Sensor?

I need to check my air fuel mixture ratio.  I have a '79 bus with 
California emissions, so it has an installed oxygen sensor.  Has anyone 
successfully used the output ffrom  the oxygen sensor to check air/fuel 
mixture ratio?  If so, can you share your method?
