Hi Jerry,

Let the record now stand at 2-posts FOR, one against.

I like to daydream about life amongst affordable rust-free type2s.  
Please continue to post these items.

Maybe we can just get Dan to set up a filter on his email app so they  
won't interfere with the usual Tire/Oil/ChildCot traffic.


Happy trails,
