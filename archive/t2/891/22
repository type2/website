Subject: funny signs

For some reason this got kicked back.  Another funny sign story:


I'm still sorry that I didn't get a picture of a sign that had me  
laughing for years.  Actually it's the company name: Stubbs Limb  and 
Brace.  I was going to send that in to Leno.  Now they've  changed it to:  
Stubbs Prosthetics and Orthotics.  Still  funny but much more subtle.  
Cheers...KR
