Hi Don,

For $25 I'd definitely recommend you replace the coil. Mine packed it  
in on the way to the Outer Banks on Easter Monday. It started as an  
occaisional hiccup and got a lot less occasional within a couple  
hundred miles. Problem was that the bus ran PERFECTLY at idle, so I  
could not nail the problem down to a specific cylinder. Eventually it  
got bad enough that something "had to be done", so I pulled into an  
Advance Auto and within 12 minutes I was back on the road problem- 
free. This was a lesson I learned on the way to EveryBus 2001, when  
it happened to Jeff Stewart going through Lynchburg VA.


Happy trails,
