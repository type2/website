Subject: Sighting on the PA Turnpike

Saw a gorgeous teal and white bay with PA plates on the PA Turnpike  
yesterday right around mile marker 310-320 Westbound.

They were stopped on the side of the road, I swung in, gestured a  
"thumbs up/thumbs to the side" query, got a "thumbs up" in return and  
was on my way.

Safe travels!
