So has  anybody broken the FI diagnostics up into 15 minute  chunks?



hey Don  I have the factory troubleshooting manuel and I did loan it  to Rod 
Henley(Hot Dog)  to copy so he could put it on his web site. I am  not too 
sure what his web is now but you can get in touch thur the Fullmoon site  .  
pretty cool little book that is 90 pages and has the troubleshooting  broken down 
into a flow chart.  If need be I can make you a copy,  later  Mark Dearing
