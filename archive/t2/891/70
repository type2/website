Subject: fuel pump mounting bracket

today as i was trying to install my brand new bosch fuel pump i managed to
snap the upper rubber piece the bracket bolts to.  is there a replacement
part for these anywhere, if so a part number would help.  if not has anyone
else experienced this problem and please explain to me a fix for it.  the
pump is on a 78 2.0 liter FI.   thank all of you gus in advance.
