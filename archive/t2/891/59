Hi All,

Took the long way home today, and saw a sad, rusted bay in a Greek guy's 
driveway.  He's scrapping it out, and wants only the engine/transmission 
(2.0, FI, automatic tranny).  I'm going to gut the rest of the bus for 
anything and eveything I can cram into my own.  And you'd better believe 
that if it looks presentable, it's going home with me. 

The main thing I'm after is the A/C setup on the bus.  It's the under 
dash unit, and everything is there, though some of it is slightly worse 
for the wear.  Alse grabbing the steering box, front seats (to adapt the 
rails to more comfy seats for my bus), and loads of other stuff.    
Pretty much, if it ain't worn out, or absolutely disgusting, it's 
getting unbolted and put in the box of stuff that's going home with me. 

All because I took the long way home :)

Shad H.
