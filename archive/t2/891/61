I ordered a new coil along with my Crane XR700. It came with an external
ballast resistor.  Is this resistor to drop the voltage from 12V to
whatever the coil needs to do its thing?  I assume the Bosch blue
coil does the same thing, just internally. If this is the case, what
voltage does the coil need to work?  (whether reduced internally or
externally)
