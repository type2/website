I've got  the Bosch manuals, is it the same thing? Or do you have a VW

 hey Don  This is a blue book with AFC(air flow controlled)  fuel  injection VW troubleshooting type 2 model
1976 on the front cover doesn't say anything about Bosch.  See if you can find Hot Dogs site then you could
down load it from  there.  later  Mark Dearing

I wonder if it is anything like this reprint that Terry is selling?

I have the 1976 booklet. Don't have this one.
