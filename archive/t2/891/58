The coil  I just took out and plan on cutting open (heh) was an Autozone one

crap.



Hey Don  I have found that the ones from autozone, advance and most  
aftermarket ones will be wrong.  most of the workers don't know the  difference 
between a internal resistor coil and an external resistor coil.   they just know 
what the computor tells them.  later  mark dearing
