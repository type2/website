how bout the guy offering a olive westy for 2500 on the samba now,
two weeks ago he was asking 1000, now he sez hes getting offers for
twice what he was asking, so he comes back and asks for more(!?)

now, if im selling something for a grand, and someone offers twice
that, i wont think twice bout selling it to them (unless of course
its one of those stupid nigerian money wire scams)
