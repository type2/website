113 142 355 B  - Bonded Rubber Mount 77-79, 2 Required, Bus Depot shows it
at $8.58 each

As deduced by the above part number, these are also used as mounts for the
Auto-Stick Clutch Solenoid unit on Type 1s 68-75.  The reason why I bring
this up is my buddy Cliff has a 72 Auto-Suck Beetle and happened to have a
skin-packed set of their #9259 Rubber Mounts used on the Competition Oil
Coolers and used a couple of them to secure his Solenoid a few years back -
still holding up quite well.  They look closely the same as the OE numbered
mount above.  EMPI shows a "Racer" Price of $11.90/Set of 4.  Check with a
VW FLAPS to see if they have 'em and compare.....

For giggles take a look at what the 75-76 model is priced at:
211 261 325 C - 2 Required, Bus Depot shows it at $135.81(!) each
Must be platinum-plated.......
