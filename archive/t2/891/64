Sorry to hear you got AutoBoned, glad to hear that Guac is
running right.  I only buy stuff from there when it's something
they can't really mess up.  Fuel line, hose clamps, oil, wire,
brake/carb cleaner .. that kinda stuff.

I completely gave up on them a few years back when the
counter idiot thought I was jerking his chain asking for
fuel injector seals.  Well, that along with the fact they'd
*hire* an idiot like him after I couldn't even get a job
interview. <grumble>
