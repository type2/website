Subject: Broke down in PA, need info on tranny.

I am trying to help Pat from Georgia(BuggyBus) and we need 
some info. She is on Rt322 just north of Philipsburg,PA.

'72 Bus
Type 4 engine
3 rib tranny

Her tranny lost all gears but one. I took out a used 3rib 
tranny to swap with hers. Engine out, bad tranny out, 
replacement tranny in, then engine won't pop into place! I 
knew it was going too smooth. The bellhousing that was on 
her's was early Bay and the one on my replacement is late 
Bay. I have a late bay starter to match the housing.

Now my question. Are all Bay Bus flywheels compatible with 
the two bell housings? It just seems that the teeth on the 
flywheel are not getting enough room to wiggle the engine 
into place. If need be, we can swap bellhousings. Just 
didn't want to do that because we don't have a replacement 
gasket.


It was getting late, we were working under flashlights, 
and we had been at it for 4 hours. That and the skeeters 
were eating us alive. It may just be that we were trying 
to hard to get it finsihed. I am hoping some rest and some 
good info may be the boost we need to get her truckin' 
down the road again.

Thanks for any help.
