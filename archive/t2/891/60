The difference is that pointers to event announcements are not susceptable
to abuse like pointers to auctions.

As you know, some auction sellers
try to rustle up bids as much as they can by widely publicizing their
auction through posting repeated announcements.  It would be nice to have
a policy of moderation for this, but trying to explain moderation to some
auction sellers is impossible.  The solution was to simply ban all auction
pointers.
