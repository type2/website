Subject: Re: [T2] Revive battery?

One thing to try (last resort before you dump them): charge them with
reversed polarity and then chrage them again with proper polarity. Not sure
what the physics/chemistry behind this is - but it is supposed to bring back
a dead battery or totally kill it ...

I have learnt this from a guy with lots of practical experience. Did not
work on my 6V car battery though ....
