Subject: 75 Double Cab at Dick Autohaus (good front doors), Wye mills

I have passed my 75 double cab on to Dick, the bus is rusty but has
really good gates (the front doors are pretty good too).  I am joing the
westfaila world again w/a 79 one owner garage kept beige deluxe camper.
Hope everyone has a great 4th of July in the states, and hope to see you
all camping soon.
