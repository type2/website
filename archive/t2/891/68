Subject: A/C  compressor Saga

The ongoing saga of mounting the compressor in my '72 Bus with a Vanagon CV engine installed.

Clearing the left, side frame was a small problem.  Cutting a part of the mounting plate solved that.  The upraised sealing tin is causing a problem with the Sanden adapter.  So, I cut the upraised tin off, leaving a flat place on the left side.  Does anyone know why VW raised the tin in this area instead of leaving it flat to begin with?  The compressor is on order, and I need it to proceed much further.  After the compressor is mounted, new metal will be fabricated to seal the engine compartment as well as can be done.

New pictures will be posted soon.

This leaves another question.  I have now cut off the Serial Number that was located on the upraised metal.  Where does anyone think would be a good place to reinstall it?
