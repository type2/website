Well, the guy gets the "flowery ad copy of the day" award.  Definitely has
that "ebay" smell to it.

I guess the 2L engine with kadrons and blooey muffler was a rare option in
'69!  :)

"Near one of a kind metal pressings" in the top?  Isn't that a
self-negating statement?

Doesn't the "super rare industrial model dash" live underneath the padding
of every bay?

The white glove compartment door doesn't ring true, and what utility bus
came with 2-tone seats?

I love the way that he used 150+ words to say "10K Cash, Firm."

Nice bus, and might be worth 10K if it was truly original.  It would take
quite a bit of work to get this one back that way.
