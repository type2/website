Tell you what.  All I have been doing is relaying info about AridZona Bus
Stuff.  Many times I have been asked to check out the Bus as it is somewhere
in AridZona.  I do all of this for free! I have put many buyers and sellers
together. If this is such a burden the  two Bus lists, then no problem.
What happens in AridZona will now stay in AridZona.

The difference is that pointers to event announcements are not susceptable
to abuse like pointers to auctions.

 

As you know, some auction sellers

try to rustle up bids as much as they can by widely publicizing their
auction through posting repeated announcements.  It would be nice to have a
policy of moderation for this, but trying to explain moderation to some
auction sellers is impossible.  The solution was to simply ban all auction
pointers.
