Count me out on this one.  I enjoy looking at rust-free specimens  and only wish I could attend some of the many campouts they have  there.   Just don't open them if you don't want to see  them.  They're always clearly labeled in the subject line.   JMHO....KR

Not to stir up the pot here, but doesn't this really fall into the 
category of the ebay ad thread from a week or two ago?  Don't most of us 
read TS already?  No offense to the Aridzona folks, but do we really 
need to see links to every bus that comes out of the state?  And now 
links to polls on TS on where to end the VW cruise in Scottsdale....

/me puts on his flame retardant garb...
