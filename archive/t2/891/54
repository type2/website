This is a charger that also reconditions batteries that have sulfated. 
Don't know if it really works. But if that doesn't, you can put in new 
acid and some EDTA (very cheap) and charge at 50 amps for several days 
to weeks and it will recover many useless batteries. A retired engineer 
buddy of mine uses this technique on the old golf cart batteries, and 
totally powers his home from solar cells charging these batteries.

EDTA was developed by the Germans during WWII to remove metals from a 
solution, and is also used by doctors to remove plaque and cholesterol 
from arteries and thus avoid having to do heart bypass surgery. Doctors 
call it "chelation therapy".
