Hi Jim,

When dealing with an FI issue, you have to forget what you think you  
know and verify EVERYTHING.

Sudden failure as described sounds like an electrical failure. It's  
very good that you have a fuel pressure gauge, you will find that  
VERY helpful.  A vacuum gauge will also be helpful.

Also be sure to verify ALL the vacuum connections. Even a small  
cracked hose will make the bus hard to start. A dislodged hose will  
definitely kill it. This is always my first step when dealing with a  
suspected FI issue.

If it's running with the key on I would suggest you try to "hot-wire"  
it with a bridge wire connecting the fuel line to the coil. This will  
bypass the double-relay in regards to the fuel pump. If this works  
then the problem is with the wiring harness somewhere. (I know this  
only because you have ruled out the double-relay itself swapping in a  
known-good part.) If this doesn't work then you can rule out the  
double-relay, and start checking for spark at the coil.

Which brings me back to the beginning.... You'd be better off to  
follow the symptom charts in the L-jetronic manual.... they will lead  
you to the solution with as litle guesswork as possible. The trick is  
not to skip ANY of the steps based on what you think you know. Any  
troubleshooting on an FI engine always starts with valve adjustment  
and ignition/timing. Unless you do this first you WILL only wind up  
solving it by throwing parts at it... and that'll be an expensive and  
time-consuming process.


Happy trails,
