Hi Don,

The annoying PITA is that you can't tell a bad coil by looking at it.  
I have about three spares here in the garage and I don't actually  
know for 100% certain if any of them are any good. I just have to  
throw them on and see what happens.

Just be sure to toss the "known bad" in a dumpster ASAP, once you  
prove it's kaput.


Happy trails,
