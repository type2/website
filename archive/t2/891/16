Subject: Re: [T2] More 30 PICT 2 questions...

For the "plug" that Muir refers to - for 30PICT-1 (Round Bowl) and 30PICT-2
(Square Bowl) Carburetors, VW did sell a "manual" Pilot Jet to use in place
of the Idle Cut-Off Valve.

VW # 113 129 415 D, size is G55, although other sizes (from G45 thru G65)
were available too.

Many VW shops in biz for the past decade or so should have an assortment
laying around.  I still have a small stash of some myself, mostly new, a few
used ones too.
