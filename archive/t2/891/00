Subject: hey everyone! new to list, soon to be a westy owner (again)

hey all, i just sold my 62 karmann ghia (sob) but i have my sights
set on a 70 westy in tucson. previously i had a 69 westy that was
made of compressed rust and devoid of all the camper stuff cept the
attic cot and no floor under the front passenger seat...hopefully
this deal goes down good cuz i gotta drive this thing from el paso to
north carolina!
