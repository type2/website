Subject: Bite Sized Chunks

My misfire has grown exponentially.

So far I've ruled out the distributor (p&c replaced, checked cap for cracks,
etc), wires, and fuel filter.

I now need to dive into the FI and associated bits. (And plugs if I can ever
stop having to rescue the wife long enough for it to cool down... heh)

Because of my recent surgery, I find I'm only good for about 15-20 minutes
at a time with my head in the engine compartment. While that will eventually
go away, for now it's a limitation.

So has anybody broken the FI diagnostics up into 15 minute chunks?

I've been considering grounding one plug wire at a time and trying to drive
hoping to isolate the misfiring cylinder to reduce my time under there. Any
thoughts or suggestions on a good grounding method? I've been looking at my
clip on spark tester thinking it might do the trick.
