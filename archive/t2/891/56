Subject: Coil! (Was bite sized...)

Yep. The coil swap did it!

The Guac's smooth power is back. I hadn't realized it was acting up before
the obvious misfiring until I put the old Bosch coil back in.

The coil I just took out and plan on cutting open (heh) was an Autozone one
I bought in CA when I was troubleshooting a bucking problem that turned out
to be the fuel filter. So it's only a couple months old. Grrr..... Piece of
crap.

Anyway, I'm gonna cut it open and take pics. :)
