Not to stir up the pot here, but doesn't this really fall into the 
category of the ebay ad thread from a week or two ago?  Don't most of us 
read TS already?  No offense to the Aridzona folks, but do we really 
need to see links to every bus that comes out of the state?  And now 
links to polls on TS on where to end the VW cruise in Scottsdale....
