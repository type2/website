Hey,Bob, a 'messed up one' is what I've got!!!!

It's a long, sad story, but the front part is this:  I had my '78 bay parked 
on a downhill with just the emergency brake (not in gear) holding it.  I 
loaded a real heavy chair in the passenger seat, and when I dropped it on 
the Vanagon seat, I knocked the emergency brake handle OFF!!  I could not 
reach across the large chair to grab the e-brake handle again, and I didn't 
have time to do much except to turn the wheel as hard as it would go before 
it locked.

All this time the passenger door was swinging wide open, with me hanging on 
to the wheel, prone over the large chair.

The open door caught the neighbor's mail box and knocked the box off the 
post (the funy part of the story) but the door also caught the 
hood/windshield.pillar/rear view mirror of the car parked in front of my 
neighbor's house. And this is where the sad and tragic part of the story 
begins.  It is not suitable for publication, really...

GEICO said they would give me $300 to R&R the door on my own, or total the 
vehicle for $700 (less $200 deductable).

I am going to order some Sage Green from the XYZ paint company and spray a 
replacement door, if I can find one.

So, all you lurkers out there, please RESPOND!!!  Is anyone local scrapping 
a late bay, or have a passenger door left over from previous.

There is some possibility on Maui Howie if he comes back in country, or I'll 
be heading out to Dick's Autohaus in Wye MD
