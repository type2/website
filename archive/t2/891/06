I saw that poor thing last year at the Portland Bug-In, and the engine 
was just
hangin' there in the open, and I could sure smell it when they pulled 
in.

I hope they've gotten around to sealing the engine compartment.  With 
all the work
involved to hack the engine bay to install a pancake T4 in the first 
place, what's
another few hours?
