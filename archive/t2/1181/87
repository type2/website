You can pull the dist drive out with a broken #2 pencil jammed into the 
center of the drive. Remove the spring first of course. It'll want to 
rotate as you gently put it out.

Take care though when putting it back that you are installing it 
correctly. The John Muir book explains it all pretty well.
