Subject: Re: [T2] Brake booster hose

Hey Everybody -

Save your $$.  I have been using 1/2" cooler hose for the Power Brake
Booster on all of my Power Brake equipped Buses and both my Vanagons
for the past 35+ years because I was turned off by Volkswagen's price
for the wire-reinforced hose they sold at the dealer, it's obscene.
The plastic hose used on the later models is also obscenely priced as
well.

Oil Cooler hose is heavily reinforced to prevent pressure bursting
(something like 300PSI) and it does not collapse because of this
reinforcement.  Most FLAPS carry this for transmission cooler use and
of course a lot of VW shops carry it for the external coolers.

Try it.  It works :)
