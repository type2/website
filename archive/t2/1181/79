I think I answered my own question via the Samba, the Type2 Archives and 
Mr. Ratwell's site.

No mudflap on the passenger side b/c of the propane tank and guard.

If I want to put a mudflap over there (and delete the propane tank) I'd 
have to fab a bracket that matches the driver's side. I also think I' 
can visualize how to do that with scrap metal and a streel bar to hammer 
it against to get the curvature details that the driver's side has.

We are seriously considering deleting the camper stove and sink in favor 
of a portable stove b/c I don't really want to cook inside of the van 
anymore. Maybe a cookstove unit using the westy parts that fits inside 
my Brenderup trailer and slides to the rear of the trailer when we are 
parked, otherwise sits at the front of the trailer. I need to see how 
well it would fit with the bikes in the trailer. That's a primary use of 
the Brenderup for us.

Mostly want to just sleep and carry people in the van with lots of storage.
