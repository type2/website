Subject: brakes

OK, so it's over 100F here and yesterday I drive the Bopmobile to the 
grocery store.  Everything seemed fine on the way so I loaded up and 
started back and my brake pedal goes 3/4 way to the floor before it 
catches and then I don't have much brake.  I just drove back home really 
carefully and even tried the emergency brake a couple times but even it 
didn't want to lock it down.  Like I said, it's over 100 outside and I'd 
like to not waste too much time diagnosing this thing.  Most likely 
problems?  Thanks....KR
