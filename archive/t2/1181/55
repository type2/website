OK that is just too friggin cool.

The top looks like an earlier Adventure or
a Safare (can't see those side windows and the back perfect) but all that
front glass is just too cool.  If it is a modified adventure or safare, I
can't imagine where they got the corner bits.  Doesn't look of course like the
Westy interior started with it.

I wonder how bad it leaks.
