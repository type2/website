Yes it is! But it is doable. I've done it twice now; you learn to curse and 
use needle nose pliers to coax the new boot on. I did it, so it can be done 
by anybody. :-) If it's the gasket, can you squeeze some silicone sealant 
around it to stop the leak?

Yes you just have to remove the valve cover, and the rocker arm from the 
offending PR tube. You then pull out the tube towards the head, using a 
strap wrench, or as in my case, a pair of waterpump pliers with a cloth and 
try NOT to dent up the tube. I dented one, but I tapped an appropriate size 
socket through it to remove the dent. Get the better Viton gaskets when you 
replace it. I now have abosolutely NO leaks and thats saying a lot form a 
VW!!
HTH,
