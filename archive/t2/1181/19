Subject: Any must do things (VW or otherwise) around Hood River, OR?

Leaving tomorrow for a family reunion (wifes) in Hood River, and wondered if
there are any must do/see VW places (good junkyards?) around Hood River as
I'll have most of a day to myself.  I plan on hitting the big auto/air museum
(exact name escapes me, and early US not VW at all) but am always interested
in a good VW yard to look at.  Or other suggestions of must do things.
 
TIA,
John
