Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Hose (HARD PLASTIC)

That is one the things that is still in almost every Vanagon at the junk
yards!

PO for crew cab used copper tubing when booster was added. Cost me a motor
from vacuum leaks. Vanagon line worked, with a little persuasion here and
there. Might have been easier to run new instead.
