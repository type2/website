You're going to get five million opinions of what is right, but the 
engine builders that I trust say to run the engine hard after the 
initial cam break-in:

John Connolly's a very smart guy when it comes to type4 engines and I 
think he's got it right.  I think Jake Raby also follows the same method 
- honestly, I don't know many other people that know more than those two 
about type4 engines and they both say the same thing, so I trust their 
opinion.  In addition to that, there's also a motorcycle builder that 
says the same thing and has a site devoted to the topic, and his 
argument sounds convincing as well.

I've rebuilt my engine three times now (for other reasons) and I've seen 
no adverse wear on my pistons, cylinders, lifters, or cam using the 
above break-in method.  Also, you can feel the power increase when 
you're driving it hard and getting the engine hot... and I drive it 
*hard* up a steep hill that only allows me to barely get into third.
