If you are a "Zen kinda person" it can be done by "blind feel". You can
only get a couple of fingers in there but it can be done. 

Use a lube on the upper and lower tubes like KY Jelly that'll break
down to 1/4tsp of water rather than something like soap that may later
dry out the rubber.

Put the UPPER part on the tube first as you can slide it up far enough
to get the whole boot on then slide it back down onto the lower tube.

This is a "sit on the ground with your forehead resting on the bumper
and your eyes closed" job.

Remove rocker arm assemblies

Remove push rods (keeping them labeled as to which hole they came out
of and which end pointed "in" toward the engine)

Slide push rod tubes out.

Put on new seals.

Put tubes back in.

Put Rods back in

Reinstall rocker assemblies

Do a full valve adjustment procedure.
