if it is the stainless braided metal hose I actually hand tightened it 
from the other end and just a bit with a wrench at the end. the hose is 
tought enough and strong enough to do that, and the block is soft enough 
so that it sealed, it has been several years without leaking and get 
decent readings.

YMMV
