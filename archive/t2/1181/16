Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Hose (HARD PLASTIC)

Hey Everyone,
I just want to be specific that I'm looking for the HARD PLASTIC 
TUBE/PIPE that's used on the later bays.  I know that the earlier bays 
used a reinforced rubber hose, but that's not what I'm looking for.  It 
sounds like most of the parts that people have suggested are a hose 
instead of the nylon pipe - if that's not the case, then let me know. 
I'd rather have something similar to stock as then I don't have to drill 
the holes larger in the chassis.

thanks,
Mike
