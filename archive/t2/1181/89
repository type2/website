the one thing Bob Donald's insisted on was to NOT use synthetics for the 
first 3,000 miles.  since I was a long time synthetic user he was adamant 
about this and told me he would not honor the warranty if I did not use 
good dino oil for the breakin period.

I followed his instructions to the letter and appear to have a sound 
engine, I now use Mobil 1 15w-50 synthetic in my engine after the breakin.
