Only something you worry about in WV or Wasilla.  Not an issue in Fresno ;)

Now, keeping it from melting inside due to solar gain, that's another story. 
That thing would be a challenge anywhere in the Central Valley.

Looks like a non vented gas heater, and a good sized one at that.  Way better
to have a Toyo/Montitor vented version.
