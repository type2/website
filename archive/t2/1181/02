I've used similar nylon for fuel hose, it is quite resistant to anything in
the engine compartment, and more than sufficiently rigid to hold vacuum.  I'd
bet it would work splendidly if the right OD is available.  The stuff I bought
in a big role off *bay, but the amazon prices look OK as well.  Can be brittle
in extreme cold and I'm not sure about UV stability, though black is better
than natural in that regard.  Nylon 11 and 12 are stated as optimal for fuel
and automotive fluids, hence should be best for a car environment in general.
 
Nylon is a thermoplastic as well, so you can heat it to do complex bends
then dunk it in cold water or spray/wipe with same to take a nice set.
