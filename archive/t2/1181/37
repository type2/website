Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 CC single port intake manifold feeding to #2

The tube that was rust/corrosion blocked was the one connected to #2, and is
one of the smaller diameter tubes.

See here:

(on the right, and in the front)

Doesn't this smaller dia tube FEED fuel and air INTO the #2 chamber?

I'm a bit confused here.
You say this is an exhaust feed going AWAY from the combustion chamber, and
not air/fuel feed INTO the chamber ?
