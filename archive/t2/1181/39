Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 CC single port intake manifold feeding to #2

Hi Bob
it is the heat riser,, and they are always plugged...  you can use an old 
clutch cable ,, with the end a little frayed,, and spin it in a drill ,, it 
will clean out the rust.. with some effort ..  some folks cut holes in the 
tube to get at the rust, then weld up the hole..

the intake portion of that manifold feeds gas and air to #1 AND #2  on the 
right side,, and #3 AND #4 on the left side
the smaller tube that is touching is just a heat exchanger.. it allows hot 
exhaust air to flow thru that tube,, and transfer the heat to the intake 
runner.
but, the AIR thru each does not mix...

intake manifolds bolt to the heads.
heat risers bolt to the muffler..

(on the right, and in the front)

Doesn't this smaller dia tube FEED fuel and air INTO the #2 chamber?

I'm a bit confused here.
You say this is an exhaust feed going AWAY from the combustion chamber, and 
not air/fuel feed INTO the chamber ?
