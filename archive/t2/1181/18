Mike -

This plastic piece, at least for the late Bays was obsoleted by VW
over 15 years ago with a Parts Bulletin issued to use the expensive
Wire-In-Hose as a replacement (VW 203903).  Sorry, that's just the way
it is, which is why I used the 1/2" Oil Cooler Hose on my 73 Panel and
78 Westy at the time.

VW still offers the plastic tube with the 1-way valve attached for the
Wasserboxer Vanagons, but I'm not sure if it is the right length you
may need.  VW 251 611 929 G.

You may have to fabricate something if you're adamant about using
nylon/plastic tubing.
