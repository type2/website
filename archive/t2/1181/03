David, BusDepot came thru with a very well built battery tray!

I could not find one either. I ended up buying 2 right side battery trays. I 
am just going to flip the one for the left side upside down. I got the trays 
from Bus Depot.
Let the list know if you find a supplier of the other side at a reasonable 
cost.
