Subject: Re: [T2] YMMV - 2" air disc grinders

Joe, I bagged one of those no-namers from HarborFreight years ago, and with 
my little 30 gallon air compressor, it works very well. I just used it last 
week to grind down some of my horrendous welding on an exhaust pipe 
conversion for my motorcycle. Here is the one I got, along with their little 
2" kit.

Walmart was also closing out a lot of their autobody stuff, and I picked up 
about 5 of the little 3M disc kits as well.
I'm with you; these work really really well.
