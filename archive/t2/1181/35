Subject: 1600 CC single port intake manifold feeding to #2 cylinder

In tearing my engine down for inspection and rebuild, I discovered this tube
to be completely shut from rust inside the manifold tube.

Unbeknownst to me, I guess #2 has not been getting fed for quite some
prolonged period of time.

How can this happen?
What might have been a cause?
Carburetor icing,
obviously internal condensation created by something, ????
