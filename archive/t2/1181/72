Subject: 1978 Factory mudflaps

Hey Volks!

Got a question about the factory mudflaps on the front of a '78 Westy. I 
have the driver's side mounting plate, not the passenger side. Removed 
it last night so I could reposition my jack stand on the driver's side 
in anticipation of sanding the floors where they are surface rusted here 
and there.

is this something I can buy as a repro item? I can make one but I'd 
rather have the "right one".

I THINK this was a factory item. Am not even sure.

Am planning to run mudflaps when the bus is done to keep gravel from 
scarring up the bottom of the rocker panels and the rear end of the bus. 
Stone chips lead to rust, etc.

Thanks,

Chris in TN

Resto update: everything is painted hub to hub. Have all the parts. 
Balljoints reinstalled. Looking for a factory style balljoint crimping 
tool for safety. Am starting the floor and fenderwell cleaning. Removing 
only the undercoating that is peeling. Will clean it up and paint the 
underside flat white with flat black wheel wells. Am using a  2" 
90-degree air grinder with sanding discs and scotchbrite pads.
