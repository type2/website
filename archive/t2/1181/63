Subject: oil leak

So I am restoring my westy after it was sitting for about a year.

I 've got her running great,  and almost forgot how much fun she was to drive.
But I guess sitting for a year let some of the seals dry out, and now they are
leaking.
1st - I have a leak at the base of the oil filler tube.  Its tough to get at,
any suggestions on how best to install a new gasket?  I was thinking of
applying a jack to the engine, removing the engine support which is in the
way, and then working on the gasket with the engine in.  And secondly, what
material to use since I cannot locate a new gasket anywhere.

3rd- I also have a tiny leak through one of the push rod tubes.  Can these
seals be replaced with the engine in?  and is it a job for a hack mechanic
like myself?

Thanks in advance, I always learn so much by reading this list!

Jim
