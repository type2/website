Subject: Free VW Parts Today and Tomorrow: Steve Dolan's Stash

All,

Steve Dolan's brother Jim is cleaning out Steve's part stash from his  
basement.

There's not too too much there (I've tried to list some of it below),  
but Jim emailed me yesterday afternoon and asked me to pass along the  
word: "If you want it, please come by and get it."

He's asking people to come by today or tomorrow if they want stuff.

Where: 2906 Commonwealth Ave, Alexandria, VA 22305
When: Friday 6/29, 4-7 pm  or Saturday 6/30, 12-4 pm

Here's the stuff I saw when I was helping him sort through some stuff:

- Front beam (assumed to be from a bay, could be vanagon)
- NOS locking column for a early bay.
- NOS early bay heater boxes.
- NOS (or at least "old German") type-1 engine muffler.
- Various gas heaters and components.
- Various type-4 exhaust pieces.
- What appeared to be some FI bits and pieces (not an FI guy, so I don't know)
- Lots of glass and windows.
- A used 3-rib tranny.
- 1/4 length roof rack, possibly for a beetle.
- some '67 switches
- turn signal switches for late bays

That's about all I can remember.  We set aside some early bay/splitty  
parts but nothing beyond the above was terribly notable.

There may be a type-1 engine of unknown origin or other parts  
available, but I'm not sure.

As an aside, I believe that Steve's '73 and '69 buses will probably go  
for "best offer".  Both have significant rust issues, but may be worth  
buying.  They're certainly have parts that are worthwhile, but you'd  
have to take the whole bus.  Unclear when this will happen though.   
'73 is a westy and the '69 is a euro, non-walkthrough camper with  
small pop-top.  Both run, but the '73 has intermittent FI-related  
problems last I heard.

Let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

Best,
    Tom
