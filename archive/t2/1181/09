I changed mine over to steel line .. with a very short length of nylon to 
couple it so there is some flex from the body to the engine.

been working for 20+ yrs,, and thru an engine fire that burned all the other 
lines, and the airfilter off the top of the engine.  Still on there now.

fwiw, ymmv
