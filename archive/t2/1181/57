Subject: Oil pressure meter

I bought a new VDO meter and sending unit for oil pressure, along with a
stainless steel hose to get it connected.  Anyone have an idea how to tighten
the hose into the hole in the engine?  The tin around the motor makes access
about impossible.    A crow's foot doesn't work, and funny pliers are rather
marginal.  I'd hate to leak oil all over.  thanks, ross  ( 1977-T2)
