Has nothing to do with bus sites to visit, but Hood River is sports 
mecca!  Mountain biking, hiking, camping, kitesurfing, windsurfing, 
kayaking, you name it.  I'd also check out the various falls along the 
way there from Portland - Multnomah is really nice.  Also, if you like 
museums or anything like that, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry is 
AWESOME!

enjoy!
