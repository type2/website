Bob
with a single port intake, both the #1 and #2 cyl would have been without if 
the tube is blocked.
from my experience,, only the heat riser tube gets blocked.. and it comes 
from the #2 exhaust, passes the hot air by the intake, and puts it out the 
muffler thru a port near #4 exh

without the heat riser,, you might experience carb icing .. depending on the 
climate . Here in Ontario,,we only see a few days a year where the dew point 
will cause icing..

have a closer look,,  if the tube that is blocked is smaller than the other 
2 head flanges,,, then it is a heat tube,, not an intake tube
