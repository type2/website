Subject: May need a new case

Without going into my explaining the pain of why I got into this mess ....
...I may need a new case.

Stock 1600 SOPR

What would be best source for reliability of tolerances, etc., in the opinion
of this group?

I would like a new case for my now very badly leaking 1970 Westy daily driver
whic still has original paint, never dented, and no rust.

(Always, and I mean always ..... check your end play as carefully as though
you were playing with mercury)

Gulp,

Bob Perring
