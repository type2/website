I'm having to make some assumptions such as hoping the kit provides a
pulley that runs the alternator near its max rated speed.

The forum post you pointed out has info for someone who plans to
intentionally run an alternator slower than it's max speed and load it
fully for the speed he plans to run it at. Bad idea. 

My numbers are for driving down the road with the alternator spinning
at its 85-amp speed but using only about 30 to 50 on a bad day.
