Subject: re:Real life alternator drag?

I have a motor I converted to 12V from 6V. When deciding to upgrade the 6V
generator, I figured I would go with an alternator, supposed to be more
consistent power. Not really sure.

 

I have not noticed any dip in power. But then again I don't have a ton of
gauges on my bus, and my driving varies so much that it would be hard to
tell.
