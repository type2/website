Subject: wide band read out

Hi Collective,
Can anyone recommend wide band O2 read out system? ie sensor, cable 
and digital dashboard gage?
Also thinking about a head temp gage. (Dakota Digital maybe?)

Would like to install on my bus just for S & G's. All the units I've 
looked at come with only 10 feet of cable, I would need 16 or 18 feet 
to get from the exhaust, to the front and up to the dash.

TIA
Chris
