Seems like I saw a master cylinder fail years ago where there were no 
leaks but it was not capable of generating pressure b/c fluid pressure 
was leaking past the rubber parts inside.

I too had a single circuit brake system fail coming down Signal Mtn in a 
'66 Mustang. Twice. Once down the 'W' road and once down Taft Hwy. I 
used up all of my future luck and consequently am no longer able to rely 
on luck b/c it's all gone. GRIN! The traffic parted at the right moments 
- twice. No collision. One of the drums was worn well past it's limits 
and the brake shoe moved so far out that it allowed the wheel cylinder 
for that front wheel to come apart. I was poor and a little too 
inexperienced as a shade-tree mechanic to understand the cause of my 
problems. Shoes would get hot near the bottom of the mtn and require 
more pressure from me to hold the car back and then eventually it would 
all come apart. I still dislike the memory of that wornout three speed 
manual transmission. Couldn't shift down to effectively hold the car 
back. I couldn't stop but both times I was able to limit the car's speed 
to 30-40 mph.

 From those experiences and driving Neapolitan traffic (Italy) for three 
years left me with a strong desire for good brakes and steering first, 
speed second.

I had a '49 Chevy 3100 truck too but with the stock 216 six cylinder. 
The truck would have been exciting with all that V-8 power. I loved that 
old truck. In this small town everyone seemed to have one at some point 
and wanted to talk about it if they could catch me in a parking lot.
