Subject: Re: [VB] Any must do things (VW or otherwise) around Hood

Continue east to The Dalles. Cross the river and about another 15  
miles east on Hwy 14. Maryhill Museum. You will not believe what  
you'll find there. (Ever hear of Auguste Rodin? In the Eastern  
Washington desert???? Best collection of native American baskets west  
of the Smithsonian?)
