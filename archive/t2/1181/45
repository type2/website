I used a bottle of combustion chamber cleaner liquid and poured it down the 
manifold tubes. I let it sit overnight, then went at it with the clutch 
cable end in a drill. I was able to get about 4" at a time. Then I'd pour 
more down the tube and let it sit again overnight. Did this 3-4 days in a 
row, and voila, clean as a whistle with no danger of heat etc. BUT the 
combustion cleaner is itself a bit nasty, so wear nitrile gloves etc etc.
