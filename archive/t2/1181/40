Subject: RE:1600 CC single port intake manifold feeding to #2 cylinder

I'm not sure the names of the different parts of the intake manifold. I have
had the skinnier tube on a single port manifold get clogged. It got so bad
that it actually rusted a hole through. I bought a used one-and it was
clogged too, but salvageable-and in my bus right now.

 

They can be a bit tricky to clean out-this is how I read to clean it (from
the list)-get some stranded wire, attach to drill, and stick in it the tube,
and run the drill at slow speeds, kind of poking in and out. Spraying some
carb cleaner or some type of dissolving agent in there helps. I did the work
on mine-with it detached, and on my work bench. At one point I turned it
upside down, and just sprayed a bunch of cleaner in the tube, to let it soak
over night. It took a couple days of work on it-unti I could run water
through it cleanly. Then I dried it good, with a heat gun and all-and then
painted with some high temp paint. 

 

As for the wire- you will need a bunch of it, and you need to keep using
longer lengths until you can snake all the way through.

Don't try a long length right off the bat-or it can just spin out of
control, and become a tangle mess. Also be careful with running this on a
drill.

 

I don't know what causes it, nor how to prevent it-but have heard it is
quite common.
