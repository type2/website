Subject: Re: [T2] May need a new case

Original case with about 150,000 miles on it, and two rebuilds of Mahle
cylinders and pistons, case savers, double thrust bearing configuration.

Despite my attempts to change out the seal and obtain no leaks, I fail, and
the engine gushes oil. I have tried viton seals as well as the orange guys.

This most recent tear down was to torque the neads and stop what was a bad
leak.

Now the leak is increased to beyond terrible.

I will tear down again over weekend, and look for my having beat out the
bearings with too much end play. At this point, I fear the worse, but suspect
my suspicions are correct.

Guess I could line bore, but would rather stay away from that solution
approach as I am 65 and pulling an engine will only become harder as a
function of time.

I nurse the bus, and maintain it well.
As to how I have become a victim to too much end play is beyond my grasp of
acceptance.

if you could use it; to collectors that is the magic ingredient, the original
case. Tell me where the leak is etc, or what happened, and I might have a
better answer. I have literally seen cases rebilt with epoxy that have lasted
years.
