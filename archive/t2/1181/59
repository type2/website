Subject: Buses Of The Corn - August 10,11,12. T-shirts now on sale!

Hi Volks,

Just a friendly reminder that Buses Of The Corn 2012 is fast 
approaching. This year promises to be as good as ever as the event has 
matured... this is our near-unbelieveable TWELFTH annual bus gathering 
at Heber Down Conservation Area just north of Whitby Ontario.

We have a great design for the 2012 BOTC T-shirt which can be seen here:
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/busesofthecorn/botc12-001.jpg

The shirt will be available in adult sizes both men's and ladies, and in 
kids sizes. Shirts will be available in white or black, and extra shirts 
are $15 each. Shirts not picked up at the event can be mailed out for 
$11 each, shipping the week of August 15th..

Pre-registration for this year's event is $30/bus, a bit higher this 
year thanks to a fee increase being passed along to us by the 
Conservation Authority that operates the campground. Preregistration 
includes an event shirt. Please pre-register ASAP as this option closes 
August 1st, after which the cost of shirts and registration will rise.

If you need more information, please visit the website at 
www.busesofthecorn.ca or send me an email off-list.


Happy Trails,
