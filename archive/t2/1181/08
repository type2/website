Don't spend the money on hose unless it's wire reinforced hose. Anything
that doesn't have wire reinforcement will collapse in time. I know it
happened to me. The only correct hose has been from VW Dealer at $40 per
meter. Get a one-way air check while you're at it. The dealer can still
order both, the part number for the hose is something like N 040
