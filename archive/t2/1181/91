Subject: Re: [T2] brakes

Yeah, I forgot to mention the model and I took my description out of my 
signature as I've been so quiet over the last few years.  The Bopmobile 
is a standard, Bb, 1976, Sage Green Westy with a 1.7, 009, and baby 
Dels.   Anybody have any ideas for motivation in 100+ heat?  I'll check 
the basics when I can find a little of that.  Thanks....KR
