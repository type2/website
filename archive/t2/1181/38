Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 CC single port intake manifold feeding to #2

Got it.
I understand how this manifold works now.

This tube I was worried about is a heat riser tube, not a fuel/air feed
tube,,,,,, and I am now very happy !!

For a moment, I was thinking,,, oh,oh, crud going into the combustion chamber,
and ......   OH NO !

See here, as well
