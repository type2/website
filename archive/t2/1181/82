This one?

At $7.50 I'd buy a roll of (fuel/oil resistant) gasket material and cut
about a hundred myself.

Make sure you follow the adjustment procedure for hydraulics and PLEASE
put all the bits back exactly where, and in the same orientation, they
came from. Tubes, pushrods, rocker assembly spacers and nuts, etc. They
will have acquired a "set" over the years and moving them around can
cause some oddball behavior.

Oh, and pushrod tube seams face *UP*.
