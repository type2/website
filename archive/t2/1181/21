Subject: Real life alternator drag?

Looking at converting to an alternator so I can put at least a little
charge on my (4) aux batteries when driving.

Has anyone done any real-life testing on how much power loss there is?

I'm looking at the kits available from airheadparts.com

http://www.airheadparts.com/vintage-vw-parts/alternators-generators

they don't provide the power factor figures for the alternators but
figuring 85% the ELECTRICAL HP loss (at full load) would be:

Amps x Volts = Watts (using 14.9V)
Watts / 745.7 (one HP) = Electrical HP Produced by the Alternator
HP x 15% Efficiency Loss = HP Loss
HP + HP Loss = Total HP Used

38 amp gen. == 0.87 HP

55 amp alt. == 1.26 HP
75 amp alt. == 1.72 HP
85 amp alt. == 1.95 HP

Since our alternators are fanless there is no additional drag
introduced for cooling and the rotational drag should be minimal so
those figures should be VERY close to actual HP used by the engine at
full electrical load.

The aux batteries are AGM so I'll be putting some sort of current
limiting in the charging wire running to them. Even with all the
lights, wipers, and that charging circuit active I should be pulling
less than 50 amps. I'll probably go with the 85 amp alternator though
so I can fire up the electric coffee maker with a big inverter on the
side of the road instead of pulling out the camp stove and drip pot when
between destinations while traveling.

Be nice if they listed the power factor on each of those units so I
could see if going with the 85 is actually worse than the 75 even if
not fully loaded.

Oh, the question:

Has anyone switched from the 38amp generator to an alternator and
noticed any significant change in the "seat of the pants feel" as
related to actual driving power loss? The numbers say there shouldn't
be any as the increased HP loss even for an 85amp alternator over the
38amp generator would only be 1.08 HP fully loaded.
