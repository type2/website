Don, I will check mine in the morning, I'm only the second owner, and it's
all stock with the original radio in place. I'll see if it's the one big
hole design or the seperate knob hole/middle smaller square hole design and
let you know. So far I've heard 78 and 79 being one big hole. Mine is a 77
so that might be the turning point, Who knows VW may have said "Hey, let's
do hydraulic valves AND a big one piece hole for the radio for 78" !! :-)

Ok, so I'm curious now...

 

Can somebody whose dash has NOT been cut, but is a nearly DIN sized hole,

and never had a DIN stereo in it take a pic of the edge of the metal?

 

Ideally, someone who's owned the bus from day one. I'm thinking that *if*

the dash hole is nearly DIN sized, maybe that bus was sold stereo-less and

used a blockoff? And the ones that did come with a radio had the

circle-rectangle-circle opening. Doesn't make a lot of sense but it may be a

German thing. "Zis vun haz no Blaupunkt, zo needz NO

zircle-rectangle-zircle!"
