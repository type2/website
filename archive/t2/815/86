Unfortunately, many of the specials that I find are a "get-em-while-you-can"
proposition. Unfortunately the OE supplier of the sliding side windows sold
them all, and we are being told there won't be any more.  So, barring a
change of heart on their part (unlikely in my estimate, although anything
can happen), a used set will be your only option from here on out.  The
seals, however, remain available, and probably will be for some time.
