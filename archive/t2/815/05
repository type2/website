Subject: Re: [T2] $235 Oil Pump????

I have one of these pumps on my 75. Works well but don't be thinking it's 
going to give you higher pressure than a stock pump in good condition. Also, 
be very aware that these pumps are NOT going to bolt right in without 
modification! I had to machine off some metal from the piece that mates to 
the cam.
