Another option:	
One of my buddies drives very cool, very old British cars.  He keeps 
the original radio in place, and mounts the new system in a plastic box 
under the dash,  One flip of a door and you have access to the 21st 
century.

Since most of his cars are topless (convertibles) seeing the old radio 
keeps thieves at bay.
