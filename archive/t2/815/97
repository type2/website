Subject: Re: Bus Depot baywindow sliding windows?

The best window seals I found were from Wolfsburg West. They are really good
quality, and worth the extra money.  I picked up a front windshield seal and
the complete kits for the louvered side windows. They went in like a glove
and they don't get hard and brittle in a few months like the cheapo seals.

 

Over the last six months I have ordered a LOT of stuff from several online
vendors (I am actually working on a webpage with reviews too). I can tell
you, Wolfsburg West is my favorite - always ship quick, quality product, and
I have never had to send anything back. (The worst online vendor experience
goes to jbugs.com - 6 weeks later jbugs shipped my order after I called the
credit card company)
