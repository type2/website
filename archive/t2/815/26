Subject: '72 poptop canvas

A few years ago, in another dimension, I purchased a poptop canvas from 
BusDepot, and it's been sitting in the original box in the bottom of my 
closet.  It's time to sell it, but I'm a bit puzzled by the part number, 
which doesn't seem to match any currently at BD.  I just can't recall 
now what "flavor" it was - I paid $225.  P/N 231-702-207 color gold. 
Can anyone give me any info on which "flavor" it is so I can accurately 
represent it for sale?

Thanks,

T
