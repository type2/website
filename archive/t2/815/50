I hung the rear of the Sony CD/MP3/radio unit from the stock radio 
speaker grill holes on top of the dash, using a small bolt.  Can't 
remember if I had to use hardware pipe hanger strapping (it has holes 
all along it).  Easier to use a wing nut held underneath as you hold the 
bolthead above.

  One thing, tried to mount the rear support for the unit onto the rear
  of the ashtray.  Spent hours getting it to fit & then found that it  was
  a real pain to remove/refit the unit so left it off.  Haven't had  any
  trouble in 12,000 km.
