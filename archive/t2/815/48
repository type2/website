Ditto  with Jim on the TMI for the buses.  I had to have the bow hangers 
on mine reworked before it would fit correctly.

*And* the original bow hangers were made out of a cloth that looked and 
felt like a handkerchef....I didn't figure it would last more than a 
couple of years.

You can see it here.
