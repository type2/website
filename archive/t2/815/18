I agree Mike, just sent an email off to cip to see what they can do. You
know I've always loved 5 spokes. Comes from my old days of having Cragar SS
mags on my American Iron.

I've noticed those 5x112 5 spokes as well in Volksworld. They also sell gas

burners and fuchs in the 5x112 pattern over there as well. Would be nice to

just bolt on a set of wheels. I find bay windows stop awsome with stock

brakes in good condition so bolt on wheels are great. Only option I see

over here are 5x112mm BRM's that CIP sells.
