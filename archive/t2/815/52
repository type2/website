Courtney asked:


 Hey folks, now that I've gotten that question answered, I'd like to ask
about speaker placement. In my earlier Westies that weren't in such nice
shape, I'd just hacked the door panels and put in small round speakers in
the footwell area. This Westie is much too nice to cut up, so I'm wondering if anyone has gotten creative with
speakers without ruining the body? Any thoughts on where they could go?

I despise holes cut in door panels....... makes them hard to resell!
[everyone looking for door panels wants them without speaker holes]

I put the speakers in the lower kick panels. They don't get wet there, like they do in doors.  A shallow 6"
round speaker fits nice on each side.
In the rear, you can use the hanging Vanagon rear speakers [if you have to have rears] but they are a little
tinny sounding. In Dave Bolens headliner link earlier, I believe pic 010 showed them in his Champagne Edition.
[I noticed in pic 011 he was missing the front headrests.......]
