Subject: Re: [T2] Main Wiring Harness

Hi Todd -
 There are some areas where the harness is radically different:
 1. 72 Alternator Wiring. Doesn't exist on the 70/71, which is wired for the
Generator Model. An experienced Autoelectrician *could* "jerry-rig" that
portion to make it work on the Alternator.
 2. Rear Tail/Stop/Turn Signal Wiring. Here is where this will most likely
be the "deal-buster". Stop and Turn Signal Circuits on the 72 are separate
wires, the 70/71 is a single wire due to the design of the Turn
Signal/Emergency Flasher system. Wires will have to be added (if possible)
to correct this for the 72, which could be a real b*tch. If I had to do it,
I would prefer to use the correct color coding on the wires.
 3. Alhtough this may not matter, there is a different fusebox/relay plate
for each year Type 2 - 70, 71, 72, 73-79. I know the 70/71 harness works
with either year of fusebox. Dunno how well it will work on the 72 model
and/or if modifications will need to be made.
 IMHO, yer setting yerself up for some work if you use the 70/71 harness.
Contact Bob at Wiring Works in San Pedro, CA (-at-) 310-519-8147. He's the one
who makes these harnesses - he *may* have a correct one still laying around
in the shop. Fits 1972 ONLY.
