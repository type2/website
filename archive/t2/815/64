Hi Courtney,

Recently I replaced my kick panels and relocated the 6" front  
speakers at the same time. I moved the speakers up onto the parcel  
trays and built small boxes for them that are angled slightly  
upwards. I could have put them into the new kick panels but I figured  
that since my ears are in my head and not my shins that I'd hear them  
better if they were positioned higher.

There are two blurry-but-viewable pics here:

The rear of my bus has two 6x9's in the traditional Z-bed base  
position... I find that these don't do so well when the bus is fully  
loaded. On advice from Jamie Rivers I installed two 4x9 speakers into  
the rear hatch hinge covers and upholstered the cover to match the  
curtains. These do a great job of providing sound for passengers in  
the back seat and also sound good when relaxing in the Z-bed.


Happy trails,
