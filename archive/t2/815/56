Check links below to Nyssa's website or Email me privately and I can
send pics of the install in 75 bus putting the speakers in a better
acoustical position just outboard of the front heat vents, using the
kick panels, that I beefed up with masonite around the speakers.  The
washer tank was flattened and put in the right corner.
    I have also put the speakers where Karl suggested, in the corners of
the kick panels, but then they tend to get blocked with stuff one may
throw in the front.
This link to daughter's 75 bus shows where the speakers are; also the
woofer box/table between the front seats.
