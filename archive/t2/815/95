Ok I promise I'm going to get a Bently to cover my Bay suspension.  Is there
alway a shim that goes between the pad and caliber piston?  Just took apart
my spare calibers and it didn't have one.  These on the Bus have a shim in
between on both sides.  Can't take it apart yet until my hand heels
completely, had surgery 4 weeks ago,

Thanks for all the help from everyone.
