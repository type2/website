I'm not familiar with a 221-845-231B and it does not come up on any of my
files.  The microfiche once (before VW obsoleted them) listed 221 845 321A
seal for the side windows, and that is the number that we use. Since actual
VW seals are not available, we ship an aftermarket seal from Just Kampers in
England, and that is probably what you received if you ordered 221 845 321A.
(Their stock number for this seal may differ.) It fits either single-piece
or sliding windows (but not windows with vent wings or louvers). We've been
selling this seal for years; the fit and quality are superior to most of the
Brazilian and other aftermarket seals that I've tried.
