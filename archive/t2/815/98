As far as Underdash Parcel Trays, there are choices....
 For the past 13 years Bus Boys has manufactured an almost exact repro of
the original Dealer Accessory Tray. Go to this link:

 The photo was provided by me in 1993 taken from the Dealer Accessory Book.
Yeah, a bit pricey at $195, but looks so kewel and original.
 If you're into Bamboo Repro ($109) of a similar vein, check out:

 or if in Vinyl ($159):

 Unfortunately, they don't have photos yet uploaded, but these are really
nice and fit very well, even though they're made in the Far East.
