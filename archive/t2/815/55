Oh yeh, I forgot to mention if you don't want to cut up your kick 
panels, find peely/crappy ones and sprayglue a nifty fabric to them, or 
cut your own from THIN plywood paneling or masonite.  The purple looking 
pattern on Nyssa's bus is sprayglued fabric, as was done over the bottom 
of the rear bedseat.
