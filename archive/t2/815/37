Subject: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows??

I`ve had 2 stereo systems in my `78 bus, and didn`t
have to do any modifications to make them fit.  I
suspect earlier bay`s didn`t have the plain
rectangular opening, but instead akin to 60`s and 70's
GM, Ford, et cetera...had instead small rectangular
holes with 2 outboard holes for the knobs.
  
(Why 2 Stereo's?  The first one was stolen.)
