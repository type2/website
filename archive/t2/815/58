One question I had for the CD player ,,, can it play CD's on the angle it is
mounted on..??
All the ones I looked at stated the player must be level...
Clarion was the only one that showed a 30 deg angle allowed..  so that was as
far as I went on the research... as I got a Clarion as a gift a few days later.

I installed the speakers in the dash. I spent a few minutes with graph paper and
copied the stock hole pattern from the speaker in the center of the dash.. then
transfered that pattern to the side where my new speakers fit.
The rear speakers fit in the hinge/spring cover... so I installed them, and
covered them with material.
