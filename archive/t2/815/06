I don't think you will get the later bar to adapt as the engine
attachment is totally different. Theoretically you don't want to run
without it due to damage to the upper tranny bearer, but as a
practical matter, I ran my 72 with broken motor mounts for quite some
time before I got around to pulling the motor for repair with no
apparent damage.

 Can I use a stock late bay engine carrier bar to mount the 1600cc engine
 or do I need to get the '68-'71 bar? Can the later one be modified to
 fit? What do I need to make this happen?

 Is this carrier bar completely necessary? The bus isn't going to see
 much action with this setup... Probably no road time at all... just need
 to be able to move it around the driveway.
