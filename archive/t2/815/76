Subject: Parcel Tray

Hey guys, I seem to remember seeing somewhere, that some VW Bus store had what they called a "Parcel Tray" for sale. This tray would attach to the roof of the Bus, just above the sun visors... either that, or I'm getting confused and it went JUST under the dash.


Does anyone know what I'm talking about? And if so, can you tell me where it's sold?



Thanks!

Todd
