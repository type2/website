68 to 79 all have the rectangular hole.
#18 is the radio blockoff cover, #19 is the retainer plate that holds it in:

The cover is part # 211 857 233, the retainer is 211 857 237

66 buses were the last of the small rectangular hole and two round shaft holes.
67 was the 1st year of the rectangular hole, but it is not the same size as the 68-79 hole.
