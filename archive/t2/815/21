Hi Jenny,


Sounds to me like it be a couple of different things.  First off does this 
motor run?  If so does it make that noise when its warmed up?  If it does 
run, try warming it up to operating temps then crank it and listen for the 
noise.  If it goes away when warm, its most likely leaking between the top 
of the cylender and the head, quite common on any aicooled, especially the 
type 4.  If thats not it, make sure nothing is in the fan, or that the fan 
itself isnt rubbing on anything. Also make sure your belt isnt slipping, 
possibly a alternator on its way out, its a long shot but you never know? 
Good luck
Mike
