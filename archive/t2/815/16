Subject: Empi style 5 spokes for the Bays??

Has anyone seen Empis for sale on this side of the Atlantic like these ones
for sale in Britain? I would love to put these on my bay when the bodywork
is done.

Go about half way down the page and you'll see the mag there. Looks like a
regular wide 5 mag, with the holes cut at the correct place for 112mm .
