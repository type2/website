Subject: Re: [T2] Disc Brake Drag

From Dave:

I've checked the archives and found the question to have been ask before but no real answers, other than one
about the booster.  With new disc put on a Bay front-end (79) how much drag should there be on the wheels?  I
can turn them by hand and no high spot felt, but they will not free spin.  I've checked and verified the rod
adjustment.  The calipers are real tight sliding over the disc.

New discs AND new pads?

Drive it for 10 miles and see what happens. More than likely, they will loosen up with a little more clearance
at the pads.
