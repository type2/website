Subject: Re: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows??

I went to the stereo store here in Kingston, ON - last year - picked out a 
nice Pioneer mp3/cd player and some nice Infinities - I made it 100 % clear 
to the sales guy - Will this fit in my dash - Yes he said - are you 100% 
sure you will not have to cut anything - Yes he said - and he said - lets go 
talk to the installer to make sure - OK says I - So I said to the 
installer - are you 100% sure you will not have to cut my dash - Yes he 
said - 100% - OK says I - I'll take it and you can install it now.

So .... I leave my bus ... got for a walk .. come back to the sound of the 
grinder cutting the shi*t out of my dash - hey says I - you told me you 
wouldn't have to cut it ... sorry - we are just about done.

At least you can't see anything.
