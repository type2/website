Ah, ok we're talking headliners here. I have never installed a headliner, I
was talking seat kits. The TMI seatkit I installed was excellent. I have NO
experience with headliners, so would have to bow to Richard and OldVolks for
experience there.

I've gotta side with Richard one this one, at least at far as Type 2

Headliners go. But OTOH, I will go with Courtney on the Beetle Headliners.

After 35+ years installing headliners in a 50 Bug (Taupe Cloth), 63 Bug

Sedan, 67 Bus 21 Wdw Dlx, 64 Notchback, 69 Camper Bus (Front Section only),

73 Bus and a 68 Bug my opinion is:

1. Acme does the best job for the Cloth Headliners for the early Bug

Sedans, bar none.

2. Both Acme & TMI have always made an excellent quality and fitting Vinyl

Headliner for the Bug Sedan. Acme did a *fantastic* job for my Ex-Notch as

well. I've no problems with a TMI on my Ex-68 Bug recently, fit great.

3. Acme makes the best quality and fitting headlinder for the Bus and

Pickup Models, hands-down, heck they've been producing them for over 40

years. I've yet to get a TMI headlinder fit worth a dang in a Type 2, no

matter what year, they still have a long way to go in fixing their design(s)

and cut(s) for proper fitment. Acme does cost a few bucks more than the TMI,

but here's a situation where I think you get yer money's worth - ya get what

ya pay for.

4. I have never used a Sewfine *BUT* in talking with several people over

the years who have, I get nothing but high marks for their cut finish and

excellent fitting on Bugs and Buses

For all the hassle there is installing a headliner, I won't go cheep,

'cause I want it right the first time!

Of couse Acme and TMI are manufacturers wholesaling to shops only, so ya

gotta check around and see who carries what. I think California Pacific

carries Acme brand, possibly even Bus Depot as well carries (or can get

Acme). The first time I used Acme headliners was around 1968 or so in my

Ex-50 Bug.

YMMV
