Karl,

Trust me, the headrests  are absolutely there now!

I guess I need to take some newer pics...oh, I did...for the A/C pics

here they are...

Oh, and number 8 shows one of the vanagon speakers installed....yes, they 
are a little tinny....need a subwoofer!...LOL!

And I have the 6" or so round speakers mounted in the lower door panels.

What I really wanted to do was mount some of those really fancy small 
speakers in the headrests like some of the way high end cars have...but 
just couldn't bring myself to cut up the original headrests.

Cheers, dave
