Mine was cut when I got it. Poorly, I might add. The edges look like a saw

My stereo fit fine until some wonderful people broke into my bus and tried
to steal it. They thought it had a detachable faceplate and so ripped the
face off. But mine wasn't supposed to come off. And when this stereo was in
the Volvo (where it started life), the same exact thing happened.

So here's what it looks like now...
