Subject: VDO LED/Digital Fuel Guage for Sale

Hey guys,

	I hope it's ok to sell items on here, if not, I appologize. I have a
Digital / LED VDO fuel gauge that came with my Bus. It was installed before
I got it, but from the looks of it, was never actually hooked up. Does
anyone have any use for it? I'm asking $20 dollars for it plus shipping
(probably less than $8). The $20 bucks will go towards my new tailights
fund! :)


Thanks,
