well you will need to swap the flywheel for the flexplate, and have to
reset the endplay on the engine...not very hard.

you will also need to swap out the vacuum line and tap into the carb
system to control the shifter...

the accelerator linkage is different so that will need to be adjusted. and
possibly swapped

hmmmm can't think of anything else off the top of my head, you will have
to use a number of parts from the 73 on your engine but since you have it
that shouldn't be a problem
