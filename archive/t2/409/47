Doing the work yourself tells you exactly what you have and allows
you to see first hand many components that most vehicle owners are
oblivious to but certainly need to be aware of, particularly with
older vehicles.

The decision really is based on funds and capability.  While it is
always advantageous to do your own work, it is not always possible
to do so.  If you are new to doing this type of thing, the cost of
parts, the knowledge of what parts you will need, and the cost and
knowledge of tools are all things to take into consideration.

Purchasing a rebuilt is much more convenient, but as other listees
have stated, you have no idea what the quality of the parts were
that were utilized in the rebuild of that engine.

My opinion?  if time and labor are not your thing, buy a rebuilt
with a WARRANTY.  No warranty? prolly not worth it.

  If it was me I would try to rebuild it myself, because  good
mechanics are hard to find, and lets face it, good VW mechanics are
getting more and more scarce, so it is probably wisest to learn to
do your own work.  On the plus side of things, once you eat the cost
of buying your own tools for specific types of jobs, you will have
them for the next time that you may need to dive in there and repair
or replace something.  There's my two cents worth.
