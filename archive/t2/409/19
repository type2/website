Subject: Re: [T2] oil filler tube  grommet

i used a radiator hose spliced and cut to hold on in between the oil 
filler tube and the tin....
seems to work pretty good and snug...
i then slide the oil filler top piece onto the tubeing top and it slides
 down into the radiator hose snugly and like a gasket kinda...
peace
