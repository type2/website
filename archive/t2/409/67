Subject: Aux. battery relay

Hey all,

I'm having a problem with my relay for the aux. battery. I purchased the relay
kit from Bus Depot. Its a Hella relay with a 15amp fuse that plugs into the
side. This fuse keeps blowing. It is fine while the engine is at idle but when
I drive the with higher RPM the fuse will blow. This is with nothing else
running (headlights, fridge etc.) I have checked the output at the coil and
verified that it is at 13.9v when engine is revved like it should be so I
think the regulator is doing its job. It's just a simple circuit and I can't
figure this out. The only thing wired to the aux. battery is the fridge. Could
I have a bad relay? I have it hooked up like this:

pin 85-ground to body
     86-positive post of coil for powering/switching the relay
     30-positive on starter battery
     87-positive on aux. battery

Thanks for any suggestions.
