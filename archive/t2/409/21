Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing clutch, tranny - and flywheel?

Just go get a dial indicator and a magnet base, or something similar.  I
think the dial indicator should run you about 5 bux and the base maybe
15 or so.  Then attach the mount to the case and then put the indicator
on the flywheel and measure away.
