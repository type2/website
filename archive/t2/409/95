Hiya Christopher,

Here are a couple of ideas you might want to check out...........

When I need matching paint for any of my cars I trip on down to my local 
NAPA.  They have a paint match system and if the guy who's using it is any good, 
you'll get a terrific product.  Yes, they can put your color into rattlecans 
also.  Cost the last time I went this way was $45 for three rattlecans.  By the 
way, perfect match!

No NAPA?  You might want to go online and point your browser to 
www.paintscratch.com
Basically the same service as offered above, although a bit spendier.  IIRC 
the cost for 1 can of spray was $25.

Happy coloring

Mike
