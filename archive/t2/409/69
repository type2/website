Subject: Re: [T2] re replacing fuel lines, finally...

"I decided to eliminate the steel pipe altogether, and replace it with 
German 5mm fuel hose, one piece from one end to the other.  I put a new 
rubber grommet in the firewall, the hose fits perfectly through it."

Has anyone used a double-ended brass fuel fitting attatched to the firewall? 
  I vaguely recall someone on the list mentioning they had done this very 
thing.  Threaded it to the firewall and attatched rubber hose to both sides. 
  Sounds safer than running anything through the firewall, EPSECIALLY rubber 
hose.  Even the nylon braid would wear down from the friction passing 
through the rubber grommet, don't you think?  If someone out there has 
changed their fuel route the way I've mentioned, and has pics, could they 
p-mail them to me?  I'd like to see the results.  Thanks!
