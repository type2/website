Folks,

I've sent $75 to Ted tonight and I hope some of you will match it.

It costs a little over five dollars a day to keep type2.com/vintagebus.com
running. We use a tremendous amount of bandwidth but our costs have not
increased in several years because we have some people on the admin side who
are very clued and get us an excellent deal with a responsive ISP.

Two years ago we asked you to pay for a new server: it's still running great
and I don't remember the last time we've had a minute of downtime (and we
haven't had a real fundraiser since then either).

We do need to pay for the bandwidth, though, and the trickle of 'good
Samaritan' donations from listees has been slowing. Our balance has been
heading toward the floor at an alarming rate. Please send anything you can.
Five dollars is perfectly fine. Anything is fine.

The thing is to put it in an envelope and put a stamp on it and SEND IT.
It's not hard to get people to donate but it's very hard to get you to
remember to actually SEND IT, preferably right now! Get up from the computer
and go find a stamp.

Thx,

--Hoop
