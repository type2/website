Subject: re replacing fuel lines, finally...

Today I finally got around to replacing my fuel hose, from the tank to the
fuel pump. I've read many, many warnings and planned to do the Hoover trick,
with the lamp tube going through the firewall tin. My grommet was long gone
and the steel line rattled around in there. I drained my gas tank, and removed
the screen, which was perfect. I removed the steel pipe from the bus to have a
good look at it.
Gaack!! They weren't kidding, it had hacksaw like cuts on both sides, about
half the way through! Also, there were flat spots worn and shiny spots all
over the place.
 I decided to eliminate the steel pipe altogether, and replace it with German
5mm fuel hose, one piece from one end to the other.  I put a new rubber
grommet in the firewall, the hose fits perfectly through it.

My brand new fuel tank screen wouldn't fit into the tank, *&$%&*%^!   This
aftermarket scrap is really pathetic sometimes.  My original one cleaned up
really nice and went back in perfectly. For now, I am not running a fuel
filter, although I will put one in between the firewall and the tank when I
drop the engine next. I've been running for a year with no filter and no
problems yet.

I'm glad I finally got around to this job. Highly recommended as always.
