Subject: chrome yellow paint?

Does Krylon or anyone else make a spray chrome yellow paint?

I found it listed one place, but there was no option to purchase, only a 
list
of colors they have offered at some point and time.

Any of you chrome yellow bus owners out there ever come across a spray 
option for
chrome yellow? or something close enough to do the wheels where it would 
match?

I heard that school busses are technically chrome yellow also, but when I 
saw a little
swatch for 'school bus yellow' by krylon online, it didnt look anything like 
Chrome yellow.

it should be noted that im pretty color blind, but it doesnt look like what 
I know as chrome
yellow. =)

thanks for any tips or leads, or general humor/tomfoolery.
