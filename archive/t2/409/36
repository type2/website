Subject: Fuel Pump Going Bad ?

Can anybody give me a list of the type of symptoms I could expect from a
fuel pump going bad - 75 EFI syst- experiencing a real nasty case of the
herky-jerky driving
Ignition is good - lots or spark - comp is good - fuel delivery seems like
the logical next step - sometimes it's smooth other times bucking and
jerking - when accelerating and while driving - then the problem goes
Sometimes idles rock solid then all over the place to the point of
stalling - always starts again but usually requires the gas pedal to start
and stay running
I don't have or know anyone with the fuel pressure tester but I wonder if
these symptoms I am experiencing are a tell tale sign of a breaking down
pump.

Thanks
