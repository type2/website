For the 70amp you want the 30051.
Bosch # 0 190 601 006

  Hello,

  I have a couple of questions regarding voltage
  regulators. What is the part# for the voltage
  regulator used with the 70amp alternators that VW
  installed in some buses? Busdepot gives 2 part numbers
  for bus regulators. They are:

  30051

  30048-supressed
