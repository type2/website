I usually attribute jerking to a clogged filter. A bad fuel pump is usually
good in 1st and 2nd gear, then there is a noticeable loss of power of
jerking in the higher gears.

You can put you ear near the pump...do you hear any grinding noises? It
should make a nice quiet hum when it's working properly.
