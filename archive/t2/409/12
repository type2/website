And this Allstate came in blue, green, black, and white--only--and was
actually a Henry J in disguise with color matched houndstooth
interior--neat car--

They were quite larger than the Metro's and the Crosleys too--

Back then Ya just didn't see too many VW's around here---only the weird
and strange had them---

Look who's talking--weird and strange---:>)

Well, I actually don't 'remember' any of this, just a big auto history
and trivia fan...But in the 40's and into the 50's cars themselves were
still in short supply...Everybody got into the act...Even Sears-Roebuck.
Remember the 'Allstate'...Came with all Sears products - battery, tires,
etc. And a 90 day warranty...Step right up to the catalog counter... And
it was really cheesy; made a Metropolitan look luxo... 
But then again my first ever VW came with one sunvisor and no fuel
gauge, just a little mechanical 'counter' to help remember the mileage
for when it was time to start lookin' for a gas station (and that handle
in the footwell for when you didn't...)
