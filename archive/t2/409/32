Subject: Pop rivet help

I'm going to need to re-secure my front turn signals. The workshop manual
says use N 016 215 1 pop rivet (3.2mm x 9.3mm) but it's NLA. ETKA says use N
016 217 1 (3.2mm x 12.2mm) which is still available.

Question: can I find a pop rivet like this at the hardware store? Did anyone
get them from the dealer?
