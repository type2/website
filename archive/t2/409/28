Subject: Re: [T2] Gen light on??

Thanks for all the replies.. It seems the light to the dash was wired to the
ground.. So now that works... :)  Everything electrical is now working and
not blowing fuses except the turn signals, emergency flashers and
unfortunately the brake lights.. As soon as I can figure out the brake
lights.. I'll use hand signals for turn signals.

I really appreciate everyone's help...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
