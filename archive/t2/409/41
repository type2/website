Subject: Couple of Random Questions

Hey guys,

	I've got a whole bunch of questions that I figured I'd just ask in
one large e-mail.

1) For optimal engine life.. on a VDO cyl head temperature guage, what is
the normal operating temperature at the #3 cyl?

2) If I have a cyl head temperature guage, should I still have an oil
temperature guage?

3) What is the easiest way to make SURE that my "Generator" light is really
working? My Bus hasn't run out of power, but how do I know that it won't?

4) What should the spark plug gap be set to?

5) Is the speedometer in my Bus the same speedometer they installed in the
early 70s Porsches? They look a heck of a lot alike?

6) How can I convince my fiancee that 401K retirement accounts are
important, and that we should be saving and not buying tons and tons of new
furniture.


Thanks!
