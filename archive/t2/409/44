Subject: Lash Caps

So I'm working on rebuilding my engine and someone suggested to me to use
Lash Caps. Now while I'm pretty handy with cars, I've never had to use
these. I understand they fit in the rocker to 'harden' up the surface
hitting the valve, but what else to they do? Any comments on whether I
really do need to use these or what?

Thanks
