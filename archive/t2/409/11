They were cutting car tires in the 40's and early 50's--no
rubber-remember??

Boy--the cords were showing big time back then--and nobody cared---just
as long as they got where they were going--

Speed and load rating?

Well, I actually don't 'remember' any of this, just a big auto history
and trivia fan...But in the 40's and into the 50's cars themselves 
were still in short supply...Everybody got into the act...Even Sears-Roebuck.
Remember the 'Allstate'...Came with all Sears products - battery, tires, etc.
And a 90 day warranty...Step right up to the catalog counter...
And it was really cheesy; made a Metropolitan look luxo...

But then again my first ever VW came with one sunvisor and no fuel
gauge, just a little mechanical 'counter' to help remember the mileage
for when it was time to start lookin' for a gas station (and that handle
in the footwell for when you didn't...)
