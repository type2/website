Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump Going Bad ?

not that it might be but have you checked for any vaccum leaks and done any kind of pressure testing yet?
these are some of the problems i am haveing at the moment...
jerking and such ...
i start out pretty good and then she starts jerking and bucking like she is goigto either cut off or give me whip lash first LOL.
i had soemone run a pressure test for me and this was the result...

bad brake booster,master cylinder,a dn they had installed a diffrent dizy than was suppose to be in the bus engine.. it needed a single vaccum dizzy...
i have all the new parts now except the brake bosster which will be here tomorrow i am hopeing.. also hopeing this will stop my jerking and bucking plugging all the vaccum leaks up?

mine acts like she isnt getting gas also sometime because of these thigs not to say that this is what is wrong with your bus but to say that it might not be the fuel pump as expected but then again could be?

hope this helps .
peace
