Since summer is here and some of you are facing installing an AC system on
your VW, or fixing up an old one, I thought I would add a little more info
on alternative refrigerants replacements for R 12.

I know some of you are not wanting to deal with any "compound" replacements
and I do not want to start a war, but I would like to add a few things.

First off ALL refrigerants are flammable when mixed with oil (which they are
In the system), even R12 or 134A.

Second, these compound alternative refrigerants can replace R12 with no
changes in the system or oil, making the R12 system a much better choice for
our old VW's.  In contrast to 134A systems, R12 systems have smaller
condensers (easier to "hide"), compressors take less engine power to run and
evaporators don't need to be as large.

**** If you try to convert an old R12 system to 134A, you need to change the
expansion valve, compressor (because 134A uses higher pressures and
compressors are preset), install barrier hoses and add more condenser
capacity. 

Third, these compounds are much less expensive ($7 per pound for R406A as
compared with up to $40 for R12, a large system such as a bus can take up to
4-6 pounds).

And fourth, the R406A has been approved by the EPA for use.

This is very important, be VERY careful in which alternative refrigerant you
choose, some do not mix well with oil and therefore will shorten the life of
your compressor.  For more information on oil mixing, go to:

I chose to go with Auto Frost R406A for my old VW's.
