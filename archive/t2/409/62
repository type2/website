Subject: Pilot bearing grease seal

I am replacing the clutch on my 87 Vanagon.  The pilot bearing was 
trash.  It was causing all the problems but the clutch was close to 
gone also.

My question: Is the pilot bearing grease seal important.  No one 
seems to stock it locally.  I don't want to wait three to four weeks 
for Bus Depot to send me a 30 cent seal.  021 105 311

I'm on the digest so email me suggestions directly ssblackham(-at-)mail.bigzoo.net


Thanks,
