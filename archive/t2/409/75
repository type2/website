Subject: RE: [T2] propane tank valve, replace myself?

I would probably do it myself, but:

1) Find out what is the right thread sealant. Regular teflon tape may be the
answer ($0.39 at Home Despot).
2) The valve is probably reverse-threaded (lefty-tighty, righty-loosey)
3) Don't over-torque the valve.

The advantage to having professionals do it is that they will inspect the
inside of the tank for corrosion and maybe hydro it to verify structural
integrity.
