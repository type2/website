Subject: Greetings,(New listee) W/ no spark brain teaser!!!

Hello All, 
As you've notice I'm new to the list, I just bought a
'70 Station Wagon Bus a week ago.(my first bus=;0)
its all original except the motor, obviously a rebuild
because it has a mexican case.
History:
The bus sat idle for 7-8 yrs.
Supposedly it overheated. The boots on the wires were
fried, so were the tops of some plugs.

What I've replaced:
plugs, wires, points, battery, fuel filter.

What I've adjusted,etc:
cylinders were loose, torqued them to 23 ft lbs.
adjusted the valves, took apart and cleaned the
varnished pict 31

Whats the problem:
I have fuel, and compression now.
and before I made all my adjustments I HAD SPARK!!
Now I dont have spark anymore and I cant figure out
whats going on. I've rechecked all wires to make sure
i didnt bump anything loose.
the coil simply isn't producing spark, i tried a new
coil, nothing. then i ran a positive lead directly to
the coil and tried cranking it, still nothing.
What gives??
Could this be an ignition switch problem at front of
bus??
I have noticed PO tinkered and replaced ignition, and
after me trying to start the motor like a 100 times I
want to believe it took a toll on the replaced ign.
switch.
I inspected the switch and it fell apart before I
could remove it. Could this be the culprit?
is there a way to test start the car without the ign.
switch? and at the same time run spark to the coil?

peace,
rob
