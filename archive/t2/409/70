I went Hoover one better.  My solution requires a trip to the electrical 
supply house and enlarging the hole in the tin to 7/8" dia.

Visit the supply house and purchase a "cord grip."  Open hole.  Install 
and tighten grip.  Push pipe through grip. Tighten grip.

Cord grips are available in Nylon, aluminum, zinc and steel.  Here's a 
nylon one.
