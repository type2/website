While on the subject fo liquid thread replacement, does anyone know if
they still sell that worn ball joint tightener that was squirted into
the gap between ball and socket and set to a self lubricating layer that
reduced play to zero? Back in the 70's it was called Liqui-Seal or such?
Can't believe there is something like that out there. NO WAY - not me!!!
You're joking - right?
Seriously - if you're not joking - you really need to just replace any
faulty brake, steering, or suspension part.
When those fail you get killed or worse - I get killed because you made
a poor decision.
If a ball join fails you loose steering - bad. You loose suspension and
traction - really bad too.
I imagine a Westy doing a barrel roll at 65 mph like one I heard of
recently in Tazwell, TN - it failed the moose test.
Would be interesting to know if crummy tires contributed to the
accident.
