Subject: 81 Vanagon Air Flow Meter

I had the case of the "random" herky jerky and the feeling of trying to
drive in 3rd while only in 1st (like the engine wasn't getting enough
fuel...really anytime I wasn't giving it gas). Replaced the airflow meter
and the "random" bigger herky jerkys have gone away but the other problem
hasn't. Could it be a faulty airflow meter? What do suspect the problem is?

Thanks.
