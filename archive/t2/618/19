Subject: Re: [T2] Physics of towing

One last thing to consider is this: wear and tear. 1 engine rebuild, is going to cost alot more than any fuel you might save by towing a car... CV joints (thinking of Beetle's CVs popping and cracking climbing Signal Mountain towing that Hyundai...) are more expensive than fuel at least for a few hundred miles...
