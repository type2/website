Here's my feedback - I don't particularly like the Pagid pads.  What's 
that?  Heresy you say?  Well I don't care.  I ponied up doublt the bucks 
recently for the Pagid pads and shoes, new brake hoses and a new rotor to 
boot.  Now I have always had a slight problem with the front brake pads 
squealing.  Not all the time, and not very loud, but it was there.  I 
chalked it up to the cheap FLAPS pads I was using.  When I pulled the cheap 
pads out, they looked nearly new.  Aha!  Cheap, hard compound, that's why 
they squeaked, right?  And wore like iron?  Surely these new, OEM Pagid 
pads have a softer, quieter compound.  Well after installing everything and 
braking it in (ha ha) the front brakes squeaked WORSE than 
before!  WTF?  And they don't seem to stop any better than the old pads did 
(well, to be fair they both stopped the bus fine).  I took everything back 
apart again and couldn't find anything wrong.  The Pagid pads have a 
coating on the back (presumably to eliminate squeaking!) which was worn 
through in one spot so I got out the ancient bottle of anti-squeak crap and 
applied it liberally to the back of the pads.  Better, but they STILL 
squeak.  I've given up - my bus will just *sound* like the junker that 
people assume it is anyway.  I've moved on to more important things.

I guess my point is that if you're expecting great things from the Pagid 
pads, my experience suggests that you not get your hopes up.
