Subject: I'm starting to get it!

Hi All (especially those in the minority here who may not know how to fix 
their cars) -

I forgot to mention what I did to learn about how to work on the bus.  
Ready?  I went to Powell's Books and got a couple of children's books - with 
great illustrations and photos - on how cars work!  I was CLUELESS before 
and even after reading only a few pages, I know more now than I ever thought 
I'd know!  It might be sad & pitiful but whatever works, right?!  I figured 
there wasn't any point in learning about a VW engine in particular when I 
don't understand the mechanics of any engine whatsoever.  OK so now y'all 
might think I'm an idiot (not fit for the Idiot's Guide - which I do have 
and recently started reading as well), but just keep in mind I'm smart and 
talented when it comes to OTHER matters! :-)

-Marya
