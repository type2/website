My '76 passed with flying colors last time (and that was before the 
engine rebuild), but I'm hoping that a CDI will reduce emissions even 
more.

For me, the annoyance for my next smog check (unless the Governator 
doesn't sign the bill) is going to be the filler neck restrictor.  My 
old filler neck was cracked and dropping chunks of rubber into my fuel 
tank (clogging the outlet), and the new filler neck is restrictor-less 
because the bird-beak variety is NLA.

I would love to find one of those metal restrictor plates, but that's 
hard since no one seems to know the part number :-/
