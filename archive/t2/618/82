Subject: Re: [T2] Jay Leno fights California smog revision

When the parts aren't available, waivers are issued that solve the 
problem. Even so, the EGR valves can be rebuilt. Airpumps can be 
eliminated by installing a later-generation smog system.

Really, the toughest thing about passing smog every two years is the 
price of the EGR filter, and the hideous quality of this part.

If the revision passes, I would feel little guilt from installing the 
EGR system to pass the test, then disconnecting it and storing it for 
two years. But if you quote me, I'll deny, deny, deny.
