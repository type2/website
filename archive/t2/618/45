Subject: 73 Sunroof bus

Hi List!

I spent quite a bit of time over the weekend trying to get my (factory 
steel) sunroof working properly.  I have got it so it opens and closes 
smoothy, but I can't seem to get it to align flat with the roof when 
"closed".  When closed as far as it will go (two blocked to the front), 
it sits at a bit of an angle (down at the rear), and there is about a 
1/2 inch gap at the rear.  It seems like it just needs to be adjusted 
in some way.  Does anybody know how?
