Subject: Re: [T2] Rusty Front Brakes?

Was at a car wash in FLA once long ago changing my Moostang carb. It was hot, the car wash was far from busy and there was shade under there. Besides, it only took 20 minutes or so and if I was unlucky and somebody wanted into that bay, I could push it out. Looked like I had a wet engine and was trying to get the engine started. 

ANYHOW... Fellow came up to me and asked if I knew alot about cars... I said, yeah I can do most any fix needed. He said he had squeaky brakes and what should he do? I told him they might just be worn out or maybe he needed to get some of the brake pad to caliper grease at the FLAPS. He said he wasn't sure how to take it apart, yada, yada, yada but until he could get it fixed he would continue to put WD-40 on the rotors. With that he turned and walked back over to his car and gave them another wash of WD-40... I was speechless which doesn't happen often.
