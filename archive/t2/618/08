Most of the energy the engine produces is consumed in pushing air aside.
When towing, the air only has to be pushed aside once.  When driving
separately, the air has to be pushed aside twice.

An engine requires a certain amount of energy to simply keep itself
turning.  Two engines would require twice the amount of energy to spin as
one.

For both of these reasons, it is usually more economical to tow one car
with another than it is to drive both cars separately.
