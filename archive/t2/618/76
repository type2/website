I'm perhaps not as upset about this as you and others are, Richard. As 
long as it is maintained properly, a bus should go on passing smog 
indefinitely. And I tend to think of a baywindow bus as "timeless" 
rather than "classic."

It is irritating, though, to have the goalposts moved when you're 
within ten yards of the end zone.
