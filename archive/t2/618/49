Subject: Rusty Front Brakes?

Hi Folks,

Since my engine started running on 3 cylinders back in April, I have been 
working on getting the engine back to running order.  Now I'm waiting for 
the final box of parts and for a free weekend with helpers, and I should 
have the engine reassembled, reinstalled, and running.  My Bus is closer to 
being back on the road than it has been this summer!

That said, I was jacking up the front to turn the wheels (a once-a-month 
project), and I noticed that my brake rotors now have a fairly thick coat of 
rust from their 6-month hiatus.  My immediate thought was, "what do I do 
about that?", so I thought I would ask The List.

I figure I have several options:
1. Leave the rotors rusty and let the brake shoes clean 'em for me when I 
hit the pedal.  Repeat as necessary, replace scored rotors in 5,000 miles.

2. Remove the wheel and scrape what I can off, then return to Step 1.

3. Remove the wheel; remove the caliper, dust cap, bearings, and rotor; wire 
brush and steel wool until shiny; reassemble and hope for the best.

4. Call AAA with a ramp truck and tow the Bus to a brake shop for an 
overhaul.

Any thoughts about the merits or dangers of any of the above options?  I'm 
planning on replacing the rubber lines soon anyway, so this might be a good 
opportunity to do more brake service.

Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.

Take care,
