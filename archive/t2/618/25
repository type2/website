Subject: Re: [T2] head gasket removal

I had good results using a pair of needle nose pliers... But not the
way you'd think.

I stuck the pliers in the port itself, then pulled the handles apart.
The outside of the plier jaws then pressing on the gasket, and I
wiggle down. Pops the gasket right off.
