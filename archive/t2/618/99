Congrats!!! You WILL get it with study like that. Saves you lots of money over the years. 

I recommend "http://www.howstuffworks.com". They have the beginner explanations like you mentioned PLUS some animated models which really help me understand thing slike rotary engines... 

Also be sure to read the first chapter in John Muir's "How to Keep Your VW Alive for the Compleat Idiot". He has a good explanation of auto mechanics in layman's terms accompanied by some good illustrations. 

see ya!
