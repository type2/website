Subject: Re: [T2] Booster update and obscure Brake reservior hose

David said:

I removed, disassembled, inspected, cleaned and reassembled the master 
 cylinder while I was in there (had a bit of crud floating inside, but 
 otherwise okay).  When I went to reattach the hose from the upper reservior 
 to the lower reservior, it didn't "fit".  The hard, clear plastic line was 
 expanded at the end to the point that it was considerably larger than the 
 nipple on the lower reservior.  At first I thought it had stretched out, 
 but the original factory-looking plastic clamp over it was the same size 
 and could not have worked if the diameter of the tube was smaller.  To take 
 up the space, there was what appeared to be a short section of thin rubber 
 hose, or gasket.  This piece tore when I removed the hose and I could not 
 get it to seal again.  I had to use another piece of thin plastic hose I 
 had lying around and force the assembly together - it is not on there well 
 enough that I would be comfortable with it in the long term.
 
 So my question - Is this little rubber "spacer sleeve" thing a factory 
 part?  Or is the plastic hose not factory?  I'm confused, and want to get 
 this fixed reliably.  Anyone been there before?  Richard Atwell 
 maybe?  This kind of obscure reference ought to be right up your alley.  :-)

Yes, it is a factory part.   #59 in this pic:

My ETKA disc is acting up again, so I can't give you the part number for it.
