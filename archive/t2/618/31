Subject: My kitchen isn't from a 77 Westy...

Either I misunderstood the fellow who gave me my "new" Westy kitchen,
or he didn't know...

It's not a 77, but an 87-ish! I found an 87 Synchro Westy on eBay that
had the EXACT kitchen I've got on my patio! Same gray color and
everything.

Ok, I'm stunned and stoked! 

heh

PS: Any recommendations on who to plumb it for me? I don't know how
comfortable I am with doing it myself. Propane = BOOM. heh
