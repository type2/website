Subject: No more type II - short funny

Last week's thread about why we won't ever get a basic Type II we can afford was very interesting to me. THANKS! One post I made mentioned the idea that us modern folks often mix up what we want and what we need... 

Went to church with my family and my sister's family (in-laws) for my niece's baptism... Sat in this HUGE Signal Mountain church surrounded by very well off folks. Pastor started in his sermon spending the first few minutes on the topic of "what we want versus what we need..." I half expected him to mention Volkswagens in that sermon! <grin!> I wish he had, my sister really looks down on my obsession with Volkswagens. Would have been nice to see that look of horror race across her face - something as "stupid" as old cars has followed her to their new church... <grin!>
