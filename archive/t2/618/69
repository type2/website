roberto
the cvs will roll a long time making some very bad sounds but I would not
want to see what happened if one actually seized or got jammed while
driving.
you noticed how stiff the new ones are i see.
if you keep the cvs greased and replace bad boots they can last darn near
forever. even joints with obvious bad wear still work if lubed.

they are a bit like a chinese puzzle to reassemble. and if you jam one
together backward it is damn hard to get back apart. dont ask how i know.
