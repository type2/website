Subject: Re: [T2] re: lowering a bus

When you say that it drives horribly, compared to what?  Alot of people 
will say that a sports car drives like crap compared to a luxury car 
because it's so bumpy.

Any quantifiable terms?  Does it turn any better?  Does it lean as much? 
  Is it as susceptable to gusts?

Just curious...

thanks,
mike
