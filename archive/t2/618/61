Subject: RE: [T2] Rusty Front Brakes?

I'm confused as to why the rust is an issue. I have ALWAYS just let the pad rub the rust off. It was always gone after about the first 5 miles. 

As for the pits, as long as the pitting is not bad, would it not be similar to grooving or drilling the rotors? That is a surface with pits to allow the high temp braking gasses out from under the pads? 

Just asking, not flaming. Possibly I'm nuts too...
