 I have ALWAYS just let the pad rub the rust off.
 It was always gone after about the first 5 miles.

 would it not be similar to grooving or drilling
 the rotors? That is a surface with pits to allow

Chris,

i think it has to do with the severity of the rust. if the
rust is gone after a few brake applications i'm sure it's fine.
that's completely normal.

however, pitting is a whole different issue. first, those rotors
weren't engineered to be cross-drilled. second, the pitting could
make the rotor thinner than the minimum thickness in certain places.
and finally, less surface area rotor-to-pad could decrease
braking performance.
