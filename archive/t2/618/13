Subject: lowering a bus.. thanks for all the info

Well thanks to all that responded to my question on lowering buses!
All but one were informative and positive... and even that "one"
wasnt bad... just questioning the validity of lowering a bus.. to that
question I have no answer... good bad or indifferent. this is just
an idea I am kicking around thinking that lowering the bus will help
some
on the highway handling... which is where I drive it the most.
When camping I tend not to do the 4 wheeling thing anymore.. to hard
on the old bus. :-)

Thanks again, Dan
