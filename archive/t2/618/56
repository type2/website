 I pulled the heater boxes off my '79 westy today and it went surprisingly
easy. All 8 nuts backed off perfectly and with a little wiggling the whole
exhaust fell onto my lap.
 
Two of the copper head gaskets even fell right out.

I believe you mean exhaust gaskets, not head gaskets.  Correct?

Maybe a dumb question but....... why does your 79 have oval ports?!?

It should have flat steel gaskets.
