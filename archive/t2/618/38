Subject: Re: [T2] New BN2

Since posting, I have trolled the archives and I've learned that the 
BN2 was an 8,000 BTU unit that was installed in the trunk of beetles 
and apparently also KGs.

It was designed to set ABOVE the gas tank and so installation into a 
bus would need to be considered with that in mind.  It seems someone 
posted that they couldn't figure out how to keep the gas from flowing 
when the heater was turned off.  Theirs was mounted inline with the 
stock heater under the floor.  Other locations I've found where in the 
spare tire well (most likely considering the gas tank question), on the 
floor on the passenger side, under the jumpseat (the sitzbak), and 
under the bench seat/bed.   I have heard from a few people already 
since posting, but mostly with regards to different heaters.

This heater came with the control knob, which when pulled out makes a 
ticking sound, so I guess it's little more than a timer.  It also has 
two relays wired between the control knob and the heater.  It came with 
an exhaust pipe about 3" long (designed to empty into the wheel well, I 
guess),a piece of corrugated tubing which I presume to be combustion 
air intake, and two pieces of plastic ducting that I am not sure how 
they connect in the beetle.

I have not yet been able to locate a glow plug, but they apparently can 
be had for the right price.
