I'm sure I can get my bus to consistently pass. What I object to wrt your suggestion is the hassle, finding the parts, installing them, removing them, dealing with red tape in future when they aren't available anymore, getting mods/omissions certified by the smog ref, paying the $70 smog fee, multiple trips to the smog test station, etc etc.

This is a hassle that a 75 FI Bus owner doesn't have to endure and I stink up the environment no more than he does.
