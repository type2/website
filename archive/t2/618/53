Which is why I said remove the pads. Stick them in a box until later.

Quality rotors come from the factory with protective coating to prevent
rust. I don't see the difference.

Rust = pitting = less surface area for braking. I've left rotors sit on the
bus for a couple of years and the results aren't pretty. The rust won't come
off:

6 months is no big deal but if the storage is lengthy, something
preventative needs to be done just as the mfgr does to keep the rotor
preserved on the shelf.
