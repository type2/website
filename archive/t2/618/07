Subject: Crankcase ventilation

I've developed quite an oil leak on my bus ('68 Kombi 1600cc SP), and I'm 
beginning to think I put the engine back together wrong.  Next to the oil 
filler is a tube that runs from the block to the air cleaner.  If I am 
correct this is the crank case ventilation.  The tube also heads downwards, 
and ends just above the lower tin.  I'd take a picture but the warm air 
duct that runs to the air cleaner is in the way.  Anyway, this tube drips 
oil onto the tin, which naturally creates some knarly smoke.  Is this tube 
supposed to be connected back to the block somewhere?  I don't see any 
extra parts from the engine pull/installation, but I haven't looked to hard 
yet.
