Delirium:
If everyone burns the waste oil, why not burn the waste oil in the bus
engine at say 1% ratio ?
Once this Kenyan taxi driver picked me at my house and saw the bus. He told
me that in Kenya they all pour oil in gasoline to make the engine last
longer. He mentioned 200k+ miles out of an engine bus there. This guy had
driven from Kenya to Egypt several times in a bus.
Waste oil would be quite abrasive and burn dirty I guess...
