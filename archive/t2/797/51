<<Why not weld spot welds with a spot welder?>>

Why not?
 
If you have a spot welder in stock go for it.
As I mentioned in tight inside area's of the panel you may not be able
to get to the flange to use the spot welder.

Around open window holes it's perfect.
Don't forget to use that weld thru primer.

<<<It seems to me that in cases where two clean flanges come together
face to face, and it's possible to reach them with the electrodes of the
spot welder, it makes sense to use the spot welder to reduce or
eliminate distortion.>> 

Absolutley

<<I'm not asking how to make lemonade without lemons. I'm asking: what's
wrong with using lemons to make lemonade.>> 

Nothing wrong with the lemons as long as you have them.
