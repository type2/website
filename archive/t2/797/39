Subject: RE: [T2] Re: New welding question

You can do some pretty nice spot welds with a MIG welder and a hand drill.  
Just drill through the top panel and fill in the whole with your weld.  Make 
sure it penetrates good to the bottom piece of metal.  That's how I do 
panels.  If you drill all the way through, and can get to both sides of the 
metal, this is usefull:

Otherwise, this is another usefull tool:

It helps even out the panels so a simple skim coat of body seam seal is all 
that's required, also sold by eastwood.
