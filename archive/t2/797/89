Subject: Conserving gas in a camper

If ever there were a time to pull all the cabinets and loose gear out 
of a bus to give it all a spruce, this is it. Lighten up and save some 
gas. (But tire inflation is more important.)

And those of us with buses that are parked for the longish term can 
point out that we're doing our patriotic duty by not driving our buses 
at all.

Mark
