Subject: where to get rebuild kit for Weber DFEV?

Dear List,

	I'm looking for some advice as to where the best place is to order a 
rebuild kit for an Weber 32/36 DFEV.  I'm in the very long process of 
getting a '72 Westy back on the road.  I found a junkyard motor with 
good compression (120lbs all around).  The Weber carb seemed to do well 
for a while when testing the motor and tuning things up. Slowly but 
surely I think it has crapped out.  The accel pump has gone, so that 
alone has to be replaced.  This carb sat outside with the rest of the 
motor for a whole summer at least, so I think a good cleaning and 
rebuild would be called for.  I probably have a good air leak past that 
accel pump diaphragm, since the motor doesn't run very well with the 
choke open.  Someday I may want to put a set of twin carbs back on 
there, but for now I'll give this one a shot.  So if anyone has a 
vendor to recommend, please let me know.  Also if anyone has tips on 
rebuilding, I'm  all ears.
