Read your post with interest.  So you pay up to $1.70US a gallon.

Just for your information/interest, here in Australia we are paying  
around $A1.35 per litre.  Converting that to US gallons is about  
$A5.35 gallon.  At current rates of one Australian dollar being equal  
to 0.75 US cents that equates to $A6.35 per gallon.  Continue to  
enjoy your cheap fuel for a while longer!!
