Subject: Re: [T2] Increasing range

I fitted two custom made stainless steel tanks under my '77, just over 4" 
thick, so only hang as low as the middle chassis rails. One is for water, 
one is for fuel. They each hold ~40L (45 if I fill them to over flowing). So 
in addition to the stock tank get a range of 450-500 miles. Great on long 
trips.
Regards,
Richard
