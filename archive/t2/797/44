<<Terry, is that true? I have a gauge that's on my compressor itself,
and then I have maybe a 2 foot long steel braided hose that goes to my
regulator / water seperator. On there, I set the regulator to about 90
PSI, and then I have connected to it a 50 foot long Goodyear air hose.>>

Todd,
Absolutley honestly true.

If I use a 3/4" or 1" impact I have to use bigger daiameter hose to be
sure to get the most air pressure I can at the end of it---

The larger impacts require big volume, big pressure to get the job done.
They require full time 150 psi at the end of the hose.
