Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench

It will for a while, I have a inch pound torque
wrench, followed by one that goes to 90 foot pounds,
finished off by one that goes to 250 foot pounds, that
covers all that we need.. inch pounds for the small
torques below twenty foot pounds, I don't like to use
the very bottom or top end of a torque wrench suspect
them not to be very accurate on the very end of each
scale. Phil
