hello Chris     That would be if you put a lot in there  every Porsche 356 
owner I know including myself always put some Marvel Mystery oil in with the 
gas,  Now Marvel is a real lite weight oil like 8 or 10   Also I have ran 2 
stroke  before when I had too without any problems  smoked a little but didnt hurt

in them also as I was having problems with them gumming up just sitting  later
