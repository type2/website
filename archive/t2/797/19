Hello Jason  I put a mechanial gage in there to get a true reading of the oil 
pressure  and always crank the motor till the pressure starts reading before 
firing the engine.  I had a new type 4 motor that we couldnt get any oil 
pressure and it turned out the the new filter wouldnt allow the oil to flow thur it
