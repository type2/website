<Though I have to say it was quite humorous to see the EPA stickers on the
Expeditions 5 or 6 years ago with 30/40 on them. I nearly busted a gut. =)>

Units my friend!!! Not 30 to 40 miles, 30 to 40 Yards or Meters per gallon... 

Friend sold her Expedition. Was costing her $80 a week in gas for a 15 min commute each way and a few trips to the grocery store 15 mins the other way... <whew!> That was when gas was $2.30 a gallon...
