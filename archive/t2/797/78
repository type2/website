Just run regular (but good quality) engine oil. You're not going to wear the oil out in 3K miles I doubt. If you worry about wearing the oil out, try synthetic which is also expensive. 

Would be cheaper to just change the oil yourself every 2K miles. 

Regardless of your choice, I know alot of folks who have gotten over 200K miles on regular brand name motor oil in their cars. They simply kept it changed, decent filter, kept the maintenance up, and drove it carefully/correctly. 

I don't think - these days - that oil is the weak link in the durability of our engines. I think it is the lose nut behind the wheel - the steering wheel... <griN!> 

If your vehicle was some sort of fleet vehicle getting major hours (over the road truck, construction, or race car) I'd say you'd need the best of oils. 

Just keep it changed... Just my amateur opinion.
