<< if I was going to replace a huge panel, and I was able to completely

a spot welder anyway.. I mean, damn, it would save you a LOT of time.>>

You can still spot weld without a spot welder .
I have for 30 some years .

Prior to buying my Miller 30 E mig welder I used my arc welder.
At first I'd drill all the holes at the edge of the panel's, and arc
spot them.
All's ya need is a bunch of Vice Grip 6, 8, 10" and some flat bladed
plier's.
Some C-Clamps for weird positions works well .

Anyway--since waaay back when I'm using the same vice grips, & C-clamps,
but no the arc welder has been parked for almost 20 years.
The drill has too. 

I've been using a panel punch, which make's panel hole drilling a joke.

I punch the holes, clamp the panel and spot weld ----

Pretty simple ,and clean looking factory panel placement without
purchasing just a delegated spot welder.

You can't use an actual spot weld on the inside radius corner's
anyway---

The tool would never fit in there, where the mig welder will.

Good idea to be using a zinc weld through primer on the flanges prior to
welding them up.

Now the mig welded panels are going by the way side too.
New technology has surpassed the, panel punch, and the mig welder.

3-M's panel adhesive makes the job of replacing body panel simple.

Grind the joint clean, fit the panel, apply the adhesive, clamp it
together,and walk away from it for 12 hours.

The joint will displace moisture, and it'll take a herd of Siberian Yaks
to pull it apart.

It's a strong as a weld, a bunch faster, and the joint will never
separate or rust.

It's now actually a simple task.
