Subject: full flow oil filters (was  New 1776 into a 69 = KaChunk)

Did you do the blow/suck  throught the middle hole in the filter to see 
if it breathed readily?  Considering its location, I would think the oil 
filter needs no back-flow valve.   In the rare event no Mann or Mahle is 
present, any one that fits the threads will work if no backflow valve is 
present.  People looked at me very strangely in K-Mart when I was 
checking on the shelf filters by blowing through them!
    In a previous life I took my 71 bus and braized in 2 copper pipes to 
the sump plate- one went through the center and over the pickup tube, 
and the other to a drilled hole in the side of the plate.  Then I ran 
horizontal pipes under the bus to a spin on filter housing AND a 
transmission oil cooler in series
.  As the filter was the lowest thing in the system, I always used the 
largest filters that had NO back flow valve.  Primed it first after an 
oil change using the starter.  Did not seem to have oil pressure 
problems (watched it like a hawk), but did have the white froth under 
the cap in winter, so I bypassed the cooler then.  Considering some had 
to flow around the pipe over the pickup tube, I figured I was getting 
over 80% filtered oil up the pickup......

  Hello Jason  I put a mechanial gage in there to get a true reading of 
the oil
  pressure  and always crank the motor till the pressure starts reading 
before
  firing the engine.  I had a new type 4 motor that we couldnt get any oil
  pressure and it turned out the the new filter wouldnt allow the oil to 
flow thur it
  ? ?   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
