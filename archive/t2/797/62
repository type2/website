<Why not weld spot welds with a spot welder?>

You can if you can reach it with your tool. If I have $600 to spend though, I'm going to buy a MIG rather than a spot welder and a lesser MIG or a MIG later. 

Yes, you can spot weld all you want. 

Short answer: economics and reach. 

I'll be trying the adhesives next time I patch a non-structural panel.
