3 - the two upper are for the mechanical fuel pump. The lower is for the oil
filter stand.

4 - the smaller one is for the oil pump, the larger one if the flywheel
o-ring

7 8 9 - you have three sizes of pushrod tube o-rings. The very early 1700
used a different PR tube.

10 - oil filler tube gasket

12 - big o-ring goes under the fan hub. Smaller one with the flat side is
the distributor o-ring, small fat one is for the oil pickup tube. Small seal
is probably for the middle sump plate.

13 - 2 for the oil relief plugs, one for the screw between the case halves
that holds the pickup tube up, one for the drain plug, two small ones for
the sump plate?

14 - sump plate (taco plate) seal

15 - intake gaskets used on injection engine

16 - intake gaskets for carbed engine

2 - oil strainer gasket

3 - oil pump 

The others in the lower pics are duplicates of the some of the upper ones.

Phew...
