Subject: Increasing range

With the recent exodus from the hurricanes I started thinking about vehicle range. The VW diesels can go 500 miles I think on a tank of fuel. My cars can go about 350 miles. I began to wonder if the bus could have auxillary fuel tanks installed somewhere like under the floor. Anyone seen this done? 

Might be a good way the weather the sudden increases in fuel prices too. I know we filled up our CR-V and Cabrio minutes before the first Katrina price spike. I think we figured at $2.45 versus the $2.89 just down the street (they were changing the prices as we pumped) we saved about $9...

$9 gets my attention but maybe that's just me... <griN!>
