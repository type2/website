Subject: Need help - color code

Hello all

I'm repainting my Bay window bus...
I was planning in using two colors now.
However, i just can't decide between Pacific Blue (years 62-63) L398 and
Bahama Blue 64-66 (vw code 21) L519...

Does anyone in the list owns one bus with any of this colors?
Did anyone repaint one with a similar color?
I would like to see the end result....

I've found this color in a new VW color code brochure, that's the only one
similar color that my paint shop can provide at the moment: VW - L5N BLAU
(57306), but i just can't get the means to compare to the older colors...
Can anyone tell me how can i get the older colors, or if this new one is
similar or not to the ones i'm looking for?...

Thanks....
any kind of help will be most apreciate...

Best regards from Portugal...
Joco
