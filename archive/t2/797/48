True to a point George.  Yes we have a national health system, but  
just try to have any form of elective surgery/medical proceedure  
without private health insurance.  To not have private health  
insurance here is not to have proper health care.  Try waiting lists  
of 6+ years for Government dental care.

Our family private health insurance (which covers hospital only, no  
'extras' like glasses or dental) is over $A140.00 per month.

The government takes two (2) forms of taxation from fuel here, one is  
a GST on the final price & the other is an "excise" (a tax in other  
words) on the produced price.  So we pay a tax (GST) on a tax!!

Additionally, as Terry mentioned, we pay a top income tax rate of  
$A0.45 per dollar, with most Australian workers paying over $0.30 per  
dollar earned.

Anyway, appreciate the correction on fuel prices.  Don't feel quite  
so badly done by now!!
