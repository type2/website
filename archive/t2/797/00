Subject: I'm back!

my girlfriend and family are going to think I'm nuts,
since I have a great Subaru as a daily driver, and I
just bought a 47,000 mile 1976 Porsche 914 2 weeks
ago, but I cant resist...I'm buying a rust free
california 1977 Westy here in NY, thta is what my ass
belongs in as a daily driver.
