I thought the spot welding was a fast mass production method and seam welding was a superior method (more metal fused - rather than spots) - plus alot more oxy/acteylene or MIG setups than spot welders in garages... 

I'd prefer to MIG a panel in but do believe spot welds would be fine if you did it right. 

Also think about how it is done. MIG is done to one side if you like. Spot welding requires clamping both sides of the material to pull it together VERY tightly before the current is added. Easy to fix a quarter panel this way, not so easy to repair the contoured edge of a fender panel.
