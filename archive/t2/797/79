Subject: flapper box exhaust tubes and blue coil

Hi gang,

For jotting down somewhere: EMPI makes 50mm flexible hose 
for VW buggies.  It works great to route heat from the flapper 
boxes away from the engine and out the rear sides the way 
VW intended it to go.  Otherwise, it blows onto the heads 
when heat to the cab is off.  I think this only applies to late 
engines.   Of course, if you have the original tubes and hoses 
meant for the purpose, you don't need this hack, but it seems 
like most went missing.

I have one spare length of the EMPI hose for cost of shipping 
(more than enough for one side, maybe two if you are 
creative).  Also, I have a NIP Blue coil from Bosch Mexico free 
to the first member willing to pay shipping!

best,
