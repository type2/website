<<<One thing to examine is the completely different tax and social
structures of the countries we are comparing. In the US, we don't have
(for example) any form of national health insurance, so each individual
pays for their own health insurance. Other countries have health care
systems paid for by tax revenue, including fuel taxes.>>

Hey George,
In the counties that have national health coverage, the biggest chunk of
it comes from the 50% income tax they suck outa the populations pocket.

The gas tax is small in comparison.
