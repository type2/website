Not really.  That one is too much for the lower range of the engine nuts and bolts and too little for the
upper range of wheel bolts etc.

You need 2. One in inch pounds for the engine and one in ft.-lbs for the big stuff.

As an example in sizes: [I am NOT recommending these, just an example, but the 3rd one is OK for wheels etc.]

This one above in 3/8 would be nice. Snap-on makes one.
