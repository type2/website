Subject: Fan Shroud Flaps and the HE Covers

Hello all. I am reassembling my engine (2.0L) and I have a few questions 
about the little "tin flaps" at the bottom ports of the Fan shroud. They are 
at the ports where the Heat Exchangers tie into the Fan Shroud. At this same 
place there are two "U Shaped" pieces of tin that cover this area and are 
attached to the Heat Exchangers by two screws each. I have a set of the 
little flaps but they are mangled like foil wrappers from a fast food joint. 
The covers I don't have a single one never seen on either.

My Questions are:

How important are either the flaps or the covers?
Does anybody have any extras laying around?
How hard would it be to install them after the fact?
I could probably duplicate the little flaps and possibly the covers(if I had 
Pics of the covers). I am putting this thing together ASAP so I would need 
them soon unless either part is not really needed.

Thanks,
Michael Knight
