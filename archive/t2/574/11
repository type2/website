Subject: Polishing my Dizzy

Sounds dirty doesn't it? ;-)

Karl sold me this dizzy to replace my 009 (THANKS KARL!!!). It was
very clean and nice and silver. Much nicer than my 009 with its dingy
gray patina. But it was setting on the patio, looking so sad that it
wasn't in my bus yet. So I thought I'd polish it up.

Whipped out the Dremel, spent 5 minutes with the black and then white
compound bars to do the small area on the vacuum advance. Then I spent
less than a minute with some rubbing compound to take out the swirl
marks.

It looks beautiful! The pics really don't do it justice. I'll have it
finished tonight (hopefully) so I can try again to yank the old one
tomorrow.
