David,
Sorry I don't know what size jets were in the carb. I traded it to John 
Baker for a FI setup. I do know that the jetting was specific for 2.0L Buses 
and it sank a lot of gas into a 1600 I built and installed it on. Nearly 
killed it. Fowled out the plugs regularly. As far as the booster leak 
creating poor gas milage I think that is possible, if you had to tune/adjust 
the carb to accomodate for the extra air. I would check with Redline on the 
correct jetting size for your engine and get that booster leak fixed. Sorry 
if I stated the obvious but this link might help if you know what kit you 
have or you could cross refference for the size jetting in the different 
kits and the size jetting you have in your carb.

This link can help tune, adjust and test yours just pick the carb that you 
specifically have.
