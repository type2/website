And their really into suing their customers, or
their customers friends.  My best friend found
out first hand.  He got a very small settlement
for being off work for a month (and losing his
job because of it), and Geico sued him claiming
that he should pay them his personal injury
settlement to pay for his girlfriend's damage to
her car.  The case was thrown out, but only
because he had a friend who could help.  Most
people would have paid them rather than hire an
attorney...  BTW, he was rear ended by a drunk
guy driving a delivery truck at 95 mph on the
Washington Beltway.  No fault of his at all.  

Not in a million years, no matter how many robot
dancing geccos I see.
