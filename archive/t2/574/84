Hi Richard,

That's very useful info... Now I will be able to finish my 
"engine-cooked meals" section of the road trip cookbook.

"Place foil-wrapped package above right heater box for 75 miles at 
60MPH, stopping after 40 miles and turn to cook other side."

I guess I'd want to take care of that oil leak first though...

Happy trails,
