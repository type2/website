My sentiments exactly, but from trying to get insurance with
them 30 years ago when it became mandatory in Texas.

They only wanted to sell me insurance if I already had insurance.

Mandatory bus content...I was trying to get insurance on my 67 bus!

Not in 30 years would I ever do business with them either!

Cheers, dave
