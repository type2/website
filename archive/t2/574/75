Subject: Montana Brand Paint

So today (Sunday) we were trying to find a place open to buy more PPG sandable primer for the truck we're working on. So we call all these diff. places, and finally find  a place that's open. Only they don't sell PPG. All they sell is MONTANA. Only info I could find online about it was that it's from Venusuala (yeah, I can't spell. Heh heh). But was REALLY cheap! 

Anyone ever used or even heard of this Montana brand before?

Cheers
Chris
