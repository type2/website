Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust inside the bus - update

I recently replaced the seal on my 74. It doesn't really create an air-tight seal, particularly not around the
luggage rack. (Maybe I did something wrong?) I believe the 1/8'' or so gap between the seal and the roof in the
front is to allow the luggage rack to drain. I'm not sure the lack of a seal is going to create a wind tunnel
effect inside.

Perhaps your bus is haunted by an evil spirit.
