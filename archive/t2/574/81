Subject: Solder Advice

Hello,

I about to embark on some "wiring surgery" on some (many) cut wires in my 
engine compartment and under my dash. There are far too many unattached 
wires and ones with bad cheap connectors.

My goal is to solder using original wire and cover the solder area with the 
original plastic color, giving it a nice clean original look.

I have not solder in years so my question is what is the best way to achieve 
my goal and still get a good solder? Should the wires be placed side by 
side, end to end, twisted together, etc...?

Thanks in advance, Phil
