Subject: [T2] Insurance, Geico, radar guns

Speaking of Waldo, Florida as a listee did, be aware that the whole section
of US 301 in that area should be considered to be a speed trap. Be
especially alert to the flashing school speed limit signs. Any excuse to
give a ticket. Those towns in that area are just about dead and need the
speeding ticket revenue. I had been warned by AAA several years ago and thus
abided by the posted speed limits, and in fact usually stayed at least 5 or
more miles under it. Also when I had a passenger with me I would call out my
indicated speed, and ask the passenger to watch the speedometer as well in
the event I had to have a witness in the traffic court. I usually have used
this route at least twice a year and so far not been stopped. And while on
the subject of speed traps watch out for Society Hill, S.C. I got stopped
there along with two other vehicles which were behind me. No way the cop
could have clocked me with his radar at the angle his car was parked. I
wrote a letter of protest to the then Governor of S.C. whose assistant
replied that there was nothing he could do. To have returned there for court
would have cost me and my witness two days out of work. My insurance nearly
doubled for three years. I then resolved to never let a speeding ticket go
by without returning to fight it. Also watch out for Temple Terrace,
Florida. I saw a copy of their budget at one time and they actually had a
line item as income from traffic fines.
I had rather see this thread turned into a listing of speed traps.
