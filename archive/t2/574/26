Subject: Re: [T2] batter tray replacement.

I've seen this stuff used on everything...

Back when I was a teenager and working in an auto body shop, we'd see
cars whose frames were held together with this stuff and tack welds. I
guess the goop was used to align, then the welds used to fix in place.

The frame guys would get so ticked when they saw that stuff because it
was such a PITA to remove. heh

Bus content: 
Since I don't have any way to weld, would it be possible to replace
body panels with this stuff in combination with pop rivets? I know
welding would be ideal, but lack of $$ makes it impossible any time
soon.
