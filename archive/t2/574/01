Thanks!
I went and made a couple spacers.. turns out I had the short ones as 
described.
Had some solid aluminum cut to make the spacers, drilled the holes and 
presto!
This weekend I have a childs cot in the front for our outing.

I only wonder what the previous owner was smoking when saying he had used
the front cot alot.  I think it was a lot of bs to sell the van.

This will be the new vans first go really, 7 hour trip total with some 
inbetween
city driving.

Measure your cot poles. If they are 56 1/4" long..... you have 68-73 poles.
74 and 75 poles are 57 1/4". 2 years only. If you can find 76-79 poles, they 
will fit. They are 2 piece
collapsible.
