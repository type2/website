Thanks Adam

I have had a few emails about this so far you are the only one who has put a 
name to them. "cofer" Great I am trying to get some of them now, I was also 
told that there is a left and a right. I have never seen what they look like 
I can only picture them in my Mind. I want to finish the engine this week 
and I am running out of time. So I might have to improvise for the time 
being. I was wondering about something though. If they only block in the air 
rushing into the Heat Exchangers for use in the winter for heat, and I leave 
this piece off to open air. During the summer when I close off the HEs, and 
the air is/would be stopped there. Seems like less would be forced onto the 
engine itself to cool it off? Or am I looking at it the wrong way. Seems 
that I should do something regaurdless of the season if this is the case.

Thanks,
