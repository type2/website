Subject: Warning - Schadek oil pump on Vanagon - no go

I just finished spending a lot of time to make a Schadek 30mm pump fit 
my 2.0 air-cooled Vanagon engine, including:
- moving the gear on the shaft just the right amount on the shaft to get 
proper tang engagement in the cam slot
- counterboring the 5 bolt holes on my new webcam
- grinding down the bolt heads as well for clearance
- grinding away a corner of the cover plate to clear a boss on the case
- fitting up and bolting the unit to my just assembled case/crank/rods

I find the cast aluminum engine mount bar (moustache bar?) INTERFERES 
WITH THE PUMP COVER in such as major way that it is impossible to use 
the pump.   ARRRRGGGHHH.

I can't believe, after all the research I did before and during the 
above exercise, that I never encountered anyone's advice on this problem 
(including AC.net the vendor).  Am I really the first to do this 
dumb-a** task?

Well, here for the benefit of others is my frustrated message of warning.

Off to find an actual Type IV pump...
