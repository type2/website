Subject: Weber Progressive setup Question

I am using a Weber progressive carb set-up for the summer - I have installed
it and tuned in the lean idle as per the specs - timing is 7.5 btdc - points
are at 50 dwell
Idle speed is set at 900rpm and is very steady - runs perfectly at idle - no
vac leaks that I can find - using my stock vac advance distributor
The carb seems to hesitate coming off idle unless the rpms are really
increased with the throttle- really bogs and then feels like power is
restored  - is this normal operation for this carb or can I smooth this out
somehow - I am used of FI and am trying to use this until my harness is
reborn - any tips will be appreciated
