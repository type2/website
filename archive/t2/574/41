Subject: Value of propane tank

Hi,

I have a propane tank with skid plate that came off of an 
Adventurewagen which looks exactly like the ones from 1976 to 1979 
Westys. The tank has some surface rust but the valve, lines, and 
fitting are new and it works well. I really do not have a need for 
this and would like to sell it to someone that can use it on their 
bus. I have no idea what it is worth. Anybody have a clue or want to 
make an offer?

I could deliver the tank to Sunshine Daydream

High Country Bus Festival

or you can pick it up in Greensboro, NC

It has propane in it so I do not think it should be shipped.

Thanks
Chris
