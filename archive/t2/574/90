Subject: fuel line hoses

I am perplexed at what to do about my fuel line hoses.

I look at them and they are dry, not cracking and actually look like there is
nothing wrong with them.

To be honest, they look better than any fuel line I have seen in recent years.
They are rubber with a cloth covering. There are no cracks or bulges anywhere
at the ends or in the runs of the line.

Do I still have to replace them, just because they are likely 30 years old.
They may have been replaced by a PO, but I have generally found things to be
factory on this bus.

It is a 1978 CDN Type 2 Campmobile.

If I disturb things, It is my fear that I will end up with a not perfect
clamp, or some other fault. I am told by my mechanic, who has worked on the
busses for years to watch for cracking or wetness.

In my opinion, using the axiom "The enemy of Good, is Better" applys here.

Some one talk me out of this, Please, I am having a terrible time talking
myself out of it. ;-)
