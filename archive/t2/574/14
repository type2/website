Subject: Heat Question

Hello List,

71 Kombi. I am still getting to know the bus, bought it in April, have been
driving it for about a week now.

I have the levers on the dash - the red and the blue. When the blue levers
are up, the fresh air vents are closed, when they are down they are open ( I
think that is the way it is.) What about the red levers for the heat? I
can't determine if up lets the heat in or if down does. And, what about the
lever down below the parking brake, down by the accelerator? What role does
that play in the heating system?

Heater boxes are hooked up, cables are hooked up to them, just trying to get
the heater system kind of working before winter.

Thanks!

- Austin
