Subject: Tranny Needed in Ohio!

Looking for a Bus tranny!  Anything '68-'79 I can make it work for my Bus.  I
have different engines available, just no working tranny.  Please help me get
my Bus back on the road. I can pay shipping, but looking for anything in the
Ohio, Western PA, Southern MI area.

Thank You!
