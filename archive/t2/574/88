I product called Solder-It that solders with just the heat of a match or
lighter. It's a paste that's applied to whatever needs to be soldered.
Twist the wires together, put the paste on it and put a lighter on it.
It's a true silver soldered connection. Its pricey, but a great product.

I have not solder in years so my question is what is the best way to
achieve
my goal and still get a good solder? Should the wires be placed side by
side, end to end, twisted together, etc...?

Thanks in advance, Phil
