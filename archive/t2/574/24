Stop.  Take a deep breath.  i posted about this a few months ago.  I have
done this successfully.  Take the pump cover to a machine shop and have them
remove the entire lip on the pump cover.  What you end up with is a flat
piece of steel with the 4 holes for the studs.  Then you put it on and the
moustache bar fits no problem.
