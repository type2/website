Well, i'm home now, fortunately.  It was a hell of a trip.  I. . . <snip> . . .The van did very well the first day, and it even got up to 90 once."
 
Id say that the problem was at least partly your driving speed. You arent driving a type 4 anymore Roger, keep it at 63MPH and youll keep that rebuilt awhile longer. Also that tranny. Not only that but God/s/ess/es forbid that you get in an emergancy at that speed and have to rely on four unboosted brake drums to save you.
 
Happy trails,
 
Duncan
