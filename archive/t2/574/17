According to some infrared temperature measurements that Richard Atwell 
and I took on my '76 after I drove from my house in San Francisco down 
to Richard's in Cupertino (roughly 45 miles, at 68MPH -- engine was 
quite warmed up :-), you don't need high-temp paint for either the 
engine tin or the fan shroud.  You don't need high-temp for the plenum 
or intake runners, either.
