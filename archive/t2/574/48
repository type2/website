In response to cpdoggin(-at-)yahoo.com and his question about Texas clubs/events, 
particularly in the Austin area:


The Austin Air Coolers (see www.aircoolers.org) recently had our 3rd 
anniversary... we meet the 1st Thursday of each month at Deep Eddy Pool at 7:30 pm - 
we hang out, visit, etc. until around 8:30, then do our monthly "Tour de Force" 
down Cesar Chavez, across the South Congress bridge, on down South Congress 
through the "First Thursday" festivities (where the merchants stay open late, 
there are bands on the street corners, sidewalks , etc... , then turn at Fran's 
Hamburgers and head west on Mary Street to Austin's Pizza where we hold forth 
until they close...

there are also other "unofficial" meetings from time to time - 

we just had a big campout in East Texas over the Memorial Day weekend with 
folks from some of the other clubs...

Later today, June 13, is our annual Junebug Rally...

And in November we have our annual "Novemberfest" show/swap meet... lots of 
interesting vehicles to see there...


Come out and join us sometime!
