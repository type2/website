If you dont want to weld or use mech. fasteners you
should
look at auto panel adhesive. very strong yet remains
somewhat flexible ..unlike JB weld. JB weld works
great
in a compression join that doesnt need to flex but
drys rigid.
  The door hinges on the wife's 90 J**p Cherokee (long
gone now) were "welded" to the frame with this type of
adhesive. Lasted 9 years or so. When the driver's side
door
got tweeked I went to grind off the "weld" bead as I
was going to take it to the weld shop and get it
fixed.. Much to my suprise it was adhesive.. I dont
think the door hinge was a good choice for using it
but it is pretty
strong stuff...
