Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Engine Tin

I'm not sure how hot it really gets, but I'm painting up my tin (white so I can easily see leaks and stuff) in High Temp (1200 degree) paint that I found at NAPA. Says you can use it on exhaust componants and stuff. So I sandblasted and it's lookin' pretty good. 

I wouldn't use the BBQ paint though. It's porus and will let water and air get down to your metal and rust it. Think it mighta' been on this list somewhere that I read that. :) 

Cheers
