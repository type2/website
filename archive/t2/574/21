Forgot my recommendation:

We use Mercury for our AC VWs.  Forget the rate, but it was the lowest we
could get as of a couple of years ago.  We got it through Auto Insurance
Specialists, a good outfit to try.  They query several companies to find
the lowest rate.

21st Century tends to have the lowest rates, but they balked at our older
VWs.
