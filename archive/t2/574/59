Subject: Re: [T2] Weber Progressive setup Question

Hi Eric,

I also have a Weber progressive (32/36 DFEV).  Mine is on a 1976 2.0
Liter which should act similarly except that you actually have better
heads for an engine with carburetors.  Mine works really well coming
off idle and at low RPM.  I even get fair gas milage (17 or 18).  The
big difference is that I use a cheap Bosch 009.  I know everyone on the
list thinks it's junk but it works well for this application.

The reason for it's popularity, aside from being cheap, is that it's
advance mechanism is completely centrifugal. It only has about 20
degrees of advance so  it's maximum advance will only be about 27 or 28
degrees (7.5 + 20) but that is sufficient with a stock cam.  Another
advantage is that the distributor is fully advanced at fairly low RPM
giving it good performance in city traffic.

As I said, many on the list are very vocal about the virtues of vacuum
advance mechanisms but I have a feeling you will find the venerable 009
a good solution.  They only cost about fifty dollars so it's probably
worth a try.

Peace, Jeff
