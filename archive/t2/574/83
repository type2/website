Subject: Re: [T2] Solder Advice

I have a wireless soldering iron from Weller. Definitely a great tool.

In vehicles, I usually use crimp connectors. If done properly, they'll
last as long as the vehicle. The newer ones with heat shrink wraps are
even better. They're never pretty however. ;-)

But to answer your question: I've found when soldering 2 wires that
twisting the wires, soldering heavily at the point where they first
meet, then cutting off the excess,  works the best. That method
combined with shrink wrap over the connection is durable and more
attractive than crimp connectors.
