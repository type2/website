I feel like I need to jump in here...

Dawn Smyth is one of the coolest people I know.  She is also completely 
dedicated to the work of busing and saving our beloved Type 2s.  I 
would much rather buy something from someone of this nature, than some 
company capitalizing without impact or representation in the bus 
community.

I will be first to state the Dawn can be on the slow side and this 
should be noted before ordering from PLF.  However, I will always order 
my canvas replacement parts from Dawn, due to the impact and 
involvement she has on our community.

my two cents,
