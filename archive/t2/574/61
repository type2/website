Subject: broken ring?

Symptoms : A clittery clack noise that almost sounds like a hole in the 
manifold.
Fairly sharp sound. It's irregular sounding in consistancy.

I just got back from a 300 mile trip. It's blowing oil through it like no 
one's business.
4 liters to be exact.

If I keep the oil level up it runs with the noise going.  I had checked the 
compression
and one cyl is down from 115 to 85-90.  It may be worse now.

Is this a pretty accurate diagnosis?

Any other possibilities?

James
