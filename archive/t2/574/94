Okay Got It. I thought it was just a misspelling of "coffer" as in 
cofferdam.

What I am saying is that. If the air entering the heat exchangers is closed 
off, you close them by dashboard lever, then the air that was flowing 
through there is now added to the stream of air that is flowing over the 
engine. If the covers/coffers(=D) are not there, when you close off the HEs 
then the air that would be added is lost by way of open air where covers 
should be. Or is there sometype of release at the front of the HEs when they 
are closed off?

Defrost or Defog? I have never had to defrost in the summer, even when I 
lived in Richmond, VA driving my '69 Squareback.

That is something I did not think of. I will keep this in mind as I rig(PO 
Conception) for temporary and plan for future.
