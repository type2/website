Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hoses

Hey Alan,

If you don't know the history of the fuel lines I would change them. Period.
You can't see what the actual rubber looks like underneath the cloth and
that is why you should change them, especially if they are 30 years old.
They could start leaking gas at any time. Consider this...if you don't know
the history of the lines because you just got the bus, it is possible that
the previous owner rarely drove it. Say you start driving it frequently and
there are some cracks in the fuel line...add a little spark to a gas soaked
fuel line and the fire starts.

Maybe these will help to convince you:

You don't want your bus to look like these do you?

There are probably some good write ups on changing your fuel lines in the
Library or archives, but just take your time when doing it. Go buy new
German metric fuel line (so it's the right size-5mm for carbs, 7mm for FI),
they will be cloth too, and get some brand new clamps. You can get enough of
all for less than $20 and that's a heck of a good insurance policy. Take one
old hose off at a time and replace it with the new. Make nice "square" cuts
on the new line and tighten your clamps down good. Don't drive it far until
you have checked the lines for leaks and the wet cloth as your mechanic
mentioned.  Chances are good if it's your first time you will spill some gas
on you and the bus. Give it plenty of time to dry up before driving the bus.

Think of it this way..you can do the job and rest easy because you have all
new lines or you might possibly be making a post here later down the road
about your bus burning up.

Good luck,
