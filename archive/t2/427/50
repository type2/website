Subject: Seeking Jim DiGennaro's email re Vanagon Bentley Manual

At Transporters by the Tunnel we won a Vanagon Bentley manual (worth
60-80 bucks) and we want to sell it or trade for a Bay Window manual-
Jim, if you get this, I need the Bentley Publishers contact who donated
the manual so we can initiate a trade?
