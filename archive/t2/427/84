Subject: Anyone with Weber ICT Advice/Experience to share?

List,
The time has come to go dual. I've been checking some things out online. I'm more concerned with fuel economy than with power. I drive a 73 westy with a 1700. I'm pretty sure I want single BBL carbs. I am concerned with winter performance and heard good things about the cb performance solex w/ electronic choke, which fits my budget well, but I read that the linkage is not too great, being aluminum and non crossbar. The weber icts at aircooled.net are about $100 more than the solex's I found at CB's webpage and have steel crossbar linkage, I think. Any advice, warnings, experience with these carbs and ways to do these things on a budget welcome. Thank you very much.
