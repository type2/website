Mine actually came a little long and needed some trimming. Its been on for
about three months and I havn't noticed any shrinking yet. Did you get the
push on with the clips or the glue type? Maybe someone was a little stingy
with the ruler that day. I cant think of any way of stretching that would
not shrink back to original size.
