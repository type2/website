Subject: Re: starter problems - Piggy back

I'm looking for answers on the same problem...same symptoms as below but 
I've got a '73 converted to fuel injection with a '78 engine...popping the 
clutch starts her right up.  My husband was under da bus with me reading 
"How to Keep Your VW Alive"...diagram indicated 3 wires, he only saw 2...am 
I just missing a wire?

"Plenty of
battery, the solenoid clicks when I turn the key, I think I can hear the 
relay
clicking, but the motor does not turn."
"The motor turns when shorted direct to the battery.
This happened very suddenly"
