Subject: Re:  windshiled instalation

When the guys in my VW club put the windshield in my Bug, they used
dishsoap, not soapy water. That might make the seal and channel more
slippery and easier to put the windshield in. Also, use your flat palms to
press,  not a fist. I'm not an expert, but this is what they did. I wonder
if a Bay Window is harder due to the curved glass, than a 1970 Bug, which
has the flat glass?
