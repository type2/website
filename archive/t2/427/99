Subject: R New Heads good? R rebuilt VW heads better?

I'm searching for a good deal on some heads, im
debating used/rebuilt VW heads. But now i may be
thinking new, are there any good manufacturers out
there that produce a quality head, or should i stay
with original equipt. Im working w/ a budget (another
baby on the way), so i dont want to buy some crappy
after market junk if it isnt worth the long run..

thanx,
robert
