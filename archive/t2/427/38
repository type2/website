Subject: Re: [T2] Rear-ender Tent

Justin,
I've seen one , slept in one , and own one:0)  They were made for deluxe 
buses. With Rear-ender Tent, kids cot, and full lenth bed, my '71 Deluxe 
sleeps my family of four.  We are about to camp for two weeks in 
Canada.  Yes, they are hard to find.

Joy thru air,
