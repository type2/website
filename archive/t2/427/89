Hiya All,

Anybody out there in Listland subscribe to the Auto Restorer?  It's been 
coming my way for the past few years.  Definitely has my recommendation as a good 
reference.  Lots of how-to articles by people who really know how to.
Anyway (on to the mandatory Bus content) this month AR is profiling the 
restoration of a '62 DC.  Good article which includes a brief history of VW 
development.  You might want to bum a copy off a friend for a look - this (as far as 
I know) is a subscription-only publication.
