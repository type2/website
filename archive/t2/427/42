Subject: windshiled instalation

HELP!!  I am trying to re-install a windshield on my 68 Westy and having
nothing but problems. With three of us,all Bus guys, we succeeded in breaking
the windshield. Fortunately I have a 74 parts Bus so we cannibalized the
windshield from it and are back a square one. We are working with a freshly
painted
Westy, utilizing a new windshield seal, spraying the channel and seal with
soapy water, and using string in the seal . Our first attempt was to place the
windshield in the lower channel and work it in from the bottom,around the left
and right corner, up the sides and across the top. The seal was so tight that
the force needed to squeeze the windshield in place was too much and it broke
the glass. All suggestions welcome.
