The Toyota is a Scion xB.  Neat little car currently being sold in
Japan and California.  I has the footprint of a Beetle, but you can put
four full-size adults inside comfortably.

It seems to be developing a following much as our buses have, except that
it tends more toward the KeWlDoOd type, since the marketing is definitely
aimed at Gen Y.

We might just get one so that we can start restoring my wife's Beetle.
