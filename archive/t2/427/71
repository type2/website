from ggm You are not the only one who ever broke a windshield trying to get that rubber
grommet in correctly. I suggest that you use a pretty thick string, like 1/8" diameter.
Too small a string will cut the rubber as you pull the rubber lip into place. Have two
people inside pulling the string on each side. Have lots of people on the outside gently
pushing on the glass. I have had real good luck with a really slippery and really cheap
lube. That lube is any hand dishwashing detergent. and good luck bye ggm
