This may be old news to some of you, but Bentley Publishers sells Volkswagen
Type 2 Owner's Manuals.  They have years '73 thru '79 and the '79 campmobile
manual.  These are the factory glovebox owner's manuals. $19.95.


On that note, anyone happen to have an owner's manual for a '71 campmobile
for sale?
