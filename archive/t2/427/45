Subject: rattling from fan housing

Just got a new (used - new to me) rebuilt 2L single carb in my '72.  It was 
installed by a very good mechanic in Richmond BC.  It's performing great, 
however, a rattling sound is coming from the fan housing.  I think it is 
mostly directly from the fan area.  Kind of like two or three small nuts 
inside a plastic ball, that kind of sound.

What could this be?

thanks,
- Ian
