Subject: Westy parts bus for sale

I own a '71 Westy with a rusty exterior and an exceptionally good 
interior and window's. It has no engine, but an excellent 
transmission and Berg shifter.

It sits in my driveway with three other ACVWs and the neighbors are 
beginning to stare.

I would like to sell it for use either as a parts bus or as a daily 
driver for someone who has an engine.

Alexandria, VA;   $600.

Please respond off list.

Jack
