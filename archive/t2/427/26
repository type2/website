Subject: Re:tranny/case part tach?

That little magnetic proximity sensor on the case and the inductive pick-up on the #1 plug wire are some of the pick up points for VW's old computer diagnostic system. It was an early attempt at on-board-diagnostics (OBD). I've always thought that this flywheel sensor would make a dandy pick-up for an electronic ignition system, since even with a compu-fire (or something) the timing wanders too much for my liking. I think because crankshaft end-play affects timing at the dist.

<snip> on my case
behind the flywheel is a hole and in that hole is what looks to be an
inductive circuit that may be for a tach sender or may not.  does 
anyone
know about this part?  also, on the engine i am tearing down i think it 
has
original spark plug wires and on the #1 wire is another inductive 
circuit
that consists of a little ring with 2 connector ends sticking out which 
i
assume is also for a tach, was their ever a tach available for the 
busses
or are these just diagnostic connections?
