Oh, I can argue against that.  Your argument makes the common assumption
that accidents just happen and cannot be avoided.  The simple truth is that
the 2500 pound car is much more capable of *avoiding* the accident to begin
with.  Your 5500 pound SUV takes longer to stop, longer to turn, and is more
likely to roll over.  Active safety versus passive safety.
