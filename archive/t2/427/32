Subject: 2 weeks to go until Buses Of The Corn

Hi Volks,

As it says in the message header, there are now less than 2 weeks to go 
before the gates open at Heber Down Conservation Area for BOTC3. We now 
have 37 buses signed up, and room for at least that many more before we 
would start crowding the frisbee golf course or the driving test 
grounds.

One of my favorite items at Bus Campouts is the Full Moon Bus Club's 
Breakfast Burritos. This event makes "rolling your own" a whole new 
experience!

So BOTC now has a Breakfast Burrito Sign-up page:

The Burrito Experience will be in Whitby, Ontario on August 9th.  BOTC
