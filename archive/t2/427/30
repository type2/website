Subject: Anyone parting a '68-71 Westy?

I'm looking for the following parts in good to excellent condition:

Passenger side front vent wing window assembly - clear glass - w/ good 
rubber

Full set of OEM curtains - will buy individual curtains

Full set of OEM (or VW of A) bumper guards - will buy individual guards 
or rubbers

Door pull for front door - black plastic mounting tabs

Windshield - clear glass

Shock cord (elastic cord which holds the bottom of the curtains)

Cup hook (white colored hook next to closet door which the sliding door 
curtain attaches to when deployed)

Sliding door inner panel - wood

the lights)

Yeah, I know that some of this stuff is available as repro stuff, but 
I'd rather have original.  If anyone has a lead on NOS stuff, I'm all 
ears.  ;-)

THANKS MUCH!
