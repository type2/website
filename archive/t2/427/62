Subject: Steering knuckle nut torque

Please, can someone tell me how tight to torque the upper nut on my '79 
steering knuckle?  I've found specs for the lower one but can't find an 
explicit procedure for tightening the upper.

Seems to me that it needs to be loose enough to allow adjustment of the 
eccentric bushing, but tight enough to keep it in place.
