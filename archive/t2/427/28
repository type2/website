From the "can't win files"...Wind generated electricity (14% of Norway's
power, BTW), touted by some environmentalists as a partial answer to
pollution/green house gases has run into objections by others...The fans
are not user friendly to some birds and noise pollution has also been
mentioned...The NIMBY groups have also raised objections to a few sites,
claiming that the wind farms obstructed their views of, at least in one
case, the seaside...
