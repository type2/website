It is a really big hole in the exhaust port. I imagine it sounded pretty loud, like a
completely blown off head. That was pretty good figuring there on your part to figure
out the problem.

It is really tricky and time consuming to properly fit a plug (bolt) in that hole. You
have to drill the exact size hole to make interference threads. Really thourough tap
tables list the size drill to use by the percentage of thread filling the hole. (50%,
68%, 75%, 90%) Most normal threaded holes have huge hole diameters compared to the
diameter of the bolt and the male part end of the threads are not long enough to
actually reach out and touch the edge of the hole. Think of  the male thread ends like
the peaks of mountains. Think of the threaded hole threads like valleys. If you take the
mountain and invert it in the valley, the mountain touches the edges of the valley but
the montain tip doesn't reach all the way to the valley floor. That is why it is so hard
to fit a plug. You have to drill the correct size hole. You have to tap the hole with a
long taper tap, You have to tap a little, test the bolt, tap some more, test some more,
etc. then you have to cut off the end of the bolt to keep it out of the exhaust chamber.
That is why the factory parts seal best.

Yep, that approach is surely a much better solution to be able to use those kinds of
heads in a different than designed for application.
