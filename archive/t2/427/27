Given the ways of business and politics, I think it is every American's duty
to use as much gasoline as they can as quickly as they can. The reasoning
being that nobody will seriously look for a viable alternative fuel/vehicle
until the current supplies are exhuasted or economically un-feasible.

Think driving an electric vehicle is clean??? The power plant that burns
fuel to produce the electricity to charge that car's battery pack puts out
more pollutants than a car the same size as the electric running a gasoline
engine. It all depends on where you want your pollutants.

Just some light-night, very-tired comments; only partly serious
