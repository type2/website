Great! But are these the correct ones?

Let's find out...

I've got two alternator boots to identify, courtesy of kind Mr. Maxson (and
apologies to the other kind gentleman who sent one that was subsequently
lost by the USPS).

These are round at one end and "D" shaped at the other (alternator end).
Part number 021-903-655-B-HS-9.  It doesn't look like part #42 in fiche file
#093-000, but then again the fiche picture isn't 100% clear either.

If it's not the 70A boot, then at least I'll know the difference from now
on. :O)

Thanks for the help.
