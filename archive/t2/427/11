Subject: tranny/case part tach?

nobody answered this question so i'll make another attempt, on my case
behind the flywheel is a hole and in that hole is what looks to be an
inductive circuit that may be for a tach sender or may not.  does anyone
know about this part?  also, on the engine i am tearing down i think it has
original spark plug wires and on the #1 wire is another inductive circuit
that consists of a little ring with 2 connector ends sticking out which i
assume is also for a tach, was their ever a tach available for the busses
or are these just diagnostic connections?
