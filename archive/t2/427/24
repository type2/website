My bus too pops and especially when i rev high and let off the gas, i'm 
convinced it's because my mufffler has a huge hole in it. You might have an 
exaust leak and the bus is backfiring.

I shudder to think that my pop might actually be a knock, but god i hope 
not, i think it's a pop. Hard to tell.
