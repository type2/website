The 3rd VW dealer I found in my area has turned out great. The main parts
guy is always asking me how my bus is coming along and the other guy is
equally as friendly and owns a 79 bus himself. They have no problem
searching ETKA when there is a problem with my part number. Quite an
improvement over the last 5 dealers I've used.

What really surprised me last week was I discovered that they still service
air-cooled VWs. I don't know how well known it is but I caught them working
on an old beetle in their service bays and after asking around it seems they
have a mechanic who has been with them for 18 years and loves working on
them. Too bad their labor rate is $115/hr.
