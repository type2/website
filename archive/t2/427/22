My bus currently has no windsheild, and is ready
(hopefully) to shoot the actual finish coats of paint,
its primered and blocked now, window rust handled etc.

my question simply is this: i have replaced everything
imaginable or cleaned it etc, my bus runs ok i guess,
i mean i really dont know how an upright 1600 motor
should run in a bus, (i have no other friends with
bus' nor one around to compare it to).
but i do know how a bug should run, when its running
good.

when i decelerate coming to a stop or if im simply
idling my bus pops, sounds d-tuned or something, i
have notice it appears to get worse when its hot. 
can someone shoot me a list of probables??
the carb has been rebuilt, new fuel lines, points,
wires, but im not sure if its possible that the head
is warped, PO says it overheated and then it sat for 7
years, til i tweaked it to run...

its a '70 bus 1600

thanx,
robert
