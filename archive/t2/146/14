Subject: Re: insuring bus (was value of 78)

I don't bother with collision on the Westy- the amount paid in NJ could
buy you another body every 4 years (-8  I just drive defensively and
make sure it's the other guy's fault.
However, I do carry comprehensive (cheap for its value), for the deer
you run into (remember, hit the deer, not the tree  trying to avoid the
deer) or the tree that falls or the jerk who scratched it up in the
parking lot.
