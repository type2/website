Mark,

I would like to do this as I will need it when I get ready to install
they diy fi systems(Megasquirt).  I have a 78 stock fed model.

What part number/price for the sensor?

I appear to have a plug on the drivers side curved exhaust pipe...is this 
where you mounted yours?

Cheers, dave

I'd especially like to know whether during light acceleration/cruise whether a (very) lean condition is normal. I have my AFM tuned to be a little on the rich side most of the time, but under certain conditions light throttle/cruise the gauge displays lean. I don't know whether this is normal, a problem, or an exhaust leak that I haven't found yet. I'm swapping in another AFM soon to see if it behaves different, but your experiences would be useful to know.
