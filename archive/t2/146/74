Hello Sherrie,

About the inverters, I think they work great! I bought
a 600w (750w peak I think) inverter a year ago on
clearance at Walmart. I was planning on using it in my
bus but my bus needs a new motor so first things
first. I put a 13inch color tv with stero speakers and
a super nintendo in my bus using this thing. It worked
great! Origionally this unit cost over $100 if I
remember correctly. I bought it on clearance for $70.
I will sell it to you for $50.00 if you want it. I was
going to use it on my bus  but what good is a bus with
a TV if it cant even drive out of the yard. let me
know if you are interested. I will find it tomorrow
and give you more details about it if you are
interested. 

Have a great day!
David Kelly
