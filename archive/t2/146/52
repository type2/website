Subject: Re: [T2] line on dizzy or #1 plug wire?

Verify which one is true 1st.
With the 3/4 valve cover off, rotate the engine IN the direction of rotation.
Watch #3 valves. As the exhaust JUST closes and the intake JUST starts to
move, stop. That is #1 to fire. Look where the rotor is pointing.

But, instead of doing the monkey screwing a football routine with turning the
engine backwards and wondering what the heck cylinder you should do and
whether the planets are liked up right crap, here is a simple and easier way
to do it:

Start with any cylinder you want.
Rotate the engine in the direction of rotation.
Watch the exhaust valve. As soon as it starts to open, STOP. Adjust that
cylinders intake valve.
Rotate, the exhaust will open then close, the intake will immediately open
then close. Just as it closes, STOP.
Adjust that cylinders exhaust valve.
Move on to the next cylinder.
After you get the hang of it, you can do all four valves on one side in 2
revolutions. With a remote starter button, you can do all of them without
getting up from under the bus. Takes longer to R&R the valve covers then to
adjust the valves!
