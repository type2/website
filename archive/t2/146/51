Hi Volks,

I was picking up parts yesterday at John's Bug Shop in Niagara Falls
Ontario, and noticed they have a Bosch 009 for $100 Canadian, brand spanking
new. New Cap, points and rotor would add another $40. That comes in at under
$US100. 

For an extra $20 they have it in chrome, and you know what a horsepower
boost that brings ;^)

www.johnsbugshop.com -- yes they do mail order, but no online store (yet).

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
