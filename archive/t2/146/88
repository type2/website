Oh yeah, since you're in LA, make sure your cabinet is disguised as 
something other than an entertainment center or it will be gone in no time 
and you will be posting about where to buy replacement windows and door 
lock mechanisms.

I have recently stopped locking my bus, because I decided that there is 
nothing in it that is worth a broken window - at least, nothing anyone 
would want to steal.  Fortunately you can't steal Busma.  :)
