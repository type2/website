Had you been noting your measures you wouldn't have to estimate. Start 
writing down all data at every inspection. Such notes are so much better 
than memory, it is essential to accurate diagnosis. Bad diagnosis is a 
money pit that will cost you many times more time/money than any proper 
maintenance inspection. Consequently, your procedures cannot be considered 
as adequate unless all information is in written form. Writing it down is 
the foundation of doing it right.

You can further confirm your valve stretch issue by measuring installed 
height of the valves and comparing. 10-12 thou higher difference from the 
others on the subject valve will verify your theory or disprove it. Don't 
speculate. It's simply not reliable compared to actual measures.
