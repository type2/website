Hi Sherri,

A marine deep cycle battery is the way to go. You do not have to pay a fancy
price for them. They are simply designed to be able to go all the way down
to practically nothing and hold voltage and then be fully recharged again. A
standard battery on the other hand is designed to be able to put out a lot
of initial power to start your engine, but some say they are hurt by being
too often discharged and lose voltage on the way down.

I put the second battery under the jump seat behind the driver. Many prefer
the rear area in the engine compartment on the driver's side. This is fine
but I am reserving that area for a gas heater.

In addition I also wired in in the same jump seat area a small trickle
charger I bought from Sears for about $30. Now whenever the land is plugged
in not only does it power the main AC outlet in the bus but also recharges
the auxiliary battery which powers the interior lights, radio etc. I also
installed two other gizmos:  a relay switch that automatically connects the
two batteries when the engine generator is charging, so that the auxiliary
battery gets charged during normal driving, plus a second switch that can be
thrown manually to connect the two circuits when the bus is not running, so
the main battery can also be charged by the trickle charger.

You do want to keep the two battery circuits separate, however. One reason
is the auxiliary battery does not have the thick cable connection to the
starter that the main battery has so if it is online during engine startup
it will blow fuses or burn up its wiring all in trying to help with the
start. The second reason of course is so you do not drain the main battery
when parked and using auxiliary equipment.

I also installed a small 400/800 watt inverter with an A/C outlet. It takes
up very little space and it cost about $36 on the net. I think it would be
enough to power a small TV. I use it for lights, small appliances and to run
an immersion heater to make instant coffee. To install this I bought an A/C
outlet receptacle at a hardware store that has one outlet and one switch,
the kind you sometimes see in bathrooms. Then very cleverly I wired the
switch to control the inverter, turning it off and on, ran wires from the
outlet sockets to the inverter. Thus a switched outlet.

For about $160 you can get a much more powerful inverter, 1200/3000 watts.
If I had to do it again I might go that route. The downside, besides cost,
is that it takes up more space in the limited amount of space available to
you. On the other hand it would run just about anything including a
microwave or coffee maker. (A few items may require a true sine wave
inverter to run properly as opposed to a less expensive square wave
inverter. You should know if that is what you need. Normally this is only
very sensitive equipment although I have heard some printers fall in this
category.)

I made my own curtains. It isn't hard. Choose a material you will like to
live with. I would not worry about magnets or the bottom aluminum rod. Most
of the time the curtains will be gracefully tied back and will look really
nice that way. Other times you just slide them over the windows and not
worry if they hang and inch or two from the side of the bus.

I will be happy give you more details on any or all of the above or other
aspects of fixing up/converting a camper, etc. if you wish.

Cheers,

John Rogers
