Hello Brett,

Well, I have a stove that you may be interested in.
This is a new Optimus-Princess stainless alcohol
stove. I bought it with the intention of putting it in
my bus but I need the money for a new engine first. I
The only flaws that I could find on this stove were
one or two iight small scratches from it sitting a
garage for 20 years. Don't worry though,it runs
beautifully. I put alcohol in it for the first time
last week and fired it up long enough to make sure
that it worked as good as it looked, and it did. I
then cleaned it up.

The demensions of this stove are 11 1/2 " by 19 1/2"
by 4 1/2". It comes with its instruction card,
maintaince/ repair manual, parts list/diagram, and
instruction sheet on how to build the cabinet around
it. I am also including a alcohol filler nozzel for
the 1 gal tanks. I am asking $120.00 OBO. Any
reasonable offer accepted. Don't be afraid to ask. If
no on wants it I will just list it on Eb(-at-)y.
