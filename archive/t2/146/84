Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 shims

Three shims center the crank in the bearing saddles.
Adding more than three shims pulls the crank to the opposite end,
past the factory allowed tolerance in the forward direction.
Every time you clutch, the force applies to the end of the crank.
Out of tolerance is wear on the # 1 main and /or the case.
In addition, the crank is pounding on the #1 main in the rotational
direction, and this wobbling is what wore out the main seal.
The repair is to disassemble the case, measure the bearing holes
and "line-bore" ( align-bore ), which means to cut the holes to a
larger dimension and install bearings made to compensate the cut.
Similar to grinding the crank, where you install bearings made fatter
on the inside to compensate for grinding. Bearings are also available to
compensate for the wear of the thrust surface of # 1 main, the surface that
the flywheel pushes against. There are a large number of bearing combinations
available to provide repairs for almost any possibility of case, crank, and thrust wear.
The repair involves splitting the case, measuring, cleaning, and machining.
