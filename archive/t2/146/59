Subject: Sued-aka-VWoA Sucks!!!

sounds like a bum deal man! when did VW cease to be
anything that even remotely resembled cool, and in
turn manifest itself into the pr!ck (excuse me) center
of the universe!!!!!  this f$#%kin rediculous, and it
really makes me mad!! it almost makes me want to sell
my bus and buy some other vehicle, almost. one thing
it does make me want to do is avoid "genuine VW
parts", screw them and their genuine parts. but
really, here we are involved in a community which
revolves around their vehicles, and all they can do is
sue us for it. so you sold a couple of hubcap clocks,
big deal! really how much revenue can that cost them,
as they pump out new "disgusting" beetles at 25k a
pop. assanine daisy included of course, they know how
much the yuppies love to feel like a real "hippie".

unfortunately i have nothing to offer you but my
sympathies and rage. 

what i would like to know is, does anyone have a email
address, or preferably a phone number for VWoA. i have
a few things that i would like to tell them.

Kinda ashamed to own either one right now, quite
frankly.
