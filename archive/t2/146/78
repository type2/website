Subject: seemless conversion, what do you think???

Hello list,

Here is a picture of a bus that I played with. I
erased the seam on the side of the vehicle. Ok, ok, I
am sure that nightmares of calk and gobs of bondo come
to mind when the phrase "seamless conversion"are used,
but if you can look past that image, how do you think
it looks? Any coments welcome. Please don't be too
ulgy though.:0)
