Subject: CB antenna

I am going to add a CB radio to my bus.  Went to Radio Shack, they have
one on sale, cool.  The problem is the selection of antenna.  I do not
what to use a magnetic mount, new paint.  I am deciding between the
large buggy whip bumper mount and a cell phone antenna look-a-like that
sticks to each side of the glass.  Anyone using either of these?  Any
suggestions for alternates?
