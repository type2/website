Subject: Re:  Cooling air control cable,  broken 79 - 2.0

Working on a 79 2.0. noticed that the cooling air control cable was loose,
and the control cable +ACo-plastic?+ACo- pulley was fried.  Replaced the pulley,
then went to adjust the cable and discovered it was broken near where it
connects to the right control flap, shaft.


Question: +ACM-1. With the cable not connected are the flaps in the open or
closed position?  In the Bentley Section 5 page 21 it appears that they are
closed.

Question +ACM- 2.  Is the cable readily available? flaps? yard only?
