Neither of those options is ideal, but the marine battery (which may be 
labeled "Deep Cycle") is a better choice than a standard starting 
battery.  As for the TV, I'd ditch it and get an LCD panel.  The prices 
have come way down and they are smaller, lighter and consume less power 
than a tube-style TV (all good things for a VW camper application).  You 
should be able to find a 12V one for less than $150.  If you must use a 
tube TV, try to get one that runs off of 12V as using an inverter to power 
a 13" 110v TV is very inefficient.
