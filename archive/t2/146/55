Subject: Being sued by VWoA, what to do?

Hey all, well after we got back from the Campbelltown show today, there
was a letter in the mailbox from an attorney in Indy.  First off, about
2 years ago, I had made a clock out of an old vw hubcap of mine,
drilling a hole in the center of the cap, and buying a clock movement
from the craft store, and I had gave this as a gift to a friend of mine
for christmas. After i knew it was a hit as a gift, I had tried to sell
a few from our web page here on webtv. we might have sold one or two,
and traded a few for live music. Now this letter states we will need to
pay them $3000 by May 15th for damages of using the VW name without
authorization. And if we dont get that to them by that date, they can
sue us for up to 3x that amount. Which is absolutely absurd. The reason
I am bringing this to the lists attention is if I remember correctly,
some time ago someone else was being sued or something to that affect.
If anyone can help us out, we would totally appreciate it. After all,
isnt all that stuff we sell at the swaps unauthorized? Thanks for your
time...Brian
