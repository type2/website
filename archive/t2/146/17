Take it to a shop with air and have them zip it off and install it on the 
new alternator. Job done right, don't have to buy a compressor and air gun. 
Do you have a Les Swab tire store in the hood?

The Mexicans are about 15 years behind Taiwan as far as industrial 
capabilities (subjective opinion). They are starting with the best designs 
in the world when making VW/Bosch parts, but their quality control is not 
yet reliable. It took Japan 30 years to start putting out high quality 
products after WWII. Mexico will get better as time goes by, or else they 
will remain a 3rd world country.

But there is nothing like a Bosch Reman or Newman starter to put worn out 
starter problems to rest for a very long time. Quick starts means far less 
strain on the battery, alternator and starter. Weakness in any one will 
wear heavy on the others. The main benefit of properly tuned settings is 
the quick start. Low stress every time extends life tremendously for the 
primary electrical system components.

When you have symptoms of low battery/starter glitches, find the weaknesses 
and remove them all. A quicky battery terminal is a constant unnecessary 
load compared to a new cable with properly crimped terminals, and I suggest 
one gage larger than stock. Improve the spec when it only costs but a few 
dollars more.
