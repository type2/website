>>After 6 inches of snow on April 20th and a about a foot or so on April
Fool's Day I was just thinking about moving to the Carolinas.<<

wait until mid-August when it's 100+ degrees outside & the humidity makes
every pore sweat as soon as you step foot outside, even at 8 a.m.

you might be wishing for all that snow again!

but of course we would still welcome any busses/bus drivers to the area.
