I used a generic Bosch 1-wire sensor ~$29. (It is the one that fits a 80 =
Vanagon. I think that they are pretty much all the same, though. It has =
18mm threads). I had wanted to get a generic cheapee sensor, but all that =
the FLAPS had was Bosch...

The plug that you are seeing is probably the one that is removed to check =
the emissions. This plug is too small to accomodate an oxygen sensor, =
although it is in the right area. I had a threaded bung welded into the =
exhaust in this curved piece before the catalytic converter. The bung is =
welded so that the sensor goes in to the exhaust horizontally (not hanging =
down).

The idea is to get the sensor positioned so that it has exhaust from all =
four cylinders, but located as upstream as possible where the exhaust is =
hottest. With the sensor positioned where I have it, it seems to get =
warmed up in about five minutes of driving.

All the best,
