Brian,

Where will it all end!

Depends on how you used the name IMHO.  The hubcaps were probably genuine 
vw from old cars...yes?  So it's not like you made the hubcaps with the vw 
emblem and tried to pass them off as genuine.

Better get a lawyer though.

This is the first instance of someone like you being sued by VWOA although 
there has been a lot of discussion on this on the vintagvw list.

Cheers, dave
