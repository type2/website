Subject: vanagon seatbelts in a non-walkthru bay?

I have a 70 bench seat bus; I'm trying to put some new seatbelts in and
wanted some advice.
Now, I've read the Library and searched the archives a bit, and I've not
seen anyone else with a bench front seat attempt this mod - maybe it can't
be done?

I got all the seatbelts out of a gorgeous 90 Vasserboxer w/ a foldout rear
seat (PO rolled  the rear into a post; broke the bumperand skirt  and
popped the hatch outta whack, but it was ALL there and in nice shape and
running... if the yard would have let me, I think I would have bought it).
When I got them home, I found that the reel mechanism is really too wide to
fit between the front passenger seat and the door. Not to mention that I'd
have to bolt it 90 degrees from its normal position, as the bulkhead
precludes the normal arrangement. Not to mention the fact that I have those
little funnels that carry air thru the bulkhead that  are kinda in the way!
So any tips or pictures of how folks have done this - even with a walk-thru
- would be great.
It actually looks like its going to be easier to mount the REAR retractable
belts than the front - I just need to cut and weld fer that :P

Oh, and another question: when I took the belts out of the car, the reels
wound them up as far as they could go; now the damn things will NOT
unreel!! There is a little pawl action doodad that has prevented me from
being able to pull the belts back out; is there a catch to release? I
already found out that you DON'T take off the plastic sides to find it,
unless you are prepared to deal with several dozen feet of tightly wound
spring steel whizzing by your head. I got it all back in properly, though.
 I KNOW there has to be a release, as I assume they needed one on the
factory floor; I certainly hope I didn't pay $150 for now-junk belts!
