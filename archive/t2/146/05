Hella H4 halogen 'stock brightness' 55/60W bulbs.


Brighter is not always better.  Think efficiency rather
than brute force.  And be considerate - don't blind other
motorists!

Why are your current headlights not bright enough?
Check your headlamp electrical ground connections.
Confirm the status of your battery and charging system. 
Aim your headlights properly.  Upgrade from sealed-beam
lamps to halogen lamps.
