I believe your 3rd gear syncro is going south. The noise is coming from the
transaxle and telescoping up the shifter tube. Wait a little longer going to
3rd from 2nd.

Look in the archives using the word 'sags' or 'sag'. Negative camber is caused
by the torsion bars loosing tension. Either adjust them or cheat by installing
coil-over shocks.

Not on your bus. 72 to 74 only in USA. It drives the air injection pump. Turn
the page, figures 7-4 and 8-1. FI engines did not use it.
