This was a very fortunate find as far as I'm concerned.  Bosch supposedly
only sells a rebuilt version here in the U.S. but it turns out that a
Mexican made new starter is the identical part, and still available brand
new south of the border.  So this new starter comes to us "sideways" by way
of Bosch/Mexico, for _less_than Bosch charges here in the States for a
rebuilt one - $99.95 our price - and without a core deposit or the
hassle/cost of sending your core back.  Considering that even the rebuilt
Bosch's are sometimes rebuilt in Mexico anyway, there is no downside - you
just get a new one for cheaper than rebuilt.  I've had them for over a year
now and haven't had even a single defect - seems quality control is great!
Hopefully these will continue to be available forever. :-)  Incidentally, we
are still using the Bosch/USA "rebuilt" part number for these, SR87X (which
fits '76 to early '81 with manual trans), but you will actually get the new
one when you order it.
