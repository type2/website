Not to down play or tarnish the price Mike has put on
his 009 but I sold the one that was on my bus for$0.75
at Everybus. It was in working condition. 

Have a good day!

P.S.- I don't think that asking Mike if he would take
$0.75 for his 009 would be considered a "serious
inquiry", so don't use my price as an example!! ;o) 

Cheers!
