Subject: 1600 shims

Question is, on a 1971 bus the 1600 size engine, how many shims is to many. 
Or just check end play and slap them in till good. The bus we just bought was 
dumping oil so out the engine came checked end play and other things but it 
looks as though there is about 1/16inch space. I don;t have  a true gauge but 
what do you think.
