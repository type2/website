Subject: Air-fuel gauge results

Hi All,

Well, I gave up and bought myself an LED gauge (Autometer) to connect to =
the Oxygen sensor that I added to my '78 for tuning. It actually looks =
like my voltmeter was giving me the correct readings after all, but the =
gauge does make it much easier to see the swings in  mixture.

I'm curious to hear from other listees (78 or before) who are using an =
oxygen sensor and an air/fuel mixture gauge. I'd especially like to know =
whether during light acceleration/cruise whether a (very) lean condition =
is normal. I have my AFM tuned to be a little on the rich side most of the =
time, but under certain conditions light throttle/cruise the gauge =
displays lean. I don't know whether this is normal, a problem, or an =
exhaust leak that I haven't found yet. I'm swapping in another AFM soon to =
see if it behaves different, but your experiences would be useful to know.

Thanks!!
