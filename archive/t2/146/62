You can make a simple effective tool with a bolt and feeler gauges.
Info for that is in the Muir. If you measured that much play with the
main seal and shims currently installed. you will have to have the
case line-bored. Three shims does it, and you can't do it in three.
1/16 is .060, the limit is .006. Did you remove the flywheel ?
