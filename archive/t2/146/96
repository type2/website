Have a few questions for the list.  I have a 69 bus that originally had a=
 single port engine in it.  I am converting to the 71 dual port.  I have =
the doghouse tin, but it did not come with the fan.  My original non-dogh=
ouse style shroud still had the fan in it.  I was wondering if this fan w=
ill work on the 71.  I installed it, and it fits in nice and tight.  Spin=
s well.  Looks like a perfect fit, but I was told that the fan could be d=
ifferent.  Any way to tell?  Also, in installing my damper pipe to my muf=
fler, I found that it is still a little loose, not much, but a little.  C=
lamp is pretty tight, and I don't want to over tighten.  Put on a new cla=
mp, and it came with a gasket, and a small tapered ring.  Am I missing so=
mething?  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Thank y=
