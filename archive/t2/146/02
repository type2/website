Subject: RE: [T2] Blue print to make childrens bed...

	No, I did not really get an answer to this.  What I was looking
for was maybe some blueprints from people that were forced to make their
own cot, because this is what I will have to do.  Was also looking for
certain tips on design that I may not think of.  Guess I will stick with
a piece of cardboard for a template and go from there.  Not really sure
how to go about this.  Thanks,
