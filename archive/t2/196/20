That page only lists "Campmobile" with no difference between a non-pop top, a
pop top, or a deluxe.
The deluxe has the added weight of the fridge instead of a cooler, the stove,
the propane tank, the front table, the stool/trash container.
Plus the 7 gallons of water in the water tank, and propane in the tank....
