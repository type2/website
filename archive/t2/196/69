Subject: VW Type 1 List

Again, I apologize for marginal content, but I LOVE the T2 and VB lists so
much and have learned so much here, that I want to re-create this atmosphere
in a Beetle setting and with beetle information. I sent out a message a few
days ago about starting a PURELY TECHNICAL mailing list geared toward bugs,
with Roughly the same rules and guidelines as the T2 and VB lists. Well it is
done, and in a couple of days we already have 20+ members. I have discovered a
lack of good technical list (low noise to signal ratio) for bugs, and I hope
this will fill a void. If the membership grows, I will look to move the list
off of Yahoo to a more appropriate forum. Here is a link to the VW Type 1 List
Web site that will direct to information on subscribing:

Thank you for your time and I hope to learn just as much from you all about
bugs as I have about buses!


Peace, John Baker
