Subject: doing push rod tube seals this weekend

 I've got a couple of leaks at the push rod tubes that I'm going to attempt to remedy this weekend.  I bought a set of Viton seals from Bus Depot figuring I might as well do them all while I'm under there.

What kind of grease am I supposed to apply to the seals before I install them?  Also, I was planning on following Bartnik's advice and using grease on the valve cover gaskets.
