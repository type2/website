I'm brand new to this VW thing ... just dawned on me today what \x/ is after
being on the list a couple weeks (!).  Anyway, having had much experience
with very rusty (read stuck) Jeep CJ7 parts, one of these things can come in
very handy ... and is mucho better that shearing off a stud.  I've seen more
compact versions at the local FLAPS also.  g'luck.
