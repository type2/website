Subject: Tire Tread

I know that the tire thread has come up several times, but I have a bit of a
twist on it. I know that I need 185/R14 etc.

I want to know what the difference is between the tread patterns. I was
looking at a set of WinStar tires that meet all the necessary specs, but
they had what I believe to be called Highway rib. someone had sent me the
following:

<<This is generally used for trailers (as in your case) and have
specialized handling characteristics... very straight tracking and
very low friction, both excellent in a towed application; but also very
poor turning (goes with the straight tracking) and braking (goes with the
low friction).  Trailer tires are *different*!
>>

Please let me know what you think or where I can can get some good info.
Later,
