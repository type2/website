Hiya List,

I know that this is not THE forum for this question, but I do know that we 
have knowledgeable people here.  

I am going to look at a '64 Safari in a couple of hours.  Now I can get 
around a Baywindow pretty well and I know what to look for in general terms 
when buying a used vehicle (read - Bus).  But Splitties and campers are a 
whole new ballgame for me.  Is there anything particular to this vehicle I 
should be looking for?  Any and all input is welcome.

Mike
