OK,
Just an update.

Sacramento got back to me right away.
I spoke with the guy in SanDiego and he will be calling me back shortly.
There will be two options
Buy it outright   or
get a heads up what day it will be in the yard and hit the yard first thing 
that morning.

The yard it is heading to will be in Chula Vista

More updates as they happen
