Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel bay?  German Translation

I used google.com to translate the German Diesel conversion site. 
This is of interest to me as I already run my Mercedes 300D on a 
biodiesel mix and wonder about changing over the Westy someday.

http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.birkmamero.de%2Fnews.htm&langpair=de%7Cen&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&prev=%2Flanguage_tools

Original site is http://www.birkmamero.de

The translation is somewhat humorous but you get what the fellow is 
talking about.

To do this manually, go to http://google.com select "language tools" 
and paste in the site you want translated from German to English. 
German and Spanish woork best but they are testing many other 
languages.
