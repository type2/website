Has anyone done this conversion?  How tricky is it.  I see there's a =
little banter in the archive about it, but I'd like some words of wisdom =
from someone who's actually been there & done that.  Also if you have a =
sunroof that you'd like to trade for a poptop I'd be interested in =
exploring some sort of trade.  I'm in the Seattle area.
