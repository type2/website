HI Folks,
	Anyone have a single 2 liter P&C available (83 Vanagon).  

I pulled the 1&2 side apart this weekend (102F here yesterday "but it's
dry heat, yeah!".  The number 2 piston decided to leave a little bit of
its top land stuck to the cylinder wall, seized both compression rings and
a broken oil ring.  Still got 130psi when hot but the light tap, tap, tap
didn't 'feel' right. The #1 looks fine.  All else looks well enough to
leave alone.  Thanks. jon
