Hi Kyle,

I live in Livermore and take my bus to Old Volks Home in Santa Cruz. In 10
years of ownership, I've tried a number of other places including
Bugformance and a shop in Berkeley (forget the name).

If you want to try OVH here's the number and ask for Tony (tell him I sent
you...might not --help, but can't hurt)	825-475-3394. Tony is a genius with
VDubs AND he's honest.
Good luck.

Renate Angeli
'78 Westy

I'm lookin for a VW knowledgeable person in the san francisco/san jose area
to take my 79 westy to.  It needs engine work.  Seems to be a problem with
the number 3 piston, but not sure how deep rooted it is.

One place recommended replacing the engine w/ a rebuilt, but wanted
$2,500-$3,000+ and I don't have that kind of $$.

Maybe you know of someone or maybe you have the necessary know how and are
that someone.
If so, I would appreciate names and numbers.  It is pretty urgent.

Gregs VW doesn't work on late model engines.
Bugformance of Sunnyvale has been jerks every time I've dealt with them.
Fred's VW did un unsatisfactory job and gave me ridiculous quotes when I
took it there.
I called a couple other places, but they were way too booked up.

Thanks a lot,
Kyle
