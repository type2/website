Ok,

I'm going try a little here....some of your descriptions leave a lot out.

model westy. it seems to run
> with no fuel pressure


Scuse me?  No fuel pressure?  How do you know?
What does your fuel pressure gauge show when it is running...zero?
Does it ever go above zero?  Is the fuel pressure gauge any good?
Have you tested the fuel pressure gauge on compressed air on anything 
else?

#3  its' running and then you unplug the afm?
    then? the fuel pump shuts off?...hmmmmm, if the fuel pump is off
    then you should lose pressure in the lines if it's trying to run
    but you said it ran with no pressure in the fuel ring....I don't get 
    it.

#4  if you unplug the brake booster line it should die unless it
    is running incredibly rich....probably should die when you do that
    no matter what.

Overall, I would say that you have some injectors that are stuck
wide open, along with the cold start valve(if that model has one).

Otherwise, some condition with the pressure regulator.

You *have* to get a fuel pressure reading somewhere along the way.

Cheers, dave
