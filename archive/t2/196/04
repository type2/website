Subject: piston/cyl cleaning & resto

I'm in the thick of my first rebuild here, and now I'm down the pistons &
cylinders.  The main problem with the engine has been the head (the 3/4
side needs to be rebuilt, since the #3 exhaust valve seat dropped).  So,
now I'm inspecting the pistons and cylinders for wear.  Any tips for
cleaning and restoration of these guys?  Looks like lots of carbon is
burnt on the piston heads - I can't even read any the supposed spec info.
The cylinders are pretty rusty on the outside, but seem to be fine
inside (ie: no obvious signs of wear such as scoring or strange wear
patterns).

So, what types of solvent can/should be used to clean these parts up?  How
do I scrape off the burnt carbon deposits?  I am afraid to scratch the
pistons too much.

As for the cylinders, I'd like to eventually paint these black to help
with heat dissipation once they are cleaned.  What kinds of paint can be
used on these rusty things?  Will POR-15 work or will these get too hot?

Sure would be nice to get fancy new cylinders (check these guys out:
http://www.lnengineering.com/) to help cut down heat, but $750+ seems a
bit steep ;^)
