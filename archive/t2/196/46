V8 in the back of the bus) mounted flat under the front floor (under your
feet up the front) with a scoop just below the front bumper feeding above
the radiator. Sorry I don't have any pictures that I can find. The fan
was below the radiator sucking through the radiator and blowing down. It
was very neatly done (could even pass as factory!). I have seen another
variation (also cooling a Leyland V8) with the radiator under the middle
of the bus, but they had overheating problems.

The keys to a good radiator installation are:

Sufficent radiator size
Sufficient airflow (both moving and stationary)
Prevention of recirculation of hot air.

Of these, the last is usually the one ignored by retrofitted buses.  The
air intake must be separated from the outlet by some sort of ducting.
I've seen people go to huge 4-core radiator and experience overheating
with a 1800cc Subaru engine simply because air gets recirculated through
the radiator.
