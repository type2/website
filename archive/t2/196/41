A subject close to my heart :-)

Go visit this guy's site, he sticks diesels in bays for a living. 
http://www.birkmamero.de/news.htm

I am translating his manual from German to English with some software we 
have at work and a friend's help. Going very slow tho. He mounts 2 
radiators with fans in different places. He also uses the vanagon diesel 
bellhousing, whihc bolts right on to your tranny. This puts the diesel 
engine at a 50 degree angle, which was the standard angle for vanagons 
too. Requires the vanagon diesel oil pan and pickup tho. Plenty of room 
under the engine lid. You need to fabricate a rear engine mount.

This company sells engine conversion kits for Vanagons. They sell their 
diesel kit for $995 available in 15 degree and 50 degree angle. Your going 
to need most of what you see there for your bay conversion, probably 
easier to buy the kit and modify for bay use then start from scratch. They 
have pictures of their engine carriers on their page.
