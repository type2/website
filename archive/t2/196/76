Subject: sticking valves

I recently purchased a new engine from bap and after running it locally for 
100 miles or so I decided to take it on a 2 hour drive on the thruway. The 
exhaust valve on number 2 must have stuck and the end of the pushrod on the 
lifter got smooshed in. After replacing it and driving home by the time I got 
home the thing was running awful. So I pulled the covers and cylinder 3 and 4 
both had the same problem. What is causing this and if it the valves sticking 
why do they stick.
