Uncle Dave,

We just pulled a fox engine today and should be bolting it up to a Baja 
Bug via a Kennedy adapter kit in the next
few days.  From what I understand, the same thing is possible with a 
diesel engine and a bay window bus, but
the diesel engine (or maybe it was just a TDI engine?) has a  larger 
intake manifold and won't quite fit into a bay
without modifying (read: removing) the spare tire well -- if you choose 
to mount the engine at 45 deg -- or making a
riser platform for your bed if you choose to mount it vertically (or 
15-18 deg).

I'll double check tomorrow on whether this is just the TDI or if it's 
all jetta/rabbit diesel engines.

Roadcow also has a pop-top:  http://www.mcn.org/b/roadcow/picts.html
so that shouldn't stop you from mounting your radiator on the top.  If 
you don't want to do that, I expect you could mount
your radiator(s):
	
     a) inside your air scoops -- two small radiators would probably work 
and shouldn't pre-heat your intake air too much
     b) on the side with a scoop and a cooling fan -- if you go this 
route, I'd go BIG because you're probably not going to
	 get as much airflow by default as you'd like
     c) rear-mounted:  the distance from the bellhousing to the end of 
the apron in a type-1 engine is 22", the rabbit
           engine is 19", this gives you 2-3" to play with mounting a 
radiator, and, given that you should already have
           positive pressure in your engine compartment, you'll have 
forced airflow through the radiator, but less access
           to the engine...
     d) on the roof, ala RoadCow...
     e) on the front of the bus, hidden in a faux spare tire -- this 
requires a LOT of plumbing, perhaps an upgraded H2O pump,
	and probably an H-valve with a thermostat which doesn't start 
passing H2O to the radiator until you hit 170-200 deg
     f) on either side of the tranny? -- this recreates the existing 
problem of extra heat getting to your engine, but may not be
	a concern with a water-cooled block

Personally, I like the idea of two smaller radiators mounted in a 
creative place -- like on either side of the tranny or in
the path of the air coming through the intake scoops, but I think this 
is harder to maintain and might require drilling
to mount effectively.  As a result, I think the RoadCow sol'n is 
probably the simplest and most elegant.

I'll keep you posted on our progress with the H2O Fox engine (1.8) and 
how hard it is..

One other thing you might consider is making it possible for your diesel 
engine to run veggie-oil while you're
doing the conversion -- if this is something that interests you : ):
