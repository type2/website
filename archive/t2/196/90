Subject: sticky valves

We just installed a new engine in our 71 bus from BAP, after running around 
town for about a week we decided to hit the open road and drove about 2 hrs 
at 60mph. slept the night got up the next day and started to drive back after 
2 minutes it started popping through the carb and had no power. pulled over  
figured out #2 was the issue, pulled the valve cover and found the pushrod 
for exhaust valve wedge between the rocker sticking out, so we pulled it and 
the end against the lifter was hammered. Got a spare popped it in ran fine. 
Drove most of the way home a little under power and 1 1/2hrs into our drive 
started popping again, but we got it home. pulled the valve cover to find #2 
was fine but #3 had the smooshed pushrod, so kept looking and it was starting 
to happen to #4, all exhaust valves. What causes this and if the valves are 
sticking what causes that. This is suppose to be a brand new engine.
