Richard,

I used some engine oil on mine.

My favorite on the gaskets is to use 3m weatherstrip adhesive on the valve 
cover side only ...applied sparingly.  Make sure that where the gasket 
will go on the heads that the heads are absolutely spotless and flat.

Took me about 45 minutes each side when I did this last(damn PO).

Do not *ever* use any sort of rtv on the gaskets!

Cheers, dave
