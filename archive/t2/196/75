check:

1.  Big hose (60mm?) that goes from filler to tank.
2.  Medium hose (20mm?)  that goes from connector at top of tank to vapor
recovery system.  Must remove firewall to get at this (this was a problem
with my '72).  Firewall can be removed without removing engine.  Loosen
motor mounts and lower engine.  Look out for the two "hidden" screws at the
bottom corners.
3.  Check fuel pump for leaks.
4.  Check for fuel leaking from fuel delivery tubing.
5.  Check for fuel leaking from carbs, especially the accelerator pumps.

Good luck.
