Michael,
	I have to disagree w/ you on this one. 212 was my initial thought
as well on what temp the oil should be. The I thought about a pot of
water on a stove. Now at sea level it should boil at 212F, but there
is some evaporation going on a lower temps. While the water vapor
will seperate from the oil at higher temps it should also seperate &
change to vapor at lower temps, just not as quick.
