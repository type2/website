Subject: carb question


Listees, 

I know this may be a silly question, but please bear with me. Last night I was expecting my new carb to get here, and it did'nt. ( My bus won't idle unless i keep the accelerator pressed and i figured a carb rebuild was in order anyway). Now fed ex says Friday with the holiday and all (argh!)
Anyway, I guess for the sake of it, I was poking around in my engine bay checking out how the wires and such were connected to my old carb so I know when I replace it. I noticed three things, of which I would imagine would be fairly significant. 

First, my electric choke seems loose. I dont mean the wire to it, I mean the unit itself. Where the wires connect. I dont see any screws to tighten it. Can this be done? Does it need it? 

Second, my electro magnetic cutoff valve seemed loose too. I tightened it by hand. How tight is this bugger supposed to be?

Third, and I guess most importantly. I only have one wire. Just the wire that does from the choke to the cut off valve. No wire from the cut off valve to the coil. Two questions here. First, where is this wire supposed to connect on the coil. And lastly for what purpose?  

Maybe if I had noticed these before hand I wouldnt have bought a new carb. Regardless though, I have to have the wired correctly to reinstall the new one. 

All help is appreciated!

Thanks!
