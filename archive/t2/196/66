Sound about right,, When I was learning about tires, I weighed my 74 Deluxe
Westfalia, and it was 3950lbs empty.. with about 1/2 tank of gas,

So,, I figure, add:
Wife blah blah Blah! pounds
Me at 200 pounds,
3 kids add up to 300 pounds 
our 700 pounds of gear,, and you end up with about 5350 lbs... and if you do the
math,, i added 50 lbs for the gas!
