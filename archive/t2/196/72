thought the san diego boys would be interested in this one as it looks like a bay needs saving.

 

Hello, collectors. The following vehicles are 
scheduled for July 6
delivery in the San Diego area:

77 CADI  DEVILLE
79 DATS  210
80 HONDA  CIVIC
77 HONDA  ACCORD
71 VOLKS  BUS

Again, if you are sincerely interested in making an 
appointment to go to
the dismantler to inspect and potentially buy any of 
these vehicles,
please let me know by responding to this email and be 
sure to specify
that the vehicle is in the San Diego area.

For the San Diego Area, we only have the above 
information so if you are
sincerely interested in further inspection, please 
respond to this email
and contact me if you have any further questions. My 
contact information
is below.

Thank you, Chuck B.
