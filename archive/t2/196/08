Subject: AFM's CO adjustment and emission test

Hello Volks,

   Failed emmisions test. What to do? Here are the numbers:

	           HC      CO
Cruise limit      220      1.2
  ""   Emmision    29      0.47
                  Pass     Pass

Idle Limit        220      1.2
""   Emission     108      1.38
                  Pass     FAIL

My settings:  Fresh rebuild ( 3 hours ) some road time. Valve gap currently
at .006"  7.5 BTDC, Idle  850 -950 rpm  CO screw adjustment is currently
screwed all the way in. Does that mean it is running as rich as it can?

Can I back out on the adj. screw with any luck?

I'm trying to avoid going to the shop for the $75.00 adjustment and
diagnosis charge. Any imput would be appreciated.

Craig in Seattle
