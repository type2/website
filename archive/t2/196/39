Subject: RE: [T2] Tire Question for Canadians

ive heard good thing about:

Continental CS21
Pirelli P400 LT
Khumo LT

All three are 8 ply i think

Khumo seems more cheap (ome guy found them at 56$ eahc in Montreal)
Pirelli a bit more expensive (70$) but smoother ride than Continental
Continental are the stocks one, sometimes hard to find, depends on =
shipping
but in Montreal easy to find!

I have Continental CR21 since 3 years, now i need new tires i think ill =
give
a try to Khumo LT
