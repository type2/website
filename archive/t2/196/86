Subject: Re: [T2] engine case and stuff

First off you might want to find out what "type" of engine it is. Type 1 or 
4? The most notable differences between the two would be the fan shroud, 
location of the oil cooler, and location of the alternator/generator. Also, 
there are some differences found on the underside of the engine on the oil 
sump.
Type 1- upright cooling system, some may call "doghouse". The oil cooler 
stands up verticle from the block and is inside the shroud, and the Alt/Gen. 
sit atop a stand. One plate on bottom of engine that has your oil plug.
Type 4- "pancake" shroud cooling system. The oil cooler lies on it's side, 
and the alternator is on the right side of the engine. There will be 
multiple "plugs" and bolts on the underside of the oil sump, and also an 
additional fitting that accepts a standard oil filter.

I only review these major differences so as to help you if you plan to sell 
the case. That will also give you an idea as to if the bore/stroke of the 
engine is stock.

If your engine is of the type 4 pursuasion (sp?) then visit this page for 
useful references: http://www.tunacan.net/t4/reference/index.html

Also, whether you have a type 1 or 4, check out my buddy Nate's page for 
VERY helpful tech tables to help you identify that engine based on the 
engine number: http://www.nateswaterart.com/vw//tech_tables/

Good luck! And if it happens to be a Type 4 case, please do reply as I'm 
looking to use a Type 4 for my Ghia and may be interested.

Have a great day!
