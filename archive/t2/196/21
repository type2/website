Subject: Rhino-lined engine compartment?

Does it sound like it would be a good idea to
Rhino-line my engine compartment? Rhino-liner is a
truck bed liner of inpenatrable plastic. It is sprayed
on at a place in nearby Cookeville. I think it would
annihilate the rust in the rear corner panel. First, I
would POR-15 the holy crap out of it. Well, do you
think I should do it? It would certainly have
sound-deadening capabilities as a pleasant
side-effect...
