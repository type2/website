 1) Incorrect valve / guide clearance- Lack of attention to detail
     during engine building process, guides must be reamed to size.
 2) Wrong guide material- the guides may be steel and not bronze.
 3) Defect in oil delivery- restriction in bearing circuit or defective
      oil pump, pressure control piston, oil is not getting where it should.
 4) Improper engine oil for ambient temperatures.
 5) High ambient temperature ( it was Hot today ).
 6) Sustained high speed driving above 65 mph.
 7) Don't continue driving when there is an obvious serious problem.

 Those pushrods got very hot, and so did the rest of the engine.
It's time for gauges-Verify idle and operating oil pressure / temperature.
Change the oil and check the strainer.
Check the timing and verify fuel for no lean condition.
Call BAP and check the warranty.
