That seems a real neat solution.  I had an old article somewhere I've 
mentioned a couple times of a turbo diesel converted '74 or so where 
they used two small (well large for motorcylcle) radiators mounted at 
angles back in the rear sides sucking air through the stock air scoops, 
ducting them off for forced ram induction, and using single electric 
fans on each.  The guy toured it all over SA and Africa in the late 
80's, article was in a 85ish VW T&A.  Good solution as although it 
required a lot of plumbing back in the engine compartment it didn't 
require any cutting.
