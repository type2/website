Subject: Re: Time to rebuild my '79 Westi

Hi Jack,

I, too am attempting a rebuild of my '79 Westy engine (well, a top end
rebuild).  Folks on the list have suggested these places to me:

* AVP (www.avp-worldwide.com): I am ordering heads from these guys.  They
do the special work to help the dropped seat problem.  They will also
optionally step-cut the heads to drop the CR a bit to aid in burning the
newer fuels.

* Boston Bob (http://www.bostonengine.com/)

I have also found:

* Jake Raby (http://www.aircooledtechnology.com/).  Jake posts to the
list and I have checked out his website.  Seems they take their rebuilds
seriously!

Good luck!
