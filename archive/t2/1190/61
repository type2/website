Greg, I don't know.  Although that is one damn nice bus, none of the ones I've
ever had (bus tanks mostly '76-'79) have had the valves painted, as that one
is, the same color as the tank.  And one of the stickers on the guard seems
gone and painted (though it isn't clear) whereas the Manchester sticker
could
just have been masked.  So without close inspection in person, I
wouldn't say
that the color there (particularly as it is supiciously a nice
primer or
machinery gray) is OEM.  I wouldn't say it isn't, again that is
a fine, fine
bus, but unless I pulled the tank off and believed I was the first
to ever do
so and found the color under the contact surfaces to the body
I wouldn't say
it was.
 
YMMV.
 
John
