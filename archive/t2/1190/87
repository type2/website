Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tanks

hmm,, I think you refer to a 5 lb cylinder.. ,,, the std BBQ cylinder is 
20lb, and that is 4.7 usGAL.
so a smaller one that holds 5lbs is 1.1 usGAL. http://tinyurl.com/blvpmyu

the 5 lb cyl can be a bit of a problem at the refill store.. some have a min 
charge of the 20lb cyl..
I used to refill my 5lb cyl from a larger 20 or 33 or even 100 lb cyl... but 
now those cyl have OPD, overflow protection device which doesn't allow the 
cyl to empty when it is inverted...
