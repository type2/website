Subject: Selling an original drive-away tent - $350

Hey Everyone,
I have an original VW drive-away tent (orange one with the grey floor 
and blue roof) that I'm selling for $350.  It's in great condition for 
being 30+ years old.  If I remember correctly, there are no tears or 
holes in the tent/screens and the zippers all work (I think.. I only set 
it up once).  My parents got it a long time ago when they purchased 
their bus and then they passed it on to me.  Most every other tent goes 
for at least $500, but I never use it so I figured I'd send it out to a 
good home for a very reasonable price.

I live in Long Beach, CA and if you want to buy it, you'll have to pick 
it up.  I will be moving up to San Francisco shortly, so if you're up 
there and you want it, we could arrange something.

Thanks,
Mike
