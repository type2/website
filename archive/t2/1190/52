Subject: Re: reclining seats

I' m working on a 77 bay transporter, as you can see by my previous posts ,
i'm a newby to the vw world.
Im working on putting semi truck seats im mine, air lumbar and bolsters,
heated leather.
They seem to be a very easy bolt in ,
just had to change the track mounts. I work at the factory so parts were no
problem, though you could do the same.
When i get them set( might be a little while), i can send you pics of the
install and fit.
These seats arent for everyone, some dont like the big truck look.
Just a thought to share.
