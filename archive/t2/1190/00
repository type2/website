Subject: Re: [T2] 77 baywindow oil leak

so far, suggestions you have:
 push rod tube seals... they drip, or weep .. no oil pressure here
and you have Oil filter mount gasket or oil cooler seals,, which puts out a 
"fair bit" of oil as it is under pressure..
and. you can look at the oil pressure switch, which imho.. is the part that 
fails the most.. and it puts out a fair bit of oil tooo..

see if you can pressure wash the area.. and then start it and watch for the 
drips to start..
