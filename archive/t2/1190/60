Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joints Replacement - '72 Weekender

Thanks for all this info. I took it to a mechanic here in town (works only on buses and vanagons) and he gave me a laundry list of items that need to be replaced, incldung the CV joints (and the rear brakes, master cylinder, and a few other things).

Between Atwell and Bentley, it seems pretty straighforward.
