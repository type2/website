Subject: Memorial Service for Larry

 I just want to Thank everyone so very much for all your kind words about my
husband, Larry. It makes me very proud to hear such wonderful things about him
and how he had touched so many lives ! He loved his family, his work, cars and
mission work, but i know that the Haitian people had a special place in his
heart. We have now made plans for a celebration of his life! It will be
Sunday, November 18 (-at-) 2pm and will be held at Snohomish Community Church -
13622 Dubuque Rd. Snohomish, WA. His grave side service will be at Tahoma
National Cemetery, November 19th (-at-) 11:30am, which is to honor him for his
service in the Army. Please pass the word along to others.... all are welcome!
God Bless, Paula Bailly.....taking care of the barn!  Larry ...............
