Hi Chris,

As I have been researching all of the propex and propane tank options for
my early bay I ran across this on the Bus Depot.

Apparently it will allow you to use it while driving. I haven't seen
anything saying you cannot use it while driving though so I am not sure if
it is needed.

Maybe Ron can chime in with what the intent of the Vim accessory.
