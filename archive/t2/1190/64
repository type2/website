John,

Yeah, I know nothing about that bus other than what I can see in the
pictures.

There are some odd things about the bus that make people question the
950ish miles. I'm curious to where the "Volkswagen" trim on the rear hatch
went.

There are a dozen little things that make people go "hmmmm".  But it is a
real nice bus.
