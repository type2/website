Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joints Replacement - '72 Weekender

     I am faced with the same task. I have completely rebuilt every suspension
part on my bus including the transmission, steering box, front beam, rear
suspension, ball joints (thanks Darrell),and so on. You should see my Bently.
It is just a pile of loose grease and grimy, finger printed pages. It has been
well used and abused. I believe my cv joints to be original and they are next.
     I have one brand new cv joint that was given to me that I will use. I am
going to tear all 4 apart, replace the worst one and clean and repack all the
rest. Hopefully I won't have to replace more than one.

Any suggestions on who makes the best boot kit?  I would like quality rubber
so it lasts.
