Subject: New Sliding Door "German"  Seal  from BD?

Just got a new sliding door seal from Bus Depot for my 71 bus- Very
disappointed in it. The corners that are glued on must be 1/8 smaller in
width and are not lined up well with the sides of the seal. 

 

Anyone got a new sliding door seal recently from someone else that they are
happy with please let me know

 

I called BD and they said all of them are like that. So much for "German"
quality I guess.

 

I might have to look for a Brazilian made one. I have to think there are
better ones out there.
