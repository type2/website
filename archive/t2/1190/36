Subject: FS: NOS Vanagon oil filler extension tube (80-83)

This fell out of something I moved today, I had forgotten I had it.  I will
never
own another air cooled Vanagon volks.  I believe I gave (kid you not)
about
$50 or so for this thing at the dealer 15 years ago.  It is the 2 part
plastic
extendable filler.  NOS, new, never used, never melted, from the
dealer.  No
filler cap, but yours should be fine.

Make me a reasonable offer,
I presume these are NLA.

John
