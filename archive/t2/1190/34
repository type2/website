Both of the seats slide forward to get off of their tracks, however, 
there's an additional latch to keep it from sliding of the track with 
the normal seat position adjuster.  Look on the left or right side of 
your seat and you'll see a small 1" or so lever that is stopping the 
seat from moving any farther forward.  Lift that lever, lift the normal 
seat adjusting lever, and then slide the seat forward and off of the tracks.
