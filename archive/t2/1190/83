Subject: Re: [T2] Dealing with Underbody Rust - '72 Weekender

Hey Jeffrey,

 

I'm sure you will hear a bunch of different paint options. POR-15 probably
has the best marketing campaign. I have used that as well as Master Series
(Google search and you'll find both of them). I'm partial to Master Series
now-but don't use it out of a plastic cup-it will eat right through. And
then get on your boots.

 

From what I remember when reading about this subject many times over the
years, most of the better quality products work great - AS LONG AS YOU PREP
PROPERLY! You really need to prepare the surface well-otherwise anything you
do will not last. I think sandblasting - if possible is probably the best
prep. You can also wire brush by hand, or with a grinder. Then try to
phosphoric acid stuff to 'neutralize any rusty surface before actually
applying anything else. 

 

At a minimum wire brush, and maybe sandpaper-if the surface is amenable to
you getting your hand in there with sandpaper.

 

Here are some pics of the underside of my '65 which I used Master Series on.
