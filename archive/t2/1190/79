Exactly my thoughts. Interesting bus all the same. I think my propane 
was black and I powder coated it black again years ago when I did a big 
batch of parts. Am not really all that worried about making it 101% 
authentic but I was curious if the tank had been painted before I 
painted it. I think the answer is no.
