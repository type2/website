Subject: Rubber seal to attach the drive-away tent to the bus

I was browsing one of the vendor websites and happened to see that they 
sold the rubber that is sewn to the drive-away tent used to attach the 
tent to the bus.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find which site I saw 
it on.  Does anyone know what site(s) sell this rubber seal?

Thanks!
Mike
