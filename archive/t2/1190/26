Subject: Discount for window rubbers package

Does anyone know of a retailer that will give a discount if an entire
window/glass sealing/rebuilding set/kit is bought at one time ?

This would be for a 1971. I am swapping out some windows in the rear, but it
will be for all 4-sides. May also decide to do the doors at the same time.
Windows for sure
