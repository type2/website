Subject: [T2] installing pop-top tent

Hey Everyone,
I'm installing a poptop tent on a 79 bus and I've gotten the top of the tent
installed and now I need to do the bottom part.  I know that some cuts need
to be made in the plastic moulding to make it curve around the corners, but
I'm really hesitant to do it.  Has anyone done this before and possibly have
pictures of what needs to be done in the corners.  I'm doing this for
someone else and I really don't want to screw it up.

Thanks!
Mike
