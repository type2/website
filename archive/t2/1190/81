And even then they'll last quite a while. My two outer CV joints boots 
were toast and I kept driving the van. They were still working over a 
year later (maybe 10K miles) without any noise - mostly short local 
trips but I did do one 500 mile trip with them. Young, dumb and broke 
was me back then.

Replaced both whole half shafts with a rebuilt axle/joints/boots.
