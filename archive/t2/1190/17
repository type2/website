Subject: Propex in an early bay?

As with each chilly fall day every year I think about better solutions for
heat than my Mr. Buddy running and making condensation appear everywhere.
Plus, it is hard to keep running while driving around.

I saw recently on a few parts sites new propane tanks, installation kits
for early bays, and propex heaters. Has anyone on this list installed this
combo on a camper that did not come with the propane tank?

I have been in a vanagon with the propex setup and it was nice.

My bus is a '71 Westy named KK-Louise and she might not like the heat but I
would. :)

Cheers,
Max
