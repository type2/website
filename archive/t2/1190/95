Nah... Just another user with their email password set to something  
easy to remember (and guess.) In the ISP world we see it ALL the time.

Mr. Rogers, change your email password please. Please use something  
more challenging than "password" or "123456" This is a good place to  
start. (I recommend 8 character minimum) http://strongpasswordgenerator.com/

We in the IT world appreciate it.

Jim
