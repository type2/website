Subject: Giving away bus parts!

Hey everyone,
I'm moving so it's cleanup time.  I'm going through the garage and 
finding a bunch of bus parts to give away.  I've got some late bay tin 
(both 72-74/79 and 75-78), intake runners, might have a flywheel or two, 
intake manifold, exhaust manifolds, gas tank (no rust!), and probably a 
few other items as I dig 'em up.  I live in Long Beach, CA and if you 
want the stuff, you gotta come pick it up as I don't have the time to ship.

Lemme know if you're interested!
