Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch testing/adjusting

Been driving on this clutch near 10,000 miles. No clue how many miles
on it before I snagged it from another motor.

But, after the T/O bearing dropping loose it is definitely slipping or
something else after putting it back together. Had a helper doing most
of the wrenching while I was dealing with customers on the phone after a
long closed weekend and he tend to get in a hurry. May have put
something in sideways when closing it back up.

I'm just going to order a complete new clutch kit. If this one looks
god I'll clean it up and set it aside as a spare.
