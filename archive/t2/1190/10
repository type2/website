Gerald it is a bit interesting, as usually to me 1, 3 go down more than 2, 4
even on T4 let alone T1 engines.  You can always retorque but I doubt it is
the issue, would presume the back of each head is looser for some reason,
which would be odd.  Usually if torque is the issue (and it probably isn't
anyway) one would presume one head or the other 1,2 or 3,4.  How recent is the
build/how many miles here?  Despite the seemingly large difference, that would
still meet VW spec, and I wouldn't sweat it greatly immediately.  I would
follow over time a bit.  And I presume good valve adjust before the readings?

Single port 1600

1-- 150
2 -- 130
3 -- 150
4
-- 130

2 came up to 140 with a little oil but 4 didn't. I'll try that again
in
case I didn't get much oil in 4.

20 psi difference rear to front. Maybe
heads need retorquing?
