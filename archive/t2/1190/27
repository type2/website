Subject: Re: [T2] Discount for window rubbers package

you're lucky! Ron provides the code LIST1E for you to use at 
http://www.busdepot.com/
I did my 74 recently, and found the good rubber worked the best.. by

BusDepot is VERY good at correcting errors! Sh!t happens,, but BD makes it 
right without issue.
