Mike, (and the list for anyone looking) although I'm sure you know it,
that is
a very, very reasonable asking price if the condition is as
you describe it.
Shit I gave $400 at least 17-18 years ago for mine, and thought it
was a deal
then.  I'd do this one in a second as a user if it didn't
cost the better part
of $250 to ship one to AK (a buddy just did
with one off samba this summer.)

$350
 
Hey Everyone,
I have an original VW drive-away tent (orange one with
the grey floor and blue roof) that I'm selling for $350.  It's in great
condition for being 30+ years old.  If I remember correctly, there are no
tears or holes in the tent/screens and the zippers all work (I think.. I only
set it up once).  My parents got it a long time ago when they purchased their
bus and then they passed it on to me.  Most every other tent goes for at least
$500, but I never use it so I figured I'd send it out to a good home for a
very reasonable price.
