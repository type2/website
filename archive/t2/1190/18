Subject: Re: [T2] Propex in an early bay?

Long long ago in a vanagon list far far away we did a group buy on Propex's. 
This was about '95 or so, so whatever was then the current model, Tom Forhan I
believe co-ordinated the buy though it might have been Derek Drew, might even
have been Karl Mullendore (who eventually became the east coast reseller) I
don't recall.  I installed a spare early vanagon tank in my then '78, though I
did have a couple bus sized tanks.  Thing would run for friggin ever on the
Vanagon tank, should be fine on a bus tank.  I had no other propane devices
initially, though I eventually also retrofitted a vanagon Dometic fridge in
that bus, and it would still run both near forever.  I cook with Coleman
fuel though.  The fridge I left, the Propex I have with me and need to
eventually install it in the '77.  Does wonderfully in a Bay, warms you up
nice and toasty.  I used it on the move, at rest, to warm up before driving,
worked fine for me in all those
 instances.  I installed under back seat, took one vent forward in the
cabinets, one just there in the back, did the exhaust and intake out the
drivers side, mounted the tank under passengers, plumbed with copper (back
then you needed a metric to US adapter on the Propex) just like stock vanagon
plumbing.
 
YMMV.

As with each chilly fall day every year I think
about better solutions for
heat than my Mr. Buddy running and making
condensation appear everywhere.
Plus, it is hard to keep running while driving
around.

I saw recently on a few parts sites new propane tanks, installation
kits
for early bays, and propex heaters. Has anyone on this list installed
this
combo on a camper that did not come with the propane tank?
