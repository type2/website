harder to start... still fiddling. but Sandy disrupted things a bit 
although no damage and I and my family are all ok.

guage sometimes is "flakey"  reads same range but occasionally at 
different places on the guage.   one time it was between 16-18 knew it 
wasn't right, turned off engine and started it back up and was back in the 
11-13 range.  which is most common location.
