Subject: Clutch testing/adjusting

I have the rear of the bus off the ground right now (I'll post about
that later).

Should the engine stall if the bus is in first and I hit the brakes
while the wheels aren't actually loaded with "bus weight"?

Ie. Do I need to loosen the clutch cable a bit if the brakes don't
stall the bus in first? It "feels" about right with the "push down the
pedal with your hand" method but the engine keeps idling with the brake
down hard and the wheels stopped in 1st gear. that seems like a whole
lot of slip.
