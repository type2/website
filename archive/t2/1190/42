Subject: Re: Propex in an early bay?

I have been looking into this a bit further and it seems the only thing I
would need to fabricate for installing the propane tank would be some l
brackets with angle iron. The tank would then bolt to those brackets. A
nice fellow did a good write-up of adding a second propane tank to his bay
and shows the brackets he made.

Even though I have camped with plenty of folks who have a propane tank I
have never looked to see how it is mounted to the chassis.

After mounting the tank I would just need to plumb the Propex propane line
to the tank. I am imagining installing the tank on the driver side and the
Propex inside of my rear jump seat with an outlet facing toward the rear
cabin and another directed towards the front cabin.

Now I just the Propex, a propane tank, mounting hardware, knowledge, time,
etc... but thanks for feeding my fantasy.
