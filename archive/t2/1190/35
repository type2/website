Subject: Re: [T2] installing pop-top tent

does he have a page that show the installation.. it looks like he got stuck 
when he had the wrong canvas shipped to him

one thing I can say,,, don't install it upsidedown... the window flaps hang 
down when open..
i.ve seen far tooo many installed unside down..
