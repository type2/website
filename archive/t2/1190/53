Subject: CV Joints Replacement - '72 Weekender

Next on the list is the replacement of the CV joints on my b72. I see the
entire axle advertised on Bus Depot:  http://www.busdepot.com/211501203

Wouldnbt it be easier (and cheaper) to buy the entire axle with CV joint
already installed versus buying four and using the old axles?

Otherwise, here is the CV Joint and boot kit I was looking at:
http://www.busdepot.com/251598101 (x4?)

I do not know if the entire axle includes the LobroCV joints or a lesser
quality.

Thoughts? Thanks...from a mechanically challenged bus owner.
