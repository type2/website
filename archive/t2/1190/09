OK, the rest of the story.

This is a motor that I had in storage since 2003 and put into service
in 2010. I'm not even sure it's a 1600. When I first got it I was told
it had about 3000 miles on a rebuild. I split the cost of a bus with a
friend who had a good engine but a body that was falling apart and
couldn't find a decent, motor-less, bus locally. He took the body, I
took the motor.

I have no idea if the heads were initially torqued to spec. Or if they
were retorqued after break in.

It's been running strong for the last almost-3 years and roughly 8000
miles.

A few months ago I started running a little rich. Not horribly so, just
enough to get a whiff before full warmup (this is SE Texas, still in
the 70's most days).

About 1000 miles ago I adjusted the valves and checked dwell and
timing right before a 200 mile (one way) weekend trip.

Still rich after that trip in mid Sept and another (250 miles one way)
in mid Oct plus I could feel an intermittent miss. I figured the 3 year
old AutoZone plug wires were starting to break down.

So, with a 150 mile (one way) trip coming up this Friday I ordered
a good set of Taylor wires and bought a new set of NGK 4210 (B5HS) plugs
(to replace the AutoLites that were all I could find last time).

I figured I should check compression while I had all the plugs out. 

How would valve lash affect compression if there's not one stuck open
and the compression reading is built up over several revolutions of the
motor?

I'll crawl under with a go-no-go feeler in a bit when I'm sure my
customers are pretty much done calling me for the night and check the
valves again the recheck the compression. I have to put it back
together tonight for a test run and some shopping tomorrow for the
trip.

I'll report back afterward. I'm just wondering about the 20psi
differential between the front and rear cylinders. 130+ all the way
around says there is no need for a teardown in the near future.

Thanks,

Gerald
