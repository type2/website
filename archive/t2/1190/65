I live in no-VW-parts-land. 24 hours minimum to get anything. Had the
bus ready to go except the clutch so I grabbed what I had handy.

I'm going to toss it, but only because I thing it got sprung when the
T/O bearing came loose. The disc and pad themselves look VERY good. No
significant wear.

I pull the motor at least once a year for one thing or another. takes
under an hour each way (out and back in) on a bus that has the
removable valance. And, if the phones are slow I do it all while I'm
"working" at the office.

Going to use this opportunity to engine-brite the motor and tranny to
see if I can spot a VERY slow oil drip that has gotten spread all over
the place through the last couple of years. When I'm stopped it drips
directly on something very hot and I create a nice smoke screen. But it
doesn't even use a quart between 3000 mile oil changes.

Thanks,

Gerald
