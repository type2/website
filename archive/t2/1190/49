Rust...
 
No really.
 
Rust...
 
That is a funny question, the Manchester's on
Vanagon's were certainly white,
as I think was by then required by law (though
I guess they still sell silver ones
for airstreams.)  I have never had a bus
tank that wasn't just rust, but I do feel
in my heart that they were
brown/beige, or black, not white at least, though I certainly
can't speak for
honest sure on that.  The paint quality of Manchester is just
dismal, any
tank, any year, even the one on my EVC with under 50k miles was
rusting in
sheets of peeling powdercoat by the time it was 8 years old.  Just
dismal.  A
thorough blasting and coat of DP-40 followed by Rustoleum rattle can
white has
held the EVC tank with narry a nick for another 10+ years.  So much
the glory
of powder coat in the rust belt.

What was the original color of the
propane tank on the Westfalia?
