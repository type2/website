John,
       You could always route your propex exhaust up the back of the bus like
the dog mushers do with their trucks. ;)  Make a real Alaska install.

 For those of you "outside", the mushers put long extensions on their
tailpipes to get the exhaust above the dog box.  Keeps the exhaust gases away
from the dogs, both in their boxes, and when they are on their tie chains
along the side of the truck.

The propex is a nice sized heater.  I have a toyotomi NS-2800 in my boat, and
it is just a bit too big (physically) for the van. Heats my boat to comfy at
any temp though.  Sadly NLA. Lots of boat folks use the Dickenson heaters,
both fuel oil and propane.  They only have a small circulation fan, and can
even run with it off, so draw a lot less battery power.
