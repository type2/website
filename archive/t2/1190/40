Correct. 

Bus is blocked up with the drive wheels in the air. 

Use clutch to put it in first.

Wheels turn as expected

Foot off of clutch -- on brake

Wheels stop turning, engine continues idling

Foot off brake, wheels start turning again.

Didn't leave foot on brake or engine running in gear long enough to see
if I would get a burning clutch smell.
