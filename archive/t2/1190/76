Subject: Propane tanks

When we travelled and lived in our bus for 7 months back in 2001,
we met some Canadian folks at that big Seattle get together who had a small 5
gallon propane tank that they kept with them for their bus cooking needs, so,
at first opportunity, we bought one from Canadian Tire, (I seem to recall).

Friends who have seen my small(er) tank all want one.

Cabela's has them, I have just come to discover.
A bit pricey, but very handy to have.
