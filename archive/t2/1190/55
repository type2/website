Well, that was your first mistake - should have just gotten a new one 
then and there.  I made the same mistake and I had a clutch burn in the 
seized position right outside of SF.  Luckily I was able to speed-shift 
all the way around SF and make it to my parents place where I changed 
out the clutch.

As one wise mechanic told me, if you have the engine out, change the 
clutch.  You probably (hopefully) won't have the engine off for another 
40-60,000 miles and at that time you'll probably end up changing the 
clutch again.  It's one of those things that just makes sense to change 
when you've got then engine off.

throw it out because the next time you'll change the clutch, it will be 
with a new one.  It's only about $150 and you'll spend $300 just to have 
the engine removed, unless you're doing it yourself.  But even then, 
what's your time worth?!
