I use mine on the move all the time.  If you are buying a propex kit that
includes all the pipes sand such, then I think you would be fine.
From the
Propex website(http://www.propexheatsource.co.uk/support.php?content=airfaq):
Q: Can the heaters be used while vehicles are moving?
A: Yes, subject to the
relevant regulatory requirements. 


The metal concertina piping (or whatever
it is called) for the combustion intake and exhaust holds its shape pretty
well and you'll only need some small bracketing or wire to hold it place.
The
combustion exhaust should be pointing toward the rear of the vehicle and
slightly downward. If, for some reason, you got your bus on a train and your
bus is pointing opposite of the direction of travel, then I would not use it.
Also remember to mount the exhaust such that it is not going out toward the
side of your sliding door.  I suppose this is really only important if you use
an awning that attaches to the side with the sliding door.



I've also found
their documentation to be decent enough that anyone competent could do an
installation and basic troubleshooting.

You don't
even have to use their thermostat unit. If you have a toggle switch and an old
passive house thermostat (you should be able to find one really cheap new),
then you're good to go.

If in doubt, then contact Propex.

I've found them to be helpful,
even when trying to rig up your own controls.

I'm still trying
to figure out this Propex - can I use it while driving down the road? And the
main advantage of it is that I can have heat in the bus when parked without
the propane condensation?

Thanks,
