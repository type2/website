chris,
 
By the book I don't recall on the drive it down the road,
practically, just like a Dometic
fridge in a vanagon, yes, sure I used mine
all the time, though it is meant for stationary
camping installation in your
favorite caravan, boat, etc.  Using it on the road is probably
somewhat
dependent on the location of the BURNER air intake and exhaust and
relative
pressure differential and draft that can be set up between same.   In my
experience, worked just fine on the '78 with them simply taken out to the
drivers
side edge of the bus.
 
So for question #2, yes exactly.  Just like a
modern home high efficiency furnace
(or when you think about it a 30-40 year
old BA-4/6 gas heater) this has a totally sealed
combustion chamber.  Hence no
propane condensation, but more importantly no
concern for CO buildup (other
than what might waft in through holes in ones floor,
or an open jalouise
window) with these.  Just like a modern home HE furnace.  Just
like with a
BA-6 one would be smart to be sure that you didn't use it in a big snow
without being sure the burner ducting was free to vent, but for all I know
they might
even have safety shutdowns down for that possibility now days in
the nanny world.
 
Works like a champ.
 
I don't know what Karl gets for them
now days, back with the group buy price about
$350 each (mid 90's $$$) and the
last I looked they didn't have seemed to keep up
with inflation actually.  But
there may be other cheaper alternatives driving cost
down now days.  I can
just say the Propex worked wonderfully.  I really need to put
it in my '77 but
just haven't used it in the winter up here.
