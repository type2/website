Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tanks

Bob was that a short version of the 20lb, or a smaller overall tank.  I had
one that
was a short version of a 20lb, and was damn convenient, but was an
old one
without OPD and eventually I couldn't get it filled.  The tank bit was
little more than
the two domes joined together, might have had just a short
straight section, I
think it held about 6-7lb as I recall.  Overall it was
however a bit more than 1/2
the height of a regular one as the valve guard and
the base ring were still the
same size.  But it was nice to have, we used it
to run propane lanterns back
when I was in scouts as a kid.
 
I've seen a nice
small one (at Sportsman's Warehouse) that sort of looks like
a fully scaled
down version of a 20lb, and it is nice, but like you mention there
at least it
costs something like 2-3 times what a regular BBQ tank costs.

When we
travelled and lived in our bus for 7 months back in 2001,
we met some Canadian
folks at that big Seattle get together who had a small 5
gallon propane tank
that they kept with them for their bus cooking needs, so,
at first
opportunity, we bought one from Canadian Tire, (I seem to recall).

Friends
who have seen my small(er) tank all want one.

Cabela's has them, I have just
come to discover.
A bit pricey, but very handy to have.
