all four need replacing.

Agreed. I would pull them apart and inspect for wear and repack with grease.
Make sure you use the correct grease. When I pulled mine apart soon after
purchase of the van, the grease in one CV poured out like thick oil. I suspect
some "mechanic" had packed it with ordinary grease. Fortunately there was no
damage to the joint...
