Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch testing/adjusting

Here I go making something complicated out of something simple - do you 
have the right parts? As I recall a buddy and I were screwing around 
with a '70 Baywindow twenty five years ago and it had the wrong mix of 
pressure plate, throwout bearing, cross arm, clutch and and the bus 
wouldn't move.

Basically we had a pile of parts and tried to mix and match something 
together.
