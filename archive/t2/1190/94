OK, John. Are you totally in with this scam or just amazingly ignorant of
the tools of charlatans, up front and center.

Home Cash Profits being pushed hard to mine info is what it is.

Pop ups unsolicited that won't let you leave the page, accept this option
or that option and no way to leave the page. Got to agree with our demands
or we will foul up your browsing session.

And your mistake is, NO T-2 RELEVANCE whatsoever.

T-2 admin needs to keep an eye on John Rogers.
