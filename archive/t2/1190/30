Subject: installing pop-top tent

Hey Everyone,
I'm installing a poptop tent on a 79 bus and I've gotten the top of the 
tent installed and now I need to do the bottom part.  I know that some 
cuts need to be made in the plastic moulding to make it curve around the 
corners, but I'm really hesitant to do it.  Has anyone done this before 
and possibly have pictures of what needs to be done in the corners.  I'm 
doing this for someone else and I really don't want to screw it up.

Thanks!
Mike
