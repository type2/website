Subject: westfakia, Greg Potts

I have a 73 Westy  without fiberglass roof and a 74 donor Westy with roof.
 Plan on doing a Westfakia conversion to get double bed upstairs.  Greg
Potts had pics on his website showing the complete conversion a while back,
but apparently his website is not up and running anymore.  Anyone have any
contact info, know of a new website or have pics or info on the conversion?
 Thanks
