Hmmm. Like many others here I have had the experience of "surface rust"
turning into gaping holes with the vigorous application of a screwdriver! The
main thing is, don't be shy poking around with the screwdriver. If it's solid
metal you won't hurt it pushing by hand under there. Hopefully it does turn
out to be surface rust but you want to be sure before you spend a lot of time
applying paint or whatever to find the rust comes through again.
