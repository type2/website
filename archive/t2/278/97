Subject: Bustoberfest and Hubcap

We had a wonderful fall Bustoberfest campout.  25 busses showed up for the
event.  It was cool, but the sun came out on Saturday.  Wonderful campfire
music provide by NQ and other Buskatiers.  Of course we had TONS of food, I
swear midwest people are the best cooks, must be that farm country
background.

Steve Walters from the Colorado Bus Club showed up with the hubcap.  It is
always good to see Steve and it was fun to once again see the hubcap and all
the "stuff" that goes with it.  I think Steve is going to pass it around CO
for the winter and it will make it's next showing at BBB in Havasu.  Steve
travelled 8 hours one way to be at Bustoberfest again this year.

The long distance award once again goes to Britt Grannis of "Road Cow" fame.
Britt made an unexpected entrance Saturday afternoon delivering a Rabbit
'vert for one of the Buskatier's daughters.  Only a couple people knew he
was coming, so it really surprised us.

It may have been a bit chilly, but with little propane and electric heaters,
veryone slept warm.  I pulled my Scamp again this year and with the furnace,
the Scamp stayed 70 degrees inside all weekend even with the outside temps
close to freezing.  This made a great oasis for my 4 year old who spent a
lot of time coloring, playing with barbies and watching movies.

We have some great bus people here in the midwest who aren't afraid to drive
their busses even if they may get stuck in some nasty weather (one of the
attendies had to drive through snow getting home).  We all had a great time
and no one wished they had stayed home.
