Hiya Bob,

I've had the wheels, bumpers, brackets, and splash pans powder coated on my 
1970 Bus.  I'd do it again in an instant.  The casual observer cannot tell it 
from original paint.  The wear characteristics are vastly superior to paint.  
All one needs to do to get into "Day One" shape is to wipe the surface down 
and spray it at the local carwash.  Definitely the way to go - the parts look 
brand new and stay that way.

By the way my total bill for doing all of the above (two colors and some 
other hardware included) was a shade less than $200.
