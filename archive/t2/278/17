Subject: Re: [T2] accessory vespa for bus

I don't mean to make any one feel bad but during my
Navy tour I had a 68 vespa that I used to take with me
on a P3, in the bomb bay. That little scooter went all
over the world it was the 125cc and would run 60 MPH
longer than your back could stand it. I think it would
work well in a bus. It is still alive my son has it,
it's very hard to find the 6V lights for it now. the
new ones have 12v systems and work much better. Phil
