Subject: water in the booster  update

I wrote to a brake booster rebuilder [John Stuart via "Brent Walker"
<jstuart(-at-)netrover.com>] to ask if they had any idea how water can accumulate in
the brake booster?

I indicated 
Mid 70's Vw transporter chassis
water filled to the vac inlet on the master cyl side of the booster.
just so you know,, read that again,, "on the master cyl side of the booster"
no apparent vac leaks in the hoses
recent rebuilt booster from them
when the engine is started, it pulled the pedal to the floor.  This is the
siphon the vac creates on the water in the master side,,, so it is air over
hydraulic action.

I got a reply to check to see if it is coolant instead of water.......  Doh!
I guess he didn't know vintage Vw uses AIR as coolant!

I replied to tell him about air-cooled engines, 
now  *he*  is also baffled as how water can get into that chamber

still no where!
