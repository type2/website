Hi Wayne,

I suppose that would greatly depend on where you were when you needed 
to set the timing.  True story:

Jamie Auch's 71 Deluxe overheated on the highway while he was up here 
for Buses Of the Corn. We pulled over at the side underneath a major 
overpass. (Hwy 401 under Allen rd, for those in the know.) We hoped the 
overpass would offer some protection from the broiling August sun. 
Twelve lanes of traffic on a busy Saturday afternoon made it completely 
impossible to hear the engine running, never mind hearing the points 
arc. Luckily, we had a light, and were able to static time the engine 
and get rolling again.

The timing light we used to set the dizzy can be found at the dollar 
store hearabouts; sixty-three cents $US.

Happy trails,
