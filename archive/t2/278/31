I think it was Gene Berg (or was it John Muir) who
said that you should do your own rebuild, as no one
else cares as much about the quality of work that goes
into it as you do.
Anyway it was one of those opinionated guys who worked
on a lot more VWs than I ever will, and it is good
advice.  If you don't know enough to do the job, just
think of the education you will give yourself by the
time you are done.
