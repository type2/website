HI Susan,
I am aware of the "problem", but ...........
I am not sure as to why this has seemed to be such.

Have there been accidents due to the powder coating,
or were the accidents due to improperly torqued lug bolts that just 
happened to be on powder coated wheels?

It seems as though you might have an insight to the problem, but I'm afraid 
I did not understand what you meant by "edge of the seat".

Is there some inherent problem in keeping properly torqued lug bolts seated 
at the specified and accurately applied values on the powder coated surfaces?

Is there some required special design and application practice that must be 
used when powder coating around and through lug bolts holes?
