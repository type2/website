We used a generic bike rack from Target ($39 I think) on the back of my '73 to carry two bikes.  It worked well enough although there were two minor issues - first the strap adjusters tended to slip which let the rack sag down occasionally.  Solved this by knotting the adjuster straps.  The other problem is that it isn't possible to open the engine hatch without removing (or at least loosening) the rack.
