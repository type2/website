This one's got me, too. I read to use bleach somewhere, but it doesn't seem 
to touch the mildew I've got up there, and kinda turns it from yellow to 
white. I've also tried Woolite brand carpet cleaner with a brush, I'm just 
taking the fuzz off so I've left mine alone for awhile. I hear the fuzz can 
be replaced, that it comes in a spray bottle of some variety.  Anybody else 
on this one?
