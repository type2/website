Subject: Seat covers!

Help!  I'm attempting to replace the seat covers on the 2 front seats of
a 79 bus.  I have the TMI kit with leatherette covers, foam pads, and
spring cover material.  Material really looks nice.  This is the kind
that fits into a groove around the outside of the seat bottom (no hog
rings).  I can't get it all on the frame together at one time.  The foam
seems about 3" too big, and the cover seems about 6" too small!  I
havn't yet started on the back, and there is still a passenger seat to
go.  What's the secret?  Am I just not cramming hard enough? Should I
take the whole business to a pro and PAY the $$!!$ quoted?
