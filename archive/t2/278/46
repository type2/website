$40-$50 per steel wheel is average+.
Cheaper to do if you can sandblast yourself.
More than half the cost is surface prep.
Somebody on the list can get one ( or a whole
dozen :) done for $40, with a slight price increase
for color change mid-job. Search the archives from
this past summer if he doesn't surface soon.
