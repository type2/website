John,


I've done one of mine so far and it went on pretty well I think.

You need a helper and the material needs to be somewhat warm...as in left 
in the sun for awhile.

I used some "sisal" that Wolfsburg or wcm sells to go over the springs
before I put the foam cover on...everything on my old ones had fallen 
apart.

It is *supposed* to fir tight!
You *do* have the bottom and back apart?....

Leave the seat bottom inside out and place it fairly close to where
it will look good on the seat.  Turn everything upside down on the floor
and hold the bottom of the seat(the metal part) down against the floor
with your knee(or maybe both) to compress the springs some....and hold
the foam where it should stay.

Now roll the new seat material up around the edges(all the way around) and 
while compressing the springs with your body weight on your knees, tuck it 
into the groove.

I started tucking on one rear corner and worked around to the other side
so that the ends came out evenly at the rear.  Afterward, you can use
your hands to pull the leatherette around to make the seams match up on 
the edges.....sure helps if it is warm!

The seat back is a little harder as you literally pull it down over
the frame and cusion.  The hard part is getting it stretched over where
you can attach it over the hooks correctly...front side gets pulled under
and put over the hooks first....you really need a helper for this one!

Cheers, dave
