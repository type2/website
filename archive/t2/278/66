Subject: Bolt for CV Joints

I was just about to buy a torx tool for the CV joint bolts (mine aren't
allen heads), but then I noticed that there are more splines on the
bolts than on a torx bit.  Does anyone know kind of tool is used for
these bolts and where can I get one?  They don't seem to have them at
sears.

thanks,
Mike
