Subject: Junkyards in Bay Area (SFO)

Hi,

I'll be in San Francisco tomorrow and I was wondering if any of the listees 
in the Bay Area
knows which junkyard of the type "pick and pull" have buses at this time. 
Last time I was down
there I could only find one bus in all of the 5 pick & pull's around SFO 
and it took me one whole
day to find it.

Thanks a lot,
Rogelio
