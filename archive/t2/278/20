amen to that!  

the classic vespa is not about looking cool...I mean come on you are on a 
scooter how cool can you look...until about two years ago this was a true 
statement but the people who will still be riding their vespas in 5 years(me) 
are not worried about looking cool they just love the fun of turning wrenches 
and riding everywhere. granted im not as hardcore as the die hard ride all 
year crowd but I live in chicago and we have harsh winters.  I drive my bus 
in the winters so that counts for something right?

anyway I didnt mean to offend anyone, just stating my opinion.
