Subject: quarter light glass

My '73 bus was attacked last night, with someone putting their hand
through the driver's side quarter light and opening the door.  Bizarrely
they left the radio, and took a box of records on the back seat and two
bottles of wine.  Does anyone in the Cambridge UK area have a spare
quarter light they could sell me?  Or does someone know a vw parts
distributor who has some second hand glass, as quotes for the new light
have been pretty high.

 

Thanks very much
