Subject: no arrow on piston

I am installing a used piston (because my other one burned) and the one
that I got doesn't have an arrow on it because of carbon deposits.  Does
the arrow relate to the writing on the inside of the piston?  How can I
figure out which way to put it in?

Any help would be appreciated so I can install the piston properly.

thanks,
Mike
