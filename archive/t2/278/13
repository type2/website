Subject: Drive Flange Seal

Here's a strange problem:

I replaced the oil seals and o-rings on my tranny drive shafts.  After
installing the drive flanges, I went to install the drive flange grease
caps.  The first one went on ok, but the second one (right side) only goes
in part way, and appears to have an air pocket trapped behind it...I push it
in, it pushes back out again.  I can tell there's air pressure behind it
because the center rubber part ballons out.  Anybody had this happen?  I
could use a small pin to make a hole to relieve the trapped air, but that
kind of defeats the purpose of the seal...
