Indeed, I have heard that under the heat of the brakes the powder coat will 
become elastic and relax the bolts. The tapered seat area should be masked 
off, or the powder coat scraped off immediately coming out of the oven 
before it gets hard. I swear, you will need carbide to take it off after it 
cures. Amazingly hard paint. Same goes for the mounting plate to the 
drum/hub. That should be metal to metal, no paints on the back centers of 
the wheels either.
