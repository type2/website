 The Zep stuff you get direct from your local Zep commercial account
distributor is totally different than the Zep products sold at do-it-yourself
stores. The store stuff is already watered down ready-to-use. The real stuff
is a concentrate. i.e. one gallon of product X makes 55 gallons. One gallon of
the store bought stuff makes 1 gallon:)
Using Formula 50 as an example, it is sold in a 32 oz spray bottle called
Formula 50 R.T.U.  [which means ready to use]
It SUCKS as a cleaner in this form. About as strong as water.
I believe it to be 98% water......
