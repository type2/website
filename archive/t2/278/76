Powder coating melts at 425-450 degrees F. so if your rims are getting that
hot around the bolts because of your drums or discs, I would suggest that
you have problems. Perhaps someone with a temp gun can shoot a reading off a
lugnut and let us know? I would REALLY doubt my lugnuts are getting anywhere
near that temp.
