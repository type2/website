I sell a Fiamma rack specifically designed for a Bus. It holds 2 bikes and
runs $189 with listmember discount. Part number KA0026. You can see a
picture of a similar model (for a Vanagon) at
http://199.217.241.240/partsimages/fiammarack.JPG .

You can certainly get a generic "one size fits all" bike rack for less at
your local discount department store.  But in some cases you get what you
pay for.  My wife and I put a $75 "universal" bike rack on her Jetta a few
years back.  On the way home from a music festival, on a small rural road at
midnight, we heard a sudden "clunk" followed by a loud "crash.".  The rack's
main support had broken and the bike had fallen off of the rack.  We found
ourselves on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, with no way to
get our bikes the rest of the way home, a damaged bike, and a huge scratch
in the trunk where the bike pedal had hit the trunk on its way to the
ground.  It was an expensive lesson.  Fortunately we were on a quiet road,
late at night.  Had we been on a highway, the bike could have hit the car
behind us and possibly caused a fatal accident. Ever since then, I use a
quality bike rack on my Westy.
