I first question my gauge. Is it a consumer cheapie or a quality 
instrument?? 2 pounds error is found in many low bucks gauges. Regardless, 
2 pounds over pressure should not be enough to be outside the final mixture 
adjustment range. However, if due to inaccurate data the actual measure is 
2 lbs over, then you are actually at 32 lbs and yes that will create a 
problem. This is why I always say, bad data is worse than no data. It 
virtually guarantees time/money wasted.

If you do have a certifiable gauge, then 30 lbs pressure tells me to look 
elsewhere for the problem. You also must verify volume of delivery, per 
Bentley.

As to gauges, most hardware stores sell high quality pressure gauges for 
less than $20. Buy some hose and fittings and you have the equivalent 
precision of an $80 automotive dedicated fuel pressure setup and data 
certified to a standard, like + or - 1/2 lbs at most.
