Subject: Re:water in the booster  update

Jamie,
    I have a good idea how the water got into your booster.  Look on
the FRONT side of the booster, you'll see another hose.  It snakes
around through the drivers wheel well and the open end tucks into the
body work.  At least the end is supposed to be in the body work and
sealed with a grommet.  If the end of that hose comes out from between
those panels the open end of the hose is exposed to ambient air and
the water your left front wheel kicks up.
    I found this out one verrrrrrry cold winter a number of years
back.  My wife came home complaining that the brakes on our '77 bus
were dragging.  I went out and expected to see ice stuck in the brakes
someplace, but no.  After 3 days of working on the brakes out in the
cold weather (no garage) I found ICE in the booster.  The ice was
pushing on the diaphragm inside the booster and causing the brakes to
come on.  Of course I didn't find this until I had gone through every
other part of the brake system.  Oh well, live and learn.
    Get the water out of the brake booster and get the end of that
hose tucked back in and sealed.
