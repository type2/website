Subject: re: in-line blowers

Hey to the list,
I've been reading your discussion about in-line blowers and would like
to add my comments. I wrote an article that is still in the type 2
library about heating your bus. I'm still running the same set-up on my
'73 loaf and have not had any problems. What I did was to take another
VW blower like the one already on the bus and splice it into the heater
system underneath the front cabin floor, where it is protected from the
elements. It isn't rocket science, but it works for me. I get lots of
heat, good air flow, no melt downs and my heat don't stink.
