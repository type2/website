Home depot carries a Zep product called Formula 50--I have been buying
this stuff for years from Zep to detail the inside of filthy Mack trucks
after I had painted them.

I used to spray the headliners of the trucks and watch the nicotine roll
off--

This stuff will clean anything---honest.

There were a couple of water spots around my skylight on my 87 Westy
prior to me replacing it, and I gave the "fuzzy stuff" a shot of the
Formula 50 and --POOF--they were gone.

Be careful with this stuff---it has to be cut 50%--and it is still
strong--it will take your breath away---but I guanantee the headliner
will be clean---

Later,

Terry

This one's got me, too. I read to use bleach somewhere, but it doesn't
seem to touch the mildew I've got up there, and kinda turns it from
yellow to white. I've also tried Woolite brand carpet cleaner with a
brush, I'm just taking the fuzz off so I've left mine alone for awhile.
I hear the fuzz can be replaced, that it comes in a spray bottle of some
variety. Anybody else on this one?
