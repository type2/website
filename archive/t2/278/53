The pressure drop could be the pressure regulator is
bad,I think Bently gives a time on it but this should
not mix gas in the oil, a rich mixture would, caused
by  cold start valve stuck open(this could account for
the pressure drop) or cyl head temp sensor bad, cold
should be about 2500 oms, 250-300 hot. Just a place to
start, I have a T-3 thats been mixing gas in the oil
for over a year, I've changed everything on it(F.I.)
and it's still doing it, good luck wirh yours
