You may still have air in the lines. The break pedal drops ever so slightly
as the vacuum assist fires up. The break fluid may have been too cold to.

Had my Master Cylinder changed (it was leaking) new one from Chez republic
and now the brake pedal feels a lot different.  For one, it moves a little
when I start the bus and seems to not come all the way up after I press it.
(yes it's working) but the pedal seems to have some play in it. Again it's
working . I had the shop bleed the brakes twice and one other thing the
other morning it was 38 degrees and the pedal felt like it was sticky a
little until I got going.
