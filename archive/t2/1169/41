Stock actually on all van models.  I don't know what single and double cabs
had.  Though I don't know (even new) that I would consider it a true fording
(watertight) snorkel.  Since they didn't come with a raised exhaust, didn't
really matter that much.

Still might be a nice retrofit for a bay. 
Definitely gets you up there in more ambient, less engine compartment temp
air.

That is just cool! I didn't know snorkels were an
option for syncro's. 

Bob, if you wanted to, and also wanted to be crafty for
fording applications,
