I've seen some pretty beat up looking ones that worked perfectly.  remove 
the cover and then put a tight hose on the vacuum and suck on the tube, 
the plate in the distributor should move, hold the vacuum but don't suck 
any more,, does the plate return.  if it doesn't move or returns on it's 
own then it is likely just the vacuum cyl, and new ones of these are 
avaliable inexpensively and fairly easy to swap out.

get it running right with points, then put in electronics if you so 
desire
