Subject: RE: [T2] what would you do?

First let me say a big THANKS for all the comments and advice.  I feel
empowered to fix my bus's issues so long as I have the right info.

 So with a new fuel pump, she is running but still rough.

I would like to get me old distributor back from the mechanic (and I use the
term loosely).  We will see how that goes.  I did put a stop on the check
since he has not returned any of my phone calls.

Otherwise I am determined to replace the "new" one he put in, which looks
original, but I suspect has never been rebuilt as it looks old and beat up.  I
am leaning towards putting in electronics to replace the points.  The bus was
running fine days before it just quit on me, now I know it was the fuel pump,
and not the distributor, I suspect the current issue is the "new" distributor.
Then I can adjust the timing and see if all is better.

The fact that he adjusted my valves is a concern.  I have hydraulic lifters on
my engine, so do the valves even need to be adjusted?????  I was told years
ago never adjust them.

The vacuum hose he took off the back of the single weber carb is just lying
there ( UGH!)  but he did plug the plastic inlet to the carb with a screw (
DOUBLE UGH!)  so I will be removing the carb and trying to fix the damage, and
I will replace the hose as recommended.  Hoping that will solve the issue with
the vacuum leak, and if not, then it sounds like I should replace the brake
servo.   One step at a time.  I really don't have time for this hobby anymore
:(  wish I could find a mechanic, a real one!

Thanks again!
Jim
