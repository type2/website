Hey, Tim!

I still have this list highlighted on my Gmail alerts.  I think Bus Pilot
is correct, though - many have moved to the Samba or FaceBook. Plus, I
think the archaic list rules of having to delete portions of the original
email might turn people off.  I believe those rules come from the "old
days" when server memory was expensive.
