Subject: RE: [T2] ongoing saga  was What would you do?

David, thanks, that is what I thought.  This set of points has no pin to
attach, so they must be bouncing around inside :/



The points have a pin at the hinge end (opposite end from where they open),
underneath, that goes into a hole.  Pretty simple, and the pin is pretty large
(though shallow).

the other attachment point is near the center where the screw goes - the
points are slotted to allow adjustment by loosing the screw.
