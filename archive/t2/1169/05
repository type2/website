Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats compared - question

Passenger Vanagon Front Seats sit higher than the Westfalia Vanagon
Models.  The reason for the lower seats in a Vanagon Westy is to
accommodate the rotating seat base which raises the height to normal
for driving.  BTDT.  In my 84 Westy, I retrofitted front seats from an
'87 Passenger Model so I could have the Armrests.  I never use the
rotating seat base on the driver side, so I removed it and the
seating/driving position is so much better.
