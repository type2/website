I would also recommend testing your 'ugly' distributor, with points
and condensor, to fix whatever is not working.  Get all the bugs out
then consider electronic points (pertronix, compufire, etc).

I have a '78 FI engine which ruptured it's vacuum advance biscuit
last fall.  I put in my ugly backup distributor (w/compufire) while
the vacuum part was on order.  I'm still running my ugly backup dist.
My primary distributor was rebuilt about 5 years ago w/Philbin Group
