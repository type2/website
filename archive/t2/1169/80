Hi Volks,

It's official.... the date of BOTC 2012 is now set for August 10-12, 2012.

By now you'all are probably pretty well acquainted with the routine; 
this marks the 12th annual BOTC campout in the same great location just 
east of Toronto. Year after year buses come from far and wide to attend 
this event; it may not be the biggest in the area but it does have a 
reputation for being able to show campers how to have a good time.

There are lots of cool things up my sleeve for 2012, but the first thing 
I need to do is to get pre-registration launched. So for the first 20 
buses I am offering a limited time deal of only $30 for the weekend, 
including the annual T-shirt. See the website for details, or email me 
off-list if you have any questions or concerns.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
