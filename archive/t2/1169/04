Running the same setup here. With 4 little ones, we needed something that
could seat all 6 of us. The best solution was a 74 Westy. We took the cabinets
out and put in a jump seat behind the driver. All the cabinets can be put back
in if needed, and there have been no mods that could not be reversed.
