Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for Type 2 1.8 L engine

Robert,

I have two engines from porsche 914s, same engine.  One was rebuilt by the guy
I bought it from, and the other was claimed to be running when parked.  If you
are interested, you can have one cheap.

Jim


I need to replace the engine in my 1974 Westfalia. I'm looking for a Type 2
1.8 liter dual carb engine. If you know of someone weho has one to sell,
PLEASE let me know. Many thanks!
