I can4t tell for sure if a Westy is any different, but I could give you
some hints for a regular 477 T2:

To remove the window handle lever the central cap out with a small
screwdriver, then unbolt the Philips screw beneath.
The door handle can4t be easily removed because it4s directly connected to
the opening mechanism; you could remove the plastic seat: There4s a
Philips screw right beneath the handle, so it may be a bit of fiddling
work to access the screw.
The door pull is secured by a screw left and right (in some models
directly visible, in others there4s a plastic cap that has to be levered
out with a small screwdriver first).
After having removed door handle seat, window handle and door pull you can
start removing the door panel. Start with a wide blade at the bottom end
(you4ll be sure to break the rather narrow cardboard near the fender if
you start at the upper end), pull the panel off two or three clamps, then
continue with your hands - very carefully and try to get a grip as close
to the next clamp as possible, as to reduce the leverage as much as
possible. If a clamp can4t be pulled out, a pair of cutting pliers
(carefully applied from the side) may help.

Hope it helped,
Lorenz
