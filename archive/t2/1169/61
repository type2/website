Actually Pete, the rules come from a desire to create a useful archive, 
one that does not return dozens of duplicate results from quoted 
material.  It has never had anything to do with server memory.  A 
secondary consideration is what I like to refer to as "common 
courtesy".  In other words, taking a few seconds to trim redundant 
information so that the reader does not have to wade through it over and 
over again.  Some may consider this archaic and prefer the modern theme 
of "give it to me now, give it to me fast, give it to me free***".  
Those folks may be better suited for theSamba and/or Facebook but I 
think there is still a place in the VW community for a mailing list, one 
that, in addition to being free (thanks to the generosity of some of its 
members) will not bombard you with advertisements or give your e-mail 
address to their marketing partners.
