Subject: 71Westy Brake Master Cylinder Woes

Had my Master Cylinder changed (it was leaking) new one from Chez republic
and now the brake pedal feels a lot different.  For one, it moves a little
when I start the bus and seems to not come all the way up after I press it.
(yes it's working) but the pedal seems to have some play in it. Again it's
working . I had the shop bleed the brakes twice and one other thing the
other morning it was 38 degrees and the pedal felt like it was sticky a
little until I got going.

 

Ideas? Cheap master cylinder?
