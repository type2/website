Subject: Re: [T2] tire covers

I think Jon's concern is a pretty good one on abrasion.  You can have a very
well fitting, very tightly attached cover, with a very soft lining, and will
be astounded by how badly edges get abraded if you have any real wind.  First
year I had it my TR4A was outdoors up here in AK, and couple of edges got
pretty beat up secondary to same.  But I do have real wind at the house (50-60
mph gusting for days over periods of the winter.)  On a westy, a bit less
issue likely cause the poptop and bumpers will catch most of the wear, but on
a vanagon like his, front edges are going to catch some real wear as well
beside/above the headlights.

Best set of tire covers I ever had were a set of
canvas covers I got from JC Whitless back in the day for RV use for this exact
purpose.  Went on easy and quick (slit up the back, heavy fast strap system)
stayed on...   Until they got stolen.  Which surprised me because I also used
them as painting covers and they were hardly beautiful.  I'd bet RV places
still have them even for little 14" tires in consideration of the common 14"
trailer tire.  Mine were very heavy canvas would resist any weather, sun, ice,
snow, etc.  Heavy as (or heavier) than a classic 50's army wall tent, tires
stayed looking like new under them.  But they were heavy and bulky, you didn't
store them inside the camper when not in use.  You can go further and combine
them with little round single piece chocks that keep you from flat spotting a
bit, or at least used to be able to get those, but they were a PITA cause you
had to jack onto them.

          I park my bus outside year round.  Much of
the time it is idle.  I
am looking for better tire covers than I currently use
to protect the tires
from the California sun.  Does the list have a
recommendation?   I could use a
full bus cover but, where I park, we have
strong wind events regularly and I'm
concerned about paint abrasion.  Perhaps
it is the lesser of two evils. 
Certainly you can leave bare metal out here
for decades without it rotting
away.  Where I live most of the year, the wind
blows three times as hard, we
recently had 20 feet of snow in a month, and a
fabric cover isn't an option at
all.  Metal melts before your eyes there,
however, rubber lasts forever. 
Suggestions for the sun?  Thanks. jon
