The points have a pin at the hinge end (opposite end from where they 
open), underneath, that goes into a hole.  Pretty simple, and the pin is 
pretty large (though shallow).

the other attachment point is near the center where the screw goes - the 
points are slotted to allow adjustment by loosing the screw.
