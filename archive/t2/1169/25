Subject: RE: [T2] Resistor Spark plugs & wires & Radio Static

I've got to double check that. I took it for a ride this past weekend.

I tried just using a length of wire instead of the installed antenna, and
still have reception problems. I didn't try turning the bus off, as it was
damn cold, and I was worried about restarting in that weather. 

I'll update again-when I can.

Ho Kevin,

You said earlier that when the engine is running you get static, but there
is no static when the engine is stopped. I would suggest that you check for
a bad ground on the antenna or the wiring going to and from the radio. There
is also a ferrous core clamp on for power cords and the like to keep static
from entering what ever unit the ferrous core is clamped to. It's a little
plastic device that is hinged on one side that allows it to go around the
cable, power cord etc. I use them for all of my amateur radios and antennas.
They work pretty well, but I  still have to make sure all of my grounds are
clean with a good electrical bond.
