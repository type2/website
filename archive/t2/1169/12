Jim,

It was the ACN SVDA distributor which they recurve for your carb. The only
"trick" is that it is installed 90 degrees around from the stock distributor.
Not hard to do.

They can preinstall a Pertronix for $90. I re-used the one I had.

The reason for my earlier question about the type of carb was that I had
recurring difficulties with vacuum leaks with the centremount weber. You can
work out if a cylinder is not firing by removing the spark plugs leads one at
a time while the engine is idling. If removing a lead makes little or no
difference to the idle speed you can then focus on diagnosing that cylinder.
Some use a rag to avoid the occasional jolt from the ignition leads!

Martin.
