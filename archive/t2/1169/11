Subject: Which distributor to choose? was : what would you do?

the second by changing to a Pertronix ignition. I have subsequently changed to
a new distributor from Aircooled.net.

Martin,

Can you give more info on which distributor you went to from aircooled?  I
looked and like always there are several options.  If yours is working well,
I'm inclined to follow your lead.  Thanks!
