Subject: Re: [T2] '71 front turn signals do not work with headlights

when a ground is bad,,, weird things happen to more than one circuit.. when
one circuit is selected, another might go off, or dim, etc..
when a hot is bad... that circuit doesn't work...or works intermittently
when a hot has a short.. it smokes something,, a fuse , or the wiring.
