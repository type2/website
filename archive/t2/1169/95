no problem Ron It is a great cover. zipper doors are nice but what I really 
 like is it is big enough to cover the whole bus even with a roof rack on 
it and  the three straps make it where you can really snug it to the bus. 
also the  bottom has elastic all around it to keep it in place. very well made  
product.  even water proof as I found out with a roof rack full of  water.  
LOL  spider bunge seems to have cured that problem   later  mark d

Thanks  for the positive review, Mark!  I would also recommend this  cover,
even over some of the pricier ones that we sell. I use it myself.  Just
Kampers did a great job designing this particular product. I  particularly
like the fact that it has zippered doors so you can get into  the Bus 
without
taking it off. I like to start my Bus over the winter  periodically, and
being able to do that without having to remove the cover  is key. Not to
mention that I invariably discover that I left something  inside it that  I
need...
