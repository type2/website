Subject: Was Re: 15 years ago. Now Subaru gearbox

>I personally think that if the subaru gearbox project ever gets to be a
stable, affordable, option they, Vanagons, will be even more common.

I think stable is here. Affordable is another question. These guys have a
reverse cut ring and pinion gear. For $2200 AUD delivered the gear and
assorted other required items can be yours. :) Then you just need to get a
Subaru gearbox and fit the parts...
