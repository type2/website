Thanks for the positive review, Mark!  I would also recommend this cover,
even over some of the pricier ones that we sell. I use it myself. Just
Kampers did a great job designing this particular product. I particularly
like the fact that it has zippered doors so you can get into the Bus without
taking it off. I like to start my Bus over the winter periodically, and
being able to do that without having to remove the cover is key. Not to
mention that I invariably discover that I left something inside it that I
need...
