Bob
the late bay body has a cold air intake built in.
the air scoops in the body of the late bay have a venturi effect to them.. 
as they have a narrow area.. that increases the speed of the air flowing 
thru there, and drops the air temps.
this reduced air temps is fed into the intake, as well as the cooling fan.
neat engineering eh?
now.. when idling in traffic, the air doesn't seem to speed up and cool as 
much..
one way to test this theory,, try to cook some chicken in the engine bay.
Most cyl heads run at 350 deg. perfect cooking temps!
but, alas.. turns out the heads are below the tin, and that pesky cold air 
intake wind actually cools the chicken .... sad but true.. 

If you have a air temp gage you can put in the engine bay.. you will see the 
temps are lower than ambient on a long drive. 

the temps will rise slightly above ambient when you stop moving and shut off 
the engine
