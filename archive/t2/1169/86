Subject: re:'71 front turn signals do not work with headlights turned on

Electrical gremlins are often rampant in VW's. Especially old VW's.

 

I have had similar problems. Sometimes it turned out to be a weird grounding
issue- ie a ground at one of the lights or at the switch itself had come
loose.

Sometimes it is just that some spade connector has come loose on one thing
while working on another.ie I'll be hooking up a radio speaker, and
accidentally knock an ignition wire loose, then have weird starting issues.

 

I recommend the following-

Check grounds at all lights, turn signals etc.

Remove Dash cover/speedo cluster thing.then with a bright
light/flashlight/droplight.look/trace all yoru wires. It does look like
someone puked on a bowl of spaghetti, but if you stare long enough, you will
start to see patterns.compare the patterns to the wiring diagram.

 

Good luck.
