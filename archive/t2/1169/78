Pete,

No need to cut out "all" of the text, just most of it.  The idea is to 
quote only for context, and usually that is just a few lines or a 
paragraph from the previous message.  Typically I will go down below the 
first paragraph and hit <esc> d <shift>-G.  Oops, I think I just dated 
myself...
