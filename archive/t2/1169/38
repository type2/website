Hey guys , I have an app called Polaris Snow Trails, and what this is great
for other than maps of trails,
It will draw a map of your route as you drive and then you can save it to your
maps for later referance, this is good for dirt roads and such that are not on
alot of gps thingys.
Its free too, I think its cool
