The other thing is age, the Type2's are not getting any younger. I 
can go take a drive around Olympia WA today, I'll see a couple pre 
1968 buses, several bays but more Vanagons. Some days I'll see more 
Eurovans than anything else.
BBTB was last weekend at Lake Havasu City, AZ, what I heard was there 
were a lot move Vanagons than there were prevoius years.  Still more 
air cooled buses but things are changing.

I think Bus Pilot is correct, though - many have moved to the Samba 
or FaceBook. Plus, I
think the archaic list rules of having to delete portions of the original
email might turn people off.  I believe those rules come from the "old
days" when server memory was expensive.
