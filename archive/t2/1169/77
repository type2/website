Another place that heavy quoting is killer is digest mode.  If you're not 
familiar with it (and if you were you'd already know...), the digest 
version of the list combines multiple emails together into a single 
message.

In this format, you get this:

original message about a dog

cool!
quoted original message about a dog

way cool!
quoted cool
quoted original message about a dog

I wish my dog could do that!
quoted cool
quoted original message about a dog

> I wish my dog could do that!
> quoted original message about a dog
ha, you should see my dog



instead.   I challenge you to subscribe to an active yahoo list at random 
and try out digest mode.   Get back to me if you still like heavy quoting. 
;)
