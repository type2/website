Thank you all for all of your suggestions. Is it possible to install such a
device onto a carbureted engine? I might be able to rig something up for
cooking chickens and other small fowl or fresh road kill. The best part of
cooking them under the engine is the fat won't be able to accumulate on the
engine. All the heat you need is right there. Maybe a conversationalist
might be able to recycle the left over greases into biofuel. Sort of killing
two birds with one stone

TGIF!!
