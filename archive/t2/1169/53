I have thought about a cold air intake like setup for a different reason.

The FI setup I have looks like the dual-carb setup on a DP engine with air
intakes on both cylinder banks.  For whatever reason, this setup is LOUD!

And it is not exhaust noise, it is engine noise and I assume it is loud
based on the intake system.

My guess is that creating this "cold intake" system would muffle the sound
as perceived from the interior of the bus.  It may be louder standing
outside the vehicle near the scoops but just running some type of plumbing
should reduce the noise dramatically.

The hard part would be getting a good fit on the air cleaners or intake (if
the air cleaners are moved farther upstream.
