Subject: tire covers

Hi Folks,
          I park my bus outside year round.  Much of the time it is idle.  I
am looking for better tire covers than I currently use to protect the tires
from the California sun.  Does the list have a recommendation?   I could use a
full bus cover but, where I park, we have strong wind events regularly and I'm
concerned about paint abrasion.  Perhaps it is the lesser of two evils. 
Certainly you can leave bare metal out here for decades without it rotting
away.  Where I live most of the year, the wind blows three times as hard, we
recently had 20 feet of snow in a month, and a fabric cover isn't an option at
all.  Metal melts before your eyes there, however, rubber lasts forever. 
Suggestions for the sun?  Thanks. jon
