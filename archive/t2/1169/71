Subject: ongoing saga  was What would you do?

Well I worked on the bus this weekend, something I really don't have time to
do, and was having trouble setting the points.  I think I discovered the
source of the rough running issue.  The "new" distributor they guy installed (
note : no longer using the term mechanic) has an old set of points, even
though they look in good shape, as I tried to adjust the DWELL, which was
ready 10 degrees ( UGH!) the points were moving about inside, and I could not
get the gap set.  After doing more reading online, it seems the points should
attach to the points plate at two spots, one that is adjustable , and one that
is not. IS THIS TRUE?

If I understand correctly, then there is no way to set the points without a
new points plate and or set of points.  And hopefully, when I replace the
distributor, with a new one, which I ordered today, set the dwell, and gap,
she will run smoothly again.

Damn that guy really screwed up my bus!

Jim
