Someone with a stock setup may chime in here, but I believe that the hot air
intake for the type IV engine doesn't have a hose (the box with the valve sits
straight into the hot air outlet) and the cold air hose leads to the right
from the same box.

Isn't that the pre-heated air intake for early (1600) carb-ed engine and hence
the opposite of cold-air intake?

I believe this is to help combat carb icing during start-up in cold weather.
