Subject: 1976 Door  Panel Removal

Before I break anything, which I will anyway, I'm sure, how do I remove the
window handle and other pieces from the interior front door panel on my 1976
Westfalia?  And is there a special tool I should use to pry off the panel from
the metal door, or will screwdrivers and other wide blades do the job?
To
express my serious thanks in advance, I'll share my silly RC Kombi video I
made.

The Window handle is my concern right now. I think I know
how to do it, but it's so frail I'm afraid to start bending plastic around.
Thanks, Happy Feder
