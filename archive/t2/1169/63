Actually Pete, the rules come from a desire to create a useful archive,

one that does not return dozens of duplicate results from quoted

material.

I couldn't agree more with David.  I am on several lists where most of the
traffic is "me too", or "+1", followed by a full quote of the last "me too". 
Total slob email etiquette, not only didn't the poster have anything useful to
add, but asked me to scroll through (a) page(s) of repetition to find the "me
too" line.  I need to be on those organizational lists for the 5% useful
traffic but it is a real PITA.

The mods do an outstanding job here, and if we currently need some funding let
me know.

The new search engine is much superior but it still picks up the duplicates if
they are not pruned in the reply.

On the declining number of bays/splits seen on the road, and increasing
sightings of Vanagons. Do folks think this is due to the success of WBX engine
conversions?  I personally think that if the subaru gearbox project ever gets
to be a stable, affordable, option they, Vanagons, will be even more common.  
The wedge needs more grunt because its heavier, but it handles (way) better
IMHO. 140hp or so makes them go really nicely.  The gearbox is a weak link at
this level and above. Plenty of them fly by me pottering along in my a/c
Vanagon, so they must have something else under the deck.
