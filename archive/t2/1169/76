Thanks for the response, David.  Always wondered why the mods were so
uptight on that rule when memory gets less expensive by the day.  One
disadvantage of having all the text cut out from the previous email is if
one needs a reference point, you have to go back and open up the one you
just stripped.

Maybe it's me, though, being spoiled by FaceBook, iPhone and other fast
response sites?  Still love the Type2 list and the friends I have made and
repair advice given.
