Indeed, in my experience many times I have reset hydraulic lifters on high
milage engines and gotten much improved, smoother idle and running. Also,
the hydraulic lifter setting has been updated since the Bentley was
written. I suggest something like a 40k interval is appropriate for the
hydraulic lifter check, and the updated setting for the later VW T-2 and
Vanagon, both air and water cooled.

Boston Bob developed the data that VW accepted and tested that led to the
updated setting. It was addressing issues with the Wasserboxer, but the
lifters are the same design, if not the same part no. as the aircooled
part.
