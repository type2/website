Subject: '71 front turn signals do not work with headlights turned on

Hi everyone,

My '71 bus has a peculiar problem. With my headlights turned on, the 
front blinkers do not flash when operated by the turn signal stalk.

They do operate when the headlights are on and the hazard switch is 
pulled and also when the headlights are turned off.

My rear blinkers work properly with the headlights turned on or off and 
with the hazard switch.

It seems like with the headlights on, a short is caused in the turn 
signal switch itself. I would think that if the flasher relay was going 
out, the blinkers would not function with the hazard switch.

I am planning on taking the cover off of the switch and looking at the 
wiring, does that seem like a good idea, or should I try installing a 
new flasher relay first? I do have a spare switch that I picked up 
several years ago, and I am hoping to compare the wiring.

Reading through the archives, it appears to me that the flasher relay is 
attached to the bottom of the fuse block in '71 models.

Thanks for the ideas,

Max
