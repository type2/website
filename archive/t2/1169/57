well it appears that Sandra and myself are now in charge of nattybus. Today 
 we started work on the rafflebus a 78 sage green westy. this is going to 
be a  real nice bus that some lucky person will win. We are planning a couple 
of  changes this year. we are going to let people buy off the internet and 
the  person does not have to be there to win this year, what we are going to 
do is  when we get the payment we will e mail the person their numbers. we 
will need  their e mail and phone numbers which will be wrote on their 
ticket for drawing.  payments can be cash, check(made out to roanoke ronald 
mcdonald house) or paypal  ,which I dont care for as they will be taking money 
away from a great cause.  payments can be sent to us at salem import service 
1113 flordia st salem va  24153 , paypal is at _gobusgo(-at-)veizon.net_ 
(mailto:gobusgo(-at-)veizon.net)
