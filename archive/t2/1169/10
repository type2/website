Have you checked the timing with the "new" distributor? My original
distributor ran ok when set correctly. However, there were two problems with
it. The centremount weber I had at the time produced a vacuum signal at idle
which advanced the timing a few degrees and there was timing scatter at high
revs. The first problem was addressed by setting the idle rpm low and the
second by changing to a Pertronix ignition. I have subsequently changed to a
new distributor from Aircooled.net.
