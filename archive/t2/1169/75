Subject: Speaking of manifold icing (new 12V heater pads)

Well the 12V pads new to me at least.  As winter is in full swing, and with
recent progressive weber talk and all...
 
I've mentioned before I have a
factory heating element off I believe (sold to me as such on ebay.de) a 1.9
carbed Vanagon that I mounted long ago with good effect to a Weber progressive
center section that I use as a break in and recovery carb.  I've also noted
that up here in AK the little 120VAC silicone pad heater jobs go real cheap
($5-10) depending on physical size/wattage.  I've put one of them on 12VDC
before and pumping a regulated 10A into one, it does warm up, slightly warmer
than body temp, just warm to the touch so guess 100F or so (my IR thermometer
pooped.)  Nothing like it does on 120VAC of course (red HOT...)  So I noticed
recently while searching for something different that on a common auction site
a guy is now selling "12VDC" ones.  Has a store at:
 
www.willrodgers.info
 
Now whether or not there is any difference in the heating element to what I'm
merely paying $5 for locally, I don't know.  Has 12VDC pads up to 225W so
drawing up to 20A or so, which is more than I've put into one of my cheapies. 
But for someone with a Weber who is having icing problems, I'd figure on
mentioning them out of pure conjecture.  I figure the 70W perhaps even
the 120W would fit on the manifold.  As to the guys ebay claims that a 250W
pad could raise the temp of 6qt of oil from -40 to 60F in a few hours, pure
baloney I'd conjecture from experience with 250W and 500W 120V models on my
burbs oil an tranny sumps on mere -20F days.  But would 70W be enough to keep
the chill off an aluminum manifold, perhaps so.  Someone smarter than me would
be required to decide.  Could put it on a thermo time switch to turn it off
BTW, or on all the time, who knows.  Anyway the things are neat and
convenient, and the ones I get are cheap.  $20-30
 isn't crazy but isn't cheap either.
