"The first thing you should do is clean all the grounds from 
fusebox/switch out to the headlights/signal lights. Corroded grounds 
will cause some awesomely weird stuff to go on."

I can double-check and clean the grounds this weekend. To answer cesar, 
I have not done anything between working and non-working lights. She is 
my daily driver and I noticed it last night waiting to turn behind a 
white pickup truck.

Thanks for the help.
