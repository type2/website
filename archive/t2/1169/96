Subject: Please Help!  Timing a new Distributor

Ok, so after replacing the bad fuel pump and filter, my bus was running but
really rough.  The points in the old distributor were broken, so I decided to
buy a brand new SVDA distributor with electronic points.  But I am not having
much success.  Here is what I have done-


1-      Installed new dist, and checked that it is seated, rotor turns with
engine

2-      Located the TDC mark on the fan pulley, marked it with paint, verified
TDC using a pencil on piston #1

3-      Adjusted distributor so its hitting on #1 at 8 degress BTDC with
engine NOT on

4-      Hooked up timing light, turned on ignition, turned distributor by hand
to get a signal from the light, and NOTHING ( UGH!)  so I bought a new timing
light, old one was 220 years old bought for the last time I adjusted timing.
Still nothing.

5-      I have tried firing up the engine, and it will not start, occasional
fire of one cylinder, but wont start.

6-      I have moved the dist about 180 degrees and no luck
ANY IDEAS????

Thanks in advance
Jim
