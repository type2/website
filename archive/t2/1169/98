Subject: RE: [T2] Please Help!  Timing a new Distributor

OKI, so if its not TDC, which memory serves me correct, 20 years ago when I
put the engine in the bus the notch in the pulley was accurate, then it would
be TDC for piston #3, so I could move the wires 180 degrees on the dist cap
and it would be close???

Or is that a dumb idea?

this might not be TDC as the piston comes uo twice,  correct way is to watch
the #1 intake ,turning engine in running direction when it goes in and comes
back out you are approaching TDC turn crank till timing mark comes up  later
mark d
