For a custom application, try some of this.

use these to connect tubing to air cleaner, or air box.

The SCEET is fairly smooth inside and flows much better than corrugated
flexible tubing of the same diameter.  Designed for high under hood
temperatures, not that that is an issue above the tin with A/C buses .  The
wire spiral largely prevents it from buckling and collapsing.  Nothing is
impossible in that regard, of course.

Works great for my applications-heater box outlets.  The flanges are very
nicely made, light but plenty strong enough, and fit the corresponding SCEET
size closely.  IMHO a good deal for the $.
