Bob, if you wanted to, and also wanted to be crafty for fording applications,
a syncro snorkel goes right up the passenger side pillar to where the air is
certainly cold (depending on ambient obviously) though as Jamie mentions, you
are always getting ram and venturi effect in those scoops at speed.  Syncro
unit also has the little dust/water prefilter etc.  One could probably figure
a fairly easy way to plumb it given enough slicone turbo connectors from your
favorite auction site.

is an example. 
Price probably isn't terrible, though shipping might be a bit due to
cumbersome size.

Bob
the late bay body has a cold air intake built in.
the air scoops in
the body of the late bay have a venturi effect to them.. as they have a narrow
area.. that increases the speed of the air flowing thru there, and drops the
air temps.
this reduced air temps is fed into the intake, as well as the
cooling fan.
neat engineering eh?
