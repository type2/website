Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Cold air intake

Greg, I've seen adapters for remote mount filters for the common IDF/DRLA air
filter setup.  Presuming your FI setup is same (which it might be, most of the
those independent dual, 2 throat throttle body sets are) you can probably find
something.  Markete for the heavy duty desert/sand crowd who wanted to get
their air intake up high, and also as adapters for "blow through" turbo
installations.  Then just some creative silicone hose plumbing.

Picture down almost at the
very bottom "Blow Through is Modern State of the Art" shows what I mean, could
do a couple of things in my mind, rotate the connecting tube up and plumb
where you will, or reverse the orientation of the filter adapters and run
independent "snorkels" where you will.  Mind you the article is also about FI
and throttle bodies similar to what you got likely.

CB isn't always the
cheapest, but generally won't sell you crap.

I have
thought about a cold air intake like setup for a different reason.

The FI
setup I have looks like the dual-carb setup on a DP engine with air
intakes on
both cylinder banks.  For whatever reason, this setup is LOUD!
