Loose as in finger tight or loose as in not quite up to the book spec?  It
has been noted that VW de Mexico uses a lower torque on their engines,
probably because of questionable stud metallurgy.  I recommend swapping
for used Germans studs before installing the engine.

Knowing how close the studs are to the limit in stock configuration, I
wonder if cutting threads is such a good idea.  I'll bet that the threads
on the stock studs are rolled, not cut.
