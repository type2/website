Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

Speaking of odd mixtures in the gas tank, I was told to throw a couple of
ounces of ATF in (to clean up the deposits from running rich) every other
tank of gas.  I swear it did seem to run better after I did this, althougth
I haven't pulled it apart to see if it actually cleaned anything up.

Is this an old mechanic's tale or is there something to this?

Happy New Year!
