Subject: Re: [T2] Happy VW new year and thanks

well as the old year fades into history and a new one all bright and
shinny (and hopefully not from GEX) arrives I just want to take a quick
moment to thank all the good folks on this list who have provided so much
help and "inspiration" to keep these old buses on the road.  my 78 still
motors along in good part to the help from the list and the many members,
  so if I know you by face or only by e-mail....have a great new year and
safe busing
