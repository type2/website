Subject: Transmission Oil, 4 speed, GL-4, need info!

Hi guys, well, my time to ask a question!
Very simple, i need to change my tranny oil (73 westy 4-speed)! In the 
Vanagon, if i remember right, we use the very expensive GL-4 or MT-1 or 
something like that!!! I am not use to SPECIAL "Tranny oil" that much, 
My Honda use normal engine oil in the transmission!!! Some other cars i 
work on use standard tranny oil (i never work on tranny!!!).
My question, what are you guys using on those old tranny!!! (Brand name 
if possible, am in Canada)
I know that VW sells a very expensive one, is it worthed? If not, what 
other brand and what is the product #.

I don't want to start a debate on a very old subject, sorry for that,  
but i need the info quick!

Thank you and happy new year! Ben
