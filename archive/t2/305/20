Yes, thanks Jim, 

Sorry, stayed up too late last night in my bus drinking irish coffees and reading "Heart of Darkness" in one sitting. Makes a man fiesty in the morning, and I jumped on poor Robb, who is in fact a California refugee.

The dark secret, I'm actually a New Yorker!

Now that I've completely lost everyone's attention, I'd like to thank the list for everything this year, you've gotten me back on the road more than once in 2002.

You're all good folks, and welcome in my driveway at anytime.

Peace in the world in 2003,

Billy

Jim, Me and the wife'll make tofu chili at BBB!!
