Subject: Re: [T2] What is a 091

I feel that this article from the library needs to be augmented.

The bastard transmission is simply a European 1600 transmission used
from 74 on (VIN 214 2000 001).
The 75 transmission in that article really is a 74 introduced with the
1800 engine.

I think were simply dealing with 4 transmissions in our T2bs - one for
each engine (1600, 1700, 1800, and 2000)

Here is what I have found in Stefan Doliwa's VW Transporter Book (Die
technische Dokumentation 1950 - 1990):
August 1, 1973 (1974 model) VIN 214 2000 001:
1600 engine - ring and pinion 7:38, 4th gear 62:51
1700 engine - discontinued
1800 engine - ring and pinion 7:34, 4th gear 27:24
October 1973 - Achsuebersetzung (what is the English term here?) from
11:49 to 11:48
August 1, 1975 (1976 model) VIN 216 2000 001:
ring and pinion from 7:34 to 7:38
gear ratios adapted to new engine

Hiya All,

Thanks to you all who helped straighten me out on Roberto's predicament
down 
in sunny Venezuela.  
Yes, I was aware of the General Strike.  Yes, I was aware of the long
waiting 
lines for gasoline.  
Unfortunately, I either misread or misunderstood Roberto's original
post.  I 
believe he had mentioned that, due to the strike, the only gas available
was 
uncertified.  That started me off on the track of, "perhaps this
uncertified 
gasoline is lacking in some qualities".  And following that track I was 
wondering what adding oil to gasoline would accomplish in terms of
improving 
the quality of the gasoline.
I realize now that poor old Roberto is just trying to stretch his supply
of 
gasoline.  Sorry if I got anybody's nose out of joint - it surely was
not 
intentional.  I promise to work on my comprehension in the coming new
year.  
And for that matter, a Happy New Year to All - especially to Roberto.  I
hope 
things get back to normal for you.
