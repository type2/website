Hugh,

Helicoil uses unique tap sizes. I just double-checked my helicoil m8x1.25
tap with a vernier and thread gauges, and i can't match it up to any
standard taps. It is like 9.75mm, and close to 1.25 pitch. In other words,
to use helicoils, you have to buy their tap. I'd say you need the insertion
tool as well, but that you could make by grinding the end of a  nice hard
8mm bolt to the right shape.
