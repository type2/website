I don't disagree with them.

There is a lot of 911 fan discussion and debate in the Type 4rum at
http://www.shoptalkforums.com. Go there, read the posts and search the

From what I've read, running a stock compression ratio with that setup will
reduce engine life.  It's best used in conjunction with a high CR engine.
