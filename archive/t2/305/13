Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

You know... One time somebody told me to put in a little bit of motor 
oil with each tank of gas, like a tenth of a quart of oil to a full tank 
of gas. He said, "Now Paul, I know I've got some strange quarks, but I 
know that it's good for the engine. It'll help keep it lubricated 
better. It may smoke a little." This guy is really good with VW's, but this 
advice kindof rubbed me the wrong way. I never tried it. What do you 
all think? Happy New Year!                                            -Paul Deatherage
