this summer a very experienced vw friend was putting marvel oil in at the gas station with his gas
and i inquired and he told a similar story and has been putting a 1/4 of marvel oil in with every
full tank of gas for years. has seen no ill effects and thinks it is a good thing.  
so far i have just tried the marvel before an oil change.  so i don't have personal exp.
