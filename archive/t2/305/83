> Do you really need to take it off?

Good question, and my answer is NO...

Here's what I do:
- Remove the drum, brake shoes and springs
- You can usually soak the adjuster, and with a good pair of slip joints or vice
grips, carefully remove the center of the adjuster...the part that contacts the
shoe...if you don't want to mark up the adjuster, try using a good wide blade
slotty screwdriver turned sideways to use as a lever...the center usually moves
pretty easily
- Once the center is out, soak the star adjuster part well down the center
HERE'S MY TRICK
I have lots of type I engine studs in my collection...the 10mm ones have the same
thread as the center of the star wheel....so I double nut one end of a short stud,
and weld it at the top so it doesn't move...insert the other end in the star
wheel, and once it bottoms in the holder, it will press out the starwheel
nicely...just don't thread it into the star wheel too far unless you've cut the
stud threads a little longer as I did on the one I've used over 20 years...a VW
speciality tool at a fraction of the price....LOL

Once everything is apart. move to the steel wool for the holder hole(dry it out
first), and wire wheel to clean up the star and adjuster...

Put the star and adjuster back together with anti-seize, and work them til they're
free enough to work top to bottom of each other by hand, and turn easily in the
holder...

There, you're done...

Enjoy, and remember to back off the cables, and get the wheels adjusted properly
with the star wheels (pumping and adjusting a couple of times to make sure
everything stays centered) THEN adjust the cables back up...you'll find the system
works a lot better that way...

Den.
