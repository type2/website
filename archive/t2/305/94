Subject: FI conversion questions

Hi. I haven't posted here for a while, mainly because 
my bus has not been running for a while. Bus is a '74 cali hardtop
Westy. I just got a new AVP 1.8l rebuilt engine, and am starting to
assemble other components to put it in the bus. POs had really hacked
up the bus, having removed/disabled all the emission control stuff,
replaced the stock dizzy with a 009, and replaced the carbs with some
webers on which I've not been able to find any info.

A fellow list member is going to sell me his partially blown up 2l engine
complete with all the FI stuff (it's off a '78 bus). My plan is to take
his FI parts and install them on my bus. Over time I'll take the 2l engine
and rebuild it, but this AVP should last me quite a while, so I won't be
in a hurry for that.

The question has to do with the exhaust. My bus has the original heater
boxes and they're getting pretty bad. I want to put a whole new exhaust
on it before I put the new engine in, and I'm not clear as to what I need.
Can I use a stock '74 exhaust with FI? I've never worked on a fuel injected
VW before, so any other pointers/gotchas that you folks might have to
offer would be appreciated. I'd also like to put what emissions control
stuff back on that actually matter. I know about the fuel tank swap, and
am working on that now.

Oh, one other thing: should I get a new engine compartment wiring harnass
for the FI setup? If so, does it matter what year it's from? I want to do
this as correctly as I can given that I'm mixing some components in from
a later year.

Thanks, and happy new year to everyone!
