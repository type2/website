Subject: FI tank design

Who has any pictures of the fi style tank that goes in an 79 or
similar bus. I keep going through fuel filters every 3 or 4 months &
suspect some crap in the bottom of the tank. What I really want to
know is if the 2 hose bibbs on the bottom of the tank are actually
flush with the bottom or if the are actually slightly higher in the
tank. I'd like to do a semi-flush while it's still cold, just don't
want to do it if flushing it in place will simply keep a lot of loose
crud on the bottom of the tank. TIA & have a safe new years eve.
