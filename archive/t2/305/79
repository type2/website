Use a bolt to drive it out. I don't remember the size anymore, but all I
had to do was screwing the bolt into the opposite end of the sleeve and
thus force the adjuster out. I did this on a 79 and on a 74, so it
should work on yours, too.

Oh, wise and giving list........HELP!

For the first time in our nearly two year relationship, my bus has
defeated
me. Neither experience, native wit, luck or brute force could prevail
over a
stuck rear brake adjusting screw and star wheel.
