David, here is what I recently did for a stuck adjuster on my 79. can
you get the "screw" part of the adjuster out? if so you can soak the
snot out of it in liquid wrench (yes i know you already have some,but
do it some more) then screw a bolt of suficent size (IIRC 8mm) into
the star, the bolt should go through & push against the middle
seperator of the adjuster block, forcing the adjuster out. It worked
great for me, but I did have to put a bit of force & lots of oil on
it. I would only consider taking the block off as a completely last
resort.
