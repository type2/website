sure sounds like exchangers. I believe you are right.

Well, yes & no. Take a close look at the system. It is reasonably
straightforward in it's design. The exchangers insides are part of the
exhaust system. it's a finned piece of metal that pipes the exhaust
gasses to your muffler & then out the side. The outside metal (which
you see) is what makes it possible to get heat from the engine. The
engine (& also aux fan) push air into the exchangers & across the
finned insides to transfer heat from the hot exhaust metal to the cool
air. this air is transfered via ductwork to your windshield defroster
& other heater vents. including those on your toes :) Without this air
you cannot heat the bus, not that that matters much in CA, but you
will not have a functional defroster. I believe some safety regs
require that to be functional (i don't know for sure, ask proper
authorities)

If it were removed you would have to replace it with some sort of
exhaust system, so this isn't really what you want anyway.

yes those darn things do get in the way, but rest assured that there
is enough room to get the valve cover off & adjust your valves. I use
a good thick screwdriver & a box end wrench. good luck, this is the
best way to keep tabs while owning a VW :)
