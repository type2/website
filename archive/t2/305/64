Subject: gas tank lines

Well after 4 years we are finally at the stage to install the gas tank back 
into our bus, but looking through Bentley book gave us only a diagram of thr 
hoses without the charcoal canister. Does anyone have a picture of how all 
the hoses go and what if we are installing dual carbs. Thanks Dylan and
