Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Adjusters!!!

David -
I did my rear brakes this past summer, so I'm working from memory, but I had 
the same problem. I'll assume you've already soaked the star adjuster in 
liq. wrench, PB Buster or some other penetrant. What you do is get a M8 or 
M10 bolt or cap screw, longer than the star adjuster. I just went to home 
depot with a star adjuster in hand and found a bolt/screw that fit.  Take 
the screw and thread it into the top of the stuck star adjuster. Using a 
wrench or ratchet, thread it all the way down to the bottom of the adjuster, 
and just keep cranking. The cap screw will bottom out on the bottom of the 
well the adjuster sits in, and you'll force the adjuster to start threading 
itself out backwards up the cap screw. I was afraid I'd damage something by 
doing this, but was told not to worry. It took some effort, but it came out 
like a charm. You just keep cranking, and all of a sudden the adjuster 
juststarts creeping upward. It's a beautiful thing.

Neither experience, native wit, luck or brute force could prevail over a
stuck rear brake adjusting screw and star wheel.
