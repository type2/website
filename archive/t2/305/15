	Bretheren & sisterethen, listerines, listeroos, listerettes, ladies
and germs, children of all ages:

	In a desperate bid to get this thread back to bus content, wuv, and
feewings among bus pilots - I'm going make the supreme sacrifice and 'jack
this thread ;-)  C'mon you two, settle down with the Left Coast, Right Coast
sniping (look what it did for the rappers)...  I don't want to have to do
this, but you-all leave me no other choice...

	Robb:  If'n it wasn't for the Left Coast mags, none of us would know
how great 009s and prog Webers are for our buses (especially when Type 4
powered).  Please - give us-all in the SOUTH of Cali some credit where
credit is due - I mean we gave the world GEX and MSHP, didn't we?  Do you
want that we should slit our wrists and bleed for you?  I shan't make
mention of the fact you live in NORTH Carolina, m'kay...  Don't forget about
an extra 914 sump plate for me if'n you find one ;-)

	Billy:  Tofu tacos?  Puh-leeeeeze!  You keep up that Bay
(har-de-har!) Area left-liberal, touchy-feelie kinda talk and I will
personally drive up to Fresno and smear Hylomar on your leaky valve covers,
little mister...  Saints alive - tofu tacos! Yuck!  Make me want to spew...
The only vegetable (OK, so it's really a tuber) that needs to go naked and
solo into a taco, is a POTATOE!  Repeat after me - P-O-T-A-T-O-E!  Methinks
the clean air of Fresno has caused a cerebral malfunction.  Tofu tacos...

	I'm now turning off the Broad Humor Ray(tm) and wish all of you (or
is that you-all), and The List at large a Happy New Year!

	Just remember:  If there are no improvements in morale, I'll be
forced to reinstitute the beatings until it does...

	That is all...  Peas out!
