With all due respect to Master Raby, not everyone
thinks that way.  Some believe that the reason
the T4 engine runs hotter is due to poor fan
design:

Understand that I'm not taking a position one way
or the other.  But Jake is definitely on the
extreme end of the spectrum with regard to
fondness for the T4 engine.  (This might be a
good thing if the coverage Jake gets in VWT or
HVW spawns interest in T4 parts and more
aftermarket support.)  HOWEVER....many
experienced vw mechanics (including the Bergs)
don't think much of the T4 engine in general and
the T4 cooling system in particular.  

I do note Raby's complaint that many of the kits
do not have thermostats.  That alone should cause
a thinking person avoid the aftermarket cooling
kits for street use.
