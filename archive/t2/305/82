Subject: Acces to the ignition switch

Hello Volks

My first question of the year, somebody out there knows how I can disassembly
the upper part of the steering column in order to get the ignition switch
out.
I am already take out the steering wheel, turn signal and wipers assemblies
but could not move the plastic sleeve that cover the column and the switch.

Thanks in advance
