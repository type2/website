Richard,

After a rough time at my last SMOG test (77 T2),I inquired around the local 
VW community for a "VW tolerant" SMOG shop. It worked.
Although I was fully compliant the second test I did not see the fuel 
restricter, fuel cap, and EGR checked or tested.

BTW running a bit rich (CO > 2%)is much safer than a bit lean (CO<1%).
