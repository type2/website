Subject: Altitude attitude?

Does anyone else notice that their bus always starts on the flatlands and 
never starts in the mountains? My bus always starts in Los Angeles but if I 
drive it to Yosemite or Big Bear it won't start and gets flooded. It may have 
to do with the altitude or extreme cold. I know something is broken but what 
I'm not sure what.  Laura :o)
