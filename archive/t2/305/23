I'm not going to get involved in this smog debate because everyone on the
list has an opinion on the environment and VWs but I will say that the
testing demonstrates whether or not your are really in tune or not.

You can debate whether or not the factory specs are the best settings to run
your bus at but as my test indicated, I was running too rich, wasting gas
and polluting more than necessary and all it took was the turn of a screw.
