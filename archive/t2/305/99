Yes, I suppose I should have been a bit more clear about this. Does the
FI setup on a '78 require anything specific from the exhaust system? I'm
pretty sure that there isn't an oxygen sensor on a '78, and if there were
I'm also sure I'd be able to install it on a stock '74 exhaust.

I'm going to ask Bus Depot about that $199 special -- it sounds pretty good
but it's hard to believe I'd get decent heater boxes for that price.
They have some NOS German left heater boxes right now too. Now if only there
were NOS German right heater boxes still. :)

So if I go scouring the wrecking yards for wiring harnasses, I will need
to get one from a '78? I don't think this '78 was a cali model but I guess
I'll have to find that out too. Will the engine compartment harnass from a
'78 mate up with the main harnass from my '74?

Thanks for your reply!
