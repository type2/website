Subject: re Pertronix

I have a 70 Bus with a 1600sp stock engine, with the correct stock vacuum
advance distributor.  I also have a Pertronix in an 009 on my trike. The
Pertronix was for an 009, but the plug for the distributor was wrong, so I
had to modify the condensor plug to get it to fit. Anyway, it runs great in
the trike. I am contemplating stealing the Pertronix and putting it in my
bus. I carry spare points and I leave the condenser on the dizzy, so I can
convert it back to points on the side of the road if the Pertronix calves. I
am not sure if I still have the clear plastic feeler gauge that came with
the unit.

1)    Will the Pertronix work in the 70 vacuum dizzy?
2)    What thickness is the feeler gauge for the Pertronix, and what can be
substituted for it to set the gap correctly?
