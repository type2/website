Subject: Heli-coil question

Happy New Year!

I've stripped the smaller hole in the rear of my engine case which holds the
8mm thread bolt that attaches the rear engine mount to my case.  I've bought
the 8mmx1.25 heli coil inserts to repair the hole so that I can use the
original sized bolt, but I need to know the correct size of the tap needed to
fit the in the heli-coil.  Does anyone know?  Thanx in advance.
