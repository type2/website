A valve cover trick:

To engage and disengage the heavy wire clip that hold the valve covers on, 
I use a short ( 30") piece of nylon climbing rope. Thread it under the 
wire clip at one end of the cover, slide it near the middle, and use this 
as a leash to pull the clip up or down WITH A GLOVED HAND. Ungloved 
knuckles are quickly busted by this procedure. This dramatically reduces 
the amount of cursing and fussing necessary to get at your valves. When 
not in use, I use the rope to tie my wrench bag shut.

One more thing:

I recall that my bus (1978 Westy) originally had these "extra tailpipe" 
things attached to the heating system. They were indeed right in front of 
the valve covers, above and a little outboard of the heat exchanger boxes. 
I missed the first post to this thread, but I wonder if the original 
poster is possibly referring to those. They were attached to the heater 
vents just downstream of the heat exchangers. Aluminum pleated hoses 
(approx. 2" diameter) connected the heater vents to these  2 foot long 
things that look like tailpipes, attached to the body with 2 bolts. Their 
apparent purpose was to direct unused warm air (when heater vents are 
closed) aft and outboard of the engine before releasing it. They have been 
removed and discarded on every bus I've seen in recent times. They must be 
removed to get at the valve covers.
