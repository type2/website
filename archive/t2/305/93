Subject: Re: [T2] Acces to the ignition switch

Someone answered this for me just a few weeks ago.  If all you need to remove is the electrical portion of the switch, simply unhook your battery, remove the tiny screw holding the switch in and wiggle it out.  It is tight but will clear the housing.  I removed the four screws holding the column to the dash to get better access.

As an aside, after doing this job my horn now goes off randomly.  :(  I'll have to research that after I get the new ignition switch from Busted Bus and get it all put back together.
