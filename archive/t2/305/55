There is an 1847A for the 009 and 1847V (or sometimes just 1847) for the
vacuum models.  I'd like to know what the difference is also.  At least they
seem to be different in size: http://www.w-p-c.com/009.jpg

I believe it's .030".

I asked the list about the gap a while back and the consensus was that the
gap doesn't affect the dwell.  All that matters is that the module clear the
magnetic sleeve so that it doesn't rub.
