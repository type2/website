Subject: '72 Spindle

Hello, and seasons greetings!!

Q1:  Will a '79 bay's caliper and rotor fit on a '72 spindle?  I. e., can I 
simply swap out a '72 caliper/rotor with that from a '79.

Q2:  If not, how far back must I extract from the '79 to fit the system, 
bolt on, to a '72??

Thanks

Barry sends
