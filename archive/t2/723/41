Since you already have a complete hydraulic brake system in place, I'd be
tempted to come up with some sort of surge brake system with a master
cylinder on the tow bar.

Still, the big negative would be that you couldn't back up with the
standard front wheel setup.

There is a fellow who converted a bus into a portable key shop, but he put
an axle under the middle of the bus and converted it into a conventional
trailer.
