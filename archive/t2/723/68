Subject: 1.8 in a 1972 Van

Hello,

I am about to take my 1.8 fuel injected spare motor from my old 75 van and 
put it temporarily into my 72 van. The original 1700 is requiring a rebuild. 
I am going to put the 1.8 and convert it to a dual carb set up. Besides the 
dual carb and electronic fuel pump what else will I need to change.

Will the alternator be the same, distributor, etc...

Thanks, Phil.
