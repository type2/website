Csaba,

This is the part that is going bad in my bus(78), so I understand.


Csaba, there *must* be someplace closer than California for you to get 
this part.  A junkyard?

When I was in Germany last year, there was a magazine for "older" cars and 
vw's.  There were more than a few advertisements for shops and parts all 
over Europe.

I think the magazine was called "Old Markt".  I was in a small town 
outside of Freiburg Germany and they had a vw repair shop there(lots of 
buses and air cooled bugs around).

If possible look here

These people are in Germany, but can probably give you a lead for 
someplace closer, or possibly sell you the part you need.

BTW, they call a transmission a "gearbox"....must be an "English" thing.


Cheers, dave

 Here is a diagram, this is #6 (bracket):
