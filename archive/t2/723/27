Subject: Re: [T2] I popped out a CV Joint

Yesterday I discovered that whoever worked on the bus before me found
a smart way to not get dirty while doing CVs. It's pretty
straighforward : not use any grease ! The lower CV was totally dry
while it's rubber boot was not cracked.
Amazing !!!
I could not stop driving yesterday night once I was done (midnight).
It felt good to be back on the road after having the bus for 12 days
on the stands. Working heat riser + stock exhaust + torqued heads make
a difference !
