From Eric Arnold:

I checked and my drain plug is 12mm (at least it takes a 12mm socket to
remove it).
Now I just need to find someone who stocks the washer.

Whoa...... sounds like you are used to working on old British that use to use Whitworth wrenchs!
Back then, a 1/4 marked wrench was around 1/2" because good ol' Whitworth figured that was the size of the nut
or bolt that 1/4". That system went by-by in the mid to late 60's and was last used on Jaguar starter cable
bolts......

Now a days, all bolt measurements are in the thread size.  Head sizes vary with car makers. A 8mm bolt on a
Japanese car uses a 12mm wrench, a 8mm bolt on a German car is 13mm.

Measure the diameter of the tread section. You can use an open end wrench and be real close.
If the drain plug fits in a 12 open end, it is 12mm.
