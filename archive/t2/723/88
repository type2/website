Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic: Missing California

I miss So Cal every day. Laguna, Dana Point, San Diego. I will always 
consider myself a Lagunatic at heart.

Charleston is groovy, but hey, I moved to the East Coast because it was 
the place I landed after the Dot Com bubble burst, and I needed 
employment at some place other than Starbuck's.

At least we have the grooviest Full Moon Bus Club people here to hang 
out with and help with our bus. That is reason enough for me not to 
kvetch too loudly.
