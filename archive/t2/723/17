I make a correction myself to my says after I read the answer of Paul
Roethele.

Transmission can be used but you have to find another flywheel, clutch,
pressure plate to start the fit (200 mm instead of 210 if I recall right).

Why so much work and money for this swap ???

My opinion

BusBosss Pierre (which knows thing but has so much to learn from you
guys/gals)

I'm pretty sure it is a bored-out 1600 cc type 1 bug engine, so I don't
think it would even work for my bus.  My friend insists it will, so I
told him I would consult a panel of experts.  That means you,
Type-2-ers! ;)  So can anybody tell me...

--- This is a Type 1 engine.  Just seeing the exhaust port at each end of
the heads is the answer.

1. Would it bolt-up to my stock transmission?

---  I say no.  Flywheel is larger from 1975 if I recall it right.  Previous
to that, it would have fit.

2. Would it accept my stock fuel injection?

---  I say no.  Studs location and port dimensions are not the same.

3. Would it accept my stock exhaust?

--- No. As said above, exhaust port is at a different location.  Ports are
under the head on a Type 4 engine.

4. Would the HP/torque be comparable/better?

--- Comparable

5. Would it even mount in my bus? (The web page says they can "supply
Rear-mount Engine case Bus, Squareback and Thing engine applications for
a small additional cost."  Is this just pre-'71 busses?)

--- Probably need different supporting at the back from what you have at the
present time.

Hope this can help.  Anybody correct my says where I am out of bound.
