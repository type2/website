Subject: Thread pitch.

Thread pitch.

I want to make a mini-press to remove and install the wrist pins out_of and 
in_to the piston / connecting rod.  I will use a 7 bolt with fender washer 
types on either end, a nut on one end, and appropriate PCV pipe segments 
between.

As I tighten the nut, this will press the wrist pint OUT of the piston / 
connecting rod coupling, or INTO the piston / connecting rod coupling, 
depending on the setup.

In order to get the most efficiency from this setup, should I use a 7 bolt 
(or threaded rod) with a broad thread pitch, or with a tight thread pitch?

Should the bolt / threaded rod be as thin as possible, or as thick as 
possible?

Please consider the friction that would be encountered at the bolt threads 
by the rotating nut.  My objective is ease of turning the nut.  I dont want 
it to bind.

Thanks
