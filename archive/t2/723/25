Subject: Yet Another BallJoint Question

Ok.

I've read over and over that it's difficult if not impossible for an
average person to replace the ball joints on our busses and that a big
fat press is needed.

Why are these so much worse than other cars? Why can't we use
something like this:

I guess I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around this.
