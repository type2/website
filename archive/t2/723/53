Subject: re Animals sleeping on tarmac at night...

I read a post from someone a couple of years ago- he said running through 
the desert at night can be a bit hairy, as rattlers can stretch out on that 
warm tarmac, giving you the choice of running them over or dodging 
em...maybe someone can tell us is this is true. Doesn't sound great to me...

A hint.  Always make sure that gas pump shows zero before starting to fill 
up.

Driving at night  can = animals sleeping on warm tarmac = ????  Be warned.
