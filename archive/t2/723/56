This set fits a 2.0L Porsche 914. My recollection is that Porsche 914
engines had domed pistons. I think these can be used on a VW block but I may
be wrong. Perhaps someone else on the list can confirm.   To give you an
idea of their value, we would sell them for maybe $650 or $700 if our
distributor has them.  (Yes, we can get parts for brands other than VW.)
