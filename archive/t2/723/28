You have to see it to believe it. There is little chance that tool will work
on a bus ball joint. They are very large, and very tight. It is about the
size, and therefore surface area. I have seen small hydraulic presses NOT be
able to press out a bus ball joint at all. If the cylinder is leaky at all,
it will just not have enough pressure for the job. Even beetle joints, which
are smaller (less surface area, less pressure needed to remove) can give an
average size press a hard time.  The c-press might work on a beetle joint,
especially if you use an impact gun to drive the screw.

The sound when the joint breaks loose from the torsion arm is like a gun
shot.
