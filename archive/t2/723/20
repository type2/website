Subject: Help with fixing a few dents

I'd like to patch up a few minor dents and I was curious if anyone had 
any website links with information on how to patch and sand them.  I'm 
looking specifically on what kind of tools to use, what type of bondo 
(if there are different types), and general tips and tricks.  Any help 
would be much appreaciated!

Thanks,
Mike
