Subject: Chunks of Aluminum

Hello,

I have had my current 1700 motor for about 1 year. I have been doing regular 
oil changes but the other day I discovered several pebble size pieces of 
aluminum in the oil  screen. Then I saw a couple more where the screen goes. 
I could not pull them out.

I was told that at one time perhaps a piston may have blown and who ever 
fixed it did not take out all of the pieces. If this is true? and How do I 
get out the rest of these small pieces?

Thanks.
