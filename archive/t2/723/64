Subject: FI to Carb'd Bus

Are there any write-ups on converting a carb'd bus to fuel injection
other than this?

Did a quick search and haven't seen anything. I'll keep looking after
I go adjust my carbs AGAIN.

(Yes, I got a line on a complete FI kit. I know about having to fab up
the brackets and locations for other bits, but was hoping for a
complete how-to with pics and goodies. If there's nothing out there
guess what I'll be doing!)
