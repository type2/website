Don,

You can do more than that!

got a remote start button?

Start the bus and look at the dwell while running.
Pull the cap and rotor and turn the engine over with your starter and note 
the "average approximate" dwell reading.

Adjust points while doing this.  If the battery is in good shape, you can 
get pretty much perfect the first or second time!...as in *exactly* 50 
degrees.

Be sure and use the right scale!!!

Cheers, dave
