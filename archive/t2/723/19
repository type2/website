But without the hard slam, you miss out on that delightful
sound.  You know,.. the one that sounds like an empty dumpster
being pushed off of a loading dock.  So accoustically
satisfying  :-P

just turn the outside handle up and it pulls the door tight
and latches
tight.  No hard
slamming necessary.  Give it a try.........
