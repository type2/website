Subject: Need source for part 002 301 239

Thank for those who gave me advice on reliable web-order companies.
BUT: I'm unable to find a source for the shift bracket (relay lever
guide) for my '77 bus.

Mine is broken, here nobody sells it, and the only place is
longenterpised where I found it - but they won't ship international
orders below 300 $ !

So pleeeeaaaaaseee help!!!
