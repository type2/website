Subject: RE: [T2] Help with fixing a few dents

I would also benefit from an online reference.  A product
reference would also be nice, even though there are many
products and likely under different names in different
countries and such.  Products such as acid etching primers,
sealants, and helpful purchasing info on automotive paint, I
would also benefit from.  I can talk about house paint all
day,.. automotive paint is something else entirely.
