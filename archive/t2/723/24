Look around your town (yellow pages) for a shop that rebuilds starters and alternators. That way you pay for the repair you need and you get YOUR alternator back - not somebody else's core - which may not be the right part or a part that went through hell in it's lifetime. 

NAPA or one of the rebuild places can prob get you the diodes. 

Get rid of the Haynes. Buy yourself a Bentley (less than $30 last time I looked). You'll have better info. I use my Haynes and Bentley together.
