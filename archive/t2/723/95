Subject: Re: [T2] Points adjustment tip

Aren't the new points coming with the grooves or nubs that allow you to move and hold the points with a flat blade screwdriver? I use two screwdrivers - one to loose the points.tighten the point, 1 to move the points. I never get them loose enough to move with my finger, always requires the second screwdriver...
