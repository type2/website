The seller says it is for a Porsche .

I don't know, but if anyone needs a set of 2, I've still got the ones I
posted about in January...

It's a pair of new pistons/cylinders, which were part of a set of four.  The
box has "Kolbenschmidt AG" printed all over it, and the following numbers:

029 198 075
92 803 960

The second number has "Volkbusrist" printed under it.

The pistons are in their original wrappings and have never been used.
There's also an open set of seals, gaskets, and the odd widget (a metal disk
with 6 holes in it?) with the following text and numbers on the package:

039 198 009
"Reinz Vollsatz"-Full Set-Pochette Complete
01-23455-06
914  2,0  2,0  LTR.100  PS  (73,5KW)  1972/

I have no idea what they're worth, but anyone's welcome to make an offer for
them.  The buyer will also need to cover the cost of the shipping.
