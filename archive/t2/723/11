It is manual.

The part I'm searching for, is at the front of the transmission, if you
remove the front cover, there it is, a U shape metal, with springs and
that metal rod attached to it, in which the shift ball is, into which
the hockey stick comes.

Here is a diagram, this is #6 (bracket):

This company could have one, but they didn't responded to my email yet.

If I can not find one, do you think a turner could manufacture me one,
after the old (broken)? Would it last? Or what the hell should I do?!
Here is this very good bus, with beautifull engine (I took it out
because of the transmission, and inspected, just to be sure) and this
tiny bit of part missing could make this whole big car sit in my
backyard for months?!
