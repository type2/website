Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in Mexico

Hey there,

Being a former resident behind the Orange Curtain and San Diego, I can
sort of address the gasoline subject down in Ensenada. I stayed in
Ensenada and Rosarito Beach (and point further South) MANY times on
extended vacations/trips.

While I was exclusively a Saab driver then (900, 900 Turbo), I never
had a problem with petrol anywhere in Mexico, and we did some extensive
traveling. I usually avoided the smallest stations in the middle of
nowhere, and AAA had a handy list of gas stations (back then) that had
"good gas."

I have no idea how a Bus will react to their fuel, though. I did see
TONS of bugs running around (as well as VW Beetles!) with BC-MEX
plates, so it is probably ok.

Just my 478 pesos. Your exchange rates may vary.
