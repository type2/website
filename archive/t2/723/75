Thank you for the suggestions in response to my trouble shooting and
remote starter questions yesterday.

I started testing the double relay per Bentley 10.8, section 4.1. In
step 4 and 5, I jumpered 85 to 86c. The test light lit up until I
engaged the starter. The same occurred when testing 86a. Am I reading
correctly, the light should be on while cranking? If the light is on
backwards from what ought to be happening, what might be the causal
factor?

Thanks yet again,

jack
