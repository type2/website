My advice to you my friend is to take up snow skiing,
snow boarding, hiking, mountain climbing, bird
watching, or one of the many, many things that
Colorado has to offer that you won't find in LA. 
Surely the traffic is a lot better.  I live in
Chattanooga and can't ski because it's such a long
drive (or an expensive flight) to do so.  Same with
one of my other passions, scuba diving.  We have
spring-fed lakes (freezing!) and the Tennessee river
(swift current!).  But this is also one of the most
beautiful places in the country.  Anytime you get
home-sick, just look around at the beautiful scenery
you have there.  The one time I was there, I loved it.
 I have a good friend in Summit county that I want to
go see.  And one of these days, I'm going to
hang-glide off Teluride.  Don, life is what one makes
of it.  Good luck on your trip home.  Cheers...KR
