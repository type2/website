Subject: New tire are on:)

Hi Volks,

So my new tires arrived at the shop and I went on my lunch break to put
them on. I had already picked the shop because the owner runs the place
and has been nothing but extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Also he
made sure the guys know I am a bit over cautious with my bus. Including
No one drives it but me:-) I was in there helping a bit- basically
double checking what they were doing the whole time.

So I went for the Michelin Agilis 185/80/14  1865(-at-)65. They filled them
with nitrogen instead of air, wonder if that means I can go faster:-)
Kind of like when you were a kid you could run faster with a new pair of
shoes:-) They feel great the short distance back to work, I can't wait
till 4:30 to get on the road home. The weekend will be a better test
with the canoe on top driving around. I am so happy:-)

Question I may have misunderstood but in a discussion on the samba I
think Karl was saying these are really not the right size for our
busses? Did I read that right?

Have a great weekend,
