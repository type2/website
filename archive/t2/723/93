That's the problem. Because tightening the screw ALWAYS seems to move
the adjustment. Grr...

When I "rebuilt" my distributor I greased up the points and the screw
and washer and it helped a bit. But not much.

I have to say, now that I'm close to 50* (after tweaking) my bus has a
bit more power and accelleration is smoother. Definitely worth the
trouble to get right.
