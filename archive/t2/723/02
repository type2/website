I don't know if this is coincidence, or if it results from a call from our
shop, as we've been contacting customers who have Hankook 185's on order.

As you know, I have been a big proponent of the Hankook tires, having used
them for years, and now started selling them. Unfortunately, our Bus/Vanagon
sales volume took Hankook USA completely by surprise, and I sold their
entire U.S. inventory. They have more en route from the factory, but it's
taking longer than they had originally anticipated. (They first said 2-3
weeks, now it looks like another 4-6)

As a result, they have offered me their 195R14 for the same price in the
meantime. (Usually it is $10 more per tire.)  This is the identical tire,
except that its slightly larger size actually provides a slight increase in
load capacity (2094 lbs vs. 1874).  The size difference is roughly half an
inch, so it's not dramatically different. The only real negative that I can
see is that this diameter difference will cause your speedo to read 2.5% too
low (so if your speedo says 60 mph, you're actually going 61.5). Of course
this assumes that your speedo is dead-on to begin with; on old busses or
Vanagons, a mere 2.5% fluxuation may be the least of your worries! :-)

Personally I don't see a major advantage or drawback to using this tire
instead of the 185, given the relatively small size difference. The main
drawback would have been the $40 per set price difference, if it weren't for
the fact that Hankook is waiving that price difference for the time being.
Some people even prefer a slightly larger tire, as it slightly reduces
engine revs at high speed and slightly increases ground clearance (although
both differences are quite small, and in my opinion negligable).  Of course
the 195R14 size is technically not what the Vanagon calls for, so I suppose
that should be clearly noted.

On the other hand, for those who do want a slightly larger tire, this
temporary offer makes these a pretty good deal. And for those who need tires
now and can't wait 4-6 weeks, the Hankooks' excellent performance may make
the size change worthwhile, compared to inferior 185R14's for more money.
(This is the tire that outperformed the much more expensive Michelin Agilis
in an independent German road test.)

I don't normally carry many of the Hankook 195R14's, because for $40 more
per set than the 185's there isn't much call for them. But I'm going to take
Hankook up on their offer to give them to me at the same price, and stock
them for the next month or so (or while supplies last). I should have them a
week from Monday, give or take a day or so.
