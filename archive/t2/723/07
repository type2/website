Subject: stock 78 automatic engine installed, would like help

I've installed my engine in my 78 automatic. I hooked everything up and 
tried to start it. The engine turns over and acts like it wants to start, 
but then dies. After an attempt or two to start the bus, it quits acting 
like it wants to start. I think this behavior is gas being injected by 
the cold start valve which cuts out when the thermo-time switch heats up 
as it is supposed to do. 

I have verified spark and I'm inferring gas. I installed a new fuel
filter while I was replacing my fuel lines and added about seven gallons
of new gas to a drained tank.

If I understand the Bentley correctly, all of the injectors spray every 
other point opening. This means I ought not have the harness hooked up
incorrectly. Am I correct here?

Where should I start on the fuel injection trouble shooting list? Can I 
verify fuel pressure while cranking? Should I hear the fuel pump with the 
key in the run position -- I'm not hearing it, and am not clearly 
remembering what's been said in list regarding hearing it.

How do I hook up my remote starter? I hooked the switch up at the
solenoid, but all I got was starter spin.

Also, a couple of folks indicated they might have the 76-79 automatic
throttle linkage (m6 male threaded stock, nuts, pivot, spring, and
c-clip would be dreamy). I kludged a temporary fix, but would love to
have the right part.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions, directions, corrections, and/or
linkages,

jack
