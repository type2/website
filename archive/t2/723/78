The only time I have seen the track of a vehicle altered like this is so
that the wheels match the width of a railway track so that they can run on
the track, guided by small flanged bogie wheels front and rear.  You'd
probably find some traces of the bracketry front and rear.

Either that, or someone just happened to get a good deal on the "railway"
wheels and used them on another bus.  You might have a "rarest of the
rare" item there!
