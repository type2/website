Jeremy -
 
    It can certainly be done -  I have a 1600 DP in my '72 (done by a previous owner).  Main considerations are:
 
- You will have to make sure the new engine has mounting points for the rear engine brace, or buy an oil plate adapter (caution - many people think these are a really bad idea)
 
-You may have to trim your transmission input shaft
 
-You will need to locate an original set of filler tin, or buy a fiberglass reproduction (like the ones at http://www.creativecarcraft.com/notforbug.htm ), or fab it yourself out of sheet metal (what I have, but not recommended - I will be replacing mine with the fiberglass model when $$$ permits)
 
-You might have to fiddle with the length of the throttle cable (adjusters are readily available, for example: http://www.bugsandbuggies.com/Parts.asp?CN=528&SN=89&GN=7 )
 
The main consideration is that your bus may be considerably slower if you use your transmission - there were taller gear ratios in '76 for the bigger engine (I'm sure some of the more technically oriented people here could go into much greater detail about this).  I don't know anything about the quality of the engines from the site you posted, but given all of the above it might be a better idea to find the correct engine, or, if you have your heart set on a 1600, a donor bus with a good engine & tranny...
