If I was in Denver I'd go to one of the area bookstores and see if I 
could start a rumble with  RageBoy. ( 
http://www.rageboy.com/blogger.html ) Then I'd drive to Colorado 
Springs and slap James Dobson.

Don't worry about your bus on the hills. Get a John Dusseldorf tape for 
the eight track and everything will be just fine.
