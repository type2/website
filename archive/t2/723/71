Subject: wheel alteration question

I pulled a wheel off my 1970 Westy for the first time yesterday.   A previous 
owner had gone through a great deal of effort, and I'm sure money, to move 
the center of the wheel all the way to the outside edge so that the tires ride 
closer into the axle.  The wheels are stock 5 hole 14 inch wheels other than 
that.

Why did they do that?
