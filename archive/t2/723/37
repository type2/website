Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in Mexico

Vincent,

I don't think leaded gas is available in Mexico or practically anywhere in the
world anymore.  In the aviation community it's widely said that there is only
one factory in the world that still manufactures TEL (Tetraethyl Lead), with
production declining stadily every year.

Pemex sells three kinds of unleaded: "Nova" (blue pumps, very low octane,
might cause your Bus to "no va"), "Magna Sin" (bright green pumps, very
similar to US unleaded, this is what you want), and "Premium" (not available
everywhere, and you probably don't need it anyway).
