Remote starter: 1 clip on the starter bolt that the pos battery cable from the battery connects to. 

The other clip on the terminal (push on male terminal) that the key switch attaches to. You'll have to have the key on for it to fire up. The remote will only make the engine roll over. 

If you problem is fuel related, just spray some WD-40 into the intake to see if it will fire up. A 2-3 second squirt will give you enough to start I think. Will run for a second or two and die. At that point you've got fuel supply problems. 

Have to checked for fuel flow (remove the cold start injector and check for a squirt). 

Have you checked for fuel pressure?
