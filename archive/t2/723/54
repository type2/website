Subject: Broke a thingy

So ... replacing the gas lines isn't going so well ... The gas line comes 
thru the fire wall and T's off to a cylinder - carries on and T's off to 
another carries on and goes into this little blue thing that has a couple 
wires - picks up on the other side and carries on ...

So ... what is that blue thing called that the fuel line goes into that has 
the plug attached - I broke a piece of it off and need to replace the 
^&$%#*(-at-).
