Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in Mexico

Cool, I drove down Baja a couple years ago, awesome place.  The gas is lower
quality, but unleaded is readily available.  It's low octane but I don't
know the rating.  It works fine.  Make sure your spare is in good shape and
strap on a gas can if you go south of Ensenada!  There are some long
stretches and flat tires are too common (evidenced by number of tire shops,
every 5 miles!).  By the way if you get a chance I would highly recommend
Bajia de los Angeles on the sea of Cortez side.  Gorgeous area, great sea
kayaking/marine life and a nice change from the crashing waves on the
Pacific side.  Also highly recommend not driving the highway at night (or
camping right on it), there are banditos, but mostly because the road is
narrow, squiggly and there are LOTS of huge trucks.  I saw lots of local
driving T2's so you should be able to get most any part if necessary but
maybe not FI stuff but probably doesn't apply to you. I'm jealous, have fun
