Subject: RE: 185 vs 195 tire question

I used to run 195R14 Cooper SRMII's on a vanagon.
 Same specs as the Hankooks, like 2000 lbs max
load and load range D.  The larger tires still
weren't enough.  My speedo was still 4-5 mph to
optimistic at 65mph.  My loaf bus is quite
optimistic also.  I wouldn't be concerned about
buying a slightly larger tire.  


Happy bussin'
