Subject: Porsche 914 2 liter case

OK, I am considering going after the pair of 3 stud intake heads (2 liter) 
from a junk yard 914.

The pair of heads alone will be $80, but for $70 more, I can get the rest of 
the engine (not the FI or carbs, what ever it HAD on it, nor the alternator 
or muffler)

Is there enough value in the block/case and the P&C and crank and cam to be 
worth paying the extra $70 for it??

TIA
