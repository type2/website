This seems reasonable, but I've found that the dwell at the initial
setting varies quite a bit from one set of points to another.  I figure if
I can get the engine running at the inital setting I'm ahead!

After that I do all my adjusting with the dwell meter.  The dwell meter
"sees" the electrical situation that is needed, so it takes precidence
over the point gap.

I really wish that VW had done something like the GM points setup where
you run the engine and simply turn a screw to adjust the gap.  The
"loosen, the screw, push the points a smidge, tighten the screw" routine
gets to be very tedious.
