Subject: Headlight dimmer relay

I just took one apart (non functioning)
I always wondered how it worked.  Figured it
was mechanical.  Very neat little machine,
with mechanical springs and latches to switch
between hi/low beams.

I replaced the burnt out coil with one from a
polaroid sonar camera :-).  In line resistor
to reduce voltage (polaroid coil was rated at
6v).  It works great.

I think the reason the coil burnt was because
the switch assembly was frozen, and repeated
attempts to dim the lights got it too hot.  A bit
of wd-40 unfroze the switch.
