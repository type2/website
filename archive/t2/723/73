Subject: vanagon tranny

I hope folks don't mind but this is a water cooled request.

I have a buddy, not on the list, who is need of a good used Vanagon tranny,
part # 091-301-103D. The D is important as it represents a later water cooled
tranny.

If anyone in the SouthEast has a good one for sale pmail me and I'll get you
in touch with Lou.

Thanks!!
