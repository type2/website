What I meant on the Samba about not being the right
tire was not the size, 185R14 is correct, it is the
sidewall. Missing is the reinforced sidewall. Even
though Michelin rates the load weight at 1865 lbs,
which is better than the minimum load weight
requirement of 1540 lbs with reinforced sidewalls,
Michelin does NOT recommend this tire for 86+
Vanagons. 86 Vanagon is as far back as you can go on
the Michelin website, they used the same tires as bay
buses.

There is more to a tire than just size and load weight
and speed rating.....

 Hi Volks,
 
 So my new tires arrived at the shop and I went on my
 lunch break to put
 them on. I had already picked the shop because the
 owner runs the place
 and has been nothing but extremely helpful and
 knowledgeable. Also he
 made sure the guys know I am a bit over cautious
 with my bus. Including
 No one drives it but me:-) I was in there helping a
 bit- basically
 double checking what they were doing the whole time.
 
 So I went for the Michelin Agilis 185/80/14 
 1865(-at-)65. They filled them
 with nitrogen instead of air, wonder if that means I
 can go faster:-)
 Kind of like when you were a kid you could run
 faster with a new pair of
 shoes:-) They feel great the short distance back to
 work, I can't wait
 till 4:30 to get on the road home. The weekend will
 be a better test
 with the canoe on top driving around. I am so
 happy:-)
 
 Question I may have misunderstood but in a
 discussion on the samba I
 think Karl was saying these are really not the right
 size for our
 busses? Did I read that right?
