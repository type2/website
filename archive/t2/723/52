Ginny made a great point.

Also, don't EVER, EVER, EVER speed unless you are POSITIVE no one is
around. The cops down there sometimes drive their own family vehicles,
and will pull over ANYONE for almost ANY reason.

I was lucky. I never once was pulled over, and on some trips I was
nailing my Saabie's throttle to the firewall.

ZOOM ZOOM.

But just be cautious.
