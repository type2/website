Subject: Gas in Mexico

I recently went to Ensenada, in Baja California  Mexico. I was  wondering if 
the gas in Mexico is of good enough quality. any advice will be  appreciated. 
Does Mexico still sell leaded gasoline , and is it wise to use it ?  I plan to 
go to Mexico a lot this summer in my 1971 Westy. I am concerned about  the 
gas and any precautions I should take.
 
 
 
 
 
Thank you
