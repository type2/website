Subject: Points adjustment tip

**I posted this on The Samba, but thought I'd pull in comments here as well**

I've been going nuts with my points lately. Couldn't get a dwell over 30*.

I'd been working off a base of .016" as spec'd in Bentley and my
owner's manual. And making tiny adjustments while the dizzy is in the
bus is a serious PITA.

A beam of light shone through the clouds and shat upon my bald head
today and I tried something new. I pulled the distributor and set to
.014"...

44* dwell

Man I'm a dope. Why didn't I think of this before?
