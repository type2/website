Subject: Re: [T2] wheel alteration question

Jacques asked:


 I pulled a wheel off my 1970 Westy for the first time yesterday.   A previous 
 owner had gone through a great deal of effort, and I'm sure money, to move 
 the center of the wheel all the way to the outside edge so that the tires ride 
 closer into the axle.  The wheels are stock 5 hole 14 inch wheels other than 
 that.
 
 Why did they do that?

This is a serious question, correct??

VW wheels from before 1949 to the end of the 1970 model year were called 'wide 5's'
because of the BIG bolt pattern. Starting in 1971, buses went to the small 5 bolt patteren, 5 x 112mm.

The top wheel here: http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Microfiche/t204700.gif
is a 70 and back wide 5. General rule is 64 to 70 were 14", 63 and back were 15".
