Thanks Paul, and everybody else who replied, either on the list or via
pmail.  Got some really good advice and confirmed what I had guessed,
which was that the bored 1600 would not be a practical replacement.  My
friend was trying to save me some money but was not familiar with the
difference between Type 1 and Type 4 engines.  I think I'm going to
shell out the cash for a rebuilt stock Type 4 2000cc - sounds like the
hassle avoided will be well worth the extra $$.

In the meantime, looks like I'll be ordering a swing lever pin kit and a
new set of ball joints or rebuilt torsion arms.  This should be fun! :)

Jeremy

Jeremy -

    It can certainly be done -  I have a 1600 DP in my '72 (done by a
previous owner).  Main considerations are:

- You will have to make sure the new engine has mounting points for the
rear engine brace, or buy an oil plate adapter (caution - many people
think these are a really bad idea)

-You may have to trim your transmission input shaft

-You will need to locate an original set of filler tin, or buy a
fiberglass reproduction (like the ones at
http://www.creativecarcraft.com/notforbug.htm ), or fab it yourself out
of sheet metal (what I have, but not recommended - I will be replacing
mine with the fiberglass model when $$$ permits)

-You might have to fiddle with the length of the throttle cable
(adjusters are readily available, for example:
http://www.bugsandbuggies.com/Parts.asp?CN=528&SN=89&GN=7 )

The main consideration is that your bus may be considerably slower if
you use your transmission - there were taller gear ratios in '76 for the
bigger engine (I'm sure some of the more technically oriented people
here could go into much greater detail about this).  I don't know
anything about the quality of the engines from the site you posted, but
given all of the above it might be a better idea to find the correct
engine, or, if you have your heart set on a 1600, a donor bus with a
good engine & tranny...
