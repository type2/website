Subject: NBC story

Hi all,

As a public relations guy I get tips throughout the day on stories coming up
in magazines, radio, etc. Saw this one and thought the list might get a kick
out of it.

Guess we gotta keep tuned to NBC for the story.

**14. MANUFACTURING: ANYTHING OLDER THAN A VW BUG? - NBC NEWS (US)
We're doing a story about the last VW Beetle Bug. It will be produced at the
Puebla, Mexico, factory soon. Our question: Can anyone name a modern piece
of machinery that has been around longer, basically unchanged, than the
Beetle? The Beetle Bug was first built 1938-1940 (depending on start date
you choose). No phone calls, please.
Need leads by 05:00 PM US/Eastern JUL 27
