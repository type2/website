Subject: Re: [T2] Solex jets for 2L's

I just checked my non-stock 2L. I popped off the air-cleaner and searched
for numbers: venturis: 28mm, main jet 150 (this is the jet you see inside
the throat, right?). However, this engine is a 2L with 36-40 PDSIT carbs,
higher compression, larger valves, and hotter cam.
I could have checked my stock carbs in Germany, but I noticed the thread too
late and now I am on this side of the pond again ...

> All conventional wisdom that I have come across says that the stock Solex
venturis are way too small for even a 1700cc engine, yet VW put them on from
the factory.  Because of this, I'm not convinced that larger venturis are
necessary for an 11% increase in displacement (from 1800 which came stock
with 26mm venturis, to 2000).  I ran the stock 26mm venturis on my 2-liter
engine for a few years and they ran just fine.  My current opinion is that
the stock cam is the limiting factor in upper-rpm breathing on the type IV,
not the carbs.  With an aftermarket cam, I think a case could be made for
larger venturis.
