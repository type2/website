TDC sensor.  You can remove it and leave the hole open, or just leave it there.  I've never seen a functioning TDC sensor on a type IV, they are pretty rare.  Even ol 'n bust'd ones are pretty rare.

Typically the spacers were for fuel injected engines only.

Air injection ports.  1973 had one per cylinder (four total) and 1974 only had one on the drivers side (three total).  I've never been able to figure out why this is.  If there are really bolts there, then someone has plugged the ports with bolts.  If they are original they would actually be threaded, hollow tubes with a fitting at the top to attach to a pipe assembly that straddled the engine.  Many people cut these tubes and pinch them off when they remove the crosspipe assembly.
