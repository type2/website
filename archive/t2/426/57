Even the correct scale isn't an very accurate way to do it. I remember
timing mine to 7.5 and the smog referee insisted it was really 9 degrees but
I couldn't argue.

I really want to hook up to that flywheel sensor and compare the phase of
the spark to that sensor to accurately do it. Future project...

I don't think any bus was timed 5 BTDC.

I bought a spare scale a few months ago so I could paint the marks white for
readability.

On it are dimples at 7.5 BTDC, 5ATDC and 10ATDC. There is also a square
notch between 26 and 28 VOR.
