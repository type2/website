Subject: Re: [T2] interesting weird engine failure need advice

Hello Dave


Okay, thanks the boiling out the gas tank at a radiator shop sounds like a really good
idea.

When I rebuild an engine I have my machine shop guy boil all the tin in his big vat of
boiling lye. The lye turns all the grease compounds into soap just like all the soap
manufacturers do. The lye also eats off all the paint.

But he told me he wouldn't boil my gas tank. I didn't think of a radiator shop.

I replaced a gas tank once on a 1970 bus. When I took out the tank I sort of sound
proofed the van by applying lots of coats of Aluminum Roof coating. I bought a 5 gallon
bucket and covered everything I could. I covered the gas tank cover on both sides. It
helped a lot with cutting down the noise. Although rugs all over the inside help the
most. For soundproofing, old cars used to have most surfaces covered with thick tar
soaked mats of compressed cottonseed. You can get 30 LB roofing felt (compressed
cottonseed) and do the same thing. I also covered all the engine compart ment surfaces
with "Duct Board" . This is a 4' x 10' piece of 1"  thick stiff fiberglass insulation
covered on one side with aluminum covered mylar. You just cut it with a utility knife.

Most of the engine noise comes from the hot air heat exchangers so you can't really make
an old VW that quiet anyway.

That is a very  interesting picture of a ball bearing just sitting there. Did you ever
figure out where it came from?
