	Ben,
	Coulda been the condensor, coulda been the points. Did you
check the point gap before swapping? Ah, well. The engine will
RUN with NO condensor, but it will kill the points pretty quick.
That's why pointsandcondensor are usually replaced at the same
time.

	From my experience, big bangs (not backfires) mean a combustable
mixture got let out into the exhaust and went off there. A BACKFIRE
is when something lights off the mixture while its coming into
the cylinder- the exhaust valve is open combustion takes place
in the INTAKE. Hence 'back fire' - fire going back UP the intake.
Most people have never seen an engine so fouled-up that it would
do this, but it CAN and does happen with huge carbon deposits
which heat up and ignite the incoming mixture or other other
extreme problems that ignite the incoming mixture.

	What most people call 'backfire' is the result of poor 
sparks letting unburned mixture go out the exhaust. It finds
something hot and goes off when it hits hot combustion products 
from one of the other cylinders or when they hit it. KaPOW! 

	I wonder if the ignition happens when the leading edge of the 
unburned mixture hits hot exhaust gas in the muffler or if it ignites 
when hot exhaust gas (or hot exhaust valve) hits the unburned mixture- 
in other words, which exhast valve is open- the one from the
cylinder that didn't fire  or one from the one that did? On reflection,
I'd pick the KaPOW! happening when a cylinder that fired opens its
exhaust valve...
