Subject: Oil Pressure Light

Hi!,  I'm having problems with my Oil pressure light.  It stays on.  I
have recently changed my oil and now the light stays on.  I am not much
of a mechanic.  I'm a computer geek by trade.  I have a 1970 VW Deluxe
bus (Green) on its second engine.  Could you help me troubleshoot this
problem.  Thanks and Aloha...
Michael.
