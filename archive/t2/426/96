Whoa, a bus monopoly piece?  That is too cool!!!  I wonder if, being a "thrifty" vehicle it would have a better-than-average chance of landing on Free Parking?  :)

Has anyone actually seen these for sale?  That would be a great addition to a vintage monopoly game (I still remember getting monopoly from three different people one Christmas back in the early 70's).
