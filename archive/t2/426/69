Gary,

Forget the fuel part....went thru that procedure myself on one that had 
sat 8 years....you really should have pulled the tank out and cleaned it
before putting the engine back in...you will have another opportunity 
though.

I've seen a similar situation on a 1600 single port that I rebuilt.
Ran fine for the first 30 minutes and then i drove it about 4 miles to get 
pizza.  Died right after leaving the pizza place.

When I pulled it and started looking, one of the valves had stuck
open.  I tapped it gently  with a hammer and it  snapped closed 
immediately.  I readjusted valves and turned it over several times by hand 
and it did fine.  Put it back in the car and it has about
500-1,000 miles on it now...with no problem.

You won't know until you take it apart again...you may have something that 
caused the lifter to stick, or the valve to stick.

Never seen that kind of destruction from a problem like that though.

Maybe a bent pushrod and that's it.

Cheers, dave
