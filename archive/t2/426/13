Subject: Late Bay/Vanagon Sliding Windows

Here goes nothing.
I have been trying to locate a set of sliding windows of the late
bay variety.  I have seen these available at certain vendors
websites, but also know that they can be had in my local area if I
look hard enough.  There was even a set that I was going to grab
last week off of a junked 78, but I waited a day and when I got back
there with tools needed, somebody beat me to it.*sigh*

At any rate, my local yard stacks the junked vanagons next to the
junked buses.  Side by side, the sliding windows look (to the eye)
to be the same dimensions of the glass that would fit in a late bay;
although the seals absolutely appear wider on the vanagon's than on
the buses.  The window latch mechanisms are the same as well.
Several catalogues that sell seals for sliding windows (WCM, RMMW)
list different part numbers for the seals, but what I don't know is
if the window units themselves are the same.  Its obvious that the
seals would be different, as the frame in the body types are of
different dimensions.

Havn't had the presence of mind to go the yard with a tape measure
yet, so I figured I would ask you all if you were aware of any
similarity/dissimilarity for those sliding windows.

The local yards have tons of junked vanagon's with that glass
available, but the buses have been picked clean.  If I was a vanagon
owner I would be set.
