Subject: Re: [T2] lowering the front end of a bay.

Wouldnt it be easier to raise the back a notch?

Lowering the front of a bus is an expensive and labor intensive job, whereas
raising the rear would take an hour or so and cost you nothing...

is there a simple way to modify the height of the
front end of a 70 bay?

On a T3 you can simply turn the torsion bar a notch or
two to adjust height..

I dont want to slam it just make it more of an even
height with the rear, i dont like the low-rider look..

thanx,
rob
