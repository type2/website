Subject: Trading windows...any takers?

Hi Volks,
 I have a '71 Deluxe model bus that the PO put jalousie windows on. Not that
I have anything against them, but, I just think they have no business being
on a deluxe. I was wondering if there are any list members who would be
willing to trade window unit for window unit...I will trade the jalousies
for a slider or vent window set(complete, frame, glass, etc). Any one
interested? The jalousies I have are in good condition and they don't
leak...one will need to be rescreened.

Thanks Volks,
Scott
