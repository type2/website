<< **14. MANUFACTURING: ANYTHING OLDER THAN A VW BUG? - NBC NEWS (US)

We're doing a story about the last VW Beetle Bug. It will be produced at the

Puebla, Mexico, factory soon. Our question: Can anyone name a modern piece

of machinery that has been around longer, basically unchanged, than the

Beetle? The Beetle Bug was first built 1938-1940 (depending on start date

you choose). No phone calls, please.

Need leads by 05:00 PM US/Eastern JUL 27

My '62 Morgan 4/4 is basically the same as the original '36 4/4...And the 2003
4/4 is quite the same, again. The sliding pillar front end (original in 1909) 
is
still the same. BTW, '36 was THE big year in Morgan changes...That's the year
Morgan introduced the 4/4 - 4 wheels/4 cylinders - prior to that all Morgans
were "trikes", three wheelers with JAP, Matchless, Blackbourne motorcycle
engines for power...Trikes were in production until '51, the last ones with 
small EnFo (English Ford) engines... :-)
BTW, the grandson of the original founder of the company, now runs it...
