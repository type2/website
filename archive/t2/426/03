Courtney,

The guys on the megasquirt list have discussed it off and on...and I 
believe that someone actually did it....I haven't been watching that list 
as closely lately cause I am working hard trying to get my bus ready for 
Eureka Springs...and they generate about 3 times more mail than we do!

Lots of tuning changes and certain injectors that can flow a lot because
there is not as much "energy" available in the propane as there is in 
gasoline.

It is doable though, F**d apparently sells a dual use vehicle that runs
on either....my uncle has one, but did have some minor problems with 
it...since worked out.

When I was growing up in West Texas, propane was "free" at the well sites 
and my stepdad modified his car to run on it(with a carb).  Wasn't old 
enough to know whether it ran better or worse, only that the fuel was 
pretty much free....the only bad part was when he almost froze his hand 
off filling it up one day when he didn't get the connector on the tank 
good.

Oh, I just remembered that there is a site in the UK that offers
to do the conversion for you(carbs I think)...and probably the same 
someplace in the states if you looked.

As always, YMMV

Cheers, dave
