Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] Trash into oil

The original post was about an ecological one (i guess!). 
I hope that all car will do 50mpg one day, and it is pissing me off to 
have that unburn fuel in the back of my Westy, but i think am better off 
whit this little one then a 30 foots V-10 RV.

Am not bashing the SUV in particular,  am bashing those who don't have a 
"conscience" because they live in one of bigest and most free (sorry for 
my English here) continent in the world. America thinks big, it could 
think a bit smaller, that's what am trying to say. IMAO :-)
My mom just bought a small SUV!!!! i was mad as hell (at least it's a 
very small V6 that would fit nicely in my Bus, he he he) , but like you 
said, it's a free country! If you did a bit of traveling, it's chocking 
to see how big and powerful the car/truck are in America.

 >>>Lets go back to what we're here for, the Bus, and may it remain a 
part of an active link to history for many generations to enjoy.<<<<

That is the point, will it be others generations if some still keep 
thinking big????
I guess you right, we could go on for ever on that subject, drinkable 
water is a good exemple!!! But its not the place for that, sorry about that.

Have a good weekend Stan
