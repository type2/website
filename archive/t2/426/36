Subject: Eccentric Bushing

I am rebuilding the beam on my 1968 Westy and have had a machine shop press
out to old ball joints and press in the new replacements (Tks Bus Depot). When
I got them back the Eccentric Burshings were in the parts box but had been
mixed up. I don't which bushing came from which torsion arm or if it even
matters. I am thinking about putting a little anti seize on the bushing to
make it easier when it comes to ajusting for the camber but it this a smart
move or a serious no no.Please respond.
