Subject: Hot engine = No start

I know this subject has been brought up before and that there is some relay
I can install to fix the problem but can anyone tell me exactly what is
going on here. As long as the motor is cool it starts fine. Even making
trips around town its okay. But on one trip back from New England it would
not turn after getting gas and had to push start. My 72 used to do this
after highway driving for some time.  Is it just a sign on the starter
getting old? Am I missing a heat shield for the starter? I really dont
think I should have to modify my starter system to aviod this problem, but
hey maybe that relay is easier and cheaper than a new starter?
