Subject: Key Blanks

I might be able to get VW key blanks in bulk from a local locksmith.
They'll need a little time to make sure that the blanks are available to
them (I get the "R" blank there for my bus).

What I'll need to know is which blanks are the most difficult to find.  I
used the page that Richard sent yesterday to see what key blanks are used,
but I don't know which are the most needed.

The blanks come in a box of either 50 or 100 (not sure yet), and I don't
want to put out a ton of cash for blanks that I'll end up stuck with.

Suggestions?
