they are not identical, but they can be interchanged if you are going from
hydro to solid. in fact the hydro rocker assemblies are slightly better in
design, so they are an "upgrade" on a solid lift motor. i wouldn't swap them
the other way 'round (solid arms on a hydro motor), though they will fit.
