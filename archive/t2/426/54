Subject: ignition timing

Hello,

I have a 2.0 motor with fuel injection, and should be timing my motor at
7.5 BTDC.

ingscale2.jpg

Here is a picture of my timing scale for reference. Note those little
circle shaped dimples. For some reason I thought those were placed on
there in the different spots where the different bus motors would be
timed at. 

7.5BTDC means 7.5 on this scale right? 

If so, the scale jumps from 6 to 12 with only one mark between the two.
How am I supposed to time my motor at 7.5 with such a huge non-specific
area to work with? 

I have been timing it at that mark by the number 6, but that dimple is
before the 6, which I am guessing now is just because the dimples don't
mean squat, or that is for 5BTDC for motors up to 74/75 but not after,
which is what mine is. 

There is no dimple after the 6 where 7.5 would be somewhere in that area
between 6 and 12.

What am I missing here? 

Thanks,

Head up me bum -
