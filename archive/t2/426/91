That was it, thanks.

Now, any thoughts as to why it would change while idling? I will have my
timing light on it, and it will be jumping around from anywhere between
4 and 9 BTDC. The average is still 7.5, but a lot of the time its just
surging and going above and below that. 

I have another AFM I am going to try after the trip this weekend, we'll
see where that gets me.
