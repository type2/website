greg,

the real problem with using 1.7l carbs on a 2.0l motor is not getting more
FUEL into it (bigger jets), but more air. you need AIR to hold the FUEL and
to get more air you need a bigger venturi in the carb.

if you have some extra carbs to mess with, you could try opening up the
venturis by 2mm. this could be done by a competent machinist. the venturis
are removable from the carb body. i tried to look this up, but couldn't
verify that the euro spec carbs had bigger vents, but all carburation logic
would say they would have. when fitting aftermarket carbs on a motor the
first thing you do is decide what size venturis you will run, and this is
determined mostly by displacement. two motors with 300cc difference in
displacement would not likely run the same size vents unless the other
engine specs were vastly different.
