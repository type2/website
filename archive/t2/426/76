Subject: RE: [T2] Solex jets for 2L's

I have now found a listing for 2L jets in a German Repair Manual (So wird's
gemacht by Etzold). This information refers to the CU-code dual carb 2L
Vanagon engine but should be identical to the CJ engines as the only
technical changes involved hydraulic lifters and electronic ignition.

Manual and automatic transmission, Spetember 1979 on:
Venturi: 26 mm
Main jet: x 132.5
Air correction jet: 140
Idle fuel jet (Leerlaufkraftstoffduese): 55
Idle air jet (Leerlaufluftduese): 140 - cannot be changed
Additional fuel jet (Zusatzkraftstoffduese): 45 - cannot be changed
Additional air jet (Zusatzluftduese): 0.7 - cannot be changed

Prior to September 79 - i.e. very early Vanagons with production dates
between June and September used x 135 main jets with 50 idle fuel jets.

My own engine with raised compression and a hotter cam uses 28mm venturis
and 150 air correction jets in 36-40 PDSIT carbs. I have no idea which main
jets are installed with this combination.
