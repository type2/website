Gentlemen's, after being very happy camper with my new Weber, sadness 
and rage are back!!!!
Same problem as before! Explanation:

Morning: Bus cold (overnight), very humid (95%) and wet. It's a NO start 
to very difficult start, including heavy backfire (12 gage sound), 
puffing, rough running to complete engine stall!!! Heavy smell of fuel!

Ok, it's not a carb problem anymore, that for sure, it's not the pump, 
tank, IT'S NOT A FUEL PROBLEM, am sure of that.
So, we all know the basic engine rule: Fire-Fuel-Air
What's left, Fire! (Ignition)
So one by one I replace all components (I have spares),
-first the plugs: start, same problem
-the plug wire: start, same problem
-coil, start: same problem
-Rotor & cap: start, same problem

Ok, what's left! The distributor, condenser and point!
Remove this one; the distributor is working fine....
Point is 10000miles old and not so nice anymore, so I change this one 
for a new one and putt a semi-used condenser (no new on hand), shim 
(.20mm) the point, put all back in the Bus and...Vroummmm, steady as it 
can be???????????????? Set dwell to 50, 7.5 BTDC idle, idle 900rpm, 
28-32 at 2500rpm.

I just called one of my VW guru budy and he told me that maybe the 
condenser was not ground properly on the distributor (can is/was 
rusty)???? Or this one was failing slowly and was sensitive to 
humidity???? Im not sure that I solve the problem but I think so! What 
else could it be???? Also, since I change the condenser and point, 
believe it or not I "again" increase the power, I climb overpass like 
they were not there!!!

What do you think??? any of you guys had a similar problem??? Everything 
as been replace/change on this engine, if it's still doing that tomorrow 
morning am selling the bus, I quit, or am taking a hammer and...!!! (NOT)

Here is a few shot of my engine, so you know everything is straight:
