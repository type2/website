Subject: RE: [T2] R: [T2] Trash into oil

Err, I might be slightly jaded but, we are all going to die before we run
out of natural resources so, while I am on this planet I plan on using them
as I normally have for the last 36 years...now, I am sensitive to the
environment so please don't take the above remark out of context. I think
cars have gotten better at burning fuel and letting out zero
emissions...Honda has done some great things in this area...

Even if it was true, the problem we face when we want to avoid gasoline is
not oil availability, it is POLLUTION!

I don't think that a "technology" that allows us to keep using gasoline
instead of more clean energy is progress...
