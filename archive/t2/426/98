Wait and see! maybe not in your life time but one day, our children will 
have too pay the price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 >>>do you ever drive alone in your bus?<<<
Just for testing! i feel it's a waste of fuel, energy and space 
otherwise! When i have to go down town, i take the Bus, Metro, Train or 
i  carpool! Am not bashing USA, am bashing North America way of thinking.
Think BIG, Big is beautiful...

Well David, am not here to argue whit anyone, if you don't understand my 
point, what can i say!

I fully agree that our westy are pollutant, but my Civic is 3 time less 
pollutant than your SUV,  I don't care if my friends and neighbor have 
bigger, nicer and more powerful car/truck. When i travel for business or 
pleasure am always amaze too see the number of Ford Crown Victoria, 
Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincolm Town Car...... with one guys inside, 
so it's my right also to NOT agree with what i see!
Now do you follow me or you need further explanation of how we are 
spoilling our environment!

>The reason I ask is simple - Big V8 SUVs get about the same mileage as VW busses.  I should know, I own one of each.  One '73 VW bus, one '97 Ford Expedition.  They get about the same mileage (15 city, 20 highway).  And you know what?  The Expedition produces much less emissions than the VW.
