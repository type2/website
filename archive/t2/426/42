I did this.  I did not do a before/after dyno test but I noticed no seat-of-the-pants improvement.

The dual Solex 34mm carbs offered by CB Performance supposedly have 28mm venturis.  There's your 2mm.  :)

All conventional wisdom that I have come across says that the stock Solex venturis are way too small for even a 1700cc engine, yet VW put them on from the factory.  Because of this, I'm not convinced that larger venturis are necessary for an 11% increase in displacement (from 1800 which came stock with 26mm venturis, to 2000).  I ran the stock 26mm venturis on my 2-liter engine for a few years and they ran just fine.  My current opinion is that the stock cam is the limiting factor in upper-rpm breathing on the type IV, not the carbs.  With an aftermarket cam, I think a case could be made for larger venturis.
