Subject: Friday bus joke 

This is a joke my father in law sent me thought the list might get a kick
out of it. CHAD

SUBJECT: The Texan bus

 A man from Texas, driving a Volkswagen bus, pulls up next to a guy in a
Rolls Royce with Calif. plates at a stop sign. Their windows are open and he
yells at the guy in the Rolls, "Hey, you got a telephone in that Rolls?"

 The guy in the Rolls says, "Yes, of course I do." "I got one too... see?"
the Texan says. "Uh, huh, yes, that's very nice."
 "You got a fax machine?" asks the Texan. "Why, actually, yes, I do."
"I do too! See? It's right here!" brags the Texan.
 The light is just about to turn green and the guy in the Volkswagen says,
"So, do you have a double bed in back there?"
 The guy in the Rolls replies, "NO! Do you?"
 "Yep, got my double bed right in back here, see?" the Texan replies.
 The light turns and the man in the Volkswagen bus takes off.

 Well, the guy in the Rolls is not about! to be one-upped, so he immediately
goes to a customizing shop and orders them to put a double bed in back of
his car.

 About two weeks later, the job is finally done. He picks up his car and
drives all over town looking for the Volkswagen bus with the Texas plates.
Finally, he finds it parked alongside the road, so he pulls his Rolls up
next to it.

 The windows on the Volkswagen bus are all fogged up and he feels somewhat
awkward about it, but he gets out of his newly modified Rolls and taps on
the foggy window of the Volkswagen. The man in the Volkswagen bus finally
opens the window a crack and peeks out.

The guy in the Rolls says, "Hey, remember me?"

"Yeah, yeah, I remember you," replies the Texan. "What's up?"

"Check this out... I got a double bed installed in my Rolls."

The Texan exclaims, "YOU GOT ME OUT OF THE SHOWER TO TELL ME THAT?!"
