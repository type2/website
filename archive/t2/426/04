Hi all.  Just wanted to give a little update regarding Jerome Jamboree and
highlight some of the important items.

First and foremost it is now officially a 3-day event, September 12, 13, 14.
The caravan leaves Phoenix on Friday the 12th at 9:00 AM.  The gate opens at
Jerome at NOON on Friday.  The chili cook-off is Friday evening.  First
raffle
of the weekend will be Friday evening.  Preliminaries for the slow drags are
Saturday around 11:00 AM, with an early afternoon raffle and another in the
evening.  We'll finish up on Sunday morning with slow drag finals, car show
awards and final raffles.

In case you haven't heard, this year's raffle bus is a white over green,
1967
13-window Deluxe.  Our website isn't updated yet, but will soon have a wish
list for needed parts for the raffle bus as a couple of photos of the bus
now
that it is painted.

Swapping by general participants is encouraged.  ALL new item vendors must
pre-register (before showing up at the event) and must set up along "vendor
row".

Admission is still $10 per vehicle per night, and raffle tickets are still
only $0.50 each.  You must be a paid participant of the event to buy raffle
tickets.

For further details, email me off-list.
