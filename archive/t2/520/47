Subject: push start

just goes to show if you don't know something isn't supposed to work you try anyway :-)
2 years ago there was plenty of battery so those occasions everything worked it just 
didn't start.
on my dead battery ones there was minimal juice just not nearly enough to start the 
bus. so now i need to either rewire my radio so i don't need to turn everything on to 
run it or listen to some other source.

doesn't any fuel remain in the system when the bus is turned off???
