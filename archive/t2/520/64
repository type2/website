Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

Tony's is solid advice. There is, however, a qualification that must be 
made. If you are new to buses -- even if you've done a lot of 
mechanical work on WC cars -- it makes some sense to get a beater as a 
means to gaining competence in repair and maintenance. You'll get it!

Driving a bus whose every part you've held in your hand, measured, 
lubricated, replaced, reground, weighed, or found after searching 
junkyards for six months is the ultimate baywindow experience. 
Competence beats wealth hands down, IMHO.
