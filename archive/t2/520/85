Subject: child cot in front

OK so I have an extra cot that fits in the front of a bay window.  There is a
young lady in northern Minnesota that has a 1969 hardtop camper and is
interested in the cot but doesn't have the brackets and isn't sure if her year
came equipped with a front cot.  So did all bay campers come equipped with a
cot or do we need to install it from scratch?
Thanks in advance
