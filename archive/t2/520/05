 Standard Bus? Mine is White over Red, but it's being repainted next month
 and I can't remember where to find the code.

The paint code of the color?  Or the location of the paint code on your bus?

Here are paint chips to match your codes:

Go here:  http://www.type2.com/
and click on 'Library'. Click on M for M-code options. This will tell you that your 73 bus ID plate is
supposed to be behind the drivers seat. 3rd row, 1st 6 numbers/letters are your paint and interior code. Now
click 'back' and the next choice will be 'Paint Codes". Click on the 1st choice, 'Exterior and interior color
codes'.  My guess is your plate should show 0206 if it is original. L30B Kasan red bottom and L90D Pastel
white top. If this is true, then your bus originally looked like this:
