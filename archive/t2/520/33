dave,

i am not an auto engineer, but i'll take a stab.

i seem to remember you have a dual carb engine? do you have the stock
distributor with retard canister hooked up? timed at 5 ATDC? if the answers
to these questions are all yes, then we may have found the "problem". the
stock dual carbs need retarded idle timing to make the central idle work
properly, and retarded timing will give low vacuum. as a test, you could
time the engine to 7 BTDC, with the retard removed and plugged, reset idle
to specs, then see where the vacuum is at. i am going to guess it may be
more like 15-17 inhg. but put it back to specs after the test.
