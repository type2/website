Subject: Re: [T2] WD-40 (was: Sliding door question)

For those really interested in the ingredients to wd-40, it may be a secret
formula but over 90% of its contents are vaguely disclosed on the MSDS sheet
available on WD40.com

Personally I would only use the stuff on a bus as a penetrant to free up and
clean out neglected gunked up parts/mechanisms then lube with a proper
lubricant for the bus part in question.

Of course it also works as a temporary Water Displacer to dry out electrical
connections or prevent rust until you have time to properly clean and lube
things. If you expect long term rust prevention from one application YMMV.
Gun owners can never agree on this stuff. Great to spray a rain soaked
gun/tools/etc. down with until you can clean and lube it correctly but I
would look for something better for long term humidity protection.
