If I could figure out a way to get it home (north of Orlando) I'd buy it
and store it at least out of the sun and most rain till I found a new
owner for it.  Got plenty of room under the shed across the pond (I don't
like to use it for things I need to get to, cause it's a long walk around
the pond.:)


Anyone between Orlando and Ft Meyers have a truck w/ hitch they'll loan
me? :)  I'll rent the dolly...
