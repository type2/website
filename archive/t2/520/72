Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

You're across the river from the bus? Why not go have a look at it? It might
be a good deal for that price and do you want to see it get scrapped if it's
good? I think she said it has 2 engines with it and it might be easier to
get it on the road than you might think.

So true, I'm across the river from the 71(?) Fort Myers FL bus, but no
garage and short of $$$. I don't want to be one in a long line of  probable
previous owners that never got to enjoy it. ( In this case I take it her/his
moving to NC and having the bus apart it just wasn't worth grief of
transporting it up there.)
