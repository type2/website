Subject: Good bye for now

Hello all, sorry to say the time has come for me to leave.
I have been busy preparing for a 6 month Round Australia holiday.
After 2 frantic months preparing we're close to being ready.
This is just a quick note to say I'm leaving this list for a while.
Thanks to all those that have helped with my queries in the past, and I hope I
have helped a few of you out there.
I also plan to set-up a web page as a diary of our travels for those
interested. (it's pretty crappy at the moment, but I will improve it as time
permits)

CYA and happy trails,
Richard Beckers.
Brisbane Australia (not for long :-)
And Andy the '77 deluxe bus, soon to be our home :-)
