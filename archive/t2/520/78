Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

Does most of the list consider the current prices of VW Busses to be cheap?
I personally find most of what I've seen to be very expensive (i.e. -> Samba,
eBay, etc.). I can't imagine paying $3000.00 for a Bus (and that should be a
very good bus at that :-)

My first bus was a '73 in which 2nd gear didn't work. It cost me $400.00
Very little was rusted out and I spent ~ $200.00 on a used tranny. I had a buddy
who lived close by and was a fantastic (hobyist) vw mechanic.

My second bus was a '79 (I loved that bus!). The third cylinder had a shot valve
and it cost $1300. It had no rust whatsoever. I bought a used head for $75.00
and also had to buy new CV joints.
(As an aside, I cleaned my used head in the dishwasher and it came out
sparkling, I couldn't believe it!)

Moral of the story, busses are overpriced! I finally found one here on the E.
Coast that I liked. Cost me $1800 and needs so much work it makes me sad. :-(

I mean, if you see a bus for $10,000, that better be one damn nice bus! ;-)

My $0.02 cents,
Harry
