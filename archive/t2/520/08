You might want to look into this a little more.  The oil pressure loss could
be indicative of a greater problem.  I had rebuilt a 1700 on my own and
didn't replace the bearings because of the mileage on the short block &
because my prior engine experience with American cars usually lets you reuse
bearings if they mic out OK.  After lengthy discussions with elderly German
VW mechanics their take on the whole thing is it is the mains that create
the oil pressure.  If I am off on this please chime in.  Anyway expense wise
it might be beneficial to ship it back instead of replacing the oil pump.
