Subject: 30 mm Berg oil pump in a type IV?

Hi All:

My Fast German rebuild type IV 2.0L (with 500 miles) suffers from low 
oil pressure at idle (>10 psi) when the oil temps get around 200F. I 
have a choice of trying to return the engine (at my expense) or 
upgrading the oil pump. Has anyone any experience with running a Berg 
anodized 30 mm, O-ringed aluminum type I pump or other 30 mm pump? I 
think my low pressure problems are due to the poor fit between the case 
and the pump. I am hoping that the O-ring will reduce the amount of lost 
oil when the engine is above 180F.

Aircooled.net sells the 30 mm Schadeck without the O-ring modification, 
and John states that the type IV can handle the extra volume, however he 
also states that the pump will blow out my oil cooler with 30/40 weight 
oil when cold. I run straight 40 here in Florida, but it does 
occasionally get below 60F.

I do not want to have to modify the pressure relief valve.

TIA
Regards,
