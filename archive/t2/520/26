Subject: Broke down Part 2

I took the belt off the generater and I can turn the engine around and round  
O`k .
I drove It home (a short distance) when I turn the generater pulley it makes 
a clunking, churning noise. The bus made it home without getting hot., But it 
won`t start. Maybe the battery is to low to start the bus.I`ll check and 
replace the generater if necessary. I know that there is the danger of overheating 
by running the bus without the belt, on the way home the bus did not run as 
good as it usually does and then it would not start. Any any advice will be 
appreciated.             Sincerely,
                                      Vincent Moreno
