Now $4000 is a bit much for a years time, if you are spending that much on
your bus in the first year, you might consider taking a better look at what
you are getting into.  My first bus cost $900.  Within the first year I
replaced the engine and a few other things and was still way under $3000
total.

There are deals out there and just because a bus is cheaply priced doesn't
always mean it is a $ pit.  Do your homework and shop around and you can
find a great deal.

And my theory of the cheap buses for sale lately has to do with the economy
of the US.  People have less disposable income and can't afford to hang onto
cars they don't have time for.

Good luck,
