I have wondered ...will a Fi bus start when pushed, pulled, or dragged?

I have read the some folks *running* bus quit as soon as the battery level
reached ~10 volts, as their charging system failed on the drive home,,,

I have read that some folks *have* bump started the Fi bus.

I think there is a need to understand the problem before we can say the
bus will start... unless I am wrong here.

If the battery is dead, no amount of push starting will get that Electric
Pump to run,,, even if the AFM tells it to... cause the double relay won't
pull in, and the pump won't run if there isn't enough electrons in the
battery to do the trick.

Now,, if the battery is good,, and the starter isn't functioning for some
reason... then I am pretty sure the bus can be bump started, it has
everything it needs except something to spin it to get it going,, so using
the driveline to spin the engine will do the same thing as the starter.
