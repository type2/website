Subject: Re: [T2] side window glass

Thanks, Karl. That is just what I need to know. Just out of curiosity, did
all the 68 to 79 left rear windows come with vents or did some come with and
some without?

Regards,
Bill

|
| On left hand drive / right side slider buses, all 68 to 79 bay buses use a
solid window on the right rear.
| This is the same size as the driivers left rear if you want to remove the
vent

| >   2.. Are the right and left interchangeable?
|
| Yes, you can put the right rear into the left opening.  Only drawback is
the etched name in the glass will be
| a mirro image. Whoopee!
