Jim,
Good run down of the pseudo lubricating oils that are available--but you
missed one that is totally bio degradable--and harmless to none--

Good ole commonly available, slippery than hell--Whale Sperm oil---

This is my second choice over and above MMO for it's lubricating
qualities--and staying power---:>)

One more question--

What ever happened to good ole 30 w oil in a metal squirt can??

Too prehistoric perhaps---??

Take Care--

TK
