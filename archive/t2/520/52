Subject: Re: [T2] Broke down Part 2/push start

Hi Susan,

You aren't hurting anything by push-starting it.  My point was more 
regarding the battery's state of charge than FI vs. Carb.  If your battery 
is putting out less than 10.5 volts (IIRC), there's not enough power to run 
the FI computer.  However, if your Bus has carbs, you can push-start it with 
a mostly-flat battery and it should run, as long as your generator puts out 
good enough voltage.

Good Luck!
