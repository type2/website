You gotta wonder how many previous (st)owners have been bankrupted and

defeated by buses their now selling for $200-500 firm...


Anyone else have an assembled running camper bus of some sort in reasonable

condition in SW Florida for a fair price? Seems like the affordable / usable

/ maintainable ones are always CA / OR /  WA etc.!


Down here it's either brand new looking and $$$$$$ or $$$ and in pieces... >>

Every chronologically challenged car list I'm on recommends buying the best
condition vehicle you can afford...Busses are no different, and a bit harder
to stash when they go down and need repairs...You've got to be realistic a-
bout it...If it's gonna be your only transportation, do you have enough cash,
tools, and know-how to keep it up and running? A Bus that won't start and
resists your diagnostic efforts is no fun, and worse if it's in a parking 
space
that it can't stay in...
