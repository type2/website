Jamie,

1/8"x4'x8' sheets should be available and any Lowes or Home Depot 
store. If you want to get fancy you find a specially  lumber supplier 
and get the euro spec 3mm stuff that come in sheets that are 5' x (I 
think ) 4' and have the same grain orientation as the plywood in 
later split and early bay Westfalias.
