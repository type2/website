Subject: Re: [T2] side window glass

1.. What other years use the same glass?
2.. Are the right and left interchangeable?

Go to your regular local commerical glasss supplier. They can custom cut you glass and supply it in various colors and tints and then send it out to be tempered. I did all my flat glass in tinted.
