Subject: busses can be cheap

The first fact of life is that cars cost money. Vans
generaly cost more money. If you want a nice new
trouble free camper be ready to spend 35,000$. Those
of us who for one reason or another dont have 35K and
still want a van with a bed, VW busses offer a
convient and (to this day affordable) alternative.

My own expierences include:
A 72 VW hard top westy. Bought it for 500$, put
another 250$ into it, drove it 30K with what I would
consider routine maintanance (ne master cylander,
brakes, tires shocks etc) sold it for 1200$, made
4000$ driving it for work.

My latest car, 75 Rivera 1500$. Havnt really done to
much for it since I bought it except tune ups and
front shocks. still needs some work, but under 500$.

Look in the paper, see what 2000$ gets you in a
camper. I kow that with time we all get the ".. .it
costs HOW Much?!?..." syndrome ( I for one thought Id
quit smoking when cigarettes hit 1.50 a pack in
Massachusettes) but inflation is indeed a fact of life
and everything costs more. At least with a (non FI)
bus I can deal with it and the parts are cheap.

As with anything else there is a wide variety of
options. You can get a fully restored 23 window or a
200$ handymans special. In my own choices I usually
have 1000-2000$ for a car. Used o be that I would lok
for a car with a strong motor and ugly paint. Thi last
bus I wnt a but the other way. The motor is OK but the
body is bulletproof. I wanted a car that would last
awhile. plus while you can always get a motor rebuilt,
body and electrical work can bleed you dry. I always
avoid buses with chopped up wiring. I dont do
electrical work well, and if I have a wiring problem I
go to a good shop were they will do a pro job.  I also
leave FI work to the pros.

 I have had the exierence that if you do the routine
mainatance myself, I can still come out ahead in the
long haul even if yuo leave difficult and nasty jobs
to the pros.

Im sure the day is coming when all the bay windows
will be trailer queens, but until then Ill go anywhere
(with a tool box, fan belt spare points, spare
accelerator cable) in my bus.

Thats my  .02s worth
