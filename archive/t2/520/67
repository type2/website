Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

And that's the problem here they all seem to be basket cases or pretty well
restored already, the basket cases I have no place for and the restored ones
are all major bucks or the owner would not part with it even if his life
depended on it.

I know others do and more power to them, but as a newb I would never
consider a 30 something year old bus as an only vehicle! I just want
something that's not in pieces or needs to be immediately completely
stripped to pieces! I just want something to test my knowledge gained by
reading most of the 22,000+ type 2 list emails in my mailbox and learn
allot, fix things up, get to know the lay of the land hands on and not go
bankrupt in the process, oh and get to know you all in the process of asking
a zillion questions about.

I cant have a stripped out rat bus under a tarp parked out front of the
condo either... That wouldn't go over well! Renting a storage space to park
it at and then doing basket case restoration work on it sounds like a recipe
for heatstroke here in SW Florida so a bus will have to wait.

For daily driving I've got a 97 Cougar XR-7 SPORT w/ V-8. I could of bought
a sweet bus for what it costs though... But then no A/C / Leather / good
looks and 200+ crank hp LOL
