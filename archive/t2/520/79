Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

But as I said to Jammy, you need to fill in some details. How long ago 
were these purchases? How many miles on the bus? How long/how many 
miles did you drive it on a $600 (first) and approximately $1500 
(second) investment?

I can claim that I bought a bus for $440 and it ran great. (Thus 
leaving out that it wouldn't pass smog, needed an entire FI system that 
I installed with a leak that burned out a piston, etc. etc. etc.)
