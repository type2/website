My guess, without further information, would be the line going to your brake
booster.  Presumably you've got a big round port on the box your carb sits
on with a rubber hose going toward the left side of the engine compartment?
Pull the hose off at the air box and plug the hole going into the box.  If
that fixes it then your problem is either a bad brake booster or the hose is
disconnected somewhere or the one-way check valve on the booster hose is
hosed.
