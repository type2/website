I question the use of the word "restored"...A trip to a real concours
d'elegance (not just a car show) will illustrate what I mean...Twenty
grand is a reasonable sum for a restoration...Restoration means
every part is examined for condition and either replaced or rebuilt...
Not just cleaned or covered over with a finish...Is that front beam
perfect? Probably not, even if it is POR-15'd... Is the trans com-
pletely rebuilt, or just a few parts renewed?...
A good running and mechanically sound Bus with a fresh coat of 
paint is not restored, expensive to buy, perhaps, but not restored...
