Interesting.  I have a stock FI w/ dual-vacuum (advance + retard) 
distributor, timed to 5 ATDC.  Perhaps I will give this test a go, as 
well.  If that gets my vacuum back up to 15-17'', then I'll count my 
blessings and won't bother looking for a vacuum leak.

I feel like this dual-vacuum distributor causes me nothing but grief... 
while early '76s like mine did have this distributor (at least, that is 
what I have been led to believe), I am not really sure that mine is the 
original stock for my particular bus.  For example, the emissions 
compliance sticker says the engine should be timed to 7.5 BTDC, but the 
spec for my distributor is 5 ATDC.  I know what when I bought the Bus, 
it did not have the original engine, so who knows what random parts had 
been installed.

Is it possible to run those dual-vacuum distributors with the retard 
disconnected, and have it function nominally?

Makes me wonder if I shouldn't just give up and buy one of those SVDAs 
from aircooled.net (hey, and maybe I'll have better luck getting my 
Pertronix installed in that one, too).
