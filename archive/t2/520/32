Jason,

I've been thru the same thing with my new engine as well.

I am getting a little better than 12", but not a whole lot.

I have tried the spray starter fluid trick, removed almost *every*
line from the vacuum locations and plugged them and still can't get
much better vacuum.

I don't get it either, but the engine seems to run better everytime
I start it.  It's not running hot, it's idling  well, it starts
fine in 20 degree weather.

So, I'm with you,....whasup with this??

Any automotive engineers out there that can *really* explain this?

Cheers, dave
