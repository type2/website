Besides the sellers rather um, optimistic appraisal of body condition, there's the fact that neither bus is the year they say it is. The ad say a 72 and a 76, but the briefest of glances  will tell you that neither bus is later than 71. Either seller is stupid, or doesn't know what they speak of. Of course it could be both.
Whole buch of huge red flgs flying in the breeze over this ad.
