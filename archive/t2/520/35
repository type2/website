On left hand drive / right side slider buses, all 68 to 79 bay buses use a solid window on the right rear.
This is the same size as the driivers left rear if you want to remove the vent

>   2.. Are the right and left interchangeable?

Yes, you can put the right rear into the left opening.  Only drawback is the etched name in the glass will be
a mirro image. Whoopee!
