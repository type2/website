just to give you an idea of how fast a VW engine can get hot, I have
guages on mine (78 stock T4) when the fan bolt came loose I was doing
about 65 on I-70 and the air temp was about 15degrees.  the engine was
running very cool.  it took less than a mile to get to a safe place to
stop, and I had slowed to about 50mph. the engine was already about
250degrees oil temp.  I would not have driven it that far except it was a
very dangerous place to stop with no shoulder where I was.  the engine ran
like it always did the entire time, and when fixed  (about 20
minutes) immediately fired back up and cooled right down

there appears to be no permanent damage but it was one very very nerve
wracking experince

hopefully you have no damage but as always YMMV
