Subject: seat mounting bolts


Someone recently posted to the list that they were now carrying middle seat
mounting hardware. But I can't seem to find it at any of the vendors that
frequent the list. I tried searching the archives but the "most recent 1000
posts" search doesn't seem to work at all, and the older archives pulls up
peoples requests for this hardware.

Also, what years were full width solid back middle seats available? I can
only seem to find the 1/3-2/3 folding back wide middle seat upholstery.

Thanks
