Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 crank holder

Not sure on type 4 engines, but type 1 engines can get a fixture that the
crank screws into and then slips into a bench mounted engine holder. Not
much more than a glorified gland nut, pretty sure you could do the same on a
type 4. Lets you work at a comfortable height and rotate the rods thru a
full range of motion checking for tight spots.
