Subject: leaking gas update

thanks to Sean, accessbob, max, Bill Monk & everyone else who replied
about the leaking gas in my 79 transporter. I finally got around to
pulling the firewall out after dealing w/ my engine for a few weeks.
looks like all it was was that one of the vent tubes had actually pulled
free of the rubber fuel line holding it in, viola leak identified. Now
while i can get at it i will be replacing the rubber for more piece of
mind. Does anyone have any other recommendations on something to do
while the tank is easily accessable?
