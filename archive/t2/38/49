Easy check for oil light on, to diagnose sender:

Engine off, key on, light should be on.
Disconnect wire from sender, light should go off.

If light stays on when the wire is disconnected, you have a short in the
wiring, not an oil pressure problem.

Grounding the connector to the engine should make the light light.

At this point, if the light has stayed on while the engine is running,
replace the sender and test it by starting the engine momentarily.  If the
light still stays on, it's time to look at oil pressure.

OTOH, if your light never comes on, even with the engine off, you check it
by pulling the wire off the sender and grounding it.  If the light lights,
you have a bad sender.  If it still doesn't, you have a bad bulb or broken
wire.

Oil pumps seldom fail all at once.  They get loose and you slowly lose
pressure.  Pressure problems are usually caused by pickup problems (air
leaks, oil level) or pressure control/relief valve problems.
