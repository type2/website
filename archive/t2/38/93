Main reason for not using an 009 is that the advance curve comes in too
late for bus applications.  This causes a bog at low RPMS.

The last place to look for tech advice is the VW T&A magazines.  They have
lots of pretty "here's my bus and a lot of money, be back in a week"
restorations, but know little about actually driving the beasts.  Their
advertisers sell 009s, so guess what they push in their articles.

The pickup probably isn't driven further than from its trailer to where it
is shown.  How would the driver know how well it runs?
