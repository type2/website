Type 2ers,

I am creating my plan of attack on a bilge blower/heater booster installation.
 I read the archives on some of the particulars, but I'm not real sure
about the wiring.  I have a switch (on/off) and a potentiometer (speed
adjustment) and the blower (3" Atwood 3000).  I read an entry in the
archives about connecting to a relay, which is present in the late bays
with a booster fan in the engine compartment.  Can I wire/run this contraption
without a relay?  What will it be doing for me?  Is there a substitute
I can use for this relay?  I had considered running the hot wire to the
fuse panel, but I'm not sure if I will be overloading the circuits by
placing another accessory there.

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
