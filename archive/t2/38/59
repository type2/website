Subject: Re: [T2] City Water Hookup

On the subject of city water hook ups, never leave your camper =
unattended while city water is hooked up. I did once, and a fitting =
under the sink failed, flooding the camper-luckily it was a Coleman pop =
up, not a Westy! It may be a PITA to keep turning it on/off, but not as =
much as a camper full of water.    Jeff
