I'm a newbie to this so be patient please.

I am the new proud owner of a 1970 Type II Westfalia conversion.

Can't seem to find a competent mechanic (nor afford one).  Looking for
advice on:

1) Sometimes the starter will continue to spin (without the solenoid
engaged) even after the ignition switch has been released and the key
removed.

2) I have real problems shifting into first gear

3) After a long trip (a hundred miles) the engine and compartment (which

was clean) was bathed in a light spray of oil.

Appreciate any help or advice you may offer,

Juan
