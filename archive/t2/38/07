Mostly, because it is EMPTY.  The camper has a few hundred pounds of
goodies in there, that settle the suspension a bit, and add more "force"
to the motion of the body.  The panel has none of that...there is very
little weight to cause the suspension to work.

Just like in a pickup truck..usually with nothing in the bed, it is very
stiff and bouncey back there.  Add a decent load, and it rides smooth.
