Subject: 81 westy

In my 81 Westy I have an extra battery under the back
seat. I've been told this is not stock. But I fugure
since i have it and a bunch of cables I figured i
would try and use it. I have only owned bugs and
fastbacks prior to this. I am an idiot at this time
trying to gather information to get more information.
Any suggestions on using the battery for the frig or
better to use propane if the fridge is eqipped for it?
Thanx again!
