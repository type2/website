Subject: 79 California FI is idling right!


Thanks Stan and all,

I found and removed 99% of the vacuum leaks, some I had created myself 

:-( 


It is now idling good. No cold running problem. Wow. Like a new 'un. 

Now for the next problem that I cannot figure out.....

It runs great until it gets fully warmed up. Then for no apparent reason, 
with no obvious cause, it will surge in any gear. It will surge 1,2,3 times 
and then run fine for 2 miles, give a surge. Run fine for a few more miles. 
Then repeats this "pattern" (I know this is not a pattern...but you get the 
idea.)

I have replaced rotor, cap, wires, (everything but the coil), and checked all 
the injectors.....is this still a vacuum thing, do you think? It is not 
running bad, I just want it PERFECT. Also, it seems to use much more gasoline 
than my others...

I can't tell you how happy I am to have removed those leaks. This thing is 
ALMOST a real car now......

Thanks, thanks, thanks,
