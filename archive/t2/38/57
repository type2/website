Subject: Is that racket a blown engine?

My engine is making a loud clackety sound above idle..it started when i 
pushed it too hard following someone in a 350 v8 up a hill to get to the 
party....be gentle on those hills,kids....at first it came and went every 
few seconds, i pulled off, and now it's constant above idle...

it sounds like it's right behind the fan.  With the fan pulled off and 
alternator of course disconnected, it was still there, so it's inside the 
engine ....

a metal sounding rod touched to the heads between the valve rocker arms did 
not sound abnormal, so i believe it is on the main crank somewhere.....

are there any tests i should do before considering the motor shot?

with a real loud noise there, would anyone care to guess the max distance i 
might drive it before it throws a rod or something fun like that?   I pulled 
of right away,so it's been about a half mile so far.
and would that result in 4 quarts of oil sunning itself all over the 
freeway?  any leads to used engines in san francisco area will be much 
appreciated.(i posted another such message).

Thank You,
Shawn
