Subject: Re: [T2] seat mounting bolts


Thanks, that was where I saw them before. $65 for new huh? Guess I'll start
looking around at junkyards etc, find some used. Looks like only the clamps
themselves are the unique item, the bolts look like carriage bolts that
have been ground flat on the sides. Seems like I was able to use regular
carriage bolts when installing my camper interior, though I might be
remembering wrong.

It's possible then that what I have is a non-folding backseat. It does have
an armrest on the right side so it looks like a middle seat. I haven't
checked to see if it's legs line up with the mounting points for the middle
seat. The backseat that is there has the folding back. I have a set of
seats (with 2/3 middle) from a champagne edition that I can use instead,
though the cordorouy inserts are dirty. My wife really like the full width
middle seat. Was the right 1/3 flip an unusual option?

Solid back???  I have never seen solid back full middle seats. Either right
1/3
flip for right cargo doors or left 1/3 flip for left cargo doors or both
ends
flip for double doors.
