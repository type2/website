Subject: that hole ain't supposed to be there!

I just figured out why I don't have compression in 4... :)

So, now I want to take the piston off to replace it, but I can't get the
bar (don't know the technical term) out that slips through the con-rod
and the piston.  I took out the clip but it doesn't want to budge.  I
only used thumb force on the one side because I don't want go bangin' on
it.

Any recommendations on how to get it out?

Thanks,
Mike
