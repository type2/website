Most likely your piston has broken a ring land and you've scored a
cylinder, thats about what happens when they get really hot. (been there
done that).
If it is blowing oil out from every engine seal and out your dipstick
then its probably a broken ring.
If it hasn't got bad crankcase pressure then look to a bent push rod or
loose rocker arm.
