Subject: 81 westy

Hi all. I own an 81 westy that I recently purchased.
The PO tore the inside out of her and i am trying to
find some info on some diagrams or something that can
help me get the sink and fridge back in and hook up
the secondary battery. Any suggestions would be
greatly appreciated. Thanx
