No probs,John, just let me know how you get on.
On a similar note, alot of buses over here during the
70's had small pop-up sunroofs fitted.
They were tinted glass jobs about a foot and a half
wide and 3/4 of a foot long that generally were put
either over the cabin or the middle of the car more to
let light and air in.
You CERTAINLY couldn't stand up!
Did anyone in the US or anywhere else in the world
have these?
:-)
