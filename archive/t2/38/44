A girl named Amanda

Traveling to L.A. from Montana

In a V.W. bus

That didn't make any fuss

I wonder if she wears a bandana

OBC: I have a 70 Westy next to my garage, complete interior, body not bad
for here in Massachusetts, no engine. I would love to trade for another
non-bus air-cooled VW. This is a project, so I am looking for another
project. Any takers out there for a trade before I start to pull it apart
for use on my other 70 Westy?
