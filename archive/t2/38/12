Subject: A peek at the buggy....

Hi guys,
For those on Type2.com or VWBUSUK, yes,I know this
isn't a bus, but I thought you might be interested
anyway.
This my brother Peter's '69 J&S buggy on a 67 Deluxe
pan with extra strengthening by Indian Automotive.
It's just a test fit to get an idea of the look.
You can check out Indian at:

The engine is a Subaru watercooled 2.5litre injected
flat four.
Check out the pic....we think it looks PHAT!
