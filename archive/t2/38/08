the accelerator linkage on an 75 or later auto tranny bus is totally
different than any other bus. it is adjusted differently.  if it hasn't
been adjusted right it probably will not idle correctly.

also there is something called a "decel" valve that adjusts the idle down
slightly when in neutral. most are missing and it is much harder getting
the idle right. especially when you put it in gear.  the idle is set
correctly but when shifting into gear the torque converter is engaged
putting some drag on the system and slowing it down slightly.  the idle
"Should" increase slightly to make up for this, if the decel valve is
working correctly.   
  in other words it is different to get idle adjusted right but it
shouldn't stall

nah, something is wrong here, a two liter engine with auto tranny is a bit
weak in the accel department, but has the same power and top speed as the
manual tranny bus..

mine will shift 1-2 in the 15mph range, and
shift 2-3 in the 35mph range during solid constant acceleration on level
ground

on a decent upgrade (Such as an interstate hill) I will accelerate very
slowly but still slowly the speedo will creep up until about 60-65mph

at 32mph your tranny should have downshifted to 2nd or be ready to.
yes from a standing start on a stiff grade you may drop to 32 but so will
a manual tranny bus.

the 78 has a centrifical govenor shifter (can clipped to side of
tranny) it can be cleaned if it is sticky

but you also sound like you may have a centrifical advance distributor,
the infamous 009 dizzy that it seems like these things get stuck with when
someone can't fix the correct dist.  it is important to get a correct
vacuum advance distributor in this bus, even more so than a manual an auto
tranny bus will not operate a manual advance dist, nor will the 009
advance a two liter engine correctly.

get the Bentley manual (green cover) and find out what the problem is.
