<< 70's had small pop-up sunroofs fitted.
They were tinted glass jobs about a foot and a half
wide and 3/4 of a foot long that generally were put
either over the cabin or the middle of the car more to
let light and air in.

Did anyone in the US or anywhere else in the world
have these? >>

Came across two vans fitted with those aftermarket
sunroofs over the years...both were duct tape shut.
Might have been the installations, but the severe
side-to-side curve of the roof seemed to lead to e-
ventual leakage. The aluminum frame can be bent to
fit (and with enough screws, held in place), but the
plastic insert "wants" to stay flat and with only a 
few clips locking it to the frame (four IIRC), spreads
back up and away from the seal. As I said, these may
have been "one size fits all" units and obviously not
type 2 specific. The same fitting problem comes up
with roof racks for the van; lots of off the shelf racks
fit the width of the bus but won't clear that arch.
