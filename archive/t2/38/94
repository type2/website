Subject: Slid state?


Excuse me... did you say solid state fuel pump?  How does that 
work?  Doesn't solid state imply no moving parts?

Got that out of the JCWhitney Catalogue.
"Master solid state pumps for installation with fuel return lines" $49.98
This has been near the end of their catalogues for years.
They make the same claim for their smaller model also
