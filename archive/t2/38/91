Subject: new sunroof bus

hey list:

got that 'new' 79 sunroof bus I mentioned yesterday.

issue #1 no keys and steering wheel column is locked. can you get keycodes from vw? can a key be made from say the hatch lock cylinder? does not having a title present any problems here?

thanks ahead,

busdriver X
