Subject: thanx guys and updated compression

Thankyou guys who helped me w/ my compression test and valve adjustment 
questions over the last couple days.  Doing the valve adjustment brought my 
compression to 127,135,120,135 from previous 130,155,135,125.  I also warmed 
the engine this time which is suggested in the muir book. Who knows what 
made the difference, but i'm hoping that the later are more accurate.  Thanx 
so much guys.  In buying a bus, it seems you join some type of fraternity, 
and what a cool fraternity it is. :)

I'm sure i'll be back soon for more help
take care
