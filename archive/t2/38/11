Welcome,

I picked up my first bus 1972 westy last march.

As for first gear - I shift it into 2nd first then it slides right into
first (couldn't go into first with out doing that). May not fix the actuall
problem but it works for me.

Had the same problem with the starter - replaced the selenoid and it works
fine (kind of) I need to replace the brushes. Three key turns and it
starts.

And you must have an oil leak somewhere - mine leaks from underneath after
a long trip the back of my white bus is sprinkled with oil spray.

Welcome to the Joy of owning a bus =)

Its a sickness!
