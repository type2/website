There once was a chick named Amanda,
Who dreamed of owning a samba,
So she drove to L.A, then traded her nice bay :(...
But the split died heading back to Montana.

There once was a list administrator,
Who ate threads like an alligator.
Whenever listmembers play, 'cept of course on FRIDAY,
So we'd better save this for later!
