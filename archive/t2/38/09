Subject: Heater for sale



Hi all

I have a brand new, still in the box, Carver P4, Propane/Butane heater for 
sale.
Installation instructions, templates, measurements, thermostat and other 
attachments are included.
The English Carver company was bought by a German manufacturer and they 
stopped producing these, but parts are still readily available. No warranty 
on this unit, as I bought it two years ago. Asking $500 + shipping.
Will go on Ebay if no interest on the lists.
Thank you. Please Pmail if interested.
