Hi Everybody,
   I'm determined that this winter I'm not going to have to wire the =
heat control flaps open until spring gets here.  So this week's project =
is to get the heater controls working.
    First, thanks to everyone who gave me the advice not to put the =
plastic rivets back into the heater levers.  I put in my "new" upper =
half of the levers yesterday and now see the logic behind that advice.
    Today's question is this.   Having just replaced the 2 control =
cables, I find that my bus is missing one small part.  Do I really need =
the small plastic ferrule that goes inside the plastic "cap" , and =
around the inner wire of the cable, at the back end of the control cable =
conduit?  I found the right side ferrule is missing.  It seems to me =
that the ferrule is supposed to secure the aft end of the cable housing. =
 My thought was that with the forward ends of the housing secured in the =
appropriate bracket under the control levers, and given all the friction =
between the outer housing and the conduit through which it runs, that =
the housing isn't going to move anyway.
   I'd love to hear how any of you have made out without this part.
