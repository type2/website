www.vwcalimports.com lists them in their catalogue.  They have great
service.  Stuff shows up within a week of the order.

I will have to get replacements as the lower portions of the housings are
really crumbly.  You'd think they were made out of concrete with too much
sand.  What were those crazy Germans thinking?

Thanks to Steve, Chuck and Andrew  for the help.
