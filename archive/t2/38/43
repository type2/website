Can't say for sure on an '83, but on my '78 there's a valve you need to 
turn. IIRC it's on the sink, close to the faucet. Turning it one way 
gives you 12v, the other city. Or maybe it's just an open/close sort of 
valve. I've only used it to test functionality, never actually used it in 
a camp scenario, which is why I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, check for 
other handles around the sink/faucet area, that's probably where it'd be 
on an '83.
