Subject: Type 4 crank holder

What do you guys use to hold the crank while you install the rods?

I have a T1 flywheel nut welded to the engine stand that I can support the T1
crank.. but I am fed up with using a vice to hold the type 4 crank

I guess a simple plate with the hole pattern drilled in it would work,, but I
was hoping someone had a real slick method,, cheap and easy!

Thanks!
