Subject: Rear Wheel Bearings.. What Grease

In my many excursions to VW wrecking yards I've always made it a practice
of; practicing some of my repairs on donor vehicles at the yards.
In removing the rear axle nut and the drive shaft (the one that has the
big nut 360 ft pounds torque) I've noticed that the grease in the rear
wheel bearings is about the consistency of 90/120 weight transmission
grease.
I'm thinking about removing my drive shafts, renewing the seals,
inspecting the bearings and lubricating the bearings. I've got 278K on my
Westy and it just seems practical that the least I can do at this mileage
is an inspection.
What is the lubricant used in the rear wheel bearings?
These bearings seem to have an extraordinary life span but I still feel
committed to doing this inspection.
