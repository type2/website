Subject: Re: [T2] 79 California FI is idling right!


Any special warnings or methods for replacing the fuel lines? 
Any special knowledge on replacing the hard seals under the injectors?
Any advice on fuel filter changing? 

It all seems straight forward, but I would hate to screw up this late in the 
game.Not, when I am batting 1000....

I am still a bit confused about the vacuum line that comes from the driver 
side inside the tin. It is hard plastic, and has a one-way valve. It goes to 
the mixer directly over the engine. The big black one that covers the top.

What is that? Where is it coming from/going to? 

Thanks
