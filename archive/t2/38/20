Subject: I got a new Bus! :-))) It's a Westy!

Hi all,

Haven't been active for awhile but I just had to share my good karma =
with
the rest of the list. I'm now the proud owner of a "new" 1972 Westy =
with an
original 1600 Type 1 installed. This bus is actually a trade for the =
'72
custom camper that I already had. I've been looking for a westy for a =
while
now and had to jump at the chance when it came up; even though this bus =
is
actually in rougher condition than my now former '72 custom camper was. =
But,
in the long run, I feel that this bus has more "growth" potential than =
my
other one did. We'll see. In any event, at least now I've got something =
to
do this winter.... :-)

The bus is off-yellow and apparently had brown(?) plaid curtains and =
seat
upholstery. The curtains have been changed to some disgusting flower
pattern; except for the one along the window covered by the closet and =
the
upholstery is a brown vinyl (sp?). Is that original? Anyone know a good
source for westy material? I'm also on the lookout for the appropriate
child's cot for my year.=20
I've found some minor rust on the floor on the driver and passenger =
sides
that will need some weldingas well as a sent on the nose that i can =
probably
push out. The engine needs the usual going over and I'm going to =
reinstall
the eberspacher unit that was removed at some point in the past. It's =
got a
tow hitch but I have no idea what I'll be able to tow with a fully =
loaded
bus and a stock 1600...
I'm still in the process of checking all the codes and collecting info =
so
I'll post that for those interested when I have it

What I really need at this point is the wiring diagram for the 72 westy
and/or even better a copy of the entire westy manual for my year. If =
anyone
has an extra copy I'd be eternally grateful (as well as more than =
willing to
cover copy and mailing costs).

Thanks in advance for any good suggestions and/or advice.

John B.
