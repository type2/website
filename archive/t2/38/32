Subject: Re: [T2] drilled bumpers/aux lights

I never say "all" anymore, but I don't recall seeing any without holes.
Incidentally the biggest problem with bay front bumpers is when you take it
off, you realize the nut on the inside is no longer tack-welded in place.
In such a case, the only solution seems to be to drive without a front
bumper or hack a hole in the front lower body big enough to hold a nut in
place while you bolt the bumper back on(there are a couple other options
involving halfassery, too). Ask me how I learned this relatively common
problem.  Some friends and I speculate this is mainly a problem on
westfalias due to standing on the front bumper loading the luggage rack so
often.  From now on, front bumpers get painted while still ON THE VEHICLE!
