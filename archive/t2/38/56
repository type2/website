My legs. I spread an old army blanket on the floor, put a well-washed
bedsheet on top of that (it keeps blanket lint out of the crank), then lay
the crank on top of that. Assemble the rods onto the crank with the nuts
finger tight, then sit down. Stick one rod up and put one leg on the crank
on either side of the rod. Then torque the nuts to 10 lb-ft, make sure it
falls freely, then to 18, check for free motion, then finally to 24 and
check once more for free motion. If the rod moves nicely, do the next one.
