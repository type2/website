Whatever you do, don't go bangin' on it.  :)  Sometimes varnish or 
other crud will build up in the ends of the pin bore and prevent 
the pin from coming out easily.  Other times the fit is just plain 
tight.  What I usually do is use a large C-clamp and a small deep 
socket to gently press the pin out.  Of course be sure to put a 
piece of wood or something else soft underneath the end of the 
clamp to protect the piston on the side where the C-clamp contacts 
it.
