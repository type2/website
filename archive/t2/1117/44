	I gather that one of its main uses  -  for which it need not 
be plugged in  -  is to point it down on oncoming traffic from a 
vantage point such as used by speed cops and chuckle as you see the 
front suspensions of fast cars dive when they come into view  >:-} .
	I thus mark my return from the wilderness, on a Friday as it 
happens, after taking the world record for length of time to get a 
software fault fixed.

	More seriously, I report a satisfactory 23 mpg on the first 
tankful after a (nother) engine rebuild.  Running in on my usual 
principle "you run it in fast, you get a fast motor", I clocked, in 
calm weather, 75 mpg flat-out down a slight gradient; then I turned 
around and came back up the hill at the same speed!  Must we infer 
that the 30mm carb (Brazilian Weber) so restricts the supply of fuel 
that the lower load on the downhill run can't result in any more revs 
!?!
