Subject: Fuel pump FI sub-harness replacement

So I went out today to replace the fuel pump sub-harness, having obtained
two very pretty, but different versions of that harness from Mario and
Barry.  Well, it turns out that my harness is a third variant!  One of my
cliches is, "Volkswagen buses, they're all the same...  except that every
year is different."

The variant that Mario sent me includes connections only to the pump and
starter, the version that Barry gave me includes wiring for the back-up
lights, and the installed version that I have is close to Barry's, but with
an indirect fuel pump connection.  On Barry's harness, the fuel pump
connections have rubber shields and are supposed to connect directly to the
pump.  On mine, there is a short length of wire off the two fuel pump
connections with a different style of protected connector (the rectangular
tube shield).  Very odd.

BTW, Barry, check your voice mail...  feeding the new harness in alone is a
definite impossibility :-)
