You will get a lot of different opinions on this, including various 
brands of marine fiberglass paint.  Personally, I used Rustoleum Gloss 
White enamel.  Two years in the harsh Colorado sun, and it still looks 
fresh and glossy.

Just make sure you have a clean, well-prepped surface to paint.  I used 
two coats with a foam roller.

Good luck,
