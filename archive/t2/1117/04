I'm with Mike on this one, it depends on what you have installed. I have a 
cd/dvd/stereo system that uses a miniscule amount of amperage to keep it's 
stations memorized. My battery will start with about 12.6 or so, and 
gradually go down to about 12.2 over a week. I just keep it plugged in with 
it's 120volt connection that I've wired a 12volt charger into.
HTH,
