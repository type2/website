I have assisted and troubleshot several of these hotspark ignitions on fuel
injected busses. I don't know if it is the pulse trigger to the ECU that drags
them down, or if the design is not up to working with the pulse required
forB fuel injection.B  They tend to get warm, and then cause the ignition
system to die, but then after they cool off they go back to working for
awhile. Some people seem pleased with them, and if you have good luck, cool,
but if you vehicle starts loosing power and running like it out, make sure to
suspect your ignition, even though it is brand new. Again this is my
experience with them on fuel injected Bay windows, and I tend to base my
opinion on small samples, if it is to the breaking point on one application,
it might just be under on another and never give you a problem.

Just curious why. I decided to give them a chance, and I have it
running in their repop dizzy in my 74.
