Mine was off as it was also canvas replacement time.  I have painted  
while on as well.  I tried a foam roller and immediately switched to a  
short nap regular roller. The foam roller left too many bubbles for my  
liking. Off is easier but not so much so that I'd take it off just to  
paint it. And I forgot to mention, the Rustoleum Marine Topcoat is  
available in a semi-gloss finish. The semi-gloss looks much more  
'stock' than a full gloss IMHO.
