Subject: Engine lid lock for '71 

Does anyone know a source for a locking engine lid latch to replace the
non-locking push button latch that is stock on my 71 ?
The marauding bicycle riding meth freaks have discovered that my bus is a
source of free batteries with that push button latch.
I need a way to lock down that engine compartment. Any suggestions greatly
appreciated.
