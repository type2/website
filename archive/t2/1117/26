Subject: WOOO HOOO! Bus Benefit Starts Tomorrow in Grand Rapids, MI -

Hello Fellow Volks Folks,

WOOO HOOO! We are so excited! The eighth Annual "Bus Benefit" hosted by
"Buses By the Beach" in Grand Rapids, MI starts tomorrow! Special thanks go
to our 2010 Gold Level Sponsors; GoWesty www.gowesty.com
<http://www.gowesty.com/>  and River Valley Auto! www.rivervalleyauto.net
<http://www.rivervalleyauto.net/> 

This event is our main fund raiser for The Phoenix Society for Burn
Survivors. We are really looking forward to seeing everyone and it looks
like we are going to have another great turn out again this year of Bus
Pilots from all over the US and Canada! We are not sure if this can be any
kind of indicator but we have pre-sold more t-shirts this year then the last
four years combined! We think it is going to be a huge year!

No Car Show at Bus Benefit 2010:

 

Please note: There will be NO CAR SHOW THIS YEAR. The Burn Survivor Car Show
had a scheduling conflict with 5/3rd Ball Park and had to move their event
back one week. We apologize that our website still lists the car show as
part of Bus Benefit event. We are going to be completely redoing our website
and unfortunately the way it is currently written is very difficult to
change the text. So we are sorry for any confusion this may have caused. The
good news is that we don't have to get up early on Saturday morning and pack
up the buses to go to the car show! We have lots of great activities planned
and I think you will find that you will not even miss going this year.
Hopefully next year our dates will align again.

Bus Benefit Itinerary: 

 

We have a weekend jam packed full of great activities! A highlight of a few
are:

 

*	Live Music from six different artists. Jamming this year will be the
following favorite Michigan artists; Stone Boogie Band, Jen Sygit, Sam
Corbin, Nicholas James, Roosevelt Diggs and Hawks and Owls String Band. Also
there is a good chance there will be more. I am working on a cameo
appearance by two famous Michigan Artists that will be in the area putting
on a sold out concert on Friday night. They are going to try to join us
Saturday night but did not want to advertise it because of the draw it may
cause to our event.  
*	Tens of thousands dollars of VW Camping related merchandise that
will be given away to lucky winners at the fundraising raffle
*	Free beer tasting with a local micro brewery HopCat.
*	Hot Dog Dinner Saturday night.
*	Donuts provided Saturday morning by the greatest bakery in West
Michigan; Marge's Donut Den.
*	Sunday Morning Community Breakfast.
*	Sunday morning Cara-Bus. The highway patrol is closing down West
River Drive Sunday morning at 11:30am so we can leave in a multi-mile long
line of buses going for a Sunday cruise. 
*	Blessing of the Buses at Townsend Park. We have an area reserved in
Townsend Park where our friend and fellow hippy at heart, Pastor Jason, will
give each willing bus a non-domination, spiritual blessing for safe travel
in the 2010 camping season by burning sage and anointing the underside of
the front bumper with the life blood of our beloved vehicles; 30 weight oil.
:-) After you will be given a bead or shell with a hemp string to keep you
safe as you travel this year.

forum. The list makes us smile and gives us goose bumps in anticipation of
another great weekend with our friends and family.
