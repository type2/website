I already had those points as I had manual shut off valves that have 
worked for years.  makes it easy to change fuel filters and pull engine 
etc.

I am in the process of changing all fuel lines and fittings at this time

yeah it appears to be a zero sum gain, but it does simplify my current 
fuel system with the manual valves etc.  yeah the failure part worries me 
a bit. but I did get valves that are very overrated for the service, 
designed for nitrous oxide systems in race cars.

right but if power is turned off most of the fuel for a fire is cut off.

lot of line from tank to pump.  and on the other return side, I have put 
the valves right under the tank. so only two short lines to valve. 
hopefully minimal failure points.

and yes all lines and fittings are being changed at this time, using 
genuine OEM lines and clamps
