Hi everyone,

As John said, you will be the harshest critic. I personally cut from the
back with a jigsaw. I used a foam sanding block after that to remove any
splinters. I have no clue how many TPI there were on the blade. Everyone has
given great tips, the next time I do wood work I will have more tricks up my
sleeve.

Which ever way you do it remember that you'll be the harshest critic of the
work, no one else will notice unless it is way bad and you make no effort to
sand things down.
