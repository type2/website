Hippy shaker: Kombi is 60

By TONY DAVIS - Sydney Morning Herald

....

The 1957 version we drove for this story was almost identical to the 
original model but for its slightly bigger engine (1200cc).

	< Same as my first 4-wheeled motor-vehicle, which I owned 
'64-'68, so I feel qualified to comment.


There is no comfortable way to hold this wheel

	< What a narrow-minded inflexible critic !


It is a very mushy gearbox not helped by the length of the lever and 
it's hard to find a gear.

	< He should mention that's a result of wear.  At the age of 
only 1 decade, it remained one of the very best gearshifts I've ever 
experienced, exceeded only by my aunt's '59 Beetle.


  There's something spooky about having hardly any brakes, too. The 
Kombi requires a huge amount of pedal pressure and for very little 
response.

	< This joker is spoilt by modern power-assisted brakes.  The 
4-wheel drums on the '57 Kombi were not too bad the first few times 
in a row, but with the ton payload that could be all too readily 
fitted into that cavernous interior they faded on long downhills, 
prompting the 'Munro airbrakes (i.e opening the front doors).


  Some think that once you put water in them, well, they won't even 
acknowledge them as VWs.

	< This would be correct  <:-|


Beattie says  "I love the look of the split-screen buses."

	< So, I have to admit, do I; but I agree with The Ratwell 
Dictum  - the split-screen T2 is not a practical vehicle for modern 
traffic in the overdeveloped world.



Beattie says he feels "100 per cent safe" in early Kombis.

	< What a stupid thing to say  -  tending to discourage 
actions for ready improvements e.g head-rests, lap-&-diag seatbelts, 
optimal tyres ...
