Hi David,
            I have had good luck with home brew CDI's, Mark 10's, MDS and I'm
sure would be happy with Pertronix and Crane.  However, John Anderson (IIRC)
provided the best, and simplest, solution.  "Pull the ignition package
including harness out of an early vanagon."  Either air-cooled, or early water
cooled works.  The later water cooled ones (post 86? IIRC) do not.  You need
the dizzy, coil, harness, and both the idle stabilizer and spark modules. 
Mine, in my 83 Vanagon, has been the epitome of stability.  It never changes
timing, works well in the heat of an aircooled engine bay, and was made for
the job.  Fits with no modification.   Hey, it even looks stock, how cool is
that!!  Early water cooled Vanagons are not uncommon in salvage yards, or
abandoned in backyards.  If someone is doing a Sub conversion I'm sure they
would GIVE you the whole engine and ignition bits if you would haul it away.

When these finally dry up, I will probably modify an all-in-one distributor
(coil and module in the cap) from one of the millions of (ahem) Toyota
Tercels.   I checked mine over the years, and in 275k miles (un-rebuilt ;) ),
it NEVER varied and always started instantly from >120F in Death Valley to
-55F in Fairbanks.  jon
