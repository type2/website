Subject: Re: [T2] Engine lid lock for '71

I had trouble with break-ins when I lived in Houston.  Solution:  Pit 
Bull.  Mine was a big one named Brutus.  They meth-heads won't go 
anywhere near it.  And if they do, he'll bite down and won't let go 
until you get there!  Sorry, I know you were looking for a more 
practical solution but it's FRIDAY.   So Ciao everyone from Trieste, 
Italy...KR
