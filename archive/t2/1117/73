If your goal is to stop fuel flow when the engine is not running, then 
the above is not a good idea.  Either pull a signal from the fuel pump 
harness or using that special relay which hooks up to the coil that 
someone else recommended.

Just out of curiosity, why are you doing this?  You're adding two new 
points of failure to a system that works quite well.  If both fail to 
open at the same time, then you're stuck... if the return fails to open, 
then you have excessive fuel pressure... if the main fails to open, 
then you're also stuck... and if they both get stuck open, well, you 
have the same system that you have now with possibly reduced fuel flow 
and more potential locations for leaks.  Seems like a lot of trouble to 
go through for little gain.  If you're worried about engine fires, then 
this wouldn't be helping much, as most of the time they happen on the 
pressurized side.  Changing the fuel lines is probably the best way to 
go.  Also, if my memory serves me correctly, fuel will not flow through 
the pump unless it's running.
