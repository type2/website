My Hotspark failed after 3000 miles.  In my case it was mechanical, one of 
the two studs that holds the module to the adapter plate broke free allowing 
the module to move all over the place.  Fixable but a pain in the you know 
what to troubleshoot since the bus would run fine when it wasn't moving (and 
hence the module not rattling around).  I had a spare Pertronix and 
comparing the two side by side you could easily tell the Pertronix was the 
better made product.
