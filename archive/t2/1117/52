Subject: Fiberglass top paint

Hi all:

My spring project is painting the fiberglass top on the Westy.  I know 
this got kicked around on the list a few years ago.  I likely don't have 
access to a fiberglass shop but I am looking for decent paint to apply 
which won't harm the fiberglass and won't flake quickly off.

Ideas are welcome.

BEN
