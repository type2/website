Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump FI sub-harness replacement

What year did the pump change from down low to up on the frame rail?  Could be
the issue.  '78 methinks off the top of my head, but I'm forgetting now days. 
Though I think I've seen earlier ones '76-'77 still with the "square"
connector inline before the little shrouded spade (usually) connectors.  But
I've also seen factory pumps in the day (not replaced resumably)  with both
spade and screw connectors, which might entail a differing little pigtail and
be the reason for the pigtail...  What does the book show, if there is a
connector, the Bentley will show it though back in the "supplement" probably
(mine is not closely present.)

The engine is a 1978, as is the FI.  All are installed in a 1973 body (If I
wanted multiple carburetors, I'da bought a Triumph!)  I *think* Barry's
harness is a '77 or '79 and Mario's is probably a '75.  The '75 FI was a
very weird beast, and I always fall back on that to explain oddities :-)
