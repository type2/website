Welcome back!

 tankful after a (nother) engine rebuild.  Running in on my usual
 principle "you run it in fast, you get a fast motor", I clocked, in
 calm weather, 75 mpg flat-out down a slight gradient; then I turned
 around and came back up the hill at the same speed!  Must we infer
 that the 30mm carb (Brazilian Weber) so restricts the supply of fuel
 that the lower load on the downhill run can't result in any more revs
 !?!

My goodness Robert! I hope you got a counterweighted crank in that
Type 1 motor! 75 mph is going to beat that case to death with harmonic
vibration if you didn't!

Gene Berg says you can get 5,000 rpm on a stock crank, but Type 1
gurus claim exceptionally long engine life if you never go over 4,000,
even to shift, with 1,800 to 3,200 being the preferred driving range.

Are you sure you didn't have a slight tail wind up or head wind down?
75 is rated top speed with a type 4 engine. Can't imagine getting that
out of a type 1 !!!
