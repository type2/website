Here's what I've done in the past:

1. Mark the wood
2. Lay masking tape on the front and back
3. Using a sharp razor blade, score the wood through the masking tape (use a
straight edge wherever possible)
4. Remove the masking tape on the outside of your cut line, making it easy
for you to see where to cut
5. Cut just outside of your scored/taped line with a high TPI blade (at
least 20 TPI seems to work good)
6. Be very careful and go SLOW when reaching the end of the wood (edge of
the board, etc)

I haven't tried cutting from the back of the board... that makes a lot of
sense though.
