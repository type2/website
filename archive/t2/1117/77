Mucho gracias, Scott!  That explains a lot.   I obviously have a newer
replacement pump, as it has screw terminals and  a pigtail.  On the pump
position, I put the pump where it would be on a '78, which works out to be a
major PITA on the '73 body.  The '73 has a brace right in front of the
firewall tin that the '78 did not have and it makes working in that area
exteremely tight, as the wiring harness has to pass thru both the firewall
tin and two lightening holes in that brace.  If I ever have cause to pull
the fuel tank on this bus, I am definitely moving that pump!  I liked the
'76 position, altho I tink it might make changing the fuel filter a
problem.  At any rate, I will move it somewhere where I can reach it and
just make up an extension harness for use with the terminal pump that is now
standard.
