I just went to autozone and got the appropriate hoses where needed. 
It's not like the hoses are anything special.  The only one that I got 
at my VW dealer was some nice German FI hose, but beyond that, anything 
else will do.

For the specialty T's and elbows, you'll need to source the special 
parts from one of the bus vendors (or find them used).
