Subject: Trans-Awn 2000 drip rail brackets needed

Hi Volks,

I have inherited a nice awning I can use on my westfakia and/or my 
vanagon but unfortunately the brackets are damaged. Before I spend time 
trying to fabricate my own I was wondering if anyone could recommend a 
source for the real deal or a suitable substitute.

Happy Trails,
