Subject: Vacuum Line Kit Source

Does anyone know a vendor that sells an entire vacuum line/connector kit for a
'78 FI bus?  Nearly all of my T's, elbows, and hoses are hanging on by a
thread and lots of duct tape and I'm tired of chasing down leaks.

Also, can someone tell me what would cause my bus to run rough when I push the
brakes even if I have the booster unhooked and capped at the motor?  I think I
have a leak in the booster line somewhere but I'm not sure how applying the
brakes could affect the engine if the booster is plugged up.  It runs bad
enough to stall it out if I push real hard.

Thanks,
Chandler
