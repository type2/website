Ballast resistors get installed inline between the +12v and where the 
+12v went to the coil.

If you want to get fancy, you then take the starter wire and go 
directly to the +12v on the coil, so it gets full juice only while 
running the starter. Mine starts fine without going through all that 
trouble, so I haven't bothered.
