Hi Mike,

I cleaned it thoroughly with a mild abrasive cleaner (Vim brand) and 
then wiped it thoroughly using lint-free cloth soaked in varsol.

It looked so good after being cleaned, I almost decided not to paint it. 
If I hadn't already bought the paint I wouldn't have used it.

OTOH, I have seen some pretty nasty UV damage to fibreglass, so I think 
the decision to paint it was a good one in the long run.

Happy Trails,
