Hi Max,

 

Nice work! I notice the use of fiberglass insulation, I have heard that is
not a good thing to use, as it can potentially  trap moisture against the
body, and cause rust from the inside.

 

What type of sound proofing did you use? Are you happy with the noise
reduction?

 

I just got my bus back from the shop, and am starting the interior work,
sound proofing new cabinets etc.  I am quit anxious about sound. I always
want a quieter ride!
