Subject: Re: [T2] Fiberglass top paint

I used acrylic enamel plus some hardener. Ten years later and it looks
the same except for some fiberglass cracking that is showing back through.

That will be my challenge next time 'round. Stripping the top and fixing
those cracks.

Any ideas? My luggage rack has some cracks. None on the rest of the top.
