I used oil based bright white rustoleum that I bought at home depot.  I repaired my fiberglass, and brushed on the rustoleum it self leveled and looked great.  Looked like I sprayed it.  I had the bus for a few years, and sold it to a friend.  It's been about 6 years and it looks great, not yellowing, or peeling.  
I know it is not the most hi-tech way to do it, but it worked for me and I would do it again.
