Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition, which one?

I just placed an order for the parts to build a CDI from Bill Noble's
1982 magazine article.

http://www.wbnoble.com/WN_articles/CD-ignition-SK.pdf 

I'm leaving the points installed but once the CDI is in they only have
to be replaced when the rubbing block falls apart.

I emailed Bill to verify that his CDI (designed for a 6 volt system)
REALLY will work in a 12 volt system with no changes. I had to split
the parts order between Mouser and All Electronics to get everything.

Total PARTS cost will be about $30 per unit. Add to that the time to
solder it all together and test it. Then I'll have a unit that, if it
fails, I can flip a toggle switch and regap the plugs on the side of
the road to switch back to the original kettering ignition. And, since
I built it, I'll be able to troubleshoot and repair the CDI for a few
pennies when I'm back home.
