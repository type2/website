I've done the tape type cuts and the backer board type cuts.  Both work with
the fine teeth and the teeth cutting down into the "good" side of the wood.
Don't let the blade stick way through, just an eighth inch is plenty (and
safer too).
Another way is to make a fine knife cut on the "good" side of the wood and
then cut with the saw just to the knife cut but not into it.  That is a real
hard thing to do (you need to cut very close or you'll end up with the knife
cut showing).  I ended up useing the belt sander to take the last few
thousands off, however, I had zero splintering.
Which ever way you do it remember that you'll be the harshest critic of the
work, no one else will notice unless it is way bad and you make no effort to
sand things down.
