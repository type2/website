'75 fuel pump is on the outer side left frame rail. '76 is on the
crossmember in front of the torsion housing. '77-'79 is on the inside of
the frame rail farther back close to the left wheel.

all stock fuel pumps have push-on terminals with rubber boots. the push-on
type pumps are getting hard to find from bosch, they seem to have
obsoleted them and now the pump has screw terminals.
