The best method is a combination of things..

1. SHARP high tooth count blade made for plywood. I personally like the
Freud.
2. Masking tape on both sides of the cut. (Mark your cut, put the tape
down, mark your cut again.)
3. Use a backer if cutting with a handheld circ saw. The 3" foam
insulation sheets that are like $10 at the BORG are awesome for this.
3b. A backer is useful if cutting with a tablesaw too, but here use
either another sheet of plywood or some hardboard.
4. Make sure you have good support for the wood while cutting. Having
one end bouncing in the wind while cutting on the table saw is NOT
safe, nor will you get a clean cut. An outfeed table is needed.
5. Have the BORG cut your wood close to size then just trim it when
you get home. Or at least cut that big 8x4' sheet into more manageable
sections.
