Subject: Buses Of the Corn 2010 Date Shift - August 13, 14, 15

Hi Volks,

Due to circumstances beyond me control, Buses Of the Corn cannot take 
place on the previously advertised date.

Instead, the event will happen one week later on August 13, 14 15th in 
the same location in Brooklin, Ontario, just east of Toronto.

I would also like to point out that the dot.com site is no longer the 
home for BOTC info, as it seems to have been acquired by a 
cybersquatter. I purposefully let the registration lapse last year when 
changing web hosts and had planned to reacquire it when the domain 
expired this week. Unfortunately it appears that enom.com got there 
first and somehow has plans for it.  If you have BOTC bookmarks or 
manage entries in an events listing, please update them to point at:

Sincere apologies for any inconvenience these incidents have caused.

If you are still interested in attending, then I am pleased to announce 
that pre-registration is now open; allowing you to get a BOTC T-short 
free with your $25 weekend event fee.


Happy Trails,
