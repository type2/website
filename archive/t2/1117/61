Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump FI sub-harness replacement

The engine is a 1978, as is the FI.  All are installed in a 1973 body (If I
wanted multiple carburetors, I'da bought a Triumph!)  I *think* Barry's
harness is a '77 or '79 and Mario's is probably a '75.  The '75 FI was a
very weird beast, and I always fall back on that to explain oddities :-)
OTOH, it's entirely possible that I got and installed a non-standard fuel
pump at some point, though the whole thing looks "stock" (for a '78) to me.
