I might be into this one a little late, but with the symptoms 
you are having, and the parts that you have thrown at it and all,
my guess is that you have a grounding problem, and usually that is 
the head temp sensor.  Usually it is just loose or could possibly be 
bad. They don't fail often. 
 
The real quick way to observe a bad head sensor is to watch the exhaust
when 
things start to go bad and see if all of a sudden there is black smoke
coming 
out from a really rich mixture (high resistance in the ground circuit)
like 
it is still in cold running mode.
 
I have seen this scenario hundreds of times.  This is the first place I
look.
 
Another way to pin point a loose or bad sensor is to gently tug on the
wire
and see if the engine speed changes or the engine quits.
 
Good luck. Keep us posted on what you eventually find.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
