Subject: Re: [T2] Fiberglass top paint

Since no-one else has mentioned it, I will put in my plug for Interlux 
premium Yacht enamel. It goes on supersmooth, and has enough surface 
tension to smooth out bubbles and runs like no other brush or roller 
paint I have ever worked with. One quart will cost around $30 and is 
enough to do the pop-top twice with a bit left over a light coat on both 
bumpers.

I painted my pop-top with it 9 years ago and it still looks good.

Happy Trails,
