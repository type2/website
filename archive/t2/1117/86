Subject: Electronic ignition, which one?

Hello List,
 
I know I am probably rehashing an old subject but... which electronic ignition
is worth the money? There is accu-fire (the cheapest brand that I recognize),
compufire, ignitor, ect. I am not interested in the ignitor II, or III. I just
want basic electronic ignition for my vacuum advance dizzy. They range in
price from around $30 for the accufire to ove $80 for the ignitor. The
accufire's price sounds great to me, but is it as good? I don't want to buy
junk, but I dont want to over pay for a name brand. All insight is
appreciated. Thanks!
