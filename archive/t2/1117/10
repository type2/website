Great work Max.

Any tips on preventing splintering while cutting the wood panels?

I'm getting ready to do my panels too. I'd like to do the wood instead
of vinyl, but I'm nervous about bad edges from the saw.

I heard a tip about putting masking tape on the cut line, but it is
hard for me to visualize that being enough strength to prevent
splintering.

Thanks,

John
