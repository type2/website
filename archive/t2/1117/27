Subject: Bus Benefit Flyer

I have been told that several people have been collecting the Buses By the
Beach event flyers. Thanks to Mary Wisnewski for designing this years flyer.
They are a work of art! Thought you might enjoy seeing it. 

 

It might take a second to download the pdf.

"Yeah he looked me in the eye by the interstate sign
and said may hope lead you to peace.
Keep it low and slow don't forget to reap what you sow
and keep your machine well greased."
