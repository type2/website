Yes John you are correct and I yield to your experience.

I would not strip a bus reasonably rust free to bare metal. I'd sand it 
(chemical strip?) it until you got down to a layer of paint or primer 
that was stable.

I don't think every vehicle needs to go to bare metal during 
restoration. I'd want to sand away any rust (to keep it from creeping 
under the paint and reappearing), reduce excess paint thickness, and to 
get below any flaking/peeling paint.

My bus has had two paint jobs on top of the factory paint. Due to the 
thickness of the paint I'd like to strip (sand) it down to the factory 
paint or primer. Not to the bare metal in my case.

The 30s vintage cars we've built we have sandblasted to bare metal all 
over to kill any rust and remove it. I sandblast on those occasions if I 
have access to the equipment (I can sandblast if I am patient enough 
with this new compressor). Chemical strippers, chemical rust converters 
and electric power tools are solutions for times when I did not have 
access to the more expensive air tools or did not need to paint a whole 
vehicle.  On a very rusty 30s vehicle I would only sandblast it. 
Anything else would seem to me to be cutting corners for the quality of 
work I'm trying to achieve.
