This just might turn out to be a good deal. Rumor has
is that some of the counterfit Chinese auto parts are
very high quality. An article in Automotive News
reported that a major CV joint manufacturer discovered
a Chinese plant making copies of their CV joints that
were so good they started buying from them instead of
launching legal action to try to get them to stop.
Time will tell but evidently not all the Chinese parts
are inferior.
