fair enough. how about this scenario. Builder builds engine, runs it
on engine stand, something seriously goes wrong (doesn't matter just
something broken). The engine R&R for this it gone from this scenario
since it was never installed in the bus to begin with. Now most of the
time this will not happen and everything will be hunky-dorry, but
don't forget that's exactly how insurance is sold the "what if"
factor.
