I understand! Been there too. 

What I eventually learned to do with my Beetle was raise it on a jack with a 4x4 piece of wood at the center of the car just behind the tranny mount (or was it in front). 

I do a similar thing with a 6x6 piece of wood. That gets it high enough to put stands under it. I put the stands under the torsions bar tube under the lower stops for the trailing arm. 

I unfortunately have the stamped steel (vs cast) tube stands so I don't take them to their upper limit as the vehicle does get wobbly like you mentioned. I work on our concrete drive. 

My jack is a Sears SUV trolley jack so it goes up pretty high thankfully. 

I have ramps that I use to double up the safety for engine installs and would like to buy one of those $75 ATV jacks eventually. 

Glad you got it all done.

Hoping to work on mine this weekend after a '97 Cabrio ignition switch, '78 VW Riviera ignition switch, timing belt on friend's Chrysler V-6, and diagnosing a Mazda with a tapping engine...
