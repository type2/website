Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Head Gasket??

Martin,
I have heard of leaving out the gasket before, but mainly from people trying
to up the compression. Can't say I've heard any bad things about it other than
needing more machining of the head to get a good seat after a re-build.
Richard


 have seen the following technical bulletin referred to a number of times
but have never seen any feedback. Has anybody done this? Does it do any
good? Also, I'm not clear on the details of the connecting rod grooves.
Does anyone have pictures that clarify them?
