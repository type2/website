I tend to agree with you about competitors jumping on the bandwagon, and buy
from people you know to be good, sometimes you pay a little more, but it

SERVICE and or technical help for the asking.

www.lowbugget.com is one of those fellows that does stuff the first time
right, like yourself, and has more Kadron knowledge than
anyone................
