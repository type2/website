One thing that I always do is to safety-wire this circlip together with
thin wire.  This keeps it in its groove and prevents the engine pull that
seems to follow work on the clutch.

On old-style throwout bearings, another loop of safety wire goes through
the two spring clips and around the perimter of the bearing.  Keeps things
together.
