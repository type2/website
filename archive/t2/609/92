Subject: 2 buses for sale in Western NC

I have a 69 Westfalia parts bus and a 71 Weekender for sale. The pop top Westfalia has a complete interior and good dash, steering wheel. It is a rolling shell without an engine or transaxle. Lots of good body parts and glass, but is too rusty to restore, though there is a title with it. The canvas looks remarkably good, but I haven't lifted the top to check it. I thought I had this one sold, but I guess things came up for the buyer. $150. I will sell parts if no one wants the whole bus, then to the crusher.
 
The 71 is my daily driver that I just toasted the engine in. It only needs a 1600 to be back on the road. $500. Needs the cosmetics of a paint job and headliner to be "respectable".
 
I will sell everything with some extra parts as a package or would be willing to trade for a pickup truck. This is probably my last post. Thanks to all, especially Cha Moon, Will Anderson and Greg Potts for the encouragement. I'm in Morganton NC.
