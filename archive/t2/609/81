Subject: [T2] How to exhaust....- running outside the box

Just another two cents.

Just helped to rebuild my engine at the shop.  Took a ton of time since it 
was a project on the back burner.  The VW mechanic had me rip beetle motors 
out, strip them etc etc and he would do the heads, case, cam etc etc.  I 
think by the time my motor was back in I had watched him rebuild 10 motors, 
including one for the porche spyder kit car (nice vw motor) and for the 2 
dragracers.  He said over his life he's built more than 4500 motors himself. 
  He has about 3 stands (simple things) and always has something in the 
process.

You know what? He never runs them outside the vehicle. Rebuild, take your 
time, do it right, and put it back in.  I don't think it's a necessary 
process to do it outside the vehicle.  Besides if you have to rig up each 
motor which might be slightly differernt aren't you increasing the risk of 
doing it wrong?

I can see if you had an assembly line of motors all of which were the same 
say... GEX or something it might be a better thing.

Step one: Question whether stand testing is "a must" (as Scott Lyons put it) 
or even a good idea.

Step two: Keep at it until you get good answers.

.....

What's more, if I hear that some step in the rebuilding process is "a must," 
but the book I use as a guide to rebuilding (and that many people on this 
list recommend) doesn't mention it, I get skeptical. _Somebody_ has got it 
wrong.

If testing my rebuilt engine on a stand will increase my chances of getting 
a smooth, balanced, reliable, and long-running engine, I am going to do it. 
But if I am going to spend a lot of time chasing down spare bellhousings, 
setting up a fuel ring, getting a proper but temporary FI harness together, 
then I want to make sure that this time, for a one-shot test, is worthwhile 
-- AND that I am not going to waste a lot of time trying to get my engine to 
run outside of the bus.
