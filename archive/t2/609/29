I just did this last weekend. I was going to buy that one but I found that 
Northern Tool and Equipment had this one. They are about half the distance 
that Harbor Freight is from my house.
I did have to cut the attachment bars and drill new holes in them to reduce 
the span across the back of the case. When I did I accidentally cut them too 
short, so I had no choice and had to use the bell housing, after i finish 
the engine I am going to make new supports that will allow me to use it 
either way. The way I have it mounted now, I would have to cut the plate to 
fit the starter. But like I said after I finish this engine I will be 
modifying it again.

I will post some pics when I get home.



>Will this work??? All responses welcome...

Yes but you will probably have to modify it.
