Well, here's one. Tom Wilson doesn't even mention it. Is that because 
he forgot it? Maybe the printer left those pages out? Or should we not 
trust Tom Wilson's judgment?

Or is because for the occasional or one-time engine rebuilder, the 
advantages and disadvantages of stand testing are a wash?

I'm looking to be convinced. If stand testing is going to improve my 
chances of getting the smoothest, longest-running engine I can get, I 
want to do it.

I'm just not convinced yet.
