Mine stands on a horizontal "H". I can literally roll engines across the yard (towing it with a lawn tractor or the car) if the ground is solid. I get my wife to drive and I ride on the end opposite the post to keep it from tipping over. 

The post is in the normal place as compared to a store bought.
