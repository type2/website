Subject: How to exhaust everybody's patience

Step one: Question whether stand testing is "a must" (as Scott Lyons 
put it) or even a good idea.

Step two: Keep at it until you get good answers.


Look, I am willing to be convinced. But the minute I hear from someone 
that all I have to do is bolt up a spare bellhousing, I start to get 
very skeptical.

A spare bellhousing? I don't even have a spare transmission, much less 
one with its guts torn out.

Bus owners/drivers/rebuilders come in different flavors. Some of us 
have a stack of spare bellhousings in a corner of the garage, some 
don't have the bellhousings, and some don't have garages.

What's more, if I hear that some step in the rebuilding process is "a 
must," but the book I use as a guide to rebuilding (and that many 
people on this list recommend) doesn't mention it, I get skeptical. 
_Somebody_ has got it wrong.

If testing my rebuilt engine on a stand will increase my chances of 
getting a smooth, balanced, reliable, and long-running engine, I am 
going to do it. But if I am going to spend a lot of time chasing down 
spare bellhousings, setting up a fuel ring, getting a proper but 
temporary FI harness together, then I want to make sure that this time, 
for a one-shot test, is worthwhile -- AND that I am not going to waste 
a lot of time trying to get my engine to run outside of the bus.

Or to put it another way, I question whether we're talking reason ... 
or religion.
