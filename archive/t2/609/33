maybe i should clarify. what is easier about on-stand running is access.
timing adjustments, carburetor adjustments (if you have them), leak finding
and correction, and so forth are so much easier with 360 degree bench-height
engine access. running the engine on-stand is also quite entertaining :-)

where the clarification in needed - of course there will adjustments once
you subject the engine to real loads and driving conditions in the vehicle,
and on-stand running doesn't eliminate that.
