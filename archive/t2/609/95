Subject: transmission woes in buffalo...

So... I'm trying to get back to california for school next week.  Will 
the transmission from my 77 drop nicely into my 70, or will it fight me 
to the bitter end?  What will be involved in this swap that I might not 
think of?

Alternatively, does anyone near Buffalo, NY (I'm willing to travel a few 
states over if I have to...) have a good  transmission they're willing 
to part with?  I'd rather not steal parts from my 77.

Thanks.
