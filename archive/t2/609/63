At the time I didn't like how unsteady the bus felt and was unsure if i'd
be able to safely lower it the same way I had raised it (one side at a
time). 

I'd rather rip the rubber mounts and have to pull the tranny again than
dump the bus on it's side off of the stands and have a lot more repair to
deal with..

It was a snap decision based more on safety concerns than anything else.
