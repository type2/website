That was the original plan, as mentioned here on the list earlier when
soliciting ideas for easing the install. But, as usual, I started working o
it at 9 or 10 pm and hadn't bought the wood earlier. If I turned the camera
a bit to the left you could see the lumber store parking lot so it's not
like it would have meant a long trip or anything <grin>
