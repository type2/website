Phil,

there is a circlip (inboard left side of bellhousing) that holds the cross
shaft in place against the force of the return spring which has the tendency
to pull the shaft toward the driver's side.

It is easy to bend the clip upon installation so that it won't stay in its
groove--this is most likely what happened, if you installed it.  there is a
"cross shaft rebuild kit" that includes brass bushings, rubber bushings, and
circlips.  the brass bushings are hard to get at but may not need replacing.

could be this is why your cross shaft broke in the first place?  BTDT.  been
pulling the engine a lot lately?  I feel your pain.

good luck,
