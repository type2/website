Subject: Survey about using engine stands/T4 engines

So far I have only gotten two response. Not good for statistical 
significance.

Just to get a sense of what people with the larger engines do, I would 
appreciate hearing from listees who have rebuilt Type 4 motors. Did you 
use an engine stand to test/tweak the engine before installing? Or 
install, then start/test/tweak? Would you do it that way again?

Please reply to me (which is simple: just reply and don't copy to the 
list) and I will post numbers and observations at the end of the day.
