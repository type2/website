I highly recommend Steve Sandlin at www.steveslockshop.com for all your key/lock needs but if you are in the Bay Area and need some work done quickly contact Kevin Kilfoyl <dormaticdetailing(-at-)earthlink.net>. Kevin bought up tools and inventory from Gabriel Garcia before he moved the family out to Plano, TX.
