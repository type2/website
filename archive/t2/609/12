Subject: Speedo Adjust or calibrate?

While driving home from my parents Sunday night with my wife behind in our 98
Altima, I found I was speeding. Luckinly it was my wife who told me this, not
some mean policeman. She said that she had to speed up tp about 50-55ish to
keep up with me in a 40 zone. Only kicker is that my bus said I was doin a
steady 40.

Is there any way to calibrate or adjust my speedo. I'll have to go out and
check at lunch, but I'm 99% sure my tires are stock size.
Thanks
