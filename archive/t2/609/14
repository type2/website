Subject: Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

Will this stand work for a type 4 motor????
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=32915

I've been thinking of building my own, using a tranny bell housing so
I can "bench start" the motor, but just the metal to build a "sturdy"
Frame would probably cost me more than the $39.99 for the stand above..

Will this work??? All responses welcome...

All the "VW Engine" stands I've found all say "Not for Type 4 motors"
So what's a driver to do?????

TIA
