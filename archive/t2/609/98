Subject: RE: [T2] Question for the catalytic converter experts

I'd leave the heat shield there.  It could save you or someone else from
a really nasty burn.  Once the engine is shut off the converter stays
hot but the heat shield cools fairly quickly.  I used to work at an
exhaust shop so I know this from experience.

To solve the problem go to an exhaust shop and ask them to install an 02
sensor bung for you upstream of the cat.  It'll probably cost less than
10 bucks.  Sometimes they'll do it for free.

Question:

Since this heat shield isn't really shielding anything - it's pointing
up
and to the rear too - is there any problem with me removing the heat
shield,
so that I can rotate the converter?
