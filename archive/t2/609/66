After thinking about this for a while, Scott, I have to wonder whether 
what counts as a "must" for someone who builds a lot of engines is 
quite a bit different from what counts as a "must" for someone who does 
it only once, or twice.

Because there aren't affordable off-the-shelf stands for 1700/1800/2000 
engines, and because of the need to mickey mouse an electrical system, 
fuel pump, starter mount, and anti-torque flipper-over, it seems to me 
that bench/stand running of a rebuilt engine adds opportunities for 
error to an already complicated process. If running on the stand gave 
enough running time to retorque the heads, that might be worth the 
effort.
