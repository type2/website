It was that "wobbly" feeling that got me to the point that the jack was
under there in the first place. When my baby brother was my helper, before
his death, we would use the Chevy and a set of ramps.

Hook up a tow strap and pull the bus far enough us the ramps to clear the
engine then brake-feed the bus back down the ramps as the engine is pushed
along to keep it centered. No danger of tipping that way.
