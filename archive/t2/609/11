Subject: KYB GR2 vs Gas Adjust?

Looking for new shocks for Possum. Ordered 2 gas adjusts for rear but may send em back and get 4 GR2's. I thought the GR2's were a little softer and better ride for a bus. I'm no race car driver. I also heard once of someone recommending GR2's for the front and Gas adjusts for the back. Finally do the Gas Adjusts change the ride height any? I read on Aircooled.net that they will raise the ride 1.25" in the back if used there. I dont have a sagging rear and am happy with stock ride height. 
 
Thanks Volks,
