Okay, I have what I think is a 69.

I'm having bodywork done and am ordering body panels.

I receive what I'm told are replacement rear arches for a 69. The arch
(lip over the tire) doesn't look anything like the one on my bus. The
arch I receive has a "round bump" that runs along the top of the arch.

My bus has a slight flare and a more square looking arch.

So I go back online and see that the 73-79 rear arch is described as
having a flared lip, so I order two of them

The 73-79 arch comes in and the arch is identical to the previous parts.
WTF?
I went out and looked at pictures on the samba and see lots of late
model bays with the same "flared and square" arch as mine.... so I know
that I'm not crazy. I also see earlier bays with the non-flared round
bump arch.

Is there anyone that manufactures the arch that I'm looking for?

Steve
