not if you have the right kind of stand. on-stand running of a newly built
engine is a must in my opinion, it is so much easier to get the engine
running properly on a stand than in the vehicle. with a bit of plumbing and
electrical work and a few spare bits and pieces, you can run anything from a
single carb upright to an injected type 4.

you can turn a garden variety engine stand into a really sweet aircooled
stand with this:

it seems expensive, but not when you compare it to (scroll down a bit):

in this photo you can see something similar that i use, i reamed the
receiver of my cheap-o engine stand to allow the porsche bracket to fit:

transmission bell-housings are good for running the engine, but not for the
actual assembly, as you need to be able remove and re-install the flywheel
during the process. i do use a chunk of bell-housing to attach the starter
for on-stand running.
