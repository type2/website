Subject: Question for the catalytic converter experts

Hi all:

Background:

For my Federal vehicle I purchased and installed a Bus Depot exhaust
crossover pipe and water-cooled catalytic converter and muffler.  (For
anybody contemplating doing this, be aware that you need to modify the tail
pipe.)  The aftermarket crossover pipe has no exhaust snifter port, so I'd
like to use the oxygen sensor port on the catalytic converter instead.
Right now the port is pretty much inaccessible to a snifter as it's pointing
up and to the rear.  I can't rotate the converter to the proper position
because the heat shield's in the way.

Question:

Since this heat shield isn't really shielding anything - it's pointing up
and to the rear too - is there any problem with me removing the heat shield,
so that I can rotate the converter?

TIA.
