I did an oil pressure test before I put my engine back in and sitting on a pallete it really rocked back and forth while the engine cranked.

If a bellhousing/stand attachment were to be fashioned I don't think it would be wise. Definitely those $69 Type I engine stands with the $20 yoke are too crummy. Unforunately there isn't much between those stands and the expensive Porsche engine yokes that keep going up in price.
