Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] Suggestions for tracking battery drain? 

[1] if the battery is outside of the VW, leave it out of the VW for ease of 
getting around; connect the battery to the vehicle cables with your jumper 
cables
[2] check the amperage flow at the negative ground post.  put an amp meter 
between the vehicle ground and the negative ground post.  either use a 15 
amp meter, or something that will take a blast of 5 amps without blowing a 
fuse in the amp meter [hint; check you digital amp meter and make sure you 
have enough scale to read at least 5 amps.]
[3] when you get a reading, start checking back up the wires to get an idea 
where the flow is coming from
[4] you can pull all the fuses one at a time while someone reads the amp 
meter and sees if it get a reading.  you can either pull one fuse out and 
leave it out if you get no change, or replace it while you pull the other 
fuses out.  but remember, there could be two circuits [unlikely] that 
contribute to the drain.

A note in the archives was "Also, [a relay setup],  unlike an isolator setup 
(which, when its diode fails, will tend to allow the starting battery to 
drain)"

Generator and Alternator
ALTERNATOR PRECAUTIONS
1.	Battery polarity should be checked before any connections, such as jumper 
cables or battery charger leads, are made. Reversing the battery connections 
will damage the diodes in the alternator. It is recommended that the battery 
cables be disconnected before connecting a battery charger.
2.	The battery must never be disconnected while the alternator is running.
3.	Always disconnect the battery ground lead before working on the charging 
system, especially when replacing an alternator.
4.	Do not short across or ground any alternator or regulator terminals.
5.	If electric arc welding has to be done to the car, first disconnect the 
battery and alternator cables. Never start the car with the welding unit 
attached.
