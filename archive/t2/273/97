I use 195/75R14s myself.  I cannot say if the 185 vs the 195 will make a
noticable difference.  Some 195/74R14s are smaller then others.  The
Bridgestone 603v has a narrower tread then the Yokohama 370 (NLA) did in
the same size.  It's also narrower then the old 195 (PO installed)
Michelins (MX's if i recall?) that were on the Vanagon.

Probably.  I do know that both Contis and Michelins have a very mixed
reputation.

Not really....though I'd recommend against the 356 if you plan on driving
in the rain.  Everyone I know of who's used these have had problems with
low traction in the wet.

The Bridgestone, which has a similar tread, is great in the rain. (I'm on
my first set with a dozen+ thousand miles on'm, plus a set on my moms
vanagon.)

If you plan to spend any amount of time OFF pavement, the 603v (and I
suspect the 356) is NOT the way to go.  They have virtually zero traction
in sand, grass, mud, gravel.  (Compared to my prior sets of Yoko 370s, as
well as some generic mixed passenger tires before those. (PO installed)

Pretty much, yeah.

Yup, though I cannot say for the Dunlop.  The last Dunlop I looked at was
a mild offroad tread and was at the low-end of the C ratings...I dont
recall what tire that was though, as it was a few years ago.

If you run the stock air pressures for your vehicle, you should be fine.

If my choice was between the two, I'd take my chances with the Contis.

.....david (still missing the 370s. those were good tires.)
