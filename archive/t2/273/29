Subject: update on David Bennett

Hey Now All,

David called and gave me his status as of
11:30 am Thursday (Kansas time)
Turns out he got up early and called one of the local VW shops, he was only
FOUR blocks from one place so he got it there, after sitting the bus started
back up......he drove to the mechanic and he worked up his Valves and his
choke was messed up, he did his timing, etc. etc.
for the total sum of $50!!!!!!!

They traded t-shirts and Dave is now on his way HOME! :o)

The mechanic would love ANY referred business he said, so if anyone wants a
good mechanic, easy on the prices example: (he would have done the oil
cooler seals on his bus he said for $250 and they costed him $450 here at
the Kansas mechanic)

Peace,
