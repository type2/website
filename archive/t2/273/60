Subject: 78 wont start.

I just got my 78 smogged.  The people at the smog shop had to retard the
timing to get it to pass smog.

After I left the smog shop, my van started to run very poorly.  I figured
te timing was was not set properly.  Today, I set the timing properly. 7.5
BTC.  After I set the timing, I turned the car off to tightendown the
distributor.  Then the van would not start up.  I had to move the
distributor around a couple of times to get it to work.

The van was still running very poorly.  Lots of trouble keeping idle. 
Ideling very low.  And dying.  Actually it totally died on me after
dinner.  I had to walk home.

So now its sitting roadside.  When I turn the key, the starter turns but
nothing happens.  It smells like gas.

I'm thinking a short in the distributor? Any suggestions?  I would like to
get it home..

Thanks.
