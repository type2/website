The instructions I got with my Total Seal rings said not to lube up the
cylinders.  I had always lubed them.  I called them and they said just a
very thin wiping of oil on the walls if anything.  I did it that way and
they seemed to seal fine.  They used to seal ok when I oiled them.  I'm
thinking you'll be ok either way.  I always do the Bon-ami scrub on new
cylinders so they need oiled right then to keep them from rusting up.
