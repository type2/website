Subject: Re: [T2] Heat in the bus.

just get pipes that will connect
don't worry about the flapper boxes
mine are permanently open
wrap your pipes with exhaust tape
insulate the main tube with nasa insulation
install an in-line fan from a boat store in the main tube
you will have some heat then

  The heater control boxes and tubes are not there.
Does anyone know of a good inexpensive replacements for these.  I picked
up a pair of good tubes at Oktobugfest this weekend but still need the
control boxes to hook them up to.  I really don't want to shell out for

Thanks in advance,
