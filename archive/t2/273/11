Subject: Curse of the Voodoo Vacuum Leaks

Hi all, back again with the latest installment of this neverending saga.
After trying everything in the book to find & fix my vacuum leak(s), I
finally threw in the ol' shop towel and took Dandy to one of the remaining
Berkeley mechanics who still work on the type2.  Here's what they found:

1) Vacuum leak at throttle body.  Fixed with new seal.
2) Leak at cold start injector (worn seal).  Fixed with new seal.
3) Leak at end of right runner, where it meets the 1/2 head (flat edge of
   metal was warped).  Fixed with a runner from a '78 "parts bus"
4) STILL leaking vac at the plenum itself!  Exact location unknown
   (they've been using the old propane trick to track these down).
   At this point, the bus actually runs _worse_ than before, the shop
   owner mentioned something about 6% O2 that I couldn't quite digest.
   He is admittedly stymied at this point as to why the bus is actually
   running worse.

SO, at this point, after 4 hours of pricey work, the shop owner suggests
we cool our jets a bit, step back, and re-asses the situation.  His
thoughts... maybe take off the plenum, sugmerge it in water and pressurize
it to find the leak.  Maybe a "smoke test".  Also, possibly try a new AFM
due to the fact that it was running _so_ badly.  He says it is hard to
find a replacement plenum, since most are from models with an EGR (my Cal
bus has no EGR), which are quite different.

Any suggestions?  Where do I go from here?  This has been haunting me for
months now!  Anyone ever heard of a leak from the plenum itself?
