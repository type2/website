I had a reply directly to me yesterday on my aux battery wiring question from
Andrew Stewart for which I am truly grateful.  He pointed me at this link which
was very helpful: http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/aux-batt.htm

I would suggest that this write-up be added to the Type2 tech pages as it says it
all.  Because it also shows a good diagram of the isolator setup I was able to use
that to get my original isolator back on line.  So now I have a relay kit to keep
in reserve in case the original ever fails.

One curious thing is that when I hooked a test light up, after it was all
together, going from body ground to the aux battery produced no light with the
engine off but did with it on.  Which, I guess, proves that the battery is truly
isolated to the fridge and power plugs when the engine is off and that they ground
directly to the aux battery rather than grounding to the body.
