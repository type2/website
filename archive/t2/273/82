Subject: Re: [T2] Fridays in Calif

since it is Friday thought I would make a quick comment, I was in the Bay
area last week for work.  Saw so many type 2s that I was beginning to get
mind numb, and even in the damp bay area saw very little rust.  so it must
be the salt not the wet.   

  saw a beautifully restored 58 or so being used as a daily driver...and I
had a rental and felt dumb waving back.....get back to the airport last
night and find I had left a light on and had to get a Jump start to get my
78 home........  oh well,  tommorrow John Brown's buses, I hope
