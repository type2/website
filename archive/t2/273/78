Subject: Type 1 list

OK so its Friday so I think it is safe to ask...

I know there must be a list like this for the type 1 so someone please tell
me what they are. My son and I decided to build a Baja bug! ( Is there a
Baja list?)

So if anyone has a bug to sell for a low price please let me know, I live in
Southern California but would be willing to travel for the right one ( ah an
adventure)

Thank You
