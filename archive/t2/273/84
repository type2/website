This has to qualify for the "provocative subject line of the year award!"

I think that your local builder is off his nut!  Starting an engine with
no lubricant isn't a good idea in any case.  It _might_ seat the rings
quickly on a race engine, but in terms of longevity I wouldn't take the
risk of scoring the cylinder walls before the oil film arrived to cushion
the parts..

Oil the parts while assembling, crank the engine to get oil pressure, then
hook up the ignition and run it.
