Bet your rear bumper doesn't like all the soot
either.  (I played spot the weber progressives at
Everybus by looking for the black bumper.)  But
heck, we all made the weber progressive and
chrome 009 error early in our VW careers, haven't
we?  

I searched the archive and started to cut and
paste for you, but there were simply too many
hits.  Search "weber+icing" or "weber+ice" and
get some ideas.  Basically it boils down to
preheating your air (hose to below the engine
cooling tin or even just removing some of the
seal--not for me thanks) to wrapping your intake
manifold with copper attached to the exhuast
manifold (cannot imagine that would conduct
enough heat... but who knows?).  Actually, there
is a third option:  remove the humidity from the
air by moving to Arizona or some similar clime.
As the weather gets worse, the air will actually
get more arid and you'll carb won't freeze up as
bad.  

Bottom line is that a single carb setup doesn't
work on a type 4 engine due to the lack of
preheating provision.  But then, you know that
first hand now.
