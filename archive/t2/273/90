Subject: fuel flow question

I am curious about the amount of fuel flow if I put a fuel switch coming
off the fuel tank before the fuel pump.  If I put a switch for 1/4"
hose, will that allow enough fuel to flow to the engine during
accelleration?  I'm hoping someone might have some experiences.. 

Thanks,
Mike
