have swapped the cluster at some point over the years.  I suspected that
not all year busses had that box from my junkyard explorations, but I know
that many did have them because I bought a couple extras.  Back when my
gauge used to go to zero when I got down to half a tank, I swapped out
every part but the sender hoping to fix it.  All for naught, the sender
ended up being bad.  I think that box may have started with the
introduction of the type4 engine (1972) but that's only a guess.

Actually I can help here.

Both the gauge and sender on the 1973 Bus changed in January 1973.  Here
are the part numbers and vin:

Up to 2x3 2138 900:
Gauge:  211 957 063
Sender:  211 919 051 (Tube Style)

2x3 2138 901 thru 1979 production year:
Gauge:  211 957 063A
Sender:  211 919 051A (Lever Style)

The gauges and senders are matched to each other.  The early gauge coupled
with a late sender will work, but will be inaccurate.  Same applies on a
late gauge and early sender.

Hope this helps
