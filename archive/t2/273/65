Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Knoxville area??

I have used Dean's Import Service in the past.  He doesn't keep much in the way of junkers/spares around.  He works on cars other than ACVWs.  I've done good by him, and vice versa.

For my money, I think I would rather use Larry at (formerly) Larry's Hot VWs in Harriman.  He does buggies and has since branched out into racing carts.  His work is exclusively air cooled.  He DOES have a boneyard and I usually graze out there when I go because it is a long drive from where I am.  He gets most of my business - very reasonable.
