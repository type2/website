Ronnie-
I have built alot of VW motors and have been a diesel mechanic for 21 years.
I have never, ever put a piston in a cylinder dry. Every piston put in a VW
cylinder has been oiled and never once has a motor burned oil. In fact i
have a motor in my garage I built from scraps I had around. Honed the
cylinders, new rings and well oiled piston assy. when I reassembled it. Put
it in a bug and sold it to a friend. Her first bug and ran it for 5 years.
It had an oil leak( after 5 years) so I swapped it out for another I had.
After all was done it was the oil pressure switch leaking. And it never
smoked.  Lube it for life!
