Subject: Re: [T2] Buses in Knoxville area??

I think UT's homecoming is this weekend, so beware of traffic and public intoxication around campus. This neighbor of my sister's in fort sanders had a beetle last year and somebody poured a can of paint on it after homecoming. Probably some obnoxious drunken louse. There are a couple of nice busses parked on and around Laurel ave, parallel with the strip, right off campus, on top of the hill, if it's any use to you... Have a good weekend.
