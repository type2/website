Subject: Re: [T2] '68 Pick-Up Headliner Installation

Guys,

TMI made it and I bought it from a local flaps....I try to spread
my business around a little to help the local guys too!  The folks
at TMI were pleasant, but "arrogant".....their response was to
check around with local installers who said that *they* weren't having a 
problem with it.....Turns out that they were cutting the bows down
to make it fit correctly.....which I don't believe would actually work
for the whole length....and would make it fall from the roof easier.

I have been talking with another listee and his is probably not 
made correctly either....I will let him chime in after he actually
tries it on his bus.

I called sew-fine and they were very nice....gave me what I hope
were the correct specs on their headliner and it is not made correctly 
either.

Double cab? one might be ok as their should be fewer metal ribs across the 
roof.  The problem with mine was that the metal ribs and rear hatch 
torsion bars would have showed thru the headliner(and rubbed on it).


Sorry about the bounce...my ISP(my son) had some problems with 
several servers.

p-mail me if you need more info.

Cheers ,dave
