From my experience you indeed have a cv joint problem. But before opting for 
expensive replacements, try removing the half shafts and adding some 
cv-joint grease (or lithium-based chassis grease if unavailable) to the 
offending joint(s). What has probably happened is that the original grease 
has leaked slowly out from around the ends of the boots and now there is too 
little grease to keep the ball/cage surfaces lubricated. If you do this 
maintenance promptly you may save the joint before it is unserviceable.
