Subject: 71 stock dual advance Dizzy needed

Hello again!
I just discovered the stock Distributor sold to me years ago by my friendly 
neighborhood VW mechanic is for a 71 BUG and has a different advance curve.
By the way here is a good source for Distributor specs.

I need p/n 231-167-055 Bosch 211-905-205Q VW which was only used for 1 year 
on the Bus.
Thanks!
