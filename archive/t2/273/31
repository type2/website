The shop was not going by sound, but by using a propane test.  When they
sprayed at the plenum itself, they could measure a noticeable change in
the engine.  The fishy part (and this is what has them stumped): the shop
says after they spray near the plenum, the see the engine react ~10-15
sec later.  I tell them: maybe the propane drifts to another location
during that time and gets sucked into the air system at another point.
The shop says: that's what you'd think, but we sprayed everywhere else
and see no change in the engine; the only other suspect area is near
throttle body bushings, but this was minor.

Today, the shop owner started musing about the valves/guides or something,
wondering if there is a leak in that area.  But, I just put AVP refurb
heads on...  Is this plausible?

Yes, after the cat (but with the engine running cold, so the cat had not
heated up in order to work yet anyway).

Here's my experience: the timing can't be set properly since the vac is
out of whack.  The bus _barely_ idles to begin with, only after it has
been warmed up a bit.  The bus will run with the timing around 7BTDC but
as I turn the dizzy to go for 5ATDC, the engine stalls.

Well, I stopped at the shop this morning.  They are planning on doing a
smoke test next.  Here's a theory from one of the mechanics: the old
right intake runner (which they replaced) may have been a left side runner,
causing stress on the plenum and bending it out of shape.  Dunno.  Just
his theory.  Maybe I'll need a new plenum, maybe not.

At idle.  This is according to the gas analysis at the tailpipe.
Yesterday the shop owner mused about trying a new AFM, but today he said
that it would do no good if the vac is not up to spec.

How hard is it to remove the plenum?  How big of a job is this?
