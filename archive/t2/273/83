The description for this part on www.busdepot.com says:
	Headlight Switch, 71-79 Bus (Genuine VW, this one fits!)
Now you know why I wrote that!

A while ago there was a discussion on this list of online parts vendors that
are suddenly cropping up everywhere, all using the same wholesaler's
"instant, add-water-and-stir" e-commerce site.  A copy of my explanation of
what's up with these sites is posted below, for those who missed it.  We can
now add yet another new site, avolkswagenpart.com, to that list.

The switch you received is a Chinese made switch, and, as you have
discovered, it won't fit. (It will work, but you have to fabricate your own
mounting method.)  If you order the switch somewhere else,  you'll probably
get the same switch, as it is the only one sold in the U.S. by the major
automotive wholesalers.  We, too, have sold it periodically in the past, but
only as a last resort during periods when the one we usually sell was
unavailable.

There is a Genuine Volkswagen switch that does fit, but we have to import it
ourselves.  Our part number is 211 941 531E.  It's a bit more ($39.95), but
then again, it's a real VW part, not Chinese, and it fits.  In other words,
it's a good part cheap, not a cheap part.  We have about 10 on hand at the
moment.

Hopefully avolkswagenpart.com will waive their 20% (!!!) restocking fee on
the switch they sent you.

Sure. This is a particular wholesale distributor's attempt to court small
auto parts dealers by offering them an "instant e-commerce site" that they
can just paste their name onto.  The wholesaler provides the engine that
runs the site, the parts database and web interface.  The retailer adds a
few pages with his logo, adds water and stirs, and bingo, he's in the online
auto parts business.  When the order is placed, it is dropshipped directly
from that particular wholesaler, with whom the retailer has an exclusive
contract. (This means no competiton; the retailer isn't free to pick and
choose between the offerings of different wholesalers, choosing the best
possible brand and/or sourcing the part elsewhere if the one wholesaler is
out of stock.)

So, the website owner gets a free website and doesn't even have to stock a
single part. Sounds too good to be true, right?  Indeed, it is too good to
be true.  There's a very serious catch.  To enroll in this program, this
"virtual retailer" must commit to spending a huge amount of money with the
wholesaler, which realistically is only going to happen if his website is a
raging success.  If the retailer doesn't hit that number, he agrees to pay a
very large additional sum of money to the wholesaler - in essence a penalty
for not making his quota.  So large a sum, in fact, that it could very well
put him out of business unless he has started off with very deep pockets to
begin with.  So it's a very risky proposition, to say the least.  Still,
apparantly enough people are willing to take the gamble, because all the
sudden new auto parts websites are coming out of the woodwork, all with this
same wholesaler's web interface.  I've never heard of any of the retailers
before.  Most appeared out of nowhere and will probably disappear just as
quickly. (Like the one in question, whose domain is just two months old.)
And of course, the more of them there are, selling the identical products
out of the identical warehouse, the less each one will sell individually -
meaning that each one will be that much less likely to make his quota.  Not
exactly a pyramid scheme, but it carries much of the same risk.  I predict a
lot of bankruptcy filings when many of these retailers discover that they're
not going to hit their quotas, and can't afford to make their extra
payments.
