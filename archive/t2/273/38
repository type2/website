There are supposed to be a junkyard or two in Tullahoma (I don't know first 
hand). I do know there is a pretty big stash of imports (even Porsche and 
Fiat) in Clarkrange, TN. The owner's are a bit nutty. Another handfull in 
Crossville but I don't know where, and finally a bunch (3 dozen?) near 
Cleveland, TN.
