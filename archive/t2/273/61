Hello guys

I know I am a little bit out since this question is not for my bus but my
1965 bug with 6V system. After a few months parked I decided to ride my 65
so I let it roll down hill and started it (battery almost dead) I drove it
to home a six hilly miles trip, then I decided that was time to tune up, I
change the points, condenser, sparks plugs, adjust the valves. After that I
spend the whole day trying to started the car again but I was defeat. I
check and re-check points, condenser, distributor, fuel pump, wiring using
Muir's book but nothing happened. In my oddisey I discharge my 6V battery so
for the last few tries I used a 12V battery to jumping start the bug I mean
to have enough juice but nothing happened.
Any clues or suggestions?
I would like to thanks to all of you that responds to my last note about the
sparks treads problem, the treads was redone with an Heli-Coil, the engine
back and runs steady, thanks one more time.
