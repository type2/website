Opinions?
---------------------
The oil in your pistons and cylinders last about 1 minute or less when
you crank the new engine.
Its just scraped away.
So in fact they are running dry very soon.
I've always found that I have to liberally prime my fresh engines with a
mix of STP and Oil mix just to get the starter to crank it.
The guy that says build them dry could have something if he's talking
about water cooled but with air cooled you get lots of friction heat real
quick.
I'd also add, always prime the oil pump and fill your oil cooler and
filter if you have them.
