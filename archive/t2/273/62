Subject: [T2] 78 westy ignition switch 

Greg, I just did similar  to my '78.


BTW, you said
>>the old switch was missing from the bus when I got it from the
PO so I'm not sure exactly how it came out.

SO,  ignore everything I say after the * * * stars!!

Greg, you simply slide the key assembly into the empty hole.


1)  release the column lock by pulling it to the outside, and turning your 
steering wheel some 60 - 120 degrees.  There are two locks on the steering 
wheel column, at 180 degrees from each other.  You just have to get the lock 
out of the hole it is in, and turn the wheel a bit to keep it out.  Finger 
in hole, slide steering wheel/column lock slider to outside, turn wheel, 
finger out.

2) the ignition key switch only fits in one way; there is a slot on the side 
of the switch and a reverse slot on the housing.

3) BEFORE putting the ignition key switch in, see that its little tail 
matches up with the  plastic electrical ignition switch and the little black 
disk at the bottom of the hole.  It would be safest to turn everything 
counter clockwise (lefty - loosey) to match up.  This is the only hint!!

4) slip ignition key switch into hole.

5)  done!!

* * * * * Greg, ignore all the below * * * *  This is sent to list 'cause it 
is Friday, and I am looking for FLAMES!!! * * * * *



1)  If you don't know by now, the shear bolt replacement size is M8x20 1.25 
thread (metric, of course) - hex wrench head (NOT hex socket head).  Lowes 
has them at 2 x $.90, and my local hardware store, Fishers has stainless 
steel for 1 x $1.35

2) the shear bolt was easy to twist out.  I tried drilling and inserting an 
easy-out reverse bit, but the drilling was too difficult.  I wound up 
putting a small finishing nail in the hole that is already in the shear 
bolt, hammering in my easy-out and jamming it in the hole with the small 
finishing nail, and then turning the easy-out + shear bolt with pliers.  
Worked like a charm.

3) the pin is drifted out with the same sized finishing nail, point to pin.  
It is replaced with the same sized finishing nail, head to pin.

4) you need to do 3) above because you probably want to use your old key 
lock cylinder.

5) before all this, take a peak at how the shear bolt 'clamping bracket' is 
positioned relative to the steering column plate it is holding on to.  If, 
when you replace the steering column housing on the steering column, you do 
not maintain the same relative position (how much of the steering column 
plate is visible above the steering column housing = keep it the same), when 
you replace the steering wheel, you will either have too much of a gap 
between the bottom of the steering wheel hub and the light/windshield wiper 
switches and it will look empty, or the steering wheel hub bottom will touch 
these items nd rub and make embarassing rubbing noises.

6)  if you need to drill a hole in the steering column housing to get the 
key assembly out, the instructions say 13mm, or 1/2" (12.7mm) and it is not 
really that critical, since the size if you drill bit will more than make up 
for the extra.  If it would help, I could take some 50k digital pictures for 
the hole that is to be drilled, and what it looks like inside, and why the 
exact measurement and which side of the ignition switch to drill the hole!!

7)  don't throw away anything.  Put anything extra (the shear bolt, the 
extra hex bolt, springs, old key cylinder...  this e-mail!!) in a shoe box 
and lose (sorry, STORE) it in your garage or basement.
