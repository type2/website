When you have the timing at 7 before at idle, pull off the vacuum hose that is
on the inboard nipple of the vacuum advance [the flat side pointing left].

Does the idle speed up?
Do you have vacuum at that hose?

My guess is 'no' to both questions.
Follow that hose forward. It goes to a nipple pointing to the rear on the
throttle housing. That nipple is ONLY there for vacuum retard on the dizzy. If
it is open or the hose is split, you will think the plenum is leaking.
