Subject: RE: [VB] lube it or just go at it dry?

Ronnie, I ALWAYS oil my P/S when I build an engine and I use heavy oil if it
is going to sit on the shelf for any length of time. In all my years of
building engines I have never had an oil burner. But then, I have only been
doing it for 28 years, what do I know!

looking into putting together the 36hp motor for the 57, and I've run into
two different schools of thought. Builder number one(factory trained in
germany many years ago when 25/36hp was what there was) says to oil the p's
and c's when assembling the motor, builder number two(many years experience
building stock and race motors, one of the few local builders who's work has
a good rep) says that oiling them helps make an oil burner out of your motor
and that they are best left dry. Opinions?
