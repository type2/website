I have used 1/4 quart of ATF mixed in the oil that works great , just drain
after 100-200miles or so.

Anyway, one thing that the shop did while the bus was in: they poured a
treatment product in the oil called "Militec-1" to help the valve
clatter (due to the hydraulic lifters).  The shop owner sees tons of
Vanagons and the lifters consistently have trouble pumping up after
sitting around for a few days and leaking down.  He claims this product
is the one thing that really helps the problem.  And I'll be d*mned...
the bus is quiet as ever.  I even had trouble hearing the engine at
times, it was so whisper quiet.  Unbelievable!  That thing had been
clackety-clacking like you wouldn't believe (I have bench bled all the
lifters, some I've done several times), and now... !!!
Apparently, this product is not an oil treatment, but a metal treatment
and lubricant.  Found it on the web, for more info see:
http://www.militec-1.com.  Kinda pricey, but it lasts for 15k miles.
