************************************
Although my listings do not directly say so (I am behind on updates, it's a
constant endeavor,) there are other Bug distributors that can be used on
the 71 Bus.  Here are a list of distributors that are a DIRECT Interchange
or Replacement:

043 905 205D/0231 176 033 - Calif Bug w/Auto 1974
  Note:  Replaces all listed below:
113 905 205AH/0231 167 053 - Bug w/Auto 71-73
211 905 205S/0231 180 001 - Bus 1971
  Note: This distributor came with a "Speed Limiter" Rotor that a regular
rotor can be substituted with.  Both distributors are otherwise identical
in all respects.
211 905 205Q/0231 167 055 - Bus 1971

Note:  There is an error in my 71 Bus listing I picked up on when
researching this reply - The 113 905 205AH is listed as a 0231 167 070
which is WRONG.  The correct interchange is shown above.  It has been
corrected this morning.

Most any Dual Vacuum distributor from other 1600 upright applications can
be substituted as well, keeping in mind that the timing specifications
listed on my site are a "baseline" to start from.  Remember, the "baseline"
specs are for BRAND NEW distributors on BRAND NEW engines with BRAND NEW
carburetors.  Stuff wears over time and so will the "ideal" timing specs.
As an example, my 84 Westy is supposed to be timed at 5 degrees AFTER TDC,
but with 160K+ miles on the distributor, I find that the engine runs better
at 0 degrees (TDC).

84 Westy 2.1

"Xavier"
73 Ghia Coupe
"Denise"
