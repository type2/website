Subject: Rear hatch water leak help needed

On my 76, I have replaced the seal around the rear hatch, for it leaks water
in there when it rains.  After new seal installed, it still leaks on the
flat part between the striker and the engine cover..............I adjusted
the striker to make the door close a little better, and still no luck.  It
still leaks.  Any one else been thru this?
