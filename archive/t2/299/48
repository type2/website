Subject: engine wiring - 76

Hello,

 

I have a 76 bus, and found a disconnected wire in the engine compartment
recently. It looks to be nearly round, with three female connections
within. It is over by the battery, like it is coming from the factory
wiring harness..

 

Thoughts, suggestions....... ?
