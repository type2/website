Hi Gary,

If it isn't the nut, then it's likely to  be worn splines. I have that 
problem with the p/s wiper on my Westfakia, discovering it suddenly in 
a rainstorm on my way back from EveryBus 2001

The good news is that a small shim between the wiper arm and the shaft 
will usually tighten things up enough to get the wiper moving again. 
This will keep you safe on the road until you can find and install a 
replacement wiper drive mechanism. I think we shimmed mine with a piece 
of a matchbook.

The shim is still holding fine almost 2 years later. I'll have to 
remember to buy a wiper mechanism next time I see one at a swap meet.

Happy trails,
