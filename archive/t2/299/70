Subject: Re: [T2] Replace OIl Cooler Seals?

Did you remove the bolt on the left end for the oil cooler support?
Did you remove the alternator support on the right side? The upper end is on a
stud and the lower connects to the heater box.
Did you unbolt the support bracket on the upper bolt of the U pipe and
crossover pipe connection?
