Has anyone seen the bay versions? I was comparing the profile & style
of the vanagon style of country home camper tops & the bus in
question. My sportsmobile top looks exactly like the top of that bus
on the Samba. But the country home camper site didn't have any pics of
them on bays. I was just wondering if this is indeed a CHC top if the
same mold was used for the fiberglass top.
