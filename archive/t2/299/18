i have only heard of one before and there is no guarantee that a PO hadnt
made it themselves (imho). i was thinking of making some myself. if you
like, i would happily make you one, too for the price of supplies and
shipping (how much could shipping foam POSSIBLY cost, anyway?). i was
going to reupholster my interior with different fabric and use the old
stuff (still in great shape) to make the "fill-in" cushions for other
people.

whatta ya think? anyone else want one while i'm at it?
