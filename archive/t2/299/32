Chris,

You didn't say *who* you were getting the carpet set from!

The TMI set that I got for my 78 appears to be ok(haven't installed 
yet)...but!  the two pieces that go under the front seats were NOT
finished correctly and i had to send them back.

The edges on the outside were just bare...took pics and sent them
to a rep at TMI and he said that whoever sewed them had not finished
them correctly.  The other edges very covered/sewn with cloth, just
as I had ordered them.

They sent them back with very rugged looking wide vinyl strips sewn
in...don't know about the fit yet.

I got the impression from all of my phone conversations with the folks at
TMI that somehow they weren't doing a very good job of quality control.

See my previous posts on the subject of the headliner I got from them.

Good luck, dave
