I saw this as well. it was hard to tell anything from it since the
pictures are sooooooo small. But to me it looks like someone took a
sportsmobile (or just top) & put it on a bus then installed a
westfalia interior. I have the exact same style top so I feel pretty
sure that's the origion of the top.
