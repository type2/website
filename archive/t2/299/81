Look carefully at the following picture on the lower right:

As my heater box are not NEW, i slightlty bent the right heater box REAR 
portion of the openning, after the upper plate as been remove. So this 
way i could pull the housing out on the righ side first. When the right 
side of the housing is out enough, you can slide the housing out for the 
left side.

Other stuff you should replace/check when there:
