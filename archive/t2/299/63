damn! i think my problem is more severe than i thought. the metal the
bolt goes through is no longer an enclosed circle, if it ever was (if
not, someone please tell me). the top of the circle is missing and there
appears to be a ring of metal around the bolt, as if the metal the bolt
goes through had broken. i felt behind that wall and i can feel the back
end of the bolt, so i dont THINK tightening down the bolt will do
anything at all. i need to jack it up and remove the wheel to inspect it
better, but from what i could see, it looks like i will have to have
someone weld it for me.

again, how bad/dangerous is it to drive with the shock not bolted at the
top?
