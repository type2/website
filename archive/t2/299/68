Subject: bubbles in fuel filter

It's unlikely a ruptured fuel pump diaphragm will leak fuel into the sump. The
other side if the diaphragm is open to atmosphere, and there is an oil seal
between the push rod for the pump and that side of the diaphragm also.
The most likely path is through the carbies.
As for bubbles in the fuel line (do you have clear fuel line to see it??), if
you have any loops in the line that go up and over something, or have a fuel
filter on it's side, air bubbles can be trapped there as there is insufficient
fuel flow or pressure to remove them, and fuel is not very good at absorbing
the air.
So these bubbles are 'normal' if the air can get trapped their, and will not
cause any problem.
If you say you have bubbles in the  fuel by removing a line and watch the pump
pump into a bucket, then there is a leak somewhere in the system allowing air
in, either a leaky connection before the pump, or as you say a torn diaphragm.
Both of these you will see as raw fuel leaking out some where.
Back to the problem of fuel in your oil. If you run the engine for a while and
turn it off, look down the throat of the carbie and see if any fuel is
dripping inside?
Let us know how you go.
