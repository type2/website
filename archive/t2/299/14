Subject: Re: [T2] Re:70 westy bed ~ sheet size 

Does anyone have or sell or know where I can get a nice corner cushion that
fits exactly into the spare tire hole and comes right up and lines up with
the mattress for my 70 bus with the mustard coloured Westy fabric? I'd sure
love to have one, and I'd pay for it! I really wonder why nobody has ever
marketed such an item, it'd be very popular I'm sure. Tom

 We have a corner cushion like you are thinking of making and just tuck
the sheet under it in that corner since it isn't rectangular.
