Subject: VW Trends confusing quote

In the latest issue (FEB. 2003)of VW Trends magazine in the Nuts & Bolts
feature, a guy writes in asking about the proper placement of vac lines on his
dizzy. VWT writers respond by saying, quote>>"The vacuum canister has 2
outlets, one for advancing timing and one for retarding. The outside outlet is
the retard portion, while the rear outlet (closest to the distributor housing)
is advance"<<unquote.
Uh, wait a minute. Either I am just misunderstanding what the writer is
saying, or he is absolutely dead wrong.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but
the advance port of the vac can is on the OUTSIDE of the can, and the port on
the BACK side of the vac can, closet to the dizzy body is the retard. Right?!
Am I confused? Or is there a guy driving around out there right now with his
vac lines reversed because of WRONG advice from a magazine writer?!?!?
