Subject: Total VW Officially Dead

I got a letter from Total VW a couple of weeks ago (it is 
postmarked 26.03.06 which makes no sense to me) that I have 
been meaning to share with the list. Here is is verbatim 
(typos mine):

==============================================================

Dear Subscriber,

In order that your subscription to this magazine could 
continue, over the past few months we have endeavoured to fid 
a buyer who would take over the publishing of "Total VW 
Magazine".

Unfortunately, we have not been successful in finding a buyer 
and the company that produced Total VW, Jazz (Car) Publishing 
Ltd, has now ceased trading.

In view of these circumstances, it is with regret that I have 
to inform you, we are unable to refund the balance of your 
remaining subscription.

Please ensure that if you pay your subscription by quarterly 
standing order, you must contact your bank to cancel any 
future payments.

Yours truly,
Stuart Mears
Managing Director   

==============================================================

Thanks,
Chris
