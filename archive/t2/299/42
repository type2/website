Subject: re: Turbo Vanagon, Audi 5000 CS Turbo engine for sale: PLEASE

Hello List,

PLEASE MAKE ALL INQUIRES OFF LIST at -  openwhel(-at-)bellsouth.net

   I just came across a relative low mileage ( 87649 miles ) great running,
no smoke, no noise, 1986 Audi 5000 CS Turbo today.
   The body has the usual Audi clear coat paint peeling issues, and I may
part it out. It will depend on if anyone is interested in the drivetrain or
not.
    The engine runs great, the transmission, and final drive are tight. This
would make a very good donor engine to make a Turbo Vanagon, using a KEP
engine adapter kit. The car is very complete with all the under hood parts
available, such as the intercooler, oil cooler, after run water pump,
injector cooling
fan, CIS fuel system, ignition system, etc.
    If your handy there are some other interesting items on this car, heated
outside mirrors, heated leather seats, power sunroof and windows, five lug
wheels ( I'm not sure if they are the same bolt pattern as the Vanagon or
not, what is it 112 mm????? someone know, fill us in)
    Anyway this would solve all the "will the engine hold up to a turbo, or
can I make it work. The Audi engine has always been there strong suit. With
the Kep adapter this is would be a quick project and run like a scalded cat.
Alright cat lovers, I didn't mean anything by that.
    Thanks and remember, information off list.

Marry Christmas,

Howard
