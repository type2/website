Subject: re Westy bedcovers

For our 78 Westy, I cut 2" thick foam to fit both the lower bed and the
upper bed, and then made sewn 2 sided sheet covers for both.  Use
flannel on one side for cold weather use. The upper bed is rather stiff
and this helps increase the cushioning of 50++ yr old hips.  The lower
bedseat has "depressions" where the cushions meet, and the "foam covers"
even this out.  They are stored on the upper bed, simply left folded
out.  Good insulation to keep the heat in!  I believe there are pics
showing these (along with an exstra bed in the center of the van) on my
geocities web site, which I will give to interested parties, as it shuts
down with too many hits at once.
