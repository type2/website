That's the one I was missing. Thanks a bunch! Don't know how I 
overlooked it, but there you have it. I am still going to have to take 
off the exhaust though, as the fan housing won't clear the studs and the 
heat exchangers at the same time. I am nearly to that damn cooler 
though! Thanks again for the help.
