Are you talking about the metal sleeve that should be in the rubber grommet of
the shock? This piece usually rusts to the bolt and then pulls out of the
rubber. New shocks come with the sleeve bonded to the rubber. You would need
to remove the old sleeve from the bolt.

The nut for the upper bolt is a captured nut and is in the gas tank area. You
would need to remove the gas tank panel to get to it. The bolt goes thru the
frame.

Remove the shock completely. Drive without it until you figure out a way to
fix it.
