Subject: Re: [T2] needed: cushion

any of the above. i was going to get the whole cushion so i could make my
own corner pad using the same foam as opposed to trying to match new
stuff to it, plus the vinyl. how much do you want for the corner pad? i
could always examine it to make a pattern for future pads (i had planned
on making them for others, since there doesnt seem to be any place that
offers them). or i could get just the vinyl and match the foam at the
local upholstery shop... so any of those options would work for me... how
much for each of these? is the vinyl new, in stock, available at yer
local upholstery shop? if so, let me know what the manufacturer name and
code is and i can get it here in tulsa. i was planning on reupholstering
my seats and using the old mustard vinyl to make cushions for other
people.

where do you live, karl? i am PLANNING to be at BBB7, so i can plan to
get any of this from you then (thanks for the suggestion, ronnie)

ps~is it really a triangle? or just an odd shaped rectangle?
