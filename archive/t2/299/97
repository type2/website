Subject: Re: [T2] Country Homes Camper?

I have seen the bay ones, but it has been a long time ago. Very few of them
around, even here in central Calif. I do not remember the exact configuration
of the pop top.
If I think about it, it brings back memories of the pent top of a ASI....
There is a CHC Vanagon 6 blocks from me....last time I looked at it was 2
months ago..... and I can't remember how different the top was:)  I know it
says Country Homes across the back edge of the pop top...
