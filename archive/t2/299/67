Subject: Re: [T2] Replace OIl Cooler Seals?

Oil cooler access requires engine R&R. Make sure it's not just the pressure 
switch. Aftermarket type pressure switches do fail all the time within a 
few years. Get a VDO switch if that's your leaker. That would be a 5 minute 
job to replace. It's found just forward of the distributor, maybe a 30mm 
hole with wire and grommet in the tin. If these leak, from below it will 
look like a oil cooler seal problem.

If you don't want to go back in there very soon, then take the time to pull 
the motor and replace all the seals and gaskets. Then you will nix oil 
leaks for a good long time. This assumes your not wasting time on a motor 
with a weak cylinder. Verify the compression balance or you could well be 
back in there too soon. What if the oil leak is actually associated with 
blowby and/or just a clogged breather?? You reseal the whole engine and the 
pressure blows the new seals.
