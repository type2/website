Subject: Country Homes Camper?

I was first inclined to post for this reason alone:

great."

Say again?  Does it have legs?

But I found a way to keep my post legitimate... WHAT is a Country
Homes Camper?  I've never heard of the beast.  It sure looks
interesting,
though the "detail" pics don't enlarge.

Just wondering.  $800 is a good deal, even w/o a motor.  But
hey -
she runs great!
