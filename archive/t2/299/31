Subject: Bus carpeting question.

Hey everybody,

I am going to be getting a carpet set here pretty soon, and want to welcome 
any advice or comments.

I am looking to get the 10pc chicken set for a 74 bus with buckets. From the 
internet pics, these look to carpet the entire interior floor, with exception 
to the two troughs for the brake reservoir and the other for the jack. 
Apparently, they have a 2pc. carpet set for each wheelhouse as well.
Anyone have one of these sets? Do they cover well? Are the edges finished off 
tastefully; moreover, ruggedly? 

TIA for your comments.
