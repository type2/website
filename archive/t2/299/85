Subject: Re: [T2] mysterious rattle

thanks to all who replied regarding how the shocks mount to the body in
my 70 westy. after i take my daughter to day care tomorrow morning (2
blocks from the house), i will jack it up on both sides, remove both
wheels and compare the two. i hope that i can get it back in place until
january when i get my tax return, then i had already planned on replacing
them with KYB gas shocks (someone posted that was what they used on their
69, so i figured, good enough). if you have ANY other advice on what kind
to get, please let me know, and be specific... i dont know anything about
what makes this one a gas shock and what makes this one hydraulic (just
an example, folks). anyway, bus depot lists KYB gas AND adjustable gas
shocks... what is the difference between THOSE two?

thanks again to all who have helped,
chris
