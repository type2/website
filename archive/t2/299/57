A relay should have 2 sources of power to operate correctly. One
straight from a source of power (this is the larger wire usually) the
other is the trigger (this should be the blower switch). make sure
that you have control circuit energized. also make sure that you have
the red lever that controls the heater boxes all the way down. this
activates a switch that must be on for the blower to work.
