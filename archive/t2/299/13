Subject: Re:70 westy bed ~ sheet size 

Chris,
    In our 71 we use "full" size sheets, you know, the ones for a
double bed.  My wife like to use the ones with elastic in the corners.
We have a corner cushion like you are thinking of making and just tuck
the sheet under it in that corner since it isn't rectangular.
