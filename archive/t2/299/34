Ya, sure, verify mechanicals first. Then check that carb. Jet might be 
rolling around loose, float sunk, inlet valve foul, choke hung up, etc. Can 
also be just worn rings all around.

Any grayish color suggests condenscent h2o. Lots of short range driving??? 
Clean the breather and hose and refill tube/cap of the gorilla snot.

Lots of short range driving means your running with the choke on all the 
time and would explain both the gas in the oil and the gray color. In these 
conditions rule of thumb suggestion from the early Bentley is change oil 
every 4 to 6 weeks. I say, monitor often and change at the first instance 
of unusual appearance or smell. In fact, I use my T-II in these conditions 
and I change by inspection always and get 2 months + before the oil goes 
south. That turns out to be but a few hundred miles between changes.

Haven't a clue about the green color. We talking pure dino, or some spezial 
oil.
