Subject: Re: [T2] Re:70 westy bed ~ sheet size ~ FULL! THANKS!

thanks to those who responded... i knew i could count on you guys for
this info. a set of FULL/DOUBLE sheets will be on my christmas wish list
now! it sure will cut back on the number of blankets i will have to carry
with me on all these campouts next year. i have been using blankets as
top AND bottom sheets, which can be rather hot in the summer... then
again, i think i did use a huge flat sheet for the top until it got
chilly. but what i really want is a set of sheets that will match the
decor in the bus (well, the decor i will eventually have...)

THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE~!
