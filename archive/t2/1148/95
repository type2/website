There is The Beetle Barn just off of I-77 south of Cambridge, Ohio.  I went
there quite a few times in the late '80s and early '90s for parts for my '81
Rabbit, no long gone, and my '72 Westy, which I still have.  According to
Bing, it is still there.

I also went to a parts lot called Coynes which was located east of
Kirkersville but after looking, at the satellite pictures, it appears to be
no longer in operation.  It's across US 40 and west of the race track.

Oh Nick, there is/was a big yard in Ohio along one of the more N/S
interstates, perhaps 75 or 71, not 77 I feel.  Perhaps someone knows if it
is still there.  I want to say on 71 between Cinci and Columbus, because I
usually went out US50 and would have hit that road where I was going, it
could be on 77 but I feel it was further into Ohio.  Was visible from the
interstate, to the East right at an exit, had 15-20 buses, 40-50 bugs last
time I passed it (admittedly now pushing 7-8 years ago.)
