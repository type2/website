Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Valve spring - 2 questions

IF it is stock without any wild cam or valve spring geometry screwups then 
all I can think of is a tired/defective valve spring. I would check the 
valve stem keepers though to see if they look good as well as the valve stem 
itself.
The trick you are looking for to negate disassembly is this:
1)Make sure you have the cylinder in question at TDC where both valves are 
supposed to be closed.

2)Lock the engine in place so it can't turn. (Big socket and bar on crank 
pulley nut)

3) Find a compression tester that has the spark plug screw in end and a 
gauge on the other. Remove the gauge and using appropriate fittings like a 
couple of radiator hose clamps, connect the spark plug hole end to an air 
compressor.

4)Use about 60 lbs (might need more) to keep that valve closed. This will 
keep the valve stem up and the valve in place. You will need the type of 
valve spring compressor that uses the rocker arm  like VW used to use. It 
was tool #311S

That's the only way I know of to do it in place. Perhaps someone else can 
help you out with another idea.
