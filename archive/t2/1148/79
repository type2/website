Another problem with the progressive that can appear this way is with failing
engine mounts, when shifting an already iffy accelerator cable setup can get
odd tensions or the engine movement can be jerking on the throttle cable. 
This is worse with Vanagons with their relatively weaker IMHO mounting system,
but can still happen in busses as well.  So if all else fails to correct it,
have a look with someone riding back there looking at the
engine/carb/accelerator cable with shifting.
