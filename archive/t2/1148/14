Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Battery troubles

Brian.. is sounds like you have the relay aux battery +ve connection
connected to the ignition coil..

once you energize the relay .. it holds in and the power stays to the
ignition coil

look at your ignition coil.. and make sure there is only a green wire on one
side that goes to the distributor.. and a black wire that is ign. switch
power.. and possibly another wire that goes to the carb .. if there is a
wire to the aux batt relay,, disconnect it,, test that the problem has gone
away,,  then double check the aux bat relay wiring..
