Subject: bus sitings and waffles

Just got back from another road trip down the west coast from Seattle, WA to
San Luis Obispo, CA and back. About 2400 miles roundtrip. Awesome drive as
always.

Along the way I ran into a couple funny uses of buses (well one is a
Vanagon, but is still funny).

Stopped in at the Tillamook cheese factory in Tillamook, OR. and was greeted
by this just inside the front door:

three drivable micro splitties they tour around.

Driving around in Portland, OR I saw this across the way while sitting at a
stop light: http://voxlux.com/pics/dub/volkswaffle.jpg. They sure do like
there waffles in Portland, I also saw a "Waffle Window", which sold only
waffles out of a window in the side of a building.
