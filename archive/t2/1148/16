Subject: was soundproofing, now insulating....

I've posted some pics of the insulation install on my '65. I used the silver
bubble wrap stuff. As suggested, I came up with a way to make a spacer
between the previously installed soundproofing. I took strips of the
insulation stuff, and doubled it back on itself, and then glued that in
place. Then the insulation went over that. Now I have a small air-gap
between the insulation and the exterior layers of soundproofing/shell of the
bus. The top layers of insulation are held in place with some aluminum tape.

applying the spacer strips to the insulation, prior to install.

http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/786696.jpg - here you can see two
metal panels that were screwed to the body, under the old paneling. I was
not really sure what they were for or where they came from. Originally I
thought they were providing some blocking or support for the pull-out
tables, but the tables were in no way attached to them. Then today I
thought-maybe they were cut out of the bus originally, so they could put
more windows in. One of them is actually painted on one side the original
bus color. What is weird, is that they were clearly cut out of something, I
just don't see where/how.

work

 

I started making some panels today out of a thin maple ply. 1/8". I just put
one quick coat of poly on the back of these panels, to help protect them
from any water damage, should windows leak, or something get spilled. I
think I'm only doing one coat on rear of panels, and three on front.
