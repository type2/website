Subject: '71 Camper for sale

Hello,

I posted a '71 camper for sale today:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=1112030

I am posting on this list only because this camper has a Propex propane 
heater that I bought through this same list long ago ('96 or '97 as I 
recall). Someone on this list organized an import shipment of these 
heaters, and I bought one. It is awesome, worked great, although I haven't 
started it for a few years now.

This bus also has a low miles new from the factory Mexican motor in it 
(broke down in Mexico....)

This bus has been a great companion for many years but the time has come 
to pass him on to someone that will do the work I no longer can.

I'm open to offers a bit lower than the posted price to someone from this 
list that would give him a good home.

Bus is in Portland, Oregon.

Cheers,

Jon
