I was gonna stand on a scale, put the end of the wrench in a vice, then 
push down on the wrench 12 inches away from the end, and watch the 
scale.  The change in the scale reading and the click of when I've 
reached a particular torque setting should coincide.  In other words, if 
I set the reading to 30lbs and it clicks when I've gotten lighter by 30 
pounds, then I know it's right.  I've never tried it, though, as I don't 
have a scale ;)
