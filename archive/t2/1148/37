Subject: Extra parts

Ibve got some extra parts banging around if anyone would like some before
they get disposed.  All you have to do is pay shipping.

Rear backing plate for a b67 and earlier (I believe)

Four or five Brosol 30/31 carbs b will ship as a group

stub axle 68-70

Lots of miscellaneous tin, valve covers, etc.  Tell me what you need.

Cheers,

John R
