Go over them with soapy water and a gentle plastic dish scrubby (the
white ones labeled as "non-abrasive").

Then .... go over them with cheap peanut butter.

Thin paste completely covering the rubber you can see. Let it sit
overnight then use a toothbrush to brush off whatever has dried
completely and a soft cloth to wipe off the rest.

P.S.

Park away from birds, bugs, and squirrels.
