Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking brake fluid reservoir line

Thanks for the ideas everyone. I will have to look at it again as the
hose on the reservoir is clear but underneath the bush where it is
leaking the hose is black. I want to make sure I get a proper hose
before buying the wrong thing. I like the hair dryer idea.

... some of the clear "plastic" tubing found in a hardware store.  The
diameter was too small but using a heat gun, perhaps even a hair
dryer?, I softened the hose and it fit easily, shrinking tightly when
cooled.
