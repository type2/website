That should work as well.  As long as it's not pulling air from the 
outside you should be ok.

While kinda a pain, you could get a second bung welded to one of the 
pipes as well as the end of the muffler and compare the readings.  My 
guess is they'll be pretty darn close.  Just make sure you mount the 
sensor on a downward angle so moisture can't collect in the sensor - 
that'll kill it.
