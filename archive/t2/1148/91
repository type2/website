There is one on The Samba for $55.99 in Colorado and another for $15.00 that
needs a lot of work..  All of the other ones on there are for '74 to '79.

This is the link for the $55.99 one:

This is the $15.00 one:

Hope this helps.

Hi All,
I am needing a Steering Wheel for a '73 Panel van and was wondering if there
was a cheapish one out there?
I am in Winnipeg,Canada and will pay shipping but don't really want( or am
able) to pay $150 to $300.
When I got my van it had a 10" chrome thing put on which I am disliking more
and more every day.
Cheers
