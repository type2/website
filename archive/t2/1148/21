Subject: Leaking brake fluid reservoir line

Hi all,

Just got back from some camping and noticed that my brake fluid
reservoir was low. This is a '71 bus. After refilling it I looked
under the bus and saw a drip begin from underneath the bus. Crawling
under and taking a look I believe the line that takes the brake fluid
from the reservoir behind the seat down to the twin chamber reservoir
has deteriorated. It looks like the previous owner did not use the
proper line and has an enormous hose clamp holding on the line.

Looking at my Bentley I cannot find any reference to the ID or OD of
the line or the proper length. So, what kind of hose do I need and
what size?

Thank you very much,
