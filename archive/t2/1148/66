Hi Max,

Can you explain in more detail exactly how you went about adjusting the 
valves?

....My valve adjustment went
normal until the #3 intake valve. I could not get it adjusted until I
rotated the engine forward a small amount. From 0 TDC to the next
timing mark on the pulley. ... After I
started it up it was much louder than normal. I can hear the valves
clacking. I took it for  a short drive
Thanks for the advice.
