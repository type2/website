Subject: re:Leaking brake fluid reservoir line

Hi Max,

 

Sorry I didn't chirp in earlier. I had a similar problem on my bus, but it
is a '69, so I did not think it applied. But based on other replies, it
sounds like you have the same problem I had on mine last year. There is
supposed to be a grommet between the line from the reservoir and the Master
Cylinder. Mine did not have that, and therefore it leaked. I put one in, and
the leak stopped.
