Yeah, you might try welding two bungs - put one on one of your exhaust 
pipes, and then another on the output of the muffler, as close to the 
muffler as possible, and compare the measurements (they'll probably be 
identical).  Too bad you can't just weld it straight onto the muffler. 
If you knew the internal design of the muffler, you might be able to cut 
it open and weld it in there, but that's probably more of a pain than 
it's worth.

My guess is that welding it on the tailpipe might have slightly skewed 
results at idle because outside air might get sucked back in, but I 
honestly doubt it's going to be an issue - tailpipe sniffers don't go in 
that far and they work fine.  Now, if you want faster response, you'll 
need to move the bung closer to the heads.

Btw, did you order an LC-1 already?
