Owsley Stanley, Artisan of Acid, Is Dead at 76
By MARGALIT FOX
Owsley Stanley, the prodigiously gifted applied chemist to the stars, 
who made LSD in quantity
for the Grateful Dead, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Ken Kesey and other 
avatars of the
psychedelic '60s, died on Sunday in a car accident in Australia. He 
was 76 and lived in the
bush near Cairns, in the Australian state of Queensland.
