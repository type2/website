Subject: Dual Battery troubles

 Hey Guys and Gals,

I have installed the dual battery system from Bus Depot about a year ago.
Last week one of the batteries died. I switched the dead battery with one good
one I had and replace that one with a battery.

NOW, I turn the key on and the engine fires like normal. However, turn the KEY
OFF and the engine still runs!
I disconnected the second battery and the ignition is back to normal.
I don't understand how this could happen, the second is not even connected to
the ignition.

Any ideas? I can not seem to find the schematic for the relay. To
troubleshoot, how this could happen.
