Subject: Charcoal canister question

Hello all.  I'm fixing up my rotted out battery tray on my '78 bus and am
looking at the bottom of my charcoal canister for the first time.  It has a
valve there but nothing connected to it.  Should a hose be run there, and if
so where does it go?

Thanks,
Chandler
