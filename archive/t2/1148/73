Mandy,

Take the simple steps first.

It is most likely your Bowden tube is out of alignment or damaged, which
causes the tube to bite into your clutch cable. Check the Bentley for the
proper adjustment of the Bowden tube offset. If it is OK, adjust your clutch
with the Bentley's procedure. Both are simple DIY procedures, just a little
greasy.

A sign of a bad clutch is usually letting the clutch out in gear and very
little happens, can't engage any gear from neutral or if it grinds going
into gears. To test your clutch, put the clutch in, put the car in 4th gear,
rev the engine to near max RPM's, let out the clutch. If the motor stalls
immediately, your clutch is fine. If the motor spins for a second or two
before stalling the engine, time for a new clutch.

Good Luck,

Jon Stiles
