Subject: Re: [T2] Question about O2 sensor in Vw "flat 4" FI system

Or as an unheated sensor is all of $15 or so (narrow band) you could install
one in each side and just monitor one side at a time, or even one in each pipe
if you were feeling all weld happy.  Now wide band sensors are quite pricey of
course.  Personally I'd install a sensor where VW installed it, somewhere
after the J (Y) tube comes together, which means the out side of the J tube,
or the in side of the cat or extension pipe or whatever you have there.  But
it does go to mention that it is a pretty cool location that far down, so
consider a cheap 3 wire heated sensor ($35 or so), or if you are going
wideband I believe it doesn't matter.  Narrow band sensors do give good info,
cheap, but only very close to stoichiometric, so you have to be in the
ballpark and then they will let you know you are there (sort of as a wide
range of voltage out corresponds to roughly stoichiometric), but they fall off
rapidly either direction of stoichiometric so don't
 give much resolution the further off you are, you can monitor 14.2-15:1 or so
very well, otherwise you just know you are way rich or way lean.  The Bosch
EFI book gives a good description of such or here:

Widebands of course don't make voltage, vary current I think, so you have to
have a control method to provide and monitor (pay someone for one) plus the
cost of the sensors, about $200 for a single sensor and controller most
places.

 Otherwise you can weld a bung on the other side and then swap the sensor and
repeat your testing.
