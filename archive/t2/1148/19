Wow,

Lookin' Good Kevin.

I even put a piece of damplifier inside of my fresh air duct. Be sure not to 
interfere with the diverter mechanism.

Get some before and after sound levels if you can.

All that damplifier should provide some corrosion resistance as moisture 
will  not be able to reach the body metal.
