Subject: help w/ carb linkage parts/issues

Hello fellow VW lovers,
For the past 5 months or so I've stripped my bus (windows, interior, engine,
tranny, etc...) while going through with a fine tooth comb and upgrading,
improving & fixing all the little problems. One area I've been focusing on was
the engine (which I discussed last fall on this list) and so now I've upgraded
to dual carbs on my bus but I've run into two problems that I need help with
(I've been stumped for quite some time now...)

1) I ordered this kit through EMPI
(http://www.empius.com/2010_catalog/empi2010_pg91.html) Type 1 dual linkage
kit Part #43-4410. I was told it would work for my 34 ICT Baby Webers. However
it is missing this important part
(http://www.flickr.com/photos/isaac-tait/5566614127/)
Without this part I am unable to hook up the linkage. I found this alternate
linkage kit: http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=ACC-C10-5993
but I am hesitant to drop more $ on this kit before I try and track down the
parts I need... Any ideas on where I could find this part? I've made several
phone calls and checked with my local shop and I haven't been able to come up
with anything...

2) The throttle arm on my carb is below my engine shroud therefore making it
impossible to connect linkage, once I figure out a solution to my 1st problem.
When I had a single Solex carb I purchased a 2" extension that raised my carb
above my alternator (it was sandwiched between the manifold and the carb). Is
this an option for a single port, dual carb (34 ICT Baby Weber) setup? If so
any ideas on where I can find this part? I would think it would exist as it is
fairly easy to construct (with the right machinery of course)... If there is
no such part I guess I'll just have to by a longer manifold... :(

Thanks for reading this and for any help you may be able to render.

Cheerio,
Isaac T.
