Subject: Re: [T2] oil strainer 9 ft pounds

Like Jim said...   + what I usually say is ,, who cares how tight that bolt
is... just DO NOT overtighten it!!!
use the smallest wrench, ratchet you own...  and snug it up ... then leave
it alone!

if it drips a little oil.. snug it again...    and then never take that bolt
out again!
I am refering to the T4 engine, strainer cover bolt.. that never needs
service because the oil filter does it's job.
that same bolt , overtightened will snap out part of the engine block, so
you have to dismantle the entire engine ....
