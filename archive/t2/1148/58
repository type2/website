Subject: Indicator lights (One side) & Brake Lights down 1970 Bay

Hi All

My indicators front and back on one side only (UK Nearside) of the bus have stopped working as well as the brake lights?

Any simple ideas as to what the culprit is before I start pulling stuff?

I can't find any info specific to this in the archives.

Many thanks:)
