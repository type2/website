Subject: Loud valve train

Hi all,

The adventures of the shade tree mechanic continue.'71 Bus, 1600dp. I
have completed a valve and points adjustment, adjusted the spark plugs
and checked the timing. Oil change as well. My valve adjustment went
normal until the #3 intake valve. I could not get it adjusted until I
rotated the engine forward a small amount. From 0 TDC to the next
timing mark on the pulley. Then the adjustment went fine. After I
started it up it was much louder than normal. I can hear the valves
clacking. I took it for  a short drive and it was very responsive and
appeared drove well but the valve train was loud.

Should I readjust the valves tomorrow from the spot where the #3
intake adjusted properly or just drive with a louder than normal valve
train?

Thanks for the advice.
