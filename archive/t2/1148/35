Subject: Re: [T2] oil strainer 9 ft pounds

I was thinking of building a tool to check my torque wrench. Check me on 
this. I have about 5 mins invested in the design. Haven't built it.

Create a steel bar that is 12" long. At one end weld a deep well socket 
that matches the torque wrench drive size. 3/8" or 1/2" Weld the bar 
into the side of the socket with the open end of the socket fitting into 
a wood block that you clamp to your workbench. When you snap your torque 
wrench into the socket and begin to torque the tool you built, have the 
other end press against a small digital scale.

Am i barking up the wrong tree?

Another idea would be lifting a weight with a pulley. 80 lb weight 
triggers the 80ft pound torque wrench when rotating a 12" arm past 9 
o'clock?

I feel confident that my Asian sourced clicker torque wrench is 
consistent but I have no idea whether it is consistently right or wrong. 
GRIN!
