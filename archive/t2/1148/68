I say readjust the valves one more time and here is a quick way to 
check.  Turn the distributor so it's pointing at the firing position for 
cylinder #1.  If you're sitting behind the bus, adjust the forward 3 
valves on the right/passenger side (1e, 1i, 2i) and the rearmost valve 
on the left/driver side (4e).

Rotate the crank 360 degrees until you come back to the timing mark - 
the distributor should now be pointing at the firing position for 
cylinder #3.  Adjust the forward 3 valves on the left/driver side (3e, 
3i, 4i) and the rearmost valve on the right/passenger side (2e).

Doing this makes it pretty hard to make mistakes as it will be pretty 
obvious if you're adjusting the wrong side, plus it doesn't really 
matter which way you're rotating the crank.  Now, as a sanity check to 
verify your work, turn to firing position #1, check #1 valves, then 
rotate crank CLOCKWISE and check #2, and continue to #3 and #4.  They 
should all be correct per the original adjustment above.
