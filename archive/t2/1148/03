Subject: Broken Valve spring - 2 questions

Working on a 1600 DP, was running great then started making a hell of a noise. removed valve cover to see a broken valve spring. So question 1: Is there anything other than a bad spring that would cause to valve spring to break in half... and Question 2: ARe there any tricks to getting a valve spring back on WITHOUT tearing down the engine and removing the head???

PEACE!
