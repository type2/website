That's the thread that starts with John Baker's message, "Another
VW Bus Concept Vehicle", March 1st.

But honestly, I think this discussion is not only off-topic on 
this list, but it also leads to nowhere.  Volkswagen will never,
ever, again make any vehicle that is comparable to the Type 2
in its simplicity, robustness, or interior/exterior space ratio,
at least not for European or US markets.  The reason is simple:
because they can't, due to crash safety legislation, and because
it wouldn't sell, due to different demands by the customer.

Today, car makers receive flak from the press if a new microcar
comes without ESP, a minimum of four airbags, and airconditioning.
No-one would buy a spartan ulitarian box-on-wheels like the
Type 2 (except for those few enthusiasts who would like one,
could afford one, AND would not rather sink that money into the
restoration or purchase of an original one instead).  Such a van
would be a huge market flop.  And Volkswagen don't do flops,
that's why they're doing so well these days.

So, stop dreaming already, and keep loving and preserving the
Type 2s that are already there.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel, who doesn't even own one :-(
