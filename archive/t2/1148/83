Hey Y'all,
The Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full Moon Bus Club would like to invite you all to attend the oldest and longest-running OVT officially sanctioned Camping Event...
It is the "11th Annual Buses n Boats Bash" event happening in Morrow, Ohio (32 miles north of Cincinnati) this May 20-22, 2011.
The event features beautiful river-side camping, good food, canoeing on the nationally designated scenic Little Miami River (water levels permitting of course) and MUCH more!!
Always fun and always family-friendly, if you haven't attended an OVT campout then you don't know what you're missing!!

P.S.  A big "THANK YOU" to the Kooky Math TEacher, Jamie Auch, for hosting the website and setting it up for us!!!


PEACE!
