Hi Kevin,

Sorry to hear about the material glitches. That old polyurethane does 
yellow. I'm waiting for my oak faced panels on my cargo doors to mellow, 
might be a few more years. The newer water based polyurethane doesn't seem 
to yellow quite so much as the old solvent based, but it is waayy easier to 
use.

As for measuring noise levels, I'm mostly concerned with the driver and 
passenger seats up front. Just drive around and take a look at your meter 
occasionally. That's all I've done. Nothing fancy here. I believe you said 
that you have the Radio Shack unit like mine. You can play with the 
weighting and get results for both A and C. C picks up a lot of the low 
frequency stuff.

Thanks for all the posts! Hang in there!

Chris
