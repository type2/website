Courtney

I wouldn't mind getting hold of a copy of baywindowbusframebook.pdf &
earlybaywindowpartsbook.pdf if possible please.
If you can email them to me I would really appreciate it.

Had a look at jerseylooker.com & couldn't see anything to download, it
was just the front page of the website.
Can anyone shed some light on where to go for the download.

Cheers

Adey

Courtney,

I was able to download it, I uploaded it here
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YUIENAJ1

I have the BaywindowBusFrameBook.pdf and EarlyBaywindowPartsBook.pdf
saved locally now if anyone wants them.
