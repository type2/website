Working on a 1600 DP, was running great then started making a  hell of a 
noise. removed valve cover to see a broken valve spring. So  question 1: Is 
there anything other than a bad spring that would cause to  valve spring to 
break in half... and Question 2: ARe there any tricks to  getting a valve 
spring back on WITHOUT tearing down the engine and removing  the head???

PEACE!

hey John  Take a flat piece of metal about 2-3 in wide and a foot  long. 
put a 90 degree bend at one end, being about 2 inches after the bend..  cut 
you a slot in that end and drill a hole big enough to fit over the rocker  
stud. bolt it to the rocker stud and custom fit it to push the spring  in.  
take a compression tester hose and remove the shader valve. make  this fit you 
air hose. screw into the plug hole with the broken spring.  connect air to 
it, this keeps the valve in place and remove spring with your  new homemade 
spring compressor.   I have also heard using some rope  and feeding it into 
the cly to hold the valve up but this is a PITA and doen't  work as good as 
air  later  mark d



I thought I sent this reply out to all to see, if not I am sorry , I have  
been fixing these broken valve springs like this for some time, if you bend 
it  right you can even do this with the motor in place, type 4 are harder.
