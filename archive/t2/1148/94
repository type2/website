Subject: Ohio VW Junkyard was: Re: [T2] Steering Wheel

Oh Nick, there is/was a big yard in Ohio along one of the more N/S
interstates, perhaps 75 or 71, not 77 I feel.  Perhaps someone knows if it is
still there.  I want to say on 71 between Cinci and Columbus, because I
usually went out US50 and would have hit that road where I was going, it could
be on 77 but I feel it was further into Ohio.  Was visible from the
interstate, to the East right at an exit, had 15-20 buses, 40-50 bugs last
time I passed it (admittedly now pushing 7-8 years ago.)

I'll keep an eye out for anything local that's not junk here in Ohio.
