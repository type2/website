Subject: BayWindow frame repair manual from JerseyLooker.com

Has anyone had any success in downloading this factory manual from that site?
I have tried 3 different browsers and failed with them all. Something seems to
be wrong with the site itself??
Would love to have a copy of this; it's about 63 megs in PDF format.
Thanks,
Courtney
