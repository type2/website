Working on a 1600 DP, was running great then started making a  hell of a 
noise. removed valve cover to see a broken valve spring. So question  1: Is 
there anything other than a bad spring that would cause to valve spring  to 
break in half... and Question 2: ARe there any tricks to getting a valve  
spring back on WITHOUT tearing down the engine and removing the  head???

PEACE!

hey John  Take a flat piece of metal about 2-3 in wide and a foot  long. 
put a 90 degree bend at one end, being about 2 inches after the bend.. cut  
you a slot in that end and drill a hole big enough to fit over the rocker 
stud.  bolt it to the rocker stud and custom fit it to push the spring in.  take 
a  compression tester hose and remove the shader valve. make this fit you 
air hose.  screw into the plug hole with the broken spring. connect air to 
it, this keeps  the valve in place and remove spring with your new homemade 
spring  compressor.   I have also heard using some rope and feeding it into  
the cly to hold the valve up but this is a PITA and doen't work as good as  
air  later  mark d
