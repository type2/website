Subject: VW Informercial

Hi,

For a limited period, I will have this infomercial available to view
or download at my Picasa Web album. I tried to upload it to YouTube,
but it was rejected because it is too long, which I don't understand
because I receive upload notices concerning longer uploads by others.
But they did let me upload it to Picasa Web, but I will only leave it
up until I need the storage because it is over 500MB and the free
storage is limited to 1GB.

The infomercial is called, "In Our Time - Volkswagen Reborn". It's
from the late 90's and features a lot of historical footage in the
segment on the history of Volkswagen. I don't remember much, if any,
bus content as the infomercial is primarily designed to create
interest in the soon-to-be-launched New Beetle and promote the current
water-cooled line.

Video quality is not that great as it is digitized from a 2nd gen VHS
tape, and heavily filtered for VHS noise. I might have preferred more
noise and less color wash on facial tones, but it is what it is. If
you're only interested in content, it's worth the 30 minutes.

Enjoy,
