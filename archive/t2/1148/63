I own that site.  Its coded as if it were still 1993, but it gets the job
done. :)

I've never heard of any others with a download issue.  It just takes a while,
a few minutes maybe. Regardless, I'll look into it.

If your email service allows attachments that large I can just email anyone
the file as well.  Zipped its about 48 megs. Email me and its yours.

Its a neat book, not the end all be all of repair manuals, but there are some
decent measurement pages and some cool pics.  I just noticed the full frame
dimension pages didn't scan too well.  I'll try to re-scan them soon.
