I thought you mentioned that you had them cleaned?  If all the plugs are 
equally carboned, you can probably bet they're flowing about the same. 
Worse case scenario, you'll still be better monitoring 2 than none. 
Otherwise you can weld a bung on the other side and then swap the sensor 
and repeat your testing.
