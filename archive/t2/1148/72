Subject: clutch issues?

Hello,
I recently acquired a 78 riviera camper with a single carb .  In terms
of 
driveability, it is wayyyyyyyyy better than the 71 transporter I had. 
However, whenever I'm changing gears, sometimes it will jerk, bog, and stall. 
I 
really have to finesse the gas and clutch to get the clutch to bite
correctly.  

Does that sound like a cable adjustment issue, or something more
expensive?
Thanks in advance,
Mandy in KY
