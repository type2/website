And as good quality dial type wrenches are available cheap on *bay, no reason
not to have one in 1/4" and 3/8" drive in in-lb.  I'll note as I always do,
having once bought a $200k S-R torque calibration machine for a plant, you
will be amazed at the inaccuracy of new "quality" tools, amazed sometimes by
the accuracy of new Chinese junk, but equally terrified by how bad it can be
on the other end, and there is no way to tell.  Generally I'd trust my best
luck in an unknown case where I have no way to calibrate, to a quality Snap-On
(or other US made top end) dial wrench that appears 20-30 years old, but in
clean little used condition in the case, or an ex military/military contractor
wrench with a recent calibration sticker in clean condition.  Both of which go
cheaper than local (Craftsman) junk on *bay.
 
YMMV.
