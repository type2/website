As a replacement I used some of the clear "plastic" tubing found in a hardware
store.  The diameter was too small but using a heat gun, perhaps even a hair
dryer?, I softened the hose and it fit easily, shrinking tightly when cooled.
Added clamps at the ends for security.  Sorry I don't remember the type of
tubing.  It appears to be working well and it's been on for almost 3 years.

Good luck,
