Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking brake fluid reservoir line

Hi Max,

If your hose is stock, and in not in terrible shape, there is a black rubber 
grommet that insures a tight seal between the hose and the reservoir that 
can deteriorate over time.

The hose itself is no longer available new, though Bus Boys shows it 
available used.

It is possible that the previous owner replaced the hose with something 
else.  You might want to check the hose itself.  If it looks as though it is 
still fitting over the reservoir intake nipple but just leaking, the grommet 
may be all you need to fix the leak.

Cheers,
