Can you explain in more detail exactly how you went about adjusting the valves?

Hi John,

Typical Muir procedure. Adjusted to .006, was normal until #3 intake.
Then I had to move the engine so that #3 intake could be adjusted. At
the normal point I had the adjuster all the way out and could not get
a feeler gauge in.

Oddly, it sounds to me like the 1 and 2 side is loudest.

Thanks,

Max
