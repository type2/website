Hi All,
I am needing a Steering Wheel for a '73 Panel van and was wondering if there
was a cheapish one out there?
I am in Winnipeg,Canada and will pay shipping but don't really want( or am
able) to pay $150 to $300.
When I got my van it had a 10" chrome thing put on which I am disliking more
and more every day.
Cheers
