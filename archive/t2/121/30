Subject: BN2 Heater

I have been looking at several gas heaters and am wondering if the BN2 is
large enough, with a stock heater also working, to heat a bus? I am sure the
BTU output is a lot smaller than the BN4, but with the stock heater would it
be worth installing? If the answer is yes, then how much work is it to
install this type of heater, I believe they came out of bugs.

Thanks,
Corbett
