I have left this ground undone without ill effect on my '71.  As far as I
can tell, I was grounding through the CV joints as well as the clutch and
throttle cables.  Since all of these move/slide/etc. none of them are
reliable grounds.  When I noticed the ground strap hanging I said a bad
word and hooked it up right away.
