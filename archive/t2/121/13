Subject: Heaters

I have a gas heater on the driver's sided shelf in the engine compartment of
my 70. I don't believe it is original equip. because of the hole a PO cut in
the gas tank cover to run pvc pipe to get heat into the bus. I don't even
know if it runs.
My questions area:
1. Can a heater be EASILY installed with the motor in?
2. How do I tell which heater I have?
3. How can I check if the heater works?
Thanks,
Jim
