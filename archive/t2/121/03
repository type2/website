Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Hmmm... The VERY FIRST thing I would do is take off the ground strap from
the battery and clean the bejezus off the body where the ground strap
attaches. And then clean the bejezus off the ground strap. Make them so
shiny you can see your reflection! And then do the same to the negative post
on the battery and the cable. I learned this on my Porsche 911 - which uses
a similar ground strap. Everything grounds through the body but if there is
any flux in the ground strap the entire car starts to get floating voltage
and weird stuff entails. In a carbeurated engine with a mechanical (or no)
choke and a mechanical fuel pump it will screw with the ignition a little -
but the higher amperage of the ignition will usually close any floating in
the ground - just for the spark. But fuel injection - and maybe the fuel
pump - will act whacky without VERY SOLID ground. On the Porsche, the O2
sensor would start sending bad data to the computer and the fuel mixture
will start getting whacky and then the injectors would start mis-firing and
before you knew it you were being passed by VW busses on the interstate.

Unless someone installed some kind of crazy fuel or ignition interrupt based
on the output of your temp sensor (a very dangerous idea), your engine
should run fine without the sensor connected. It kind of sounds like when
you had the sensor connected with the ohmmeter to the ground on the battery
you were giving a better ground connect through the ohmmeter than the engine
was getting through the ground strap - but that's just my guess...
