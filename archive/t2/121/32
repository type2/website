Grease Entire Front end and steering box.
Tune up engine, new plug wires?
Adjust Valves

Check Tires for Wear & Pressure

Along the way, if you have done the above before you leave, oil change,
valve adjustment and check dwell (no need to check timing, it only changes
if the dwell has moved, when you reset the dwell, the timing will be back to
where it is supposed to be) will be all you need to do.

On oil changes, keep to 2,000 miles on unfiltered and 3,000 miles on
filtered engines.  If you have hydraulic lifters and a Compufire ignition,
only oil changes are needed on your trip.
