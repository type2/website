Subject: Re: [T2] Tools, etc.

Based on your list,  (sorry, I didn't see orig qu) I'd include a piece of
plywood about 8' squ to put under the bottle jack or stock jack in soft
soil, 2 hunks of 2x4 for blocking wheels, and consider a jackstand to
"insure" your jack.
   A starter, generator are bulky luxuries- I have a spare alternator, but
then I have 233,000 mi on the original!
Might be just as easy to carry a spare battery.  A complete cv'd axle is
also bulky- if you had clean cv;s, they should last over 200K (from
experience- I changed mine at around 230K only because I had the engine out
to do a clutch disk.  I carry one spare CV joint.  I also carry a 3/4 drive
sliding handle for (1) changing tires with a 19mm impact socket (2) removing
rear drum if bearing fails (3)for removing stubborn nuts on shocks, etc
(4)defense.
