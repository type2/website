This is kind of what I was thinking at first. I was hoping that somebody had
actually tried this method before. I am like you, I am looking for a cheaper
heater. The BN4 is the best bet, but finding one seems to be hard and
expensive. I will continue to look and see what becomes available.

Hi Corbett,
We installed, (well 80%) a BN2 in my '68. Although I don't have it running
yet, my theory is simple. The BN2 should be able heat the rear 'cabin', with
this I can block the stock heat to the cabin, so the sock heat is only
heating the cockpit. I figure the back is roughly the size of a bug (the
source of a BN2) and the cockpit is roughly the size of space the stock heat
was meant to heat.
The advantage to using a BN2 is its size. I have mine suspeneded in the
engine compartment, spanning the space from the spare well, back to the
hatch. This way if I want a dual battery, I still have room, if I need to
pull the motor, I still have room. It's quite convenient in size.
Keep in mind the '68 has an upright 1600 sp with no top access hatch.
The final advantage was price. I grabbed mine from a beetle in a wrecking
yard...$25.
Oh, and these were mounted under the hood, so they were spared from the
elements, grease and oil from the motor, so they are usually in good
condition.

Good luck!
Adam

I have been looking at several gas heaters and am wondering if the BN2 is
large enough, with a stock heater also working, to heat a bus? I am sure the
BTU output is a lot smaller than the BN4, but with the stock heater would it
be worth installing? If the answer is yes, then how much work is it to
install this type of heater, I believe they came out of bugs.

Thanks,
Corbett
