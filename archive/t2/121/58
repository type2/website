Subject: Two simple problems during rebuild solved.


Always something new.

Rebuilt engine sounds great.

When we tried the transmission and put it in reverse the engine died (ok in 
all other gears).

I found out that the backup lights wiring was mixed up on one light.

When I wired them right problem disappeared.  Learned something new, but 
this was weird (to me)?

Next, my son (and then me) noticed an intermitent strange whirring noise 
when running in neutral.

Got bad vibes re: throw out bearing or something.

Then we noticed that the key was still engaged and powering the starter. 
Turned the key back an noise went away!

____QUESTION____  Is there a spring in the key/ignition that I need to replace?

____QUESTION____ Noticed that the turn signal box (four connectors type, 70 
bus) was the cause of the burning smell (scared us to death).
Pulled the sig box and took it apart. Wow, two little coils in it! Cleaned 
off the crud on the back put back in and still smoked. So, would this be 
expected for a sig switch that is bad? Or could it be a wiring problem 
going into the box?

Tinted windshield will arrive April 1.

Many thanx.
