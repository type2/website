Jason,

It has been way too long since I have looked at the rear shocks, so I am
going to pass on comments on those. but...

On replacing front shocks...  the upper mount is a  nut and bolt.  They
are both a standard size and can be replaced if rusty or reused if good.
If they are rusted badly, do not fear... twist until the bolt breaks!

On the lower mount, however.... this is a stud that is pressed into the
lower arm.  Guard that stud with your life!  If you shear it, you are off
to a machinist with the lower trailing arm in hand, after having torn
major bits of the front apart.  it is, fortunately, right out in the open.
This is rust, and all is fair in rust, even thing you would not do in love
nor war.  Hit it with penetratng oil, hit it with heat, even grind major
bits of the nut away, but save that stud!

One other thing that often occurs when you remove the original, 20 year
old shocks is that the inner sleeve from the shock will remain on the stud
or bolt.  Here, again, all is fair.  Oil, heat, grinder, vicegrips, the
works.  Get that sleeve off of there!

When you reassemble the nuts and bolts... I am a *huge* fan of antisieze.
I have not had any van for 20 years, so I can't testify to that, but after
5 it really does wonders when you come to remove a nut!
