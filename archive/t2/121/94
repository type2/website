George and Jon are both correct, thereby differentiating between electric
and electronic :-)  On a carb bus, all the electric does is the ignition
and that runs as long as there is *any* ground.  The secondary is hot
enough to push a spark across a gap, even!  Momentary interuptions might
make it run a bit rough, but probably not even enough to notice.

On FI, tho, the electronic module is right picky about voltages and
continuous power.  Interupt the power randomly every couple microseconds
and you will confuse the heck out of it.

I agree with Jon that some more positive (and easily accessed) ground
would have been a good idea, but again I resist putting extra wires across
the engine-body gap and am generally a lazy SOB :-)  I, too, have thought
of it.  I, too, have not done it.  I am amazed that the EXU does not have
a ground directly to its case and from there to the body, but the PC board
is rather deliberately insulated from the case.
