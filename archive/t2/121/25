 Ah, Neale, while it sounds like a fun suggestion I actaully need some money back on Sid, & besides, I don't think he's that far gone.
When I do create a Boneyard Bus, & despite my wife's ideas I do mean WHEN, it'll be a bus, not a pickup, mainly because the weight is better distributed and I'll be installing my "co-driver" in the back with the obligatory newspaper :-)
After all what's a bus without people in the back.

Vicous against Double Doug? Actually could be a hell of a lot of fun, in the
oollldd ddaayyysss, (late teens, early 20s), I used to race my XT Falcon
against a friend's HR Holden, around his suburban back yard ( after I taught
him to drive & drift rear wheel drive cars around tight circuits ), most fun
I ever had in a car (yes, THAT included). Got enough room in the paddock to
map out a circuit, Andrew? ( Of course, you DO have an unfair advantage, you
have an engine & transmission for SID ;^)

we're talking serious junkheaps that have some big rust problems or chassis
warping being welded up in a rather ugly but functional manner for some
good, not so clean, wholesome fun.
