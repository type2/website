Subject: '70 Tranny upgrade


Is it true that later bay transmissions can be used in early bays with
upright engines, with a change in bellhousing and chopping some off the
input shaft?
If so, what years would be appropriate?

I want to get a taller gearing for the new, bigger than stock engine I have
built.
Any suggestions appreciated.

Thanks,
Will
