That's why the comment about posi-traction was made with a smirk.  I don't
know what part of the country your from but, up north we know about what
happens when one of the driving wheels loses traction (up in the air).
That's what posi-traction/limited slip diffs address.  Enough on the
mechanical side.  If your concerned about a tragedy, I'd say don't try it.
Course it's up to you.  Maybe you'd feel more comfortable standing next to
the bus and just listening near the wheel with the partner inside.  Allows
you to test which side is the offending side at least.

Good luck and be careful,
Bill

Sounds a little hairy.
