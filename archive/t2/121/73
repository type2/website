I can't remember, what does the bus CV have under the CV bolts; 1 washer per 
bolt or the special "double-bolt washer"?  Either way, if you don't have the 
proper washer under the bolt (especially on the outer CV), the bolt is too long 
and will hit something.  

Sorry about the vague description, but it's the best I can do without crawling 
under there and looking.
