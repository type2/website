This is rust, and all is fair in rust, even thing you would not do in love
nor war.  Hit it with penetratng oil, hit it with heat, even grind major
bits of the nut away, but save that stud!

Another tip: After soaking in P B Blaster (my preference, YMMV),
try putting a socket and breaker bar on the nut and giving it a
goodly rap clock-wise before attempting to loosen it.

You're chucking the shock anyway; cut the ring surrounding the
rubber on the shock to remove the shock from the stud. This 
gives you clearance around the nut for a nut-buster if it comes
to that.
