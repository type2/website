Hi Dave, Simon and other distinguished experts,

I  am seriously in need to install a Cyl. Head Temperature sensor & =
reading gauge since my '75 bus' engine gets hot easily, up to 165-170 F  =
(oil sump heat sensor) on a hot sunny day in bumper-to-bumper traffic =
here in Jakarta, and I heard  that a CHT is the most accurate temp. =
reading & highly recommended by the experts...  Therefore I would =
appreciate it if anyone could describe to me a clear step-by-step =
instruction on how to install a CHT sensor & gauge.

To address that heat problem, I am also thinking about installing a =
second external oil cooler,  would it be a good idea?

Thanks in advance and I'd love to hear any responses....
