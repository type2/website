Sorry Glen,

I really need to give the Type2 folks more credit. I just came from the
Porsche world and there are some real nin-com-poops over there (one guy who
was afraid to check his oil with the engine running - in the 911 you can
check it buy turning off the engine and running back real quick - but come
on - the dipstick and oil fill nozzle are over the oil reservior and away
from the engine a bit - just tuck that yuppie noose into your shirt and
reach in there!).

I just saw a combination of things: corvair engine and indecision between a
dead battery and a seized engine as a warning sign. Oh yeah, alot of the 911
clueless folks buy exotic variations too.

My fault, I guess, was thinking the fan belt and alternator were separate on
the corvair engine. Now I see that it is one - just the the VW upright and
the 911!

My hat is off to you for driving a corvair powered bus of unknown quality at
3am!

P.S. I posted this to the list becuase I posted my 'roast' to the list
originally.
