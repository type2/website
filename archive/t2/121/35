Subject: Re:grounding engine/trans

Quoth Steve Dolan:
...the one (ground)everyone neglects because it is
hidden is the trans to chassis strap.  The amazing thing is that this is
the only dedicated ground connection between the engine/trans assembly and
the body (and battery)! ........
    Then all you'd need for insurance is another ground wire piggied from
the battery negative to the engine?  BTW, didn't the "brain" (MPC) have its
own ground wire?
