Whooooo!

Nemo, you sound like you are in the same mood I was in yesterday!!<grin>.

No, I don't want it to ride or corner like sh*t.

The whole point was to corner and ride better without the vast expanse of=
=20
rubber between the rim and the road.

If load range "d" means stiff sidewalls then how about 50 series
tires with a good load rating.  The idea was hug the ground with some=20
serious rubber on the ground.

In case nobody noticed, some of the tires previously mentioned as good are=
=20
marginal on a 5.5" rim and specs say they should be on a 6" and up.

Just trying to do a little better and get a little more rubber on the=20
ground.....and no....I'm really not into thumper speakers, but I am sure=20
considering a reverb as a period accessory<grin>.

Cheers, dave
