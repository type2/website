Paul,

Describe "clunk"...not? clunk, clunk, clunk...but just clunk?

Jack driver side rear up after putting large wheel chocks on every other 
wheel....put car in 1'st at idle....assuming you haven't installed 
posi-trak<grin>.

Have a helper in the car when you do this and be ready to apply brakes.

Listen for clunk.

Cheers, dave
