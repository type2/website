Having never had the trans out of my bus, I didn't realize there was another
strap! This is EXACTLY the same as the strap on the 911! For some reason, I
was assuming there was another contact point between the engine and the
chassis and there wouldn't be the same strap.

The FAQ for older 911s pretty much starts off by suggesting a good sanding
of the firewall where the ground strap connects for 99% of your problems.
This kind of grounding makes for simpler electronics (i.e. one wire run
everywhere instead of two) but makes that ground connection critical!
