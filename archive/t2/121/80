Subject: Re. electronic ignition

FWIW- I've had my bus for 3+ years and 20K miles and never even thought 
about the Compufire that came in it- absolutely trouble free and provides a 
good strong spark every time, even if she hasn't been run in a few weeks.  
The PO was always messing around with points and finally broke down and 
spent the $50. Probably the best $50 he spent :)


I'd say go for it. I don't know what is involved in installing it but my 
understanding is that it isn't that hard.  Compufire, Petronix is another I 
think.

Happy Bussing
