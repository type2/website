Subject: Transmission problems

Hello all,
 I was going down th eroad the other day and went to down shift into 2nd and
it seemed that it just dissapeared. I went back into 3rd and pulled over to
see what the deal was. It would not go into any other gears except 3rd.
Its like 1st , 2nd ,and reverse are just not there and i can almost get it
into 4th but it stops just short of engaging. I checked the shifter and it
is fine and i replaced the copler at the hockystick but the problem still
remains.
The bus is a 1975 westy
anyone have any ideas??
Thanks in advance.,
Bryan
