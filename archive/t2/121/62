I run a pertronix points eliminator in my 78, haven't noticed any change
for better or worse vs points, I haven't had any problem with em either,
but I do carry a set of points with me anyway...only reason I put em in
was "I just don't like setting points"  with the way the hatches and dizzy
are there just never seemed to be an easy way to see in there and get it
adjusted right so finally said "to heck with it" and spent the $$ to
replace em, same reason I run hyd lifters too.  maybe lazy I don't know
but I don't like phutzing with stuff like that.   

YMMV
