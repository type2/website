Dave, 
I apologize for the time discrepency, The last time I
made that Drive it was in a 65 Kombi that my friend
and I picked up in Deckers which was running on three
cylinders, no working gas gauge, only one headlight,
at 5:00 in the morning, good thing my friend only paid
$200 dollars for this bus. Time really wasn't on my
mind on that trip.
Thanks,
Tyler
