Subject: electrical woes (turn signal problem)

I pulled a bad flasher (electrical) out to replace it with a new one 
(mechanical (?)).  When I turned on the turn signal w/ the new one.  It 
didn't work properly, and a wire coming from the flasher got real hot, 
smoked a little and i cut the juice.  The same has happened with a heavy 
duty new electrical flasher, it got so hot,the insulation melted off of the 
wire.  The only flashers that have worked have been 1) a 12v electrical 
relay that was on when i got it, and has since quit working.  And 2)a bad 
spare I had which is the mechanical type, a 12V with the number 565.  I've 
tried replacing it w/ the same thing but with the number 550 on it.  The 550 
gets the wire hot. and  they don't function properly.  I have noticed that 
with the ones that don't work right.  You can hear them flashing when no 
turn signal is on.?
I'm not a smart electrical guy.  And i'm totally baffled. please help me 
out.
Thankyou-
Keith
