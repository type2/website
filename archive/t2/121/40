Yup, and I have seen this. It is not a bad test if you think this may be a
problem, but I prefer to do it as the factory did.  Extra wires make
pulling the engine more of a PITA than it usually is.  There is nothing
like discovering some extra PO-installed wire with the engine half way
down.

Yes it does, three of them as a matter of fact. but the "feed" for those
grounds are wires that connect to lugs the engine case under the intake
plenum. If the case is not grounded, the FI is not grounded.
