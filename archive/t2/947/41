I don't know.  VW seems to be in a death spiral, at least in the US.  Our
local VW dealer just closed its doors, and if they couldn't sell VWs here
in an "upscale" bedroom community I don't see how they could sell their
present line anywhere.  No great loss, as this dealer had never sold an
aircooled VW.  The building will be taken over by the adjacent Nissan
dealer's used car department.

VW's new management would be well advised to remember exactly what the
initials "VW" stand for.  I doubt that they will pay much attention,
though.
