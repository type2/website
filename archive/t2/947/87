You should check to see that the distributor drive gear is set correctly in 
the case.  It's been too long since I removed the drive dog from the bottom 
of a distributor so I can't remember if it's possible to install it 
improperly, but I'd guess if you *can* install it improperly that it'd be 
180 degrees out, nothing like 25 degrees.

Here's my guess: the distributor drive gear is set improperly.
