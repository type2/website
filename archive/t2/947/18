Subject: Digital VOM

Hi Bus pilots,

I was wandering around in a local Sears about a week ago and noticed a
digital VOM that included dwell and tach readings.  It's by Actron, I think
this is the one

As I get older it's harder to read my analog meters and I thought this just
might be the ticket at $60 US.  Do any of you have this and if so, does it
do the job?
