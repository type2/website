There is no way to know without a bit more research. Here are the facts:

1. Owners selling VW buses (and other things) have been known to lie,  
and many are frequently just ignorant.

2. 1972 VW buses sold in the U.S. had 1700 motors, but had 1600 dp  
uprights in other countries. The VIN of the bus in question would  
help to settle the matter.

3. Unless the modification was done by a genius of a sheet metal guy,  
it should be fairly easy to tell whether the corresponding cooling  
tin is original or was hacked into place. If you know what to look  
for, you should be able to spot it easily. If not, find someone who  
is familiar with one kind of engine bay or the other.
