Same experience here.  I could not get the bulb holder
to stay attached to the rear body.  I drilled the
lens/
reflector mounting holes all the way through.
Longer bolts and fender washers hold it all together.

It's a pita when a bulb burns out because the door
panel or battery might have to be removed for access.

A few years ago put bulb holders and wiring to the
front doors.  IIRC the amber reflectors faded out and
were replaced.  Right now I have a mixed set on the
car, made up of Indian repros and OEM Hellas from the
junkyard.
