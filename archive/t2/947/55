Cool Drive-in tricks (this dates us)
1. Pop off the rearview mirror and sit in the back (of camper), parking 
the bus at the right angle to see the screen.
2. Park BACKWARDS with the rear hatch open, pull out the bed (perfect in 
a full width 74 bed) and chain up or prop the the seat section up at a 
good "couch" angle- we had an eyebolt in each upper side to allow this 
with chains going to the brackets under the seat segment; good while 
driving for "safer" sleeping back there for kids.
3. In our 71 my FIRST Pod over the roofrack was a box where the top Was 
hinged in the center and angled in front so when tou folded it back, you 
had a great seat with backrest.  For parking in last row only!
