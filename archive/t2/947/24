The dwell _time_ naturally changes with points as the RPM increases 
(the points are closed a shorter period of time, because the 
distributor shaft is going faster.) The dwell as commonly measured 
(degrees of distributor rotation) doesn't change, since that measure is 
unrelated to RPM or time.

If we look a a simple case (4 cylinder engine, 45 degrees dwell, which 
means the points are open/closed equally): 1200 engine RPM = 20 revs 
per second = 10 distributor revs per second. 4 disty lobes = 40 firing 
cycles/second = 25 milliseconds per cycle. The dwell _time_ is half 
that - 12.5 ms - that's how long the coil is energized for each spark. 
Run the engine at 3600 RPM, and the dwell time is cut to about 4 ms.

I suspect with the Pertronics "variable dwell" feature that what 
they're doing is opening the electronic "points" for maybe 2 ms, plenty 
of time for a good spark, and charging the coil the rest of the time, 
so at 3600 RPM, you're still charging the coil for perhaps 6 ms, so you 
get more energy into the coil for each spark.
