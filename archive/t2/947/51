Subject: Re: [T2] review of "Little Miss Sunshine" also "Cars"

"Cars"  played at High Country Bus Festival last year.  It was 
obviously a bootleg because it hadn't been released on DVD at that 
time.  It was a large (projection?) screen (measured in feet rather 
than inches) and the quality wasn't stellar, but it sure was fun to 
watch it with a bunch of like-minded people.

I'm guessing the theater was rigged up by the Tennessee Mechanized 
Division of the Full Moon Bus Club.
