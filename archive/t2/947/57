I have the consumer DVD and it is quite viewable on the small
screen.  Only a few scenes really beg for a big screen.  The DVD has both
widescreen and pan-and-scan version of the movie.  It was well-received at
the rather chilly screening at BBBXI

I haven't seen this in the theater, but the DVD is a howl.  The bonus
features include footage about the research that the makers did along
Route 66.  You won't look at Amboy the same way again!
