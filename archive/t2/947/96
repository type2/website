Just to clarify:

 TDC = TOP DEAD CENTER (Mark corresponding to Zero on the pulley)
BTDC = BEFORE TOP DEAD CENTER (Marks corresponding to numbers located counter-clockwise on the pulley)
ATDC = AFTER TOP DEAD CENTER (Marks corresponding to numbers located clockwise on the pulley)

And then you said:

As for my motor, the idle timing is 7.5 degrees After-Top-Dead-Center at 800 RPM (Revolutions per minute). The
centrifugal advance works like it should and progresses the timing to 28 degrees After-Top-Dead-Center at 3000
RPM.

After David said:
 "Sounds to me like you have BTDC and ATDC confused... possible?

 Regardless, if you are not getting any advance and are seeing 28 degrees
 BTDC all the time, it's no wonder your engine feels sluggish.  When the
 advance kicks in, I suspect your power will return."

You define Before and After correctly.

But when you get to the part about reading your timing with a light, again you have it reversed.

In order for your engine to be giving the timing results you are stateing, your engine is running
BACKWARDS!!!!
