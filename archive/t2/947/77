Not really.  Your new engine is much tighter than your old engine.  If 
it were summer time you might have
also found that your new engine ran hotter, for the same reason.  
Continue to break it in, when you get about
500 miles on it run it hard.  You should then start to see improvement 
in both power and fuel economy.  They
should continue to gradually improve over the next 2000 miles.  That's 
my experience, anyway.
