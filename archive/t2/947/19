I have this exact meter, bought at Pep Boys for about that price.

I have a couple issues.

1. The HOLD button sticks under the housing sometimes, making it look
like the thing is frozen. It's not, just bump the HOLD button to
release it.
2. It requires you to buy a 9v battery. It says NOWHERE on the
packaging that you need to do that.
3. I'm having concerns with the Ohm meter functions. It's telling me
the resistance on both my blue coil and the stock black and orange one
is 8k. Before I replaced the battery it said my blue was 2.7k. The old
battery was fine.

The tach and dwell meters have been perfect though.
