	yes I would resent that if I were yet to see the film.  I was 
assuming we'd been about the last in line to get the movie, i.e most 
elsewhere would have seen it already if they were ever going to.
	But it was a v good summary of the characters, and I thought 
the moral assessment was fine.

	It wouldn't matter to more than a tiny fraction of the 
audience, but I thought the generally suave body was difficult to 
reconcile with the side door's coming off.  But maybe it had been 
face-lifted by MarioResto.   ;-)
