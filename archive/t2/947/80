Well, the Bopmobile tried real hard to let me down today.  She's been running great and the last time I put oil in it was last month in Gulf Shores.  I did accidently over-fill it by about a half quart.  So this morning it was really cold, low 20's.  I had trouble keeping her running long enough to rev it up enough to where it would idle without dying.  Well, she finally wouldn't start at all.   So I figure I've flooded it.  Don't know that I've ever had that much trouble getting her started.

So, I let it set for a while and try again.  Started right up.  So I let her sit and idle for a while to warm up.  Loaded up my dog and hopped in.  Just down the street it's like she's starved for gas.  So I check the fuel pump and it was softly ticking away.  This Autozone pump has outlasted any other I've had and it's extremely quiet.  Then I checked the fuel filters which had not been changed since I had the tank removed and boiled out a couple of years ago.  I have checked them periodically, however.  One did look like it didn't have much gas in it so I changed it.  Started her up and same trouble.  After several tries I got her limped home at which point she starts running perfectly.  I guess I hadn't run it enough to fill the new fuel filter.  What's weird is that it is the filter on the outbound side of the pump that clogged up.  

So when I ran my errands and got back, I checked the oil.  Quart low.  And I just checked it a couple of days ago.  Then I notice the drip marks where I had backed out.  I followed them all the way down the road to where it failed the first time and sure enough, a puddle.  So now I have to find the leak.  What a freakin' drag.  Why does everything happen all at once with these kraut boxes?  

Note to self:  Change fuel filters whether they need it or not.  

Grrr....KR
