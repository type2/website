Subject: Ambiguous description (was: read side marker light source?)

Ron,

I like your company a lot, and I've done thousands of dollars worth  
of business with you (I don't think that's an exaggeration), so what  
I'm going to say is (a) friendly criticism, and (b) based on plenty  
of experience.

Your descriptions are ambiguous. I don't know about this one,  
particularly, but in general you have to be a pretty well-informed  
buyer to use your website.

The best way to put it, I think, is that your site is a lot like the  
cars and buses for which you sell parts: it's spare and spartan, and  
it's not for everyone.

I don't know whether you lose any business because of your site, but  
when someone on the list says that a description is ambiguous, the  
chances are that they are right. It may be self-explanatory to you,  
but not to everyone.
