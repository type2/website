	I'm just a little further along in the same process on the 
same motor.  At 100 mi I said just the same.  But now at several 
hundred I'm still gaining power.
	The prime rule for running-in (what I gather is termed N. of 
the Panama canal 'breaking-in') is never let it labour (lug).  One 
way to put this is that the throttle should never be much wider than 
corresponds to steady running at the revs at the time - don't open 
the throttle far ahead of the revs.
	 But I'm of the school of thought that the 2nd rule is 'if 
you run it in fast, you get a fast motor'.  You have to let it spin 
up towards 4000rpm or it will never minimise friction by wearing down 
the micro-high spots on many rubbing surfaces.  Stand ready while 
doing this to stomp down the clutch (and take you foot off the 
throttle) if you feel the motor suddenly tightening.
