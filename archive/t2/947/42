They're going to be the same Indian repro's no matter where you buy them, as
there is only one manufacturer. (Other than the fabled Chinese ones from
Empi, which I have yet to see; the last ones I saw from Empi were simply
relabeled Indian ones.) 

This link shows all your options. (How are the descriptions ambiguous,
incidentally? They seem pretty self-explanatory to me, and include pics.
Just wondering.)
