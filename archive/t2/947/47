To All,

I do enjoy writing "fables" and the like, but I'll clear up this one.

My mistake, the "China" script is cast into the white(ish) plastic of the
lens housing, not the lens itself. 

Next time I start to care, I'll photograph it. But I have to warn all of you
I only have 600 speed black and white film and shoot with a 2000x telephoto
lens; so it may look like a plesiosaur. In fact now that I think of it,
maybe the casting said "Made in Scotland"...

They are of strange quality than really poor quality (I have received some
much worse stuff over the years). I have 6 sets of lenses (don't ask me why)
and I broke 2 of them drilling out the "clips". All of the bases vary in
finish and shape. The foam-like seals were all crappy, but the lenses were
acceptable and are all shiny and reflecty[sic] which probably matters most.

If you mix and match your old parts with the new lenses, you might be happy.
