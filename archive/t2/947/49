Subject: Re: [T2] review of "Little Miss Sunshine"

We got a screener DVD this week and watched last night on our small TV.
This is the 3rd time I have seen it, twice in a theater.  NO WAY is 
a DVD  the way to watch, and with only one of us a  VW-enthusiast. 
Thanks goodness for that DRIVE-IN this summer. Hey, that was FUN!

Go see with a bunch of VW-friends  and have a great time, else you 
might think it is just a disfunctional family, with questionable 
bursts of comedy.

Has anyone seen DVD of "Cars"? does it stand up?
