I have not been at all happy with the unit I bought on sale at Sears a few years ago.  In some modes, it almost never wants to stabilize.  Just jumps around like crazy.  I don't know when it started doing that but it's not worth fixing.  Thanks for the advice about the Actron.  Might try one of those.  For me to spend $250 for a Fluke would be a, well..    Cheers....KR
