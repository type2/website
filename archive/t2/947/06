Jim,

 

No disrespect, but my lenses came in EMPI packaging and say "made in China"
cast into the lenses. I purchased them last year. They are crap which what
is important.

 

I will have to disagree (or agree to disagree with you). The high cost of
manufacturing is a myth and the L.A., Detroit, Pittsburg and Texas based AFM
manufacturers perpetuate it to keep themselves in business.

 

10K units minimum is ridiculous for a niche market item and is highway
robbery. You can shop around and find excellent low-volume rapid prototypers
that work straight from your computer models. Injection molding and plastic
vacuum fusing is now commonplace and considered a simple process. The myth
of overseas manufacturing is just that, a myth. Small American companies
excel in making small-batch niche market parts. 30K is acceptable if you
actually want 10K lenses (3.00 a lens), but most hobby manufacturers know
that is just not possible to push that many items. So they don't put that
kind of requirements on their clients.

 

I know we are a threshold of old-tech vs. new-tech. I don't mean to sound
like a know-it-all jerk, but it really irks me when this myth comes up. 

 

Again, no disrespect intended, but that is what is currently happening in
the market. Just go take a trip to SEMA this year and it will become very
clear.
