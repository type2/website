No, you want the spark well before TDC, because the spark takes time to  
fully
ignite the air-fuel mixture. The faster the engine runs, the greater the  
needed
advance, as higher engine speeds means less time to achieve full  
combustion.

7.5 degrees BTD at idle increasing to 32 degrees at highway speeds
is a normal range.
