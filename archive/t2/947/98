Karl, aren't you familiar with the '70 one-year-only reverse running engine?
They were a special-order European only model that only runs below the
equator... grin

:) LOL at myself.

OK, I am thinking correctly but communicating incorrectly. Damn reverse
facing engines...working on my Jeep recently has gotten me cross-eyed.

Advancing the timing means pushing the spark further before TDC. The advance
timing is represented by the BTDC marks.

Retarding the timing means pushing the spark further away from TDC. This
timing is represented by the ATDC marks.

Ugh. 

The good news is that my brain takes over when I work on my vehicles. The
bus is timed correctly.
