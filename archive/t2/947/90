 Karl, one person's "bone stock" is another person's "modified". :)
 
 Good point though. What I mean by "stock" is there have been no
 modifications in displacement, exhaust and intake.
 
 My baseline is for a '71 model bus, since dual port heads, PICT 34 carb,
doghouse cooler and alternator are used. The other difference is a SVDA
dizzy with a Hot-Spark pickup.
 
 28 to 30 degrees is a safe total advance for the motor as researched.

Is that 28-30 degrees total with? or without? the vacuum advance hose connected?

Hopefully it is WITHOUT!

Do you have a degree pulley on it?
