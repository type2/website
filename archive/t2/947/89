Yup, this sounds like exactly what happened to Chris at Busted Bus recently
with a 78 Weekender. It will "sort of" run the way it is. Just turn the
drive gear 180 degrees and it should bingo. Don't bother with the plug wire
swap. Theoretically it will run with the wires reversed but you are right,
the vacuum can gets in the way. Keep the hot-spark though, it is worth it.
