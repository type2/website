I'd absolutely welcome any such feedback!  Please don't hesitate to p-mail
me. I can make web changes almost immedately. 

Although in this particular case, I'm not sure that most people would find
the description confusing. Stating that a tire is COMPATIBLE with stock VW
rims (a useful piece of information) is not the same as saying that it
INCLUDES those rims.
