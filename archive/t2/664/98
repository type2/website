Subject: RE: [T2] Degreasers

Castrol degreaser in the purple bottle works extremely well, and is
inexpensive
(http://www.acehardware.com/sm-castrol-super-clean-cleaner-degreaser-12-pack
--pi-1451528.html and available in gallon sizes). Wear gloves if you use it
full strength or you'll regret not having done so within five minutes. Safe
on metals.
