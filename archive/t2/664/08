Here's my experience:

Me "I'd like to check the status of my order."

CB "Have you ordered with us before?"

Me "Yes, that's why I'm calling to check on my order."

CB "It should ship any day."

Me "When did I place my order."

CB "Dec 1st."

Me "When I ordered, I was told it was in stock and I need it last week."

CB "Hold on."

- another person comes to phone -

CB "Richard, I'm sorry when you placed the order I thought they were in
stock".

Me "When will you have them?"

CB "I won't know until Monday."

Me "Please cancel my order."

CB "Allright. We'd credit your credit card."

Me "You charged my card before checking inventory?"

CB "Sorry about that."

Moral of story. Thank goodness for Bus Depot, Bus Boys, Go Westy, CIP1,
German Supply, OEVeedub, Busted Bus and The Bus Co.
