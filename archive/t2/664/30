Subject: friday topic - TEST - Tires - wheels - fuel lines

I propose that we have a test of about 50-100 questions that each member has to complete each year to remain a member... 

Questions about fuel lines, bolt patterns, tire specs, oil specs, etc. 

Fail the test and get the boot... 

<JUST KIDDING!>

I think I hide before I get the boot... again and again and again....
