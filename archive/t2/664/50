Except those don't mention any sort of cold junction compensation which is
what's needed to stabilize the readings.

Something like the "Remote Data Acquisition Computer" used with this "full
service" unit (scroll down or search for RDAC):

I'd like to see one of these designed for automotive use with the CHT, Oil
Temp, Oil Pressure, RPM (tach), Fuel Level, voltmeter, and Fuel flow
gauges. Drop the altimeter functions (or keep them for the "neat" factor).

And here's another with fewer "features" that would work well in an
automotive capacity. It also uses a RDAC with cold-junction-compensated
inputs for thermocouple type senders.

I like the simplicity of this one.
