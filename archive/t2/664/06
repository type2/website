Subject: Gas in my oil

Can anyone help an ignoramus figure out why I keep getting gas in my oil?
Also it comes out in fine droplets from the breather cap (I think that9s
what it is).  The black cap with thick rubber hose that originates near the
fan shroud and puts exhaust back in front of the throttle (between the air
meter and throttle).  My plugs don9t get oily.  Also is this something to
worry about?  Thank you listees.  BTW its a 79 FI 2.0 AC Wedge.  Can9t
figure out where or why gas and oil would come in contact.

One more question, water coming from the exhaust?  I know lots of cars do
this but now that it9s getting cold, mine does it and never used to.
