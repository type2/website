From andy:

 arnaud
just today. I discovered that I stashed an oil bath cleaner from a 68 that
I got for parts a number of years back.
 
 I think it correct for a 71 as well. Someone please confirm this.
If you can and will use it I will send it to you.

68-70, the warm air flap is cable controlled from the right flap.

71 is one-year-only, the warm air flap is thermostatically controlled.
