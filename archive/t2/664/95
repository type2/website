Subject: CA smog

The big automakers have filed suit to prevent the new CA smog 
legislation from going into effect. Their argument is that emissions 
standards are federal jurisdiction. The suit only questions the higher 
standards for new vehicles, but it is possible that if the prevail -- 
not a sure thing -- the end of the 30-year exemption could go down with 
the rest of the legislation.

Don't spend your smog equipment money on beer yet, but this law is not 
a done deal.
