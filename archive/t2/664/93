Subject: Degreasers

I've found that the most effective (and cheapest) water-soluable 
degreaser for both parts and hands is liquid Tide (the blue stuff), 
full strength. More effective than the citrus-based cleaners, 
unfortunately. Rinse with water and dry.

But I've noticed that the stuff seems to react with some metals if they 
are soaked in Tide diluted with water. Haven't fully catalogued which 
metals, though.

Does anyone know more about this? Is there anything more effective? 
(Other than TSP and solvents.)
