I have not investigated any of the products shown here. If none of
them are satisfactory, I have a friend here in Red Bluff who is an
aircraft mechanic. He also builds Type IV for aircraft on the side. I
asked him about better CHT for VW. He said he could get them for me
but were hundreds of dollars. If interested I could get his
recommendations.
