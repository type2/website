Subject: Hard Starting - Update 5

Hi Folks,

I got a new battery and a new hot-start relay, hooked them up, and got 11 
volts at the gauge.  However, the battery tests at 12 volts when out of the 
car.  Switch on the ignition, and voltage drops to zero in about 2 seconds.  
Switch on the radio or lights, same thing.  All fuses are good, battery to 
starter cable is new, ground strap and terminal are new, battery is fully 
charged -- twice.

So, something is drawing voltage and keeping the electrical system from 
functioning normally.  It now requires a full diagnosis of the electrical 
system and replacement or repair of whatever parts are malfunctioning.

It's difficult to do this kind of work outside in the cold weather, 
especially with daylight as short as it is.  If this Bus was a second 
vehicle, I'd put it away for the winter and get back to it whenever I could. 
  However, this is my daily driver, and I need reliable daily transportation 
during the cold weather.  All of this has happened after my Bus was down for 
6 months while I replaced the heads and rebuilt the top end.  Sadly, this 
vehicle has broken my spirit, and I am reluctant to put any more time or 
energy into it than I already have.

If any listees want to pay $2,500 for a great Bus that doesn't run, let me 
know.  See the following post with description.

May you all have better luck with your Buses than I have had with mine.
