Subject: Friday topic/rant: measuring tools

Dozens of jobs on our buses -- and every vehicle, for that matter -- 
require precise and accurate measurements using calipers, micrometers, 
and dial indicator set ups. Yet if you go into a NAPA or other FLAPS, 
or a Sears store, they are likely to be in short supply, not displayed, 
or "we just sold the last one." And of course no micrometer standards 
with which to calibrate the things (I'm supposed to trust the dial 
caliper that costs $19.95, made in China? I don't think so.)

Given the sea of other tools you can get at these places, this makes 
absolutely no sense. I can't figure it out. I can't even come up with a 
conspiracy theory to explain it.
