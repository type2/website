My Blaupunkt has a neat feature. It has the connections of most newer
"electronic" head units. 1 wire to an "always hot" source to retain station
memory etc and 1 wire to a "switched" source to turn the radio on/off with
the key.

While at JBB this year I discovered that if the key is OFF and one presses
the power button on the radio it comes on -- it stays on for one hour --
then it goes off again.

No need to put the key in to listen at the beach or to wire it in such a
way that you have to remember to turn it off when you get out (I frequently
turn the radio in my VW's all the way down for a while to listen to the
engine {when I have a running VW that is} and would forget to turn it all
the way off).

I knew I was sticking with only buying Blaupunkt for a reason <grin>.

Probably get a Monte Carlo MP34 as the next addition. Sirius Satellite
radio and an MP3 player for when I want to go off on a punk/industrial rock
tangent that even they don't play. (NoFX, BauHaus, Me First and the Gimme
Gimmes, A New found Glory, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, Fatboy Slim,
Propeller Heads, etc., etc.)
