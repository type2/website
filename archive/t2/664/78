Subject: Dual Carb Recomendations

I am planning on installing a brand new dual carb set up on my 1.8l bus - I am
looking for some recomendations - I am interested in reliability and stock
type performance - I don't want to increase performance and I don't want to
have to fiddle with them every few days

Suggestions appreciated

Eric
