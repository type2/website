Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in my oil

After checking all other possible causes and eleminating them if no other fuel injection parts(cold start valve, fuel pump pressure, afm,etc) are bad then change your computer. I worked on a 78 westy for 6 months off and on checking using bently and all was ok.Changed the computer and cured problem, no more gas in oil. Hope this helps.
