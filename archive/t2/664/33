Subject: Re: [T2] Where to wire Stereo power?

Battery + post to inline fuse to stereo. Ground the stereo up front. 

If you want switched power get a Radio Shack 12 volt relay and... 

battery + post to inline fuse to relay switched side, out the other switched side to the stereo.
Also:
Run the + side of the relay coil to the ignition coil, the other side of the relay coil to ground. 

Now the stereo only gets power when the key is on. 

The retro fit I want to look at is the ignition switch from my '97 Cabrio. The power to the car (not the engine) is on until you remove the key and the mechanical ingition lock springs to "all off". 

Personally I use the first version and must turn off the stereo when I get out of the Westy.
