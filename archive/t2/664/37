Karl/Andy - 

Thanks for your input.  When I bought my bus a couple of months ago it had
car tires on it and I felt that I needed to get them off as soon as possible
for safety reasons.  

One option at the time was to buy Michelins at $130 per tire... a little to
rich for me at the time.  

I went with Uniroyal Laredo HD 195/75 R14C tires (a tire that was described
by Uniroyal as an "all-season commercial tire... light truck tire is great
for heavy hauling and towing") with a load rating of 1435# (-at-) 50 psi.  

According to my '79 owners manual the Gross Axle Weight for a campmobile is
2800# and I felt that the 1435# was more than 1/2 the GAW (not to mention I
don't ever expect to put a maximum load in my bus) so I felt I should be
safe.

So here is where my question came from...  I read ads and quotes for tires
that "exceed VW specs" - I do exceed the VW spec, I think, but not by much.

Oh, by the way... I wasn't on the list 6 months ago ;-)

Regards,

Wayne
'79 Westy

Here we go again! 


The term LOAD RANGE and then a letter ONLY refers to
the PLY rating, NOT the MAX LOAD the tire can carry in
lbs.!!!!!

There was a whole giant discussion on this not more
than 6 months ago...........

 My question is that if one get "C" rated tires that
 have a load rating that
 is more than  1/2 the weight at the read axle - is
 that OK?
