Subject: Was Discount Tires now carb question

I noticed you list a 30 pict-1 carb for $139 part #113129027HBR.Is this a
round bowl carb or is it the square bowl carb.I was under the impression
that the 30 pict-1 with the round bowl was discontinued a long time ago.If
this is the round bowl carb then I need one for my other VW.
