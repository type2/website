Wow.  
   
Measuring 12 volts on the battery outside the vehicle
is well-and-good, but it is not a measure of how much
CURRENT / AMPHERAGE the battery can deliver.  A
Battery Stress test determines that.  But the new
battery should be full of vim and vigor.  But a bad
battery possibility nonetheless.
    
"11 to zero in 2 seconds?"  With Ignition switch to
"ON" (versus "off" or "start") I would assume
something is consuming the current.  As a quick and
simple diagnostic, you should pull-out each and every
fuse, then switch the ignition on.  When your gauge
ceases to drop from 11 to zero in 2 seconds, you will
have found the "current sucking circuit." 
   
"11 to zero in 2 seconds?"  With Ignition switch to
"Start?"  Starter and/or solinoid.
    
Another thought.  What is the possibility you
installed the WR1 (Hot Start relay) wrong?  Since that
was a change, undo the WR1 installation and try to
start the vehicle with the new battery.
