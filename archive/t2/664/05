Subject: Re: [T2] New busser introducing himself and vacuum advance

As some had guessed, the distributor is Bosh 009 indeed . There are two 
other "features" that will need work:  the carburetor is solex 31 PICS (on a 
1600 dp 1971) and the original air filter is gone, replaced by some "high 
performance" paper junk. Bastardizing ? Maybe

Anyone knows the VW junkyard closest to downtown San Diego (for stock air 
filter)? Don mentioned Interstate used parts in San Marcos and Lake 
Elsinore. Closer would be even better.
