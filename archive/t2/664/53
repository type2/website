For those that feel like wading thru the real stuff to know about 
thermocouples and how they work...

http://www.temperatures.com/tcresources.html

Horrible little buggers for telling you the right stuff between the 
thermocouple and the meter.

"The signal from a thermocouple depends as much on the reference junction 
temperature as it does on the measuring junction temperature. There are 
several different systems for establishing a reference temperature."

Surely someone can do better?

Cheers, dave
