Subject: RE: [T2] CHT Temps

So much for a verbal commitment. Glad you pointed out the web page, Richard.
Maybe we should go up to Napa and straighten them up  ;-)

If you install a CHT gauge that is calibrated at 70 degrees F and you get a
reading of say 1200 degrees F, you must subtract the ambient temperature
from the calibration temp., then subtract that from the gauge reading. Say
it's 80 degrees ambient, you subtract 80 from 70 and come up with -10.
Subtract -10 from 1200 and you get 1210. Put that in perspective, and it's
less than 1% off.
