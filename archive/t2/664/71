That's correct. According to a vendor website, it is off by exactly
the amount of outside temperature variance from 70 degrees. So if it
is 100 degrees outside, and the temp gauge reads 300, the real head
temp is 330 degrees. Don't know if this is gospel truth or close
enough for jazz and government work.

If I understand correctly it reads low above 70 and high below 70
