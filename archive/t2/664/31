Subject: Gasket material

Is carb gasket material special?

If I place a drop of gasoline on the original solex gasket it beads. If I put the same drop on the Royze gasket is simply soaks up the fluid and start to swell and break down. Do they "cure" over time or is this gasket going to leak from the fuel bowl on me?
