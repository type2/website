Subject: Re: [T2] Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

Althought Ron is refering to a more reasonably priced tire for our buses 
I will shoot this link out again because of the fact that these types of 
tire's really can be a chore to find.  I have Vredestein's on my 63 DC 
and I am very happy with them, although they are not a snow tire.  For 
the 78 Transporter that I drive more often, I went with Nokian's light 
truck snow tire.  When I posted this last time I had not had much 
driving experience but I have since been in very harsh weather.  Even 
with a light front end, these tires did extremley well.  In the last 
three weeks I have driven atop long stretches of ice at well over 3" 
thick, practically plowed through roughly two feet of powder, and tested 
braking during both.  Traction was superb.
