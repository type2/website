I don't think these more expensive units are based on the same flawed
thermocouple design to need the cold junction compensator. I think in
aircraft applications, when it advertises accurate within 1/2%, it
means absolute 1/2 % regardless of external conditions. Perhaps the
vendor could answer this question if anyone is interested enough to
pursue it.

 Except those don't mention any sort of cold junction compensation which is
 what's needed to stabilize the readings.
