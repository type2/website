Subject: Bus Depot testimonial

Yesterday morning I ordered eight items from Bus Depot online -- seals, 
rings, and bearings -- and asked for the medium-speed shipping service.

Yesterday afternoon, I got a call from Michael at BD, letting me know 
that the parts would be going out from a California shipper and that I 
would have it the next day no matter what kind of shipping I asked for. 
They charged me at the lowest rate -- ground shipment.

I just found the package on the doorstep.

YMMV, but I couldn't ask for better service than this.
