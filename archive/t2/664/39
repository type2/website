Chris,

While this is an interesting thought, I have another one - read on, I do get
there at the end.

While I've owned and worked on cars and classic cars from more years than
I'd care to admit - I am, admittedly, a newbie when it comes to air cooled
vehicles, VWs, horizontally opposed motors and more specifically air cooled
VW buses.  I've read a good deal of the Dummy's book and the Bentley manual
and a lot of what I've found on the web - not to mention many of the great
feedback messages on this newsgroup - thanks to you all.  But... yes there's
a but... there are still lot's of things I need to learn.  

So instead of a 50-100 question test...  how about a list of 50-100 things
new bus owners need to know ;-)  Hey, I could use it.

Have a great weekend.

I propose that we have a test of about 50-100 questions that each member has
to complete each year to remain a member... 

Questions about fuel lines, bolt patterns, tire specs, oil specs, etc. 

Fail the test and get the boot... 

<JUST KIDDING!>

Chris
I think I hide before I get the boot... again and again and again....
