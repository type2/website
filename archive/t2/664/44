What you have to realize is that the fuel and oil systems interface
nowhere unless you physically have a physical gas leak dripping into a
physical hole in the crankcase. Since this is highly unlikely (but
guess should be investigated just in case), it leaves the combustion
chamber as the only place where fuel and oil interface.

Gas in oil is usually something that is gradual and doesn't happen all
at once. Hence the usual advice to change your oil before a smog test
to ensure gas in oil is not upsetting HC levels on the smog test.

If you were running so rich as to have drastic amounts of gas getting
in the oil quickly, your bus would not be running well and be spewing
vast amounts of black smoke in the exhaust.

Other things could be looked at to explain raw fuel. For example, you
mentioned no plugs are oil fouled, but are any gasoline fouled
indicating a cylinder that is not firing, and thus pumping raw
unburned fuel in and out. This condition would normally cause
backfiring (wrap down) in the exhaust though.

Another thing could be a hole in the piston allowing unburned fuel
into the crankcase. This could also explain your high blowby volume.
Usually this causes so much internal pressure that you have massive
oil leaks as the air pressure pushes oil out all the seals. If you had
a small hole, that could explain why your engine continues to run. If
rings were worn badly enough, I guess that could simulate the symtoms
of a hole in the piston.

Good luck and keep us posted. That compression test sounds like a good idea.
