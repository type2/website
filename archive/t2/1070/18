Subject: Air scoops - painting and other uses!

On my '79, when we painted it, we just shot the hell out of it! Okay, now I'm facing the problem on the '74 of surface rust all over in there. What I intend to do is cut away the inside panel as neatly as possible, do all the rust prep I need, etcetera... and either flange the edges of my cutout or actually make a flange using hand-cut pieces of sheetmetal to reconstruct it all. On the '79, I installed a ventilator fan that blows outward (don't want to suck engine compartment venting into the sleep area!) I built that unit with a screen and a shutter so I can have it totally blocked off or open. I plan to put them on both sides when I build the '74. After a long drive in summer, it's really nasty trying to get to sleep with all that engine heat saturated through the mattress. At least with the fan it pulls cooler air from the slider windows in the middle of the bus. I use a 5" fan like a computer case fan and the 5" diameter hole I cut for it would
 probably be enough to accommodate rust treatment and painting, so I may just do that instead of removing the entire panel area. We shall see. Try the fans, though. You'll love it! I think I have pics somewhere if anyone's interested in the shutter system. It never had any negative effect on engine cooling or engine air when left open while driving. If you're stopped, though, you need to either have the fan running or the shutter closed to keep the fumes out!
