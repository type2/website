THANKS. Sounds like a good reason to cover the cab roof panel in a thin foam 
and then a layer of your favorite fabric... I have been considering 
upholstering the WHOLE interior - walls, around the windows, etc. The big 
problem would be that the fabric would have water stains as the inevitable 
dust mixed with condensation around the windows. 

I'll definitely upholstery the ceiling panels and all the wall panels 
(currently formica covered plywood or door panels). Of course with each new 
piece of upholstery the less I want to cook inside for the smell and the fire 
risk. More good excuses to make our van a Weekender with an external 
cookstove under a side tent or plain old outside. Maybe build a lightweight 
teardrop trailer with kitchenette in the back... <griN!> 

My friend's Riviera is pretty quiet with a full headliner (no wallpaper over 
plywood), upholstered seats, carpet, etc. If I could best that I'd be pretty 
satisified.
