I think what this whole thing means to me is that I really should change the
tires on my '72 Westy after I put the engine back in butB before I drive it.B 
I don't know exactly how old the tires are but I bought them in Zanesville,
Ohio in September of 1991.B  At 17 1/2 years, at least, I'd say they're more
than a bit past their experation date!

Thank you for posting this. Didn't know about the age out rule nor how to read
the age codes. Did know about the weight codes. Did know tires got old but
not "when".
