Don't know what the root cause of the problem is, but dying when one  
shifts to reverse is a classic symptom of having the reversing lights  
hooked to the wrong side of the coil. Check to ensure that the black  
wire with the in-line fuse is connected to the 12v side of the coil,  
not to the points side of the coil.
