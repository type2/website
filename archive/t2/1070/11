Subject: Re: [T2] Keep blowing fuse #9 / 16amp

I have a 78 and can start it with 2 bypass wires: (1) an alligator 
clipped wire that is clipped to the coil (+) and the battery +. You 
should hear the double relay click when you do this. (2)  with a bypass 
wire (12 guage) soldered to the top terminal of the starter (where the 
wire up front comes from) and the other end can be switched or just 
touched to the battery + .  A cruder way is to do this under the car 
with a screwdriver or just push the car.  Will yours stay running this 
way or does the fuse then still blow?
