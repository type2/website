so,, what is your question,,,?  you want to put a 5 speed in  you 74?   Why?

if you want to drive it like a scirocco..  I suggest you buy a scirocco...
it is up to you tho..

no, the vanagon manual trans don't bolt in.

I found that the 091 gearbox from a 79ish Bus works great..  if you have the
4.57 R&P and the 0.82 4th gear.. you will have the first 3 gears for city
driving.. and 4th for hwy... dropping the engine rpm about 1000 rpm.. and
increasing your top speed

if that is why you want to change your trans.. then you have a few
combinations to think about..
most likely you want a 091 trans. with the 4.57 R&P  and 0.82 4th...
switch the bellhousing from your 74  002 trans.. then you can leave the
200mm flywheel.. pressure plate and clutch.. and SR15 starter as they are.
assuming you have a 1800cc carb engine.
otherwise,,with a 2 liter you could leave the 091 bellhousing, and use the
228mm flywheel, and the SR87 starter

one thing that has been discussed.. you might find you need to change out
the shifter in the cab and you might have to put a new dimple in the trans
shifter hockey stick....

some swaps find the 091 is about 13mm longer, and that puts the shift rod
forward and out of adjustment.  you can adjut this where it belongs.

when I am rolling around town.. I rarely use 1st gear.. second and third...
then 4th as soon as I hit 80km/hr up to about 150km/hr
I can take third to about 100km/hr at about 4500 rpm... sometimes the wife
asks if I am going to use 4th gear... as I am sooo used to driving the 74
trans at 4500 rpm at about 100km/hr..

I have the 74 westfalia.. with an 091 trans. 4.57 R&P  0.82 4th,  002
bellhousing, SR25 starter.. 200mm flywheel and pressure plate.. I love it!
