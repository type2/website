That's the one I bought, and it works fine. My readings were:

74-82 db at idle
86-90 in town
92-96 in 3rd at 40
94-96 in 4th at 70

and 60 just sitting in the bus with the engine off. Not sure why it was that
high, but that's what it was.

I have not finished the rebuild, but I plan to compare after it's complete.
