Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] sound deadening

I'm fairly sure it is the engine. When I put it into neutral and coast, most
of the noise goes away. I can also, in gear, play with the throttle and make
the noise increase and decrease depending on the load applied. It seems
noisiest when running on the flat, constant speed, above 60mph (96.77kph). I
guess that equates to a light to medium load.

James, Good call on the hard surfaces. I'm in the process of padding my
panels in the cab area. I'm using 1/2" thick rebonded memory foam carpet
padding and a nice charcoal automotive fabric. So far I have the door panels
done. Still need to do the kick panels and the non-walk thru panels behind
the seats. I chose the memory foam as it seems to be very dead acoustically.
If you hold a piece of it about 6" from your ear you get that dead anechoic
feeling. In the Heat Noise and Vibration link, they used 1/2" thick felt.
