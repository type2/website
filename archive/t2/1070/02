Subject: Re: [VB] Tire age.

That's interesting.  I had a tire shop refuse to plug a tire once
because it was more than 5 years old, which made sense to me.  But
there are so many factors that can contribute to a tire failure I
think it would be difficult to pinpoint age alone outside of
controlled laboratory conditions.  I think because of this story a lot
of people are going to go out and check the production date on their
tires but not the load range, inflation pressure, tread depth, wear
patterns, etc.
