Subject: Keep blowing fuse #9 / 16amp

Hello busers,

I've been trying to track down a wiring issue on our '78 transporter.   
It recently developed a short of some sort as now fuse #9 continues to  
blow.  It only blows when I have the ignition cranked to start the  
engine, in which case it usually takes about 10 seconds to give way.   
I've looked at quite a bit of wiring this morning and while I've  
cleaned up some issues, none were related.  Any thoughts on where to  
look?  I think this is listed as an Accessory block?

Peace, Troy   	http://calivw78.com
