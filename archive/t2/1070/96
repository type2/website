hi Lima,

I also retrofitted a L-Jet fuel injection system into my '74. Hands
down the best mod I've done. I think mine came from a '76 bus.

Be aware that there are a few different versions of the L-Jetronic
system and some of the parts (the Air Flow Meter and ECU for example)
are not interchangeable. I would definitely recommend finding a
complete FI setup instead of piecing one together.

In addition to what Greg mentioned, you'll also need to find way to
mount the ECU. I chose to cut out a hole just like a stock FI bus and
used some clips to screw it in. I originally had a bracket to mount it
to the engine wall, but it gave me trouble, I can't remember what
exactly... i might not have liked the angle of the harness or
something. I did this conversion a while ago.

fuel injection is the way to go if you have the resources to get it working.
