Subject: knowing if your engine is overheating

How do you tell if your engine is overheating, is it just the oil sensor and I get a gauge for my third position on the dash that is open.

I note I can purchase the oil temp stuff easily, but not anything for engine temperature.

So, that means oil temp IS engine temp and there are limits.

If it moves out of range, what is the procedure, idle until it cools down or shut it off.

Thank you.
