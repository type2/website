As long as you are driving at constant speed a GPS can be remarkably 
accurate.  I've compared GPS and stopwatch-calculated speeds over 
a flat, measured road and found that the GPS was always accurate to 
within 0.5MPH to the calculated speed.  The error was more likely my 
inaccuracy with the stopwatch than in the GPS.

Back in "the day" there was a built-in error in the GPS system called 
"selective availability" but this was turned off in 2000.
