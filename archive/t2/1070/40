Turn off the ignition at ~60 and leave it in gear? Long hose from hardware 
store clamped to the carb throat and plumbed outside above the rear of the 
roof to move the intake noises outside temporarily? Would look like a bastard 
version of the Landrover deep river fording kit... 

My aftermarket carbs have been really noisy over the years. All b/c of the air 
cleaners. Will from now on try to duplicate the factory style airboxes for 
noise control. The open air cleaners on my vehicles have been responsbile for 
a 90% increase in noise and 1.5% increase in power... VBG! Can you take a one 
piece VW air cleaner assembly and cut the bottom out to fit your carb?

Sure you don't have a bad gear or bearing? Had a '66 Mustang with a worn rear 
axle pinion bearing (gears too?) that made weird 60 mph noises. Also had a 
200K mile Honda Accord with worn CV joints that made vibrations at highway 
speeds but did not have the popping CV joints in turns. Had loose CV joint 
bolts on '78 VW Westy once that caused noise. Also had a broken bellhousing 
rubber mount that allowed the drivetrain to shift sideways so that the metal 
bracket touched the metal chassis and transmitted alot of noise through the 
vehicle. 

KISS! (Keep it simple stupid!) Worry about the cheap stuff first. I typically 
worry about the expensive stuff first and overlook the real and cheaper 
problems... VBG!
