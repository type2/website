Thank you for posting this. Didn't know about the age out rule nor how to read 
the age codes. Did know about the weight codes. Did know tires got old but 
not "when". 

Why does it seem that Europe is ahead of us on so many topics? 

Am forwarding this to a friend whose van carries young ones, has underrated 
tires and by now OLD tires... Local tire store installed car tires on her 
Rivera way back when. 

Important on a vehicle which fails the moose test even when all is right... 

This ought to be in some "attention newbies" article that all new list members 
get upon signup.

My inop Westy has tires that are CERTAINLY out of date by now. All good 
excuses to upgrade to the 15" wheels I have sitting around waiting for use. 
Won't buy tires until the day before I intend to hit the road next time. Last 
set of tires is brand new but aged. I was badly optimistic about when we'd be 
on the road again and then - life happened... <griN!> 

Will take a hole saw to my old tires when I eventually retire them from garage 
duty.
