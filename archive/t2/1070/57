	Let's not go overboard on this 'dangers of old tyres' kick.
	It isn't a single monotonic trend.  On the one hand, we've 
been usefully informed of the dangers that can arise after, say, 6 y 
(esp if in sun).  But on the other hand, it's a well-known economy 
trick of taxi operators to keep new tyres in the dark (e.g. in a 
cellar) for a couple y before fitting them.  During this 'maturation' 
period the rubber compound hardens, slowing wear in a big way.  This 
harder compound will of course grip the road less, so those 'mature' 
tyres will skid more readily; but they certainly last much longer, 
which is on the whole good (if they don't wear so well that they get 
you into the 6+y danger zone :-/ )
