I second the dakota digital - awesome unit.

Also, if you find yourself constantly adjusting your valves, then you 
could have overheating problems.  My heads are overheating and I have to 
keep backing off the adjustment screw.  It's gotten to the point now on 
the #1 exhaust valve that I can't back it off any more because the 
rocker arm will contact the spring retainer.

I've got new pistons/cylinders/heads going in sometime in the next few 
weeks.  I'm also going to install my cleaned injectors and hopefully 
that also helps bring temps down...
