Subject: Re: Engine Running Problems Whilst on Holiday!

Bummer!

and even just died whilst idling.

I'm by no means an expert on FI, but I suspect it could be related to
the cold start valve that works sort of like a choke for fuel injection.
From what I have read the temp sensor on the head (3-4 side?) can go bad
and cause this valve to not operate and hence make it hard to start!

Australia.

Have you put the call out on www.aussieveedubbers.com?
