I'll work on checking all of these also.

I've not tried jump starting it yet, so not sure if it will run or not  
with the fuse out.  I do know that all my alt and other dash lights  
won't function without the fuse in.

This is a fairly recent issue (past month or so.)  The bus has sat  
untouched for most of that time because of it.  Over the past year or  
so though, it's had what I thought to be a hot-start issue.  I've  
repaired a fair amount of grounding issues over that time and have  
also replaced the starter within the past 6 months, all with positive  
results.

Thanks for the help.
