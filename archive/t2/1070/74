I have an old pickup that has sat for several years.  It had a set of 
radials on it when parked, and I have always kept them inflated properly. 
the tires had plenty of tread.

Last August I heard "BLAM!"  Sure enough, the tire blew while sitting in 
my driveway!  Tread was torn off for about a foot around it!

Now, these were a cheaper brand and were well over 10 years old, but it 
was rather amazing that it blew just sitting there!
