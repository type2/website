Subject: Re: [T2] Re: sound deadening headliner/cooking in

I meant that the cloth, headliner, or quilting could be put on the wood 
of the existing headliner or the wood /vinyl under the rear upper bed 
and closet shelf bottom.  The nearly solid rubber underlayment I 
mentioned somwhere does not absorb moisture.

quoth Bob:
I pulled most of the insulating material out of my bus, it held too
much moisture against the metal and caused more rust than I even want
to think about, be sure what ever you put in there can dry if it gets
wet.

       Check out the local fabric outlet for headliner material- it is foam
  with a stretchy fabric material. I saw solid colors only.  Consider
  quilt material also, with a layer of batting within it.  It can be
  stapled or sprayglued.  You can also get a basting gun that drives those
