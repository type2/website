Subject: Engine Case Craked or not?

  Guys,

I am in the process of rebuilding my engine and I was wondering about cracks
and cases. I'm trying to determine if I should purchase a rebuilt engine or is
mine ok to rebuild. If you go here http://photobucket.com/tooty1977  and look
at the pics, could anyone tell me if these are cracks? I have a 1077 Type 2
camper (westy) I have had the bus since I was 15 and it always ran ok, I have
always been able to start it until this year so I decided it was time for a
rebuild. I am learning as I go and here in West Palm Beach, Fl I cant seem to
find any Volkswagon people to help me. It never really leaked oil. I did have
to clean the hell out of the case to get it to look like this though. PLEASE
HELP!!!
