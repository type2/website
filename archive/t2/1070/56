I'd like to hear the list wisdom on this as well. 

At the same time I have to keep in mind all of the engines that I have had 
over the years and revved up occasionally for whatever reason (in retrospect 
few good reasons - like seeing if it sounds kewl - I was young... VBG!) with 
no ill effects. Many of these engines lasted 200K+ miles. 

You do whatever you think prudent. I'm no expert. I have revved engines up 
slowly and steadily in search of loose parts. Whole experience was less than 
a minute and never over 4K or so. 

Have you gone over the engine and looked for things like loose alternators, 
loose heater boxes, loose starters, loose tin, etc? Muffler innards intact? 
My cabrio's catalytic converter melted at some point in the past (over-rich 
condition) and I recently replaced it and two O2 sensors. Definitely changed 
the sound of the engine.
