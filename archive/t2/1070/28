Subject: CHT temp gauge

Hi folks,

This question pertains to the odd duck of of the air cooled VW engines,
being the 2.0L found in my 81 Vanagon.

When I read about using the CHT gauge, I seem to always be reading about
busses, and the word is that cylinder number three is the "hot" one that
should get the sender.

I mentioned this elsewhere, and was told that number 2 is the 'hot' cylinder
on the vanagon installation. I suppose maybe due to the different tin, air
flow, and other details of the design?

Anyway, can anyone confirm for sure, which cylinder I should be monitoring
in my Vanagon engine? Short of buying multiple senders and going through a
dash mounted switch to monitor every one of them, it would seem a good idea
to get the one that normally is considered to be the hottest running hole.

If someone knows for sure, will you share? :-)

Thanks a lot,

John
