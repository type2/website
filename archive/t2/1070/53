Chris,

The metal looks like it's cracked, unfortunately, so I'm afraid that it's
not ductile enough to be "pushed out".  And the amount it's "pushed in" 
is minimal (~1/16" if that) but i'm more concerned about structural integrity.

Perhaps I don't have to worry about that because the bearing and radial metal
that the bearing seats in is going to bear the axial load of the alternator
shaft, and just put some JB weld or epoxy on the outside of the face, then sand
it down so as to provide some cohesivness to the surface...
