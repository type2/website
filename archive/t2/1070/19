Subject: Engine Running Problems Whilst on Holiday!

Have just started a 2 week Kombi holiday in Tasmania, Australia, and have
faced engine problems on day 2 of our trip.

Was running fine the night before, then this morning went to start it up.
Normally starts first time, but this morning, took a while to get going and
even just died whilst idling. Eventually got going, however found that when
ever I tried to accelerate, it felt like the engine was not firing, but
basically had no power and almost stopped running. Eventually had to call it
quits when after it was parked, started up again (with difficulty), and
everytime went to put it into reverse, the engine would fail and stop running.

Currently at a garage tonight, and have not spoken to the mechanic yet, but
was hoping someone could help point me in the right direction to troubleshoot
this problem.

If anyone is in the area and can help, I am in Launceston, Tasmania,
Australia.

The roadside assistance guy suggested bad condenser or coil, or even faulty
air intake sensor.

Have a 1976 2.0 Litre, fuel injected (Jet Tronix) automatic Kombi.



Look forward to hearing back from anyone who can help.



Thanks in advance.



Chris.
