Well.. I just put the new injectors in and it is running *really* rich 
which is a good thing because it means that my old injectors were really 
inefficient at the amount of fuel they were injecting; that hopefully 
will bump up my MPG a few.  The WB couldn't compensate for the change 
because I didn't give it that much authority (currently set at around 2% 
or so).

Unfortunately, the head temps are still running around 420-430 when I'm 
cruising on the freeway at 70 with the mixture running around 12-13:1, 
so that should be plenty rich... excessively rich, really.  So.... now 
the only thing left that I can think of is C/R being too high or the 
timing...

last time I checked, it was spot on.  I've kept rechecking the timing 
and it's always looking good.  I'm hoping to put a timing wheel on the 
back of the fan sometime in the near future.  I'm just trying to figure 
out the best way to mount it.
