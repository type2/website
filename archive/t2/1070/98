Subject: Replacing fuel lines, Type IV, 81 Vanagon

I am rebuilding the engine from my 81 vanagon. Oh what fun :-)

I have the fuel injection parts on the bench, left and right, which includes
the rails, the injectors, and the tubes that go up to the intake.

Obviously, this is the time to replace the hoses, and some are pretty
straightforward, but I am confused about the lines that "T" off the rail
line. The end which is at the fuel rail, is held on by a hose clamp, but the
other end of this short piece, which attaches to the injector, doesn't have
such a clamp.

As I stare at it, I would like to know how it is connected, before I start
pulling and prying, or cutting the old hose off.

If I have explained the question properly, can anyone tell me what its
holding that small piece of hose to the injector body? It cannot just be
pressed on, in a pressurized system, so I am gonna wait till I can learn
what it is, before I start removing it all. Got the 7 mm fuel hose. It is
7mm, right? and ready to deal, but first, no suprises.

Also, can the old clamps be reused unless obviously in bad shape. I am on so
tight a budget, I cannot afford to spend here, when I might need it there
down the road. I know better than to scrimp on something as important as the
fuel lines, but otoh, even tho the clamps are not expensive, mail order
shipping and waiting a week, sometimes two, for a handful of clamps seems
ridiculous. I do want to move forward, so I am considering the worm drive
clamps, unless someone seriously changes my mind on that :-)

So, first, I am cheap, but don't want to burn my van down, :-) and second, I
don't want to start taking the lines off, until I understand how they
connect to the injector end, so if anyone can help, or explain what its like
in there, I would sure appreciate any pointers.

Thanks a lot, as usual.

John
