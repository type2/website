So,....it seems...I have the "Bad" transaxle in my '74 Westy, and it will have
to 'work' harder...to make the ride ..."nice",....but you know what...I have
sodium filled valves, bigger valves, higher lift cam..(aftermarket), twin del
34s, Header exhaust,..without "heaters", and 'different" wheeels and tyres,
so....."bubble bubble, toil and trouble, let me see what I can 'cobble'..and
yes...I will attempt to "break away"....from the current "think"...and try
something....different!  "Imagineering" is creativity on a budget..overseen by
your wife!  This is not a 'dis'...ok?  Cheers
Syd
