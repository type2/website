I was planning to put the new injectors on with the heads cuz it's a bit 
of a pain to get in there.  If it's not the injectors, the only other 
thing I can think of is the C/R being way off?

When I pull the engine, I'm planning on checking the current deck height 
of each of the cylinders because I never did that before.  I will then 
pull the old pistons and cylinders off and install my new P&Cs and my 
new heads.  I will also install all new pushrod tube seals and other 
random seals and check the deck height on tbe new setup.  Then after I 
get it all back together, I'll calculate the volume of the old heads and 
see what kinda C/Rs I was running.  I never calculated the C/R on my old 
setup, so I figured I'd see if that was way off and that might give me 
some insight into my problems.  I was also going to send off my 
installed set of injectors to be flow tested to see if they were way off.

However, I could just put the new injectors on right now.  It's just 
such a tight squeeze ;)

Is there anything else you could think of that would cause high head 
temps other than the C/R or the injectors... at least anything else 
mechanical that would require an engine drop?  Obviously AFR is a big 
one, but I can control that easily with the MS.  I am also going to 
install a second WBO2 sensor on the other side of the engine so I can 
monitor both sides.  Then I will be able to control the AFR separately 
for each side of the engine if I wanted to.

thoughts?
Mike
