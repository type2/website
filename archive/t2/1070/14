The problem described in that video is absolutely real.  When I get 
tires the first thing I check is the date code and I don't trust any 
tire that is more than about 5 years old, especially if the tire was 
stored outdoors or in the sun.

Saying that this story will cause people to ignore load range, pressure 
and other important things is just silly.  There are many thing to pay 
attention to, and tire age is one of the important ones that people need 
to be aware of.  I'm glad this video was made and hope that people will 
pay attention to it.
