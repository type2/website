Subject: Oil Leaks

Hey Everyone,

My 69 Westy had a really bad oil leak, which I thought was coming form 
the oil cooler.  So, I removed the engine stripped it down and found 
the cooler was perfect.

After a closer look I found that one push tube actually had a pin-hole 
in it!

 I was wondering two things:

1) What is the likelihood of a something hitting it from the road? I am 
thinking rather slim, but there is evidence of something hitting it.

2) What kind of pressure runs through the tubes?

Since I had to get back on the road, and was not excepting to replace 
the tubes I braised the hole shut with some brass and sealed it (just 
in case) with some heat resistant epoxy.  So far everything appears to 
OK.  I can start robbing banks again with out leaving an oil trail to 
follow!  :)

Happy Trails,

Brian
