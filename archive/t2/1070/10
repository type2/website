Troy,
If you can't find any other problem areas. Check the your ignition switch.
That plastic breaks and short out everything.

Hello busers,

I've been trying to track down a wiring issue on our '78 transporter.   
It recently developed a short of some sort as now fuse #9 continues to 
blow.  It only blows when I have the ignition cranked to start the 
engine, in which case it usually takes about 10 seconds to give way.   
I've looked at quite a bit of wiring this morning and while I've 
cleaned up some issues, none were related.  Any thoughts on where to 
look?  I think this is listed as an Accessory block?

Peace, Troy       http://calivw78.com
