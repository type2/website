X  Is the MasterSeries similar to POR-15? Any thoughts on quality difference?
I've use plenty of the POR (and waited plenty of days for it to
exfoliate....)



MasterSeries is like many of the other products out there but unlike POR-15 it
isn't a multi-stage / multi-step product.  You simply paint it on and you are
done.  I've painted on heavy pitted areas, treated gas tanks, and even applied
multiple coast to seal holes.  Once applied it is rock hard.  They use it on
bridges up north a good bit, so I think it would be great for your sea side
situation.
Also, someone mentioned using soda blasting.  I will warn you.  I soda blasted
an entire 48 Chevy pickup a while back.  It was great for getting all the
paint and rust off with little to no damage to the surface of the metal.  BUT,
don't simply wash it off and expect the paint to stick every time.  You will
need to neutralize the soda with a mild vinegar and water solution first and
then wash it VERY good.  I washed, neutralized, washed, and washed and washed
and still had some areas that the paint would let go afterwards.
I think if you try the MasterSeries you will be pleased.
