Subject: Re: [T2] Engine drone

Can you create the drone with no load on the engine but matching the same RPMs 
as when rushing down the road? 

I am working my way through a watercooled Cabrio with a similar problem. In my 
case it is the exhaust downpipe (between the exhaust manifold and the 
catalytic converter which I just replaced). In my case it is "resonating" at 
3500 rpm-4250 rpm and causing a severe vibration issue. Also an exhaust leak. 
Also a drone.

Just curious if in your case you can make the engine do it in neutral. 

If it is a tranny/axle problem it can be hard to figure out b/c there is no 
load on the tranny. 

I'd go through the maintenance sheet on the tranny. Everything tight? Full of 
oil? Left and check each rear wheel bearings. My '78 Westy has a bearing 
problem on the driver's side that allows the wheel to move in an out 1/8". 
Axle nut tight. Replacing all the bearings both sides b/c I am nearing 200K 
miles. 

If all else fails strap yourself to the bottom of the tranny and check stuff 
while your significant other drives down the road. Watch out for speed 
bumps... <griN!>

I love a good mystery. Let us know what else you find... Am curious if your 
engine or the tranny is the culprit.
