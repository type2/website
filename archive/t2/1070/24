Subject: Re: [T2] knowing if your engine is overheating

Alan

the aircooled engine heat problem mostly exists in the cylinder heads... so
it is really worth monitoring your Cylinder Head Temperature with a gauge...
and strangely enough.. it is called a cyl head temp gauge.. or CHT for
short.

you can get a VDO one.. or a Dakota digital one.. there is a price
difference because the dakota digital one IS better.. it is temperature
compensated.

I have been using the VDO one now for years.. I really only drive in 20C to
25C weather,,  plus or minus 10C on rare occasions... so I consider mine a
'good indication' of a trend... not really an exact temperature.

I can tell when the 'engine' is getting hot in a hurry because the heads
heat up almost instantly,, whereas the oil takes 20-30 minutes to show a
change..

I am happy with the VDO.. but if I ever bought another , I would go Dakota
digital.

if you do use a VDO ... i recommend the 'sender' ring be filed open a
little,, the hole is a bit toooo tight to work the best.. other than that..
the kit is complete and works fine...
and if you're building an engine... and can install the sender at that
point.. Scott has a good write up.. about 4 pages long.. hit next to read
more...

if your engine is getting hot... and there isn't a serious problem like a
broken fan belt, or plugged fan intake.. etc..... then all you really need
to do is lift your foot off the throttle...

engine heating seems to always come with load... up hill.. head wind... too
much cargo.. tire pressure low... brakes dragging...

hope that helps
