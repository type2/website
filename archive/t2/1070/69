Ned,

Are those readings on the dbA or dbC scale? I also have one of those 
RadioShack meters. I get similarly increasing readings. On the dbA scale, 
even at 70 its still in the high 80 range, bumping 90. On the dbC scale it 
bumps 100+. The dbA scale doesn't pick up the engine drone as it is a low 
frequency component.

dbA is supposed to mirror how we hear.
dbC is a flat response over a wider frequency range.
