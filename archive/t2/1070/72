Subject: Bodyshop recommendation Annapolis MD or Close?

Okay so the wife and I are finally ready and have some money to get the body
and paint work done on our '78 Westy. I plan to strip it to a rolling chassis
with no glass or interior and am looking for someone to use for paint and body
work. There are some areas that will need replacement metal namely the spot
below the rear decklid and maybe rear corners. There is also surface rust
inside the air scoops, media blasting?
 
Can anyone out there reccommend a shop near Annapolis MD? I'm looking to spend
4-6k on this job and am hoping to get it done right and in a reasonable amount
of time.
 
Thanks,
 
Ted Reshetiloff
