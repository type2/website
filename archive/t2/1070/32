Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that will yield the correct 
numbers.  If I remember correctly, when the opposite wheel isn't 
spinning, the lifted wheel will actually spin faster than if both of the 
wheels were spinning (because of the differential).  I remember doing 
this on my remote controlled car and I'd grab one wheel and the other 
would start spinning faster.
