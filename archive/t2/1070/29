I'm not surprised, considering that VW also thought those gear ratios 
were appropriate for a stock 2-liter.  That's why VW put them in all 
76-79 busses (except Europe).  The '74 came with an 1800 which had less 
torque and needed a lower-geared transaxle to maintain speed on the highway.

The difference you describe is about 35%, which is way too much to be 
attributed only to the difference between the 002 and 091, which is 
about 10%.  I'm not sure what to say about this except to ask if you are 
sure about those numbers.  I have never seen a bus going 120kph at 
3300rpm that didn't have a Porsche transaxle (hi Mike!).

The 091 has .889 4th and 4.57 R&P.  The 4.857 only came in the late 74 
and 1975 002 transaxles.  Your 74 either had 5.375/.82 or 4.857/.889 
which comes out close to the same and are both about 10% lower than the 
091 with 4.57/.889.
