Subject: RE: [VB] sound deadening

In my quest for a quiet bus .. I'm pretty amazed at how this is working.
I've used two types of sound deadening stuff ... one kind was thicker, more
rubbery, and stuck better than the other kind .. in fact, one pack of the
other kind didn't really stick that well at all .. I used a bit of spray on
adhesive and that seemed to do the trick.  So I did the inside of the driver
side long panel and the cargo doors with the stuff .. then put on some
tin-foil bubble insulation stuff and then a vapour barrier .. I'm optimistic
.. so when you knock on the metal it feels and sounds totally solid .. like
a Porsche say .. and when you knock on metal without the sound stuff and
just the insulation .. it sounds really tinny. 

My plan now is to use carpet underlay on the interior floor.. both the floor
of the cargo area and the over-the-engine bay floor/top and under where the
westy bed will go .. then I'm gonna lay carpet over the engine bay area,
wheel wells, and the slooping part under the westy bed .. I'll use plywood
over the underlay and flooring on top of the ply wood in the cargo area ... 

My question ... someone mentioned to me that the stick on sound deadening
stuff is pretty much like stick on floor tiles .. I'm thinking what if I had
some floor tiles .. heated em up .. and used either contact cement or spray
on adhesive .. I'm sure that would work pretty must like one of the kinds of
sound deadening stuff ... 

Thoughts?
