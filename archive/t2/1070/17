Maybe if everyone were subscribed to vehicle-specific mailing lists
where tire info is a frequent topic.  But I don't think most motorists
would be able to tell you what their tires are supposed to be inflated
to.  And the piece seems to imply that tires fail due to their age,
not a combination of factors including their age.  Anyone else notice
that the "cars and trucks" in the Texas warehouse were mostly Ford
Explorers?

I agree.  And now I'm going to grow a mustache.
