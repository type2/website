Hi Mike, I found the AFR to be a HUGE factor in controlling head temps.  
Since I installed my WBO2 and dialled things in I don't have to worry 
about that any more.  Are you sure you're not trying to run too lean?  
It would be nice for economy, but that's the fine line to be balanced on 
these engines it seems. Too hot vs. fuel economy.
I still have yet to control my ignition with Megasquirt.  Greater 
advance (within the limits of pre-ignition obviously) means cooler 
running as well. How's your ignition timing?
