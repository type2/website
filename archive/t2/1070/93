I couldn't get the photos enlarged as much as I would have liked, and
realize I haven't seen as many cracks as a lot of these guys but to me
it looks more like stuff I've seen as casting lines and crazed paint
and not cracks.

it appears in a few photos that you have the pistons removed.  have
you tried looking into the case with a flashlight and see if it can be
seen on the inside.  if you have lines like that in the same place on
the inside, then I would be concerned.

otherwise try some of the tricks these guys have posted.  I don't
think I have ever seen a crack in that area myself, it is an area that
gets very low stress.  of course if you have another known good case
why bother with this one until you can get a chance.

you also could take it to a "GOOD" machine shop that has xray testing
equipment and have it scanned. of course it would cost you some, I
haven't had something like that done in ages so have no Idea how much
it costs nowdays.

good luck

Bob
