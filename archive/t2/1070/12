Subject: Help with transaxles?

I have a '74 VW "Westy"....with a 4 speed trans, but I think I have
learned(?????), that newer Vanagons, had the same transaxle, but with a 5 th
gear, and they "bolt" up to our "early" Vw frames.....and then later were used
to make the VW "players"......like Sirooco, etc for front wheel Drive
cars...KARL...set me straight on this....thanks!
