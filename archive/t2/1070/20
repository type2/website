Subject: Re: [T2] Help with transaxles?

David.. I guess I got lucky,, in fact , I didn't even know a 4.57 existed
until Jamie Auch mentioned it on this list..
then I opened up a dozen 091 trans I had here.. and found 3 of them.. at
that point., I don't know the 4th ratio until I install the trans.. I can
count the R&P gears just by taking the bellhousing off.. but not the 4th
gear

so I installed one in my 74 camper.. and a basically stock 2 liter.. and was
very happy ! :)  I was apprehensive at first about HP and hills,, and gear
ratio's... but got over that with one trip to Washington state.. and British
Columbia!

so.. the post was about putting a 5 speed in a bus.. and my answer was sort
of aimed at using a 4 speed bus trans that has different gear ratios .... I
assumed Squid was looking for the same thing,,, but maybe he does want to
race around town in a Bus like it is a scirroco!  :-)  shifting gears until
the cows come home,,, me,, I love putting it in 3rd and hardly shifting at
all... keeps the head temps down.. and the engine noise and vibration down..
and then on the highway.. 4th gear feels like a over drive,, or a 5th,, so
the bus rolls along at 120km/hr at about 3300rpm,, vs the original trans.
002 ... 100km/hr at 4200 rpm foot to the floor 1.8L engine

so.. I guess , to my point,, even the 091 gearbox with the 0.889 4th, and
the 4.857 R&P would make a difference to the 74 gearbox 002 gear set

I would have to do some more rpm / km/hr   data and recalculate... as for
all I know for sure,, the gear set I have may well be a 0.889 4th.... I
haven't seen that gear to count the teeth and know for sure..   I have only
compared my speed and rpm with Marcus and my rpm is lower, and speed is
higher..  iirc..

I just want to point out that the 091 transaxle does NOT come with the
0.82 4th gear.  That is a custom modification that you will have to pay
a transaxle shop to make for you.  I know that you know this Jamie but
you didn't mention it in your post and I don't want there to be any
confusion about it.  All 091 transaxles that were equipped to busses
sold in the US came with a .889 4th gear.  Not sure about Canada but I
suspect it's the same.

I'm also not sure that a stock engine has enough power to push a bus on
the highway with a 4.57/.82 combo, but I don't think Jamie's engine is
stock.
