It is my understanding that it is very bad for an engine to be revved to high
rpms without a load of some kind, I have heard stories about people blowing up
their engines by revving them up over and over while parked, these were high
performance engines, but still I am sure it is similar.B  I would think that
an engine will behave entirely different when driving and parked at 4000 rpm.



Can you create the drone with no load on the engine but matching the same RPMs
as when rushing down the road?

I am working my way through a watercooled Cabrio with a similar problem. In my
case it is the exhaust downpipe (between the exhaust manifold and the
catalytic converter which I just replaced). In my case it is "resonating" at
3500 rpm-4250 rpm and causing a severe vibration issue. Also an exhaust leak.
Also a drone.
