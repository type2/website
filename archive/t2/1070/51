A few years ago, maybe just over a year ago, I got all worked up to reduce the
noise in my bus.



I can't remember the particulars, the dB levels, the reduction, the minutes, I
will get as close as possible.



I used a noisey stretch of I84 eastbound near Portland as my test stretch to
measure improvements.



My first test showed that at 60 mph I was being subjected to noise levels that
OSHA stated an employee could only be exposed to for around 8 minutes at a
single time, around 99dB I believe, or as this website reports
http://www.oshax.org/info/articles/decibel-levels B only 2 hours of an 8 hour
work day (I can't find the website that listed it in minutes anymore).



I determined that most of my noise was not caused by wind or road noise but
instead by the motor by moving the SPL mic around the inside while driving
different speeds and measuring the volume at different frequencies.



I started by getting a large piece of 1/4" thick clay filled red rubber and
putting it beneath the mattress ('77 Westy) in the very back, even before I
had it cut to shape and it was justB laying down the difference was dramatic,
I thinkB it dropped around 5 dB, increasing my allowable exposure time from
around 8 minutes to around 30.



I didn't glue anything, it is just laying on the deck.



It was huge, especially when you consider how dangerous the fatigue from the
loud dB can be while you are driving.



I have read on the Samba that the most important thing you can treat is the
front wheel-wells, I plan to do that the next time I get excited about
reducing the dB, although I am pretty sure that my motor was much louder to
beging with.



I want to fill in the spare tire well and cap it also, try driving your bus
around with the closet door open, it doesn't get much louder.
