>My plan now is to use carpet underlay on the interior floor.. both the
floor of the cargo area and the over-the-engine bay floor/top and under
where the westy bed will go .. then I'm gonna lay carpet over the engine
bay area, wheel wells, and the slooping part under the westy bed .. I'll
use plywood over the underlay and flooring on top of the ply wood in the
cargo area ...

I bought a large rubber backed mat on the weekend that is a good fit for
above the engine. I haven't had a chance to drive with it yet. I wonder
about any benefits from plywood. I would think it transmitted noise
quite well. :)

The biggest change to noise levels I made was changing the exhaust from
the cheap aftermarket copy to a stock exhaust. Suddenly I could converse
with my passenger. I have subsequently changed to a 4 into 1 style
exhaust which took me back to the former noise levels. I have then added
induction noise from twin 34 Weber icts!
