Hi John,

My recollection is that the bubble stuff is great thermal insulation and a 
poor noise barrier.
Not so sure that floor tiles will do nearly as much as a product designed to 
dampen vibration. Poke around a little on the internet and you will find 
some home brew stuff. Can't remember right off, but there was someone that 
used multiple layers of heavy duty aluminum foil glued to rubber or other 
such material to make something similar to Dynamat and Damplifier. Claimed 
to have some good results.

I've used a lot of dynamat and JC Whitney NASA insulation in my bus. I'm 
left with a bad engine drone above 60mph. Below that, its quiet enough for 
conversation without shouting. Road noise is not bad. Just the engine drone.

Did you read up on the links I attached to my earlier post?
