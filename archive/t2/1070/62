Subject: Re: [T2] Help with transaxles?

I did a test tonight.. one rear wheel on the ground, the other in the air..
spun the wheel 3 turns.. and the engine turned over 6.125 times..

I think that is a final drive of 4.08 ... and I know it is a 4.57 R&P... so
that sounds like it is a 0.889 4th..

now I have to find a way to verify my tach...   I have a digital non contact
tach... I'll have to get a way to fasten it in the engine compartment.. and
a way to view it.. and the dash VDO tach..

I can verify my speedo with my GPS .... will report back once I gather that
data..

Jamie
