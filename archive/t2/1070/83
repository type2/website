years ago I did fancy camping, now I'm lazy and prefer to spend my
time shooting the breeze with fellow bus pilots,

. breakfast is usually dounuts.
. lunch something out of a can, tuna on rolls
. dinner one of the truckers self heating meals.

if I have electric I may fire up a slow cooker put something in at
breakfast and eat dinner.
