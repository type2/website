    Check out the local fabric outlet for headliner material- it is foam 
with a stretchy fabric material. I saw solid colors only.  Consider 
quilt material also, with a layer of batting within it.  It can be 
stapled or sprayglued.  You can also get a basting gun that drives those 
I shaped clips to fasten fabric together, but you must drill a hole 
first in the thin paneling.
    As for cooking, we have the Deluxe Westy  and prefer to cook 
outside; The fliptop mostly holds our TV and bins of electronic stuff 
and magazines. If it's freezing out, the single burner that goes on top 
of a fat propane can sits fine on the floor near the door and doubles as 
a "take out the chill" heater in the morning,  Contrary to belief, these 
give off no monoxide if the flame is an intense blue, but keep the bus 
leaky enough (poptop up is enough) to keep the O2 level. Oh yes, I also 
tossed that bulky table and have one that flips up on the sliding door 
and one to the left of the cabinet.
