Hi Volks,

Perhaps we should ask Jamie if sometime he could jack up one wheel with 
the bus in 4th gear and compare the number of turns the engine must spin 
to get the raised wheel to turn a complete circle.

Once we have that data we will know for certain what the ratios are in 
Jamie's transmission. I think that's the best way to sort this out once 
and for all.

I'll even volunteer to help; next time I'm out west of Toronto....

Happy Trails,
