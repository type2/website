I just want to point out that the 091 transaxle does NOT come with the 
0.82 4th gear.  That is a custom modification that you will have to pay 
a transaxle shop to make for you.  I know that you know this Jamie but 
you didn't mention it in your post and I don't want there to be any 
confusion about it.  All 091 transaxles that were equipped to busses 
sold in the US came with a .889 4th gear.  Not sure about Canada but I 
suspect it's the same.

I'm also not sure that a stock engine has enough power to push a bus on 
the highway with a 4.57/.82 combo, but I don't think Jamie's engine is 
stock.
