I can attest twice to what will happen to a perfectly "new" tire taken
from the spare tire cabinets from 2 used campers.  In one case a "new"
20 yr old folding tire taken from a 74 was inflated and large cracks
appeared all over it- very scary to see.  Worse, in my dumber days I
took a NEW spare from a 77 bus, put it on the front, and we drove it to
the Reading VW show (about 1.5 hr ride), and on the way back, it blew
the entire casing off, causing us to almost hit the concrete divider- a
real case for also having both hands on the wheel. I think the tire was
12 yrs old.
Obviously what they claim happens did- the rubber outgasses (ozone is a
factor), becomes brittle (may not show cracks-this one did not) and
under the squirm and heat it delaminates from the belts inside.  I would
not use a tire beyond 6 years.

The problem described in that video is absolutely real.  When I get
tires the first thing I check is the date code and I don't trust any
  tire that is more than about 5 years old, especially if the tire was
stored outdoors or in the sun.
