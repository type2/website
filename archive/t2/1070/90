Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Case Craked or not?

Hi Mark,

Welcome to the group. I'm no expert, but those don't look like cracks to me,
and certainly show no sign of leakage. The heads are the bigger worry for
cracks, especially between the valve seats. I would do a compression test
before you do anything to get an idea of the state of the engine. Above 120
in each cylinder should mean you are fine. Difficult starting could be from
a vacuum leak, non functioning cold start valve or bad points or ignition
coil. But it looks like you have it out of the bus already, so doing those
tests may not matter.

Hopefully some of the wiser minds on the list can offer more....

Ned
