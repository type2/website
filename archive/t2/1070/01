one thing I've found helpful in tracing down errant shorts is a good
heavy duty Ammeter.

remove the fuse and hook each side of the ammeter to each side of the
fuse holder and put it on the dash and watch to see what pegs the
Ammeter.

can help you trace down what component your using when it blows, might
also find that there is something running "hot" just below the
threshold where the fuse blows.  The meter allows you more than the
"go/no go" that a fuse provides.
