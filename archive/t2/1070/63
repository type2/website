My spare tire well is so crammed with "almost never needed spare stuff" 
like an alternator, and bags of fuel injection stuff, blanket to lie on 
under the bus, etc that it's well insulated against noise!  The rest of 
the closet is stuffed with our bedding.
BTW, I found thrown out a very dense carpet underlayment that looked 
like glued together bits of solid rubber 3/8" thick, very dense- great 
padding- check your carpet store.
