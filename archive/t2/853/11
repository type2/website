Isn't the cable going to rub on the trailer before the bus gets up on the ramps? How high up are you going to mount it?

The last and only time I put my bus on a proper trailer...

...we found that the built-in ramps were too short to allow the bumper the clear before the wheels hit the ramps. We ended up using some longer ramps you can see in this photo:

They weren't ideal (flexed too much) and not properly mounted to the trailer (be careful they do go flying out from under a rear wheel) but I didn't know they were going to be used before the trailer showed up.
