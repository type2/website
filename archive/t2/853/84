Howard,

It all depends on the metal your welding to.

A mig will aboslutley feed the wire to the metal as fast as you have the
wire feed selector set, and how long you hold the stinger trigger.

But--it the metal is air holed and corroded bad, the tig or coat hanger
is just as fast .
Your going either being blowing holes in the crummy metal, or filling
them as you ride  with the ig or  hanger.

This is what I mentioned before---

Fresh metal top and the bottom--no questions asked the mig can fly.

But if I'm going over garbage the tig is faster and more controlable for
me anyway.

Same with the hanger--you can sit and puddle the weld till it's
full---them move on--

No Flameouts here---just sharing my experience's with you.
