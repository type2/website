Sandblasting is one possibility, but would require taking the glass out 
so you wouldn't risk sandblasting the entire Bus.

Easier on a DIY scale would be etching.  If you're at all serious, get 
yourself down to Michaels Arts & Crafts and look at the glass etching 
kits & supplies they have there.  Goes on with a brush, cleans up with 
water, and they've even got stuff for masking and making designs and 
patterns.
