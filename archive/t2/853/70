Subject: Weird looking thermostat question...

Hello List,

I have a question that i couldn't find the answer to
in the archives. I needed a thermostat for the dp
1600cc motor in my 68 bus. I bought if from a vendor
off the Internet and I was sent something that
resembled a large spring with a cylinder inside. This
did not look correct so I called the vendor and was
told that it was the replacement for the bellow style
thermostat and would work in place of it. Skeptical, I
measured it at room temperature and then placed it in
hot water but I noticed no expansion. Has anyone else
had any experience with one of these? 

Everything with my flaps system is set to go. I am
just skeptical about hooking up this weird looking
thermostat. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Regards,
