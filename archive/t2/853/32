SWEET!!!!

I'd think a pair of 6k winches would be better than a single 6k. Cheap and
the two working together should have no problem pulling a locked up vehicle
onto the trailer, while a single 6k one would be able to pull a rolling bus
with ease.

Of course a brute of a 12k winch would be great, but expensive.
