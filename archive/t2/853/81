Subject: '68 front end and rims.. in Baltimore MD junk yard

The'68 is in Crazy Ray's Erdman Ave Baltimore MD.

Someone should pull the front end, please!!  And the wide five rims are not 
that plentiful around Washington DC, so someone please grab these -5- rims.  
The yard will pull the rubber off for free, and you wind up paying $10 per 
rim plus taxes plus $1 entry fee plus gas plus time....

I looked ar the wiper arms, and they have the hidden screw/bolt so they may 
e original.  I tool the push button handles and the brake fluid reservoir is 
dry rotten and broken,  The dash is gone.  Engine gone, but trans is still 
there

Someone grab what's left before it goes to the crusher.
