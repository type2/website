Subject: Tinted rear and side glass for sale

Hi, All.

I had three pieces of glass made for my '79 (two rear sides w/o vent windows and rear hatch). They are 3/16, light smoke grey and tempered. I've already installed them and they fit perfectly and look great on my newly painted blue and white Kombi. 

The company I got them from called me up today and asked if I had already picked up my glass, and "yes", says I, "they are already installed." "Well," says she, "there are three more pieces, apparently we ordered them twice by accident. Do you want them? You can have them at our cost, otherwise they'll be thrown out."

I thought someone else on the list could use them, so I'll go ahead and pick them and offer them up for sale. $175 for all three, plus shipping, if needed. I'm in Alameda, CA 94501.

They look great, not so dark you can't see through them, just a nice grey. Real classy. There is even an aftermarket window defroster for the rear available here

that I plan on installing on mine.

I also have an abundance of other pieces of flat glass (original) if anyone needs it. Some is tinted with that awful purple stuff... you'd have to scrape that off.
