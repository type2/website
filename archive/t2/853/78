Subject: Re: [T2] Weird looking thermostat question...

From David Kelly:

I have a question that i couldn't find the answer to
in the archives. I needed a thermostat for the dp
1600cc motor in my 68 bus. I bought if from a vendor
off the Internet and I was sent something that
resembled a large spring with a cylinder inside. This
did not look correct so I called the vendor and was
told that it was the replacement for the bellow style
thermostat and would work in place of it. Skeptical, I
measured it at room temperature and then placed it in
hot water but I noticed no expansion. Has anyone else
had any experience with one of these?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contrary to the part number and the application he lists, I believe this to be a type 1 thermostat. He says it
is a 70 degree unit and he has to modify the end for the cable to fit. Sure looks like a type 1 threaded rod
goes in the end!  Type 4 thermostats are normally 85 degrees.
