I find that hydraulics still require periodic adjustment, say 10-15k miles. See my tech article on them for more info:

Poor idling in the morning and popping from the exhaust with a warm engine are usually clues you need to adjust them.

Yes. Telescoping works best.

The lifters both have the same size bore.

>Do I also need hydraulic push rods then?, or are they the same as solid lifter push rods?

The hydraulic push rods are stronger and a different length so dont' mix and match, use hydraulic rods.
