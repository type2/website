There isn't a switch, per se.

Kickdown is controlled by the throttle linkage, as you found. The cable end
is attached to a lever on the transmission case which operates the kick down
valve on the transmission. If the cable is not adjusted properly it will not
kick down. The top of the lever is attached to the rear throttle linkage,
which is a rigid rod attached to the throttle valve.

When the pedal is floored, the lever on the transmission should be a few mm
past the detent point, you can feel it easily when you are under there. If
the throttle linkage is adjusted right, and no kick down, then the valve
body may be bad.

If the bus was converted to carb, I wonder how the linkage was done? Is the
throttle linkage in the engine bay a 10mm steel rod? That is what it should
be for an automatic transmission bus. Maybe the linkage is missing, so no
kick down possible.
