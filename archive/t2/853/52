Subject: Hello and auto trans question

Hello,

A friend just bought a 1980 Westy which I am helping him fix, and I am now
looking for a Westy myself (way too cool).  I have been searching the
archives for information on transmission kickdown issues, and a seeming
slip/slide into third.  I am hoping to gain information and assistance into
the workings of the auto trans in this van.  The real question is, what is
the kickdown switch, how is it adjusted, and are replacements available?
This Westy was converted from FI to carb, and I do not see a switch
anywhere.  I had one place tell me it is manual, the throttle cable goes to
the trans, then a rod goes to the throttle body, but that doesn't match what
I think I found in the archives.  Help please?

Thanks,
