Subject: Nickle-chromium filament wire

Hi Volks- a friend of mine is rebuilding fuel sending units for air-cooled
VW's, buses included. We need to find a source for .002 nickel-chromium
wire. I believe the proper resistance value of the filament to be 87.5 Ohms.
Does anyone know if the resistance of n-c wire is the same for 30 ga? Any
help will be GREATLY appreciated. Please PM  TBear- the cherry guy
