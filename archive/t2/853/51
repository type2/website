Subject: Need a VW shop near Gardena, CA

Hi everyone - I know the wonderful resource that Larry has put together -
but I really dont know the cities in CA very well - can anyone tell me of a
good shop to inspect a Vanagon near Gardena, CA?

My mom needs to get a '84 Vanagon (with something crazy like 38k original
miles on it) looked at - and I see that go westy is just a little far away -
so any help would be appreciated.

thanks!
