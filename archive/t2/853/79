NO FLAME WAR DESIRED

Hi Terry,

   I'm a little confused, I thought we were talking about the difference in
the speed of a "Tig" verse "Mig" machines?
    BTW I have both, a Lincoln Square Weave 175 AC/DC "Tig" (wish it was
water cooled), a Snap-On 119a "Mig" (110 volt light duty machine, body sheet
metal mostly). Along with a, Miller "Zip Cut" Plasma cutter, plus the
ambiguous Oxygen/Acetylene rig, cut off wheels, grinders, BMFH's, etc.
    Back to the topic I answered. Am I wrong, is the "Tig" faster? That is
the topic I addressed, coat hangers aside.
    By nature the speed of a hand held rod machine, or a stick machine,
verse a wire feed machines speed is night and day.
    Simple fact is no matter who is doing the welding. The inch of weld pre
hour of the "Mig" is faster than the inch of weld per hour of a "Tig"
machine. That is what I addressed.
    Anyway Terry as I stated, I didn't mean the pick fly crap out of pepper.
    So, I bow out, with apologies.
