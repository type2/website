Subject: Re: [T2] Cam question(Hyd/solid)

Karl, just a quick question, I prefer the hydraulics as I'm not into adjusting every 3K miles on my 77 bus because I'm not as spry as I used to be. I can use a magnet to pull out the solid lifters after removing the tubes, correct? Then replace with new hydraulics. Do I also need hydraulic push rods then?, or are they the same as solid lifter push rods?
Thanks,
Courtney
