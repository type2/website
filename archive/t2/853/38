Subject: Re: [T2] Cam question(Hyd/solid)

Hi Adam,

    I don't think anyone is advocating that he mix cams and lifters. Just
passing along the facts in answer to his question! So he may make a decision
based on fact.
    And the fact is that they will work mixed, just not without damage, as
stated!


Cheers,

Howard
