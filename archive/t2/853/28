Do you have any photos of them installed on your bus? I would be interested
to see what they look like.

Thanks,

I thought someone else on the list could use them, so I'll go ahead and pick
them and offer them up for sale. $175 for all three, plus shipping, if
needed. I'm in Alameda, CA 94501.

They look great, not so dark you can't see through them, just a nice grey.
Real classy. There is even an aftermarket window defroster for the rear
available here

that I plan on installing on mine.
