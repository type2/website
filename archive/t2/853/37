Subject: Re: [T2] Cam question(Hyd/solid)

You can't mix/match lifters and cams.  Some folks will say  they have done 
it.  Those are the same folks that are always pulling their motors to fix 
them each month.

Solid lifters/solid cam

Hyd lifters/hyd cam.

Stick with solids.  Then you know what you got.
