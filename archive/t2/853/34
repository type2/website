Subject: Re: [T2] Electric winch for pulling T2's

I dunno much about winches.. I have always used a hand come-a-long rated at 
about 1 ton.

If you have a snatch block pulley I am sure even the smallest winch will 
pull a bus onto a trailer.
here is a picture of the come-a-long with the snatch block pulley.

Another hint I find helpful,,, if the trailer loading ramps are too steep,, 
jack up the tongue of the trailer at the hitch on the tow vehicle.. you'll 
lift both the tow vehicle and the trailer tongue so the rear slants down,,, 
allowing the ramps to be closer to the same angle as the trailer.
you have to be careful not to jack the rear wheels of the towing vehicle off 
theground or you might find you have a run a way as the rear wheels have the 
parking brake usually.

hope that  helps
