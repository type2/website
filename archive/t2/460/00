  I am glad you folks also think the throw out bearing noise is unusual. 
I have been around vw's off and on for years and I've never heard one
make this kinda racket.  I'll also inquire about the timing.  That I
could probably tackle myself if I need to.

  Well my week of bliss is almost over.  I'll be going off to work
tomorrow.  I'll have to schedule my bus work around my jobs.  I look
forward to the work left to do.

Happy Bussing All!

Jennifer
