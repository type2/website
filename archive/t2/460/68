Richard,

Did mine with chrome and rubber from Wolfsburg west....

Once you get the chrome and rubber on the windows, you *must* measure
your openings and make sure it will really go.  I burned 3 seals getting
mine in on the drivers side....that is in the next couple of installments
on the restore of my 78 bus.

pmail if you need help/advice after measuring.

Cheers, dave
