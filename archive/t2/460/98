right the 73 model year,  75 is when they changed em.  the 411/412 had
automatic in every model year  (71-74 in the USA)

right the bell housing is significantly different, but I believe the yokes
are all the same....I may be wrong but I don't think I've ever seen a
different one on the bay window bus. don't know about the vanagon, and the
411/412 I am pretty sure is different, now this is from memory I had a 74
412 automatic myself some years ago.
