Steve,

TDIs can be converted to run on vegetable oil. I met a guy at a VW show who
did just that. He actually ran straight oil all the time, not starting and
shutting off on diesel. But as with anything automotive, there are lots of
ways to do stuff. If I was doing tons of driving and had some time to
tinker, I'd consider getting a high milage TDI to do the conversion, but as
of now, my 00 TDI is staying diesel.
