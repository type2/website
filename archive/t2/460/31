Hey Jason,

        I saved this e-mail because I'm planning on repairing my steering
components in the next week or so, or however long it takes to get the
parts. When you said that you ordered new tie rods and a center-link.
Where did you buy them from? I'd like to spend the least amount of money
for the best parts. (you know how that goes).


Thanks!

Todd
