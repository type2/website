hmmmm,, type 2 buses didn't get an automatic until 1975 so an early 70 is
not an option,  the 411 mount is IIRC slightly different than the bus
mount and different than the Vanagon mount..?????

you have me a bit lost,,are you referring to the YOKE which is near where
the engine mounts to the tranny???  or the front mount at the nose of the
tranny.... I think all bay window bus yokes are the same..manual or
automatic
