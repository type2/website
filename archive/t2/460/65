There seems to some disagreement on this. I've also read a number of claims 
by conversion advocates that TDI's can run fine on vegetable oil.  If you do 
your homework thoroughly and invest in a good conversion system, I suspect you 
can find a way to run any of the various VW diesels on straight veggie oil.

There is also a pretty nice looking (though expensive) system called the 
"Elsbett" that doesn't require a separate, second tank for the vegetable oil.  It 
uses larger injector sleeves, heavier duty glow plugs and relay, water cylce 
heating of fuel and filter and secondary electrical warming.

There are some great web pages featuring european NA, TD and TDI bus 
conversions.  None of them looks easy, most require extensive re-engineering of the 
bus body, drive train and heating/cooling systems.  Not for the faint of heart 
or the average weekend bus tinkerer.  I totally wimped out and am on the slow 
track with a 1.9 TD vanagon conversion that will eventually sport a veggie oil 
conversion of some sort.
