Subject: ignition lock

Hello,
   Has anyone else have trouble with the ignition lock. I replaced it on my
71. Then sometimes the key won't go in the slot. When I twist an turn the
wheel it somehow frees up. I've taken it apart twice and still I'm not sure
what it'll do next. The lock seems to work and all is free when dissembled.
Does the little trap door on the lock block matter? It must be removed to
refit lock cylinder.
Patrick
