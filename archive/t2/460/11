Subject: RE: [T2] 15" rims for my '78 Westy

http://www.gowesty.com/ has 15 inch rims. They even have factory looking
rims that are 15 inches. They're pricey though. I wish I could find
someone else who sold 15 inch factory looking rims. You can even reuse
your old hubcaps. Did the Brazilian buses go to 15 inch rims? Where is
GoWesty getting these?

 This has probably been asked and answered many times, but can anyone
tell me
of a 15" rim that will fit correctly?

I found some mention of Mercedes wheels in the archives but nothing
specific.  Any recommendations?
