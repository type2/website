Subject: Rear Automatic Transmission Mount Wanted

I'm looking for a rear automatic transmission mount
from an early (1970?) type 2 bus or a 411.  I want to
fit it to my 1990 Vanagon with a Subaru engine for
additional mid-span support, and I understand it will fit the
top two horizontal holes of my bellhousing.

I have had no luck through bus depot or other parts suppliers.

Please call (416-678-9445) or email me if you can help.

Thanks.

Tim (Toronto)
