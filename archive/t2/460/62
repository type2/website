Remove all the rubber gas lines, and replace them.
While you have the rubber lines off blow the metal
ones out with air pressure. Drain all the old gas out
of the tank, change the tank sock, wrense the gas tank
out with clean gas, replace the filter. Rebuild the
carbs(using carb soak not the spray cleaner)after all
this it should start like a new car. Phil
