Here is the "better" idea--

And while it's a genuine VW issue part--it's not Type 2 issue--

The Vanagon assist handle secured to the same area won't break, bent,
chip, fade,  peel, or crack--and will work great--and is a inexpensive
item to find--

I added one to the front of the window frame of my 87 toassist is
closing--but I think I'll add one to my 74--in both places---good idea-

Later,

Terry

Hey Meg... 
I had that handle on my 77 bus too...it's supposed to be a closer helper
for the "slam door" slider on post 73 bays... 
Notice I said 'had'...the first time you pull on it to close the door,
it snaps off...one of the more useless items IMHO...if anyone has a
better idea here, I'd love to hear it...
