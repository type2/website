Subject: handle?

Hey Meg...

I had that handle on my 77 bus too...it's supposed to be a closer helper
for the "slam door" slider on post 73 bays...

Notice I said 'had'...the first time you pull on it to close the door,
it snaps off...one of the more useless items IMHO...if anyone has a
better idea here, I'd love to hear it...
