Hello,

This question is for all the weber progressive carb people.
Does the weber carb require an electric fuel pump for proper function?
What modifications are required to set it up properly?
Do you need to re-jet the carb?
What are your fuel/air mixture settings?
I am looking for any and all information for the best performance.

Thanks,
Darren
