Subject: Carb replacement

I am now ready to replace the carb setup that I have on my 73 westy. I
currently have a Weber progressive single carb and I think that I want to go
back to the dual setup. I need advice from anyone out there that has changed
their stock duals for an aftermarket brand. What size do I need, what brand
is best, what am I going to have to do to get new ones tuned, do I need to
order extra jets to tune it or do they come with them, etc? Any help the
list can provide is would be greatly appreciate since this is a good sized
investment. 

I am also looking for good info on performance of the different setups. I
have a 1700 cc engine with a distributor that currently has an vacuum
advance and retard setup, but only the advance is being used. The
progressive runs well, but will not work well in the winter and I have a
hesitation when I first start to accelerate. I thought about getting a carb
heater from Jake Raby, but figured that the dual setup would be better in
the long run.


Thanks,
Corbett
