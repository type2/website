Subject: Interior roofing

I need to redo the material on the interior of the roof on my 78.

No pop-tops or anything.  The stuff was taken off when I got the van
and seeing that winter is near (Canada) I want to get it done so I can
drive this unit for a little longer than normal.

I have some insulation for the roof. I am intending on using the panels
that you get from home hardware for the ceilings in office buildings.
ie those rectangle's with a white pattern on one side that sit in the
'false' ceilings.  There's about 1/2 inch of yellow/pink insulation and the
white provides a vapor barrier too.  That part isn't a problem. I'm just
going to hot glue them to the roof. The problem is how or what do you
use as material to cover them and how does it stay up there?  In the
front (cab/driver etc) the original material is there but it's fugly.

Idea's pictures, how-to's etc welcomed and appreciated!

James
