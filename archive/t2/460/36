Assuming you can get the foam boards glued to the metal with no bumps or 
bulges, why not contact-cement vinyl sheeting under the foam boards?  My 
ceiling has thick white vinyl (approx 1/16" thick) with a cool  diamond 
pattern on it - you'll probably be able to find a book of different 
designs at any upholstry supplier or furniture restorer.
