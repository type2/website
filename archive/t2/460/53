Hey Den, you should look at my "slam door"  I took a nylon web strap and
made it into a loop, and put the two ends under what is left of the
handle,, using the stock 2 small bolts to hold it.

The kids can get their hand inside the loop like a ski pole, and "giver"
to get the door to SLAM!

Mind you, I have the door adjusted so it slides and catches very
easily,,,, but everyone seems to have to slam it!
