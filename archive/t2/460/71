Subject: 71 brakes

My brake pedal is acting a bit strange.
In normal use it does not return back to the top position, but stays 
depressed ~1". I believe the brakes are dragging very slightly in this 
position.
If I turn the engine off it will return to the top.
The engine idles faster when the pedal is not at the normal top position.
The plastic ring inside the return spring appears to be broken, could this 
be the problem? I don't see it available from the online vendors. Any 
suggestions where to buy or what works as a substitute?
Does the return spring wear out?
New rubber hoses all around, new booster valve.
Any insights appreciated.
Thanks
Denny Johnson
