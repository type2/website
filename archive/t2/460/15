I always thought dual carbs were a pain, sure they
look cool on the motor but do they honestly provide
more horsepower, fuel economy, better performance
alltogether??

Maybe if your running a monster motor..

Why would you want to change your weber single carb?
If your having small issues with it then Im sure you
could dial it in much easier then you could dual
carbs.
Have you tried playing around with different size
jets, to see if you can get better performance, this
would be a lot less costly, and you may just surprise
yourself how much performance a simple jet can
provide.

two cents,
