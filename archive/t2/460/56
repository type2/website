First guess of several possible:

Original carbs running over rich, gas wash of cylinders, loss of compression.
Verify compression balance. Pull plugs to do this. If this guess is correct 
they will have heavy carbon deposits. This is confirmed if the oil in the 
crankcase is very thin and smells of gas. If out of spec on compression, it 
engine teardown and rebuilding time.

If compression is good, update all maintenance that is due or overdue or 
unknown. At this point you will have it running great or know the reason 
why not. It's not the same as picking and choosing from a bunch of possible 
faults until you finally find the cause. It's actually using a rational 
process to make sure you don't miss the fault and fix it with the least 
possible time/money required and nothing wasted on anything that is not the 
fault.
