Subject: Re: [T2] Interior roofing

This is one wild , off the wall idea to say the least---
They may only be 2x 2 ceiling tiles, but regardless, they will wind up
weighing more than the pop top--!!

Why not try this--
Do some finger walking--and locate a marine, or RV upholstery shop--
They would have an outlet for the white / off white fuzzy glue on
headliner material--used in boats and Buses---
This makes a bunch more sense than gluing Office Depots ceiling on the
roof of your Bus--

Oh Boy---:>)
