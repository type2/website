It's time to verify the basics, as Dr. Tim said. If your bus was running
well before this incident, here's what I'd do:
1] Check the valve adjustment. .006" on all valves with the engine dead
cold.

2] Verify fuel delivery to the carb(s). If no fuel, trace the lines back to
the tank, and find out where the stoppage is.

3] Got fuel? Verify the point gap--50 degrees of dwell, +/- 1 degree. While
you're in there. check the condition of the points. Are the contact surfaces
pitted or burned? Is the rubbing block worn away? If you have any doubt at
all about the points, change them; they're cheap. Also while you're in
there, check the distributor cap inside and out. Check the contact lugs
inside; burned? carbon arc tracks between them? cracks in the cap? Replace
as necessary.

4] Verify current to the coil. 12 volts to the + side when the ignition is
turned on.

5] Make sure the spark plug wires are clean and tight at both ends- the
distributor cap and the spark plug. Don't forget the wire from the coil to
the cap.

6] Remove a spark plug and check for spark while the engine is cranking.
(Plenty of info on this procedure in the archives.) You should get a nice
blue/white spark. Yellow is marginal, orange is weak. Suspect the coil.
While you're at it pull all the spark plugs and check the color.  Dark and
fouled? White and burned? Indicates problems with the fuel delivery system.
Lots of info in the archives, also all over the web.

After all this your bus should start. If all these items check out (or you
fix them in the process) and the bus still doesn't start, then I would get
into compression tests, leak down tests, and the like. Some others may give
different advice, but this is what I'd do in my driveway.

Good luck,
