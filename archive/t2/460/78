That's great to know. I'd love to see the system. I wonder if he has
everything electrically heated? I wonder if he plugs it in overnight to
keep the oil hot and ready to go. Was this person in CT? It gets pretty
cold there.

TDIs can be converted to run on vegetable oil. I met a guy at a VW show
who
did just that. He actually ran straight oil all the time, not starting
and
shutting off on diesel. But as with anything automotive, there are lots
of
ways to do stuff. If I was doing tons of driving and had some time to
tinker, I'd consider getting a high milage TDI to do the conversion, but
as
of now, my 00 TDI is staying diesel.
