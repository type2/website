Subject: Carburetor Tuning?

Hey guys,

      I've been driving around my VW Transporter for a while now, really
breaking in the new motor, and everything seems to be running pretty
well. However, I have NO idea if I have the carburetor configured
correctly. I mean, as in fuel / air ratio.


I think it idle's pretty high. Like.. in first gear, I can completely
take my foot off the clutch, with it in gear, and it will coast at around
8-10 mph all by itself. 

I doubt if this is BAD for the motor, but I can't imagine it's good for
it.

The idle seems to hunt a little.. and after the car has warmed up, the
idle seems to be pretty high. I don't have a tachometer, but if I had to
guess, I'd say it probably idles around 2,000 rpms.

I did this originally because the rebuilt motor and carburetor, et all,
sat for about 3-4 years doing nothing, and as I started to work it in, it
used to stall. Now that the motor has cleaned itself up, and it's had a
tuneup, it doesn't need to be this high.

Does someone have a good system or series of steps that I can follow for
tuning my carburetor?

FYI, I have an 1800, with hydraulic lifters, and a 2-bbl Webber
carburetor with electric choke.


P.S. Should the electric choke be hooked up to the ignition power all the
time? 


Thanks!!

Todd
