For the sliding windows they used the window seal that
is also used for the middle window. So I fugre you can
use it if you like.

I think however that a sliding window gives a higher
risk of rust underneath the seal. I don't know why but
I have seen a few buses that had quite some rust there
while normally you would hardly ever find rust below
the middele window.
