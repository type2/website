http://www.cbperformance.com/ has Solex 34PDSIT carbs in stock (Brosol, 
Brazil New Carbs) I have yet to install mine but when I get it done I'll 
try to detail it. The only major disadvantage I can see is that I can 
no-longer use the oil-bath air-cleaner because they require a 
modification to the linkage (apparently a better angle and causes less 
wear to the throttle-shaft bushings.

The stock carb setup sits low enough to the engine so that icing isn't a 
problem. I once had an 1800 in a bug with the weber progressive and 
icing was always an issue. BTW when I do remove my original carbs I'll 
put them up for sale to anyone interested. They're in great shape save 
the throttle-shaft wear.
