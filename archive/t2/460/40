Cool, let me know how it works out for you.  I've added a Pertronix kit 
for my '76 to my Christmas wish-list :-)

You will have to retime, because installing an electronic ignition is 
like changing your points, and you always need to retime after you 
fiddle with your points.

Thankfully, timing your engine is incredibly simple.  All you need to 
do it is a timing light (you don't need one of those fancy ones with 
the digital display, or anything, just a basic one ... should be in the 
ballpark of $30), a wrench to loosen the distributor clamp, and the 
timing spec for your model (I don't know off-hand what it is for an 
'82, but you should be able to find it somewhere).

The following page is a terrific introduction to timing your engine:
