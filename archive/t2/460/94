Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Automatic Transmission Mount Wanted

Bob, I was just informed by another listmember that the first automatic type
2 was in 1972. Maybe it was a 1970 411 that had it...

I was led to believe by a VW mechanic that the rear tranny mount (on rubber
mounts) from the 411 or type 2 (he suggested 1970) will fit the 1990
automatic bellhousing, which is significantly different from the manual
version later on anyways.  I believe it is the YOKE that i am looking for,
as it would fit two horizontal holes spaced apart 6-8" directly above the
torque converter on the bell housing.

hmmmm,, type 2 buses didn't get an automatic until 1975 so an early 70 is
not an option,  the 411 mount is IIRC slightly different than the bus
mount and different than the Vanagon mount..?????

you have me a bit lost,,are you referring to the YOKE which is near where
the engine mounts to the tranny???  or the front mount at the nose of the
tranny.... I think all bay window bus yokes are the same..manual or
automatic
