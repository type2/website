Subject: '78 & '79 Deluxe Middle sliding windows

Does anyone out there have a '78 or '79 Deluxe Bus with the sliding windows
in the sliding door and opposite side?
I finally have a set to fit in my '77 Deluxe bus, but am unsure on what
window rubber to use?
All my current window rubbers have he chrome moulding inserted.
So should the rubber for the sliders have the moulding or not??
All the '78's and '79's I've seen are standard bus's (in Australia that
means no moulding in the window rubbers) and not Deluxes.
Thanks for your help.
