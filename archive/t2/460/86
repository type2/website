Hi James,

The original vinyl headliner is glued at the edges and held up in the 
middle with wire bows. I removed (most of) it from my bus when I 
installed the westfakia pop-top.

The plywood westy headliner is held in place with U-clips at the edges 
and with screws in the middle. The screws are usually hidden in the 
lighting recesses and behind the sun visors.

I also have a 77 sunroof bus at home that has a badly rotted headliner 
thanks to a faulty sunroof drain, and my plan for it involves 
transplanting a wooden headliner from a 73 westy.

Happy trails,
