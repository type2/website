Subject: what years are diesel engines available

There is a course at a local community college in the area that converts 
diesel engines to biodiesel (grease cars) Any way, I was wondering what 
years the diesel engine was available for buses?
Is it difficult to put a diesel engine in body that was originally set up 
for a gasoline engine?
Thanks,
Kyle
