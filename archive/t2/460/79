Subject: RE: [T2] what years are diesel engines available

The guy was from CT, the car was a 97 or 98 Jetta, red. He told me the
conversion cost about $1000 and took him a few months. He had a heater in
the filter like most grease conversions, but no separate gas tank. I asked
him about winters, having owned two early diesel VWs (and you Vanagon guys
know about this) they can be tricky below 10 degrees F. He said he garages
the car but cannot drive it when it's really cold. I think if I did a
conversion I'd do more what the guy in the old Rabbit did, which is the more
typical two tanks (a fuel cell in the trunk) and a way to switch over to
diesel with antigel in really cold weather, because another thing to think
about with any diesel conversion is while the fuel may not be jelled at 20
degrees, if you drive it, the air will cool the tank and the diesel can jell
from the wind chill. This happened in my fathers' 03 Jetta Wagon TDI on a
trip up to New Hampshire in single digit temps. There was no antigel in the
tank. So if anyone is considering a diesel conversion (and I'm a big fan of
diesels) remember that you have to put antigel in your gas if it's really
cold. I find temps hovering below 20F during the day and single above or
below at night as the time to do it.
Also, on the older TDIs, again my experience, count on a head gasket change
around every 125K. But other than that, mine ran like clockwork.
