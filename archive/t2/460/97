Or have regular glass cut and then tempered. Did all the flat glass on my 
bus in tinted glass for something between $100 and $200. Been a few years. 
They cut copies of my glass and sent it off to be tempered. 1 shop could do 
the jalouise windows, other did the big glass. 2nd shop claimed they 
couldn't do narrow glass.

Commercial glass shops are the source I used.
