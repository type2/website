Subject: Headflow Masters as a Motor Builder?

Esteemed Listees, Friends, Romans, Ladies and Germs:

Anyone on the Type 2 List who drives a bus powered by Type 1 (see - there
"is" bus content) every had reason for Adrian at Headflow Masters over in
Vista, CA cook up a motor for them?  I'd do the puny little Type 1 1776cc
for the wife's Ghia myself, but alas and alack, I do not have the time
resource at the moment - unfortunately I'm credit-rich beyond repair ;-).  I
HAVE had Adrian prepare Type 4 heads for me in the past (he's the only game
in town IMHO), but find myself needing input from anyone who has bought an
entire long block from him, especially any SoCalifornicatizens or Sandy
Eggans (Sandy Eggites? Sandy Aliens?  Bftspck?) with experience with his
skills.  I know there are lesser $$ motors out there, but they interest-eth
me not, so please, no referrals to PDQ, XYZ or QuikenDirty Motors who can do
it for many C-notes less...  By the time you factor in the attributes I am
requiring for this application, they exceed Adrian's prices or are so close
you can see them from there.  I know there are motor builders out there who
happily EXCEED his prices as well - I figure that if his skill/credentials
at repairs on T4 heads has spilled over to entire motors, then we most
certainly have a winner.

All opinions cheerfully received OFF-LIST please; direct your
e-correspondence to type4busguy(-at-)earthlink.net !  Tanks & jeeps...

PS  As of yesterday afternoon 3ish, there's a '73 ASI camper, with automatic
trans, motor and interior still relatively intact at the Pick Yer Part in
Wilmington, CA.  See - there's now twice the bus content as before...
