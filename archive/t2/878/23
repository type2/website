Subject: Re: [T2] Loud pipes save lives

The welds look a bit...sloppy.  Then again, being a complete novice
welder, I can't claim to be able to do any better.  But I did stay in a
Holiday Day Inn once. (tm)  ;)  

I like that idea, and I never thought of it.  The exhaust on my bus has
a leak (need to replace a gasket), but it's actually not all that loud.
The solid lifters rattling around on the cam and the slightly worn
distributor gear makes more racket than the exhaust.  

However, I do get a nasty resonance with the body at 70-ish mph,
rendering the stereo and conversation useless.  May need to look into
that undercoating spray.  

Now, I wonder if the big 6" diameter x ~2' long exhaust off my Yamaha
Road Star Warrior would fit...

(not my bike, but it shows the exhaust pipe really well ;)
