So what is American and what is furrin' anymore? Remember those "built 
in the USA!" Harley guys? LOTS of that motorcycle is made overseas now, 
assembled here. The line is blurring...

Saw a Harley gas tank - "Made in Taiwan"... Brembo brakes. 
Magnetti-Marelli fuel injection components...

One friend argues where the profits go decides whether it is American or 
Furrin'... I argue if fewer and fewer American are working for a company 
(see GM and Ford assembling in Mexico and Asia), who cares where the 
profits are going b/c only a select few at the top are reaping those 
profits...
