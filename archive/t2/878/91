Well, Current NASCAR chassis design is closer to Formula 1 than Ford
Fairlane.  Nothing "Stock" about those tube frames.

The main goal of NASCAR is to make sure that all teams are evenly matched
so that they can take turns winning.  If a team or car wins too much,
they change the rules to slow them down.  Kind of the same philosophy as
professional wrestling!
