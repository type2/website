Hey y'all
I work at Advance Auto parts.  We used to be able to get rebuilt CV 
axles for $60 (less actually but round numbers will do).  Last week one 
of my customers called and asked if we had them and I told him of 
course, until I looked in our catalog and it said Nu-uh.  Does anyone 
out there know of another chain that carries the almost universal manual 
transmission axles for about the same price?  I'm gonna stock up.
