Subject: Re: [T2] Water Injection

Hi All,

WWII figher planes used water injection in their engines for similar 
effect.  The goal was so cool the cylinder down so that the engine 
wouldn't suffer from preignition while running the higher compression 
ratios (to get the crazy horsepower numbers they did). 

It's a fairly low amount of water used, though I can't remember (from 
books, I'm only 28 years old) if the water was injected into the head 
above the intake valve or introduced into the fuel/air flow through the 
carbs. 

It did drastically reduce the head temperature and allow for much higher 
compression ratios, without the fear of pre-ignition destroying the 
engine.  It'd sure be interesting to fit a water injection on a bus 
engine, crank up the compression and let 'er rip.
