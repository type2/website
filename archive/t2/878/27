st. louis is pretty dry.  see one orange wesey next to pop's blue moon
everyday.  never driving, always sitting.  saw a restored splitty once on 44
headed west.  just passing through of course.  went to a metro vw club show
in bellville, il.  lots of bugs.  counting mine, four busses.  i do see mine
everyday though.  she's nice.  waiting on new tires.  then everyday on the
road.

p.s.  sorry for the stream of conscious.  gin and tonic.
