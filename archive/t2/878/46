Hi BuH,

That sounds like the exact opposite of the typical routine here in  
the rust belt. As soon as the roads taste salty, the buses hide away  
for the winter. I can usually coax out a few hardcore camping  
fanatics for the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout, but the majority  
here aren't seen between November and April.

Even in the summer I can go a week or two without spotting a "wild"  
type2. Vanagons are plentiful enough, but a Baywindow spotting is  
noteworthy in these parts. A road-going splitty is a definite rarity.

Happy trails,
