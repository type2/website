	All the Vintage Car Club aces who drive 100-y-old Cadillacs 
from Auckland to Wellington have standardised rust treatment with 
RIPO.  I commend this fine product.
	The USA paint mfr Altex Devoe developed (on a commission from 
the NZ govt Ministry of Works, now abolished) Rust Inhibitive 
Penetrating Oil, the mighty RIPO. Any dry contiguous layer of rust is 
penetrated thru capillary creep  -  including crimped joins etc  - 
by sufficient RIPO squirted on any parts of that rust.

E-Z Do
	A pump oil-can is dedicated to this wondrous linseed-scented 
liquid.  Catch excess oil dripping from door drain holes etc as you 
squirt  -  filter back into can thru panty-hose of similar.  The 
volume to fill the whole body's internal rust layer with RIPO 
exceedes the volume of paint to cover that area, but the whole 
vehicle will cost you only around $20 - $40.  If you're unlucky the 
headlining will develop a brown ring from RIPO which crept up the 
door pillars.
	Overnight the light oils which give RIPO its amazing 
capillary creep evaporate, leaving a dark brown waxy layer of 
embalmed rust which admittedly can't withstand running water but in 
nearly all parts of a steel body mean the 'freezing' of that rusting 
process.

Learn to love your rust!
Bare metal is not nice!
Modern primers aren't so hot anyhow!
Stick with your rust where not structural!
RIPO it down and stop worrying!!
