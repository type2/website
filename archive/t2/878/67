N2O (nitrous oxide) was also injected into WWII aircraft engines to
compensate for the thinner air at higher altitudes...

Rolls-Royce aircraft engines were also being built under license in
the USA during WWII. One of the manufacturers, I think Packard, com-
plained about the tolerances required by the engine...In one instance
about the small precise diameter of some tubing...The boys at Rolls-
Royce, England, sent Packard a sample of the tubing...With another tube
inside it... ;-(

Rolls-Royce also used a severe form of quality control on their aircraft
engines...Some were randomly chosen from the assembly lines and run
at full throttle until it broke...It was then disassembled to find the cause
of the failure and that part was sent back to the engineers... ;-(
