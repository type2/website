Subject: Re: [T2] Where are all the busses?

When I lived in Laguna Beach and Dana Point (South OC, CA) I saw  
buses all the time. I had friends who drove buses, and usually bugs  
as well.

Plenty to be seen at Saddleback College where I went to school...not  
too many Westies, though. Mostly buses and older Splitties.

Here in Charleston, we know the majority of bus owners (what, maybe 3  
or 4???) and our buddy Snoopy owns the most (4 and a parts bus).

Still, the only bus we ever see on the road here is our own.
