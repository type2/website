I took a pair of pliers last night and tried to move the flaps some. They
seems stuck, so I pushed a little harder, then heard a little pop and now
everything moves freely. The only problem is that I can move the flaps by hand
now.... If what you say is true and I should not be able to move the flaps by
hand, then I still have a problem. I did not get your email until this
morning, so I thought I had it fixed. I will take another look today and make
sure that the spring is working right. The spring does return the flaps to the
open position, just without much force. With the force of the fan, I figured
that this would be fine.

As for the thermostat itself. I looked at other pics on the web and I think
that this might be a type 1 thermostat. At least that is what it looks like. I
am going to take it off today and try to clean it up and verify that it is
working. I should be able to tell for sure if it has already been changed to a
type 1 before.

Thanks,
Corbett
