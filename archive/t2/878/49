Water  injection will be pursued first.  The 'type 2' 
archives don't seem to  hold many answers for how to do this along the 
lines of my article on my  webpage.  I fail to understand how inlet 
vacuum can be used to  achieve not only retard but also advance; more 
to the point, I'm not sure  where to slap in the water in my 'W' carb 
which appears to have only vac  retard.  Has anyone worked out these 
puzzles so I don't have  to?



Hello Robert  I have done the water injection and it works very well  except 
that you have to keep putting water in there  :)      The way it works is to 
make a hooka   system pipe. Use a very strong bottle not soft plastic as it 
will suck it  together, put  a two hole stopper on top. get an air stone like 
that used  in aquaiums , put this on the inlet pipe thur one hole and down to the 
bottom of  the bottle , now if you were smoking this would have a bowl on 
top, the other  hole has an outlet pipe that just goes thur the stopper  but not 
into the  water, run a hose with a valve in it to a port below the carb. fill 
with water  and start the engine, dial the action using the valve in the 
outlet hose so that  you get just water vapors and drive.   Later and have fun
