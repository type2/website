Consider it confirmed.  Toyota pulled out because they're  concentrating on their new NASCAR entry next year.  They're going  to make waves there.  And the big three haven't run Indy in a  while.  I guess that makes Indy cars more 'Stock' than  NASCAR.  Cheers...KR

BTW, I "think" every car in this years Indy Race has a Honda engine...
Anyone confirm this...?-)
