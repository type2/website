Subject: New Carb woes - warning!! and still have the problem

I never did fix the hot start with the new carb, but after some trawling the web found that someone with the same carb (Pierburg) found that it was dumping fuel so I dipped my oil and it was easy 1/2" above the max mark - gulp! a crank case full of oil/fuel mix.  Needless to say I took the carb back to the shop (GSF - UK) and they refunded me and gave me an oil change.  I then bought another old solex, rebuilt it, stuck it on - back to the old problem : ( great starter, great at speed, lowsy at take off/idle.  I figure it *must* be an air leak somewhere or something...  but all the inlet system checks out, new gaskets, rubber boots.  Does get better when run for a long time e.g. > 10-20 miles, great after a workout on 
the motorway.  Could there be a crack somewhere ?
