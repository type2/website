Subject: Re: [T2] Where are all the busses?

I agree, I don't see too many daily drivers.  I drive from Newport, RI to 
Groton, CT (120 mi round trip) at least 3 x a week.  I rarely see any busses on 
RT95.  Here in Newport there are 2 others on the road and at least 3 just 
parked that never move. All 3 of us now are waiting for the parts. 
Today however, I drove to Old Mystic,CT Buses By The Mill IV.  My son and I 
took a drive down. It was nice to see some other busses. Nice group of people. 
So I guess they are out there, just have to look close.
