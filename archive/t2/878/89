No, Ford claimed that it was faulty tires made by Firestone.  _Firestone_
claimed that the failures were caused by Ford's low inflation pressure
recommendations, prompted by ride quality complaints.

I tend to believe Firestone, since Ford pickups that used the exact same
tire at higher inflation pressures didn't have any tire problems.
