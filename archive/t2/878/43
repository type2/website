Subject: Re: [T2]fri - Where are all the busses?

We test drove a 65 kombi to the local  weekly VW get together last  night and 
when we got to the cafe parking lot there was 4 other splitties and a  bay.  
Not sure what the count is in this area but I know around Greensboro  NC we 
have over a dozen splitties and many more bays running the roads on a  regular 
basis with a very high Vanagon count.
