   You want "real" racing, try the Gumball Rally where rich
boys and girls race their toys on open unprotected roads...
If it wasn't for the TV coverage (of the "race" and the 
nightly partying) these guys and gals would be in night
court... It's the same crap you wanted to "try" when you
first got your license but couldn't afford the lawyers to
keep you out of jail... ;-(
