Subject: Re: [T2] Crash test ratings?

I was sitting still in my Ford Taurus SHO and got rear ended by an 18  year old kid.  Totalled the SHO.  But the judge threw the  book at the kid.  Put him on probation, made him go to driving  school, etc.  I doubt it would have done that much damage in the  bus but it quite possibly would have ended up on its side.  I  heard his tires squeal as I was getting ready to turn left and  accelerated to get out of his way.  So when he hit me it spun the  car around and into a ditch.  I can't see the bus spinning like  that.   I'm going to have to put in retractable seat belts as  I hate the static ones and can't seem to make myself use them all of  the time.   Just for short jaunts I rarely wear them.   And that is where you're most likely to get hit.  The SHO was  sitting at the end of my street!   I must say, I do feel much  safer in the bus in general.  Because I rarely go very fast in  it.  I've had a lot of hot cars in my life (no, not stolen) and  cringe when I think of
 some of the stupid things I've done in  them.  But boy it was sure fun at the time.  Now I feel more  like Ralph Cramden than Mario Andretti.  But that's just  fine.

Hey, we're fine. Assuming you are sitting at a red light and a wall hits 
you at 35 mph you'll be okay. It is when some sort of shaped thing like 
a truck or heavy car hits the single layer of sheet metal nose gets 
punctured that you are in trouble...
