Subject: Re: [T2]fri - Where are all the busses?

I'm surprised at just how few busses there are around here. I think I've
seen a total of 5 different ones on the road (and I know a couple other bus
owners as well that I've never seen on the road other than meeting up) since
I moved out here at the beginning of 05. It blows my mind because the west
coast image of Colorado is hippy central. At least, that's the image I
always had.
