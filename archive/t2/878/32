Subject: RE: [T2]fri - Where are all the busses?

Manage to run across a gentleman with a 59 panel the other day at the local
DIY store that was in very nice condition.  Was nice to see.

But yea, in general there aren't many in the Denver metro area that I see.
Boulder is a whole different ball game.  I see a few every time I head up
there.

I see the same three rust buckets parked on my way to work every day.  
Rarely do I see one rolling.  The ones I do see rolling aren't near as 
nice as mine.
