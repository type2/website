An ol' 71 I had pulsed or at least sent some vibrations back thru' the
brake pedal...It was the first sign of a front beam that was internally
rusted at the shock/damper mount uprights...Any movement in the
beam will transmit thru' the master cylinder to the pedal...It's a long
shot but something to check out...
