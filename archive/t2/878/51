Subject: Pulsing brake pedal problem ?

Just been through a lengthy process to fit albatross adjusters to my 
'71.  Dropped the rear one spline and the front accordingly.  Bus has 
factory servo brakes as it's from the US and brakes were perfect before 
job. 

Now the pedal pulses a bit when I brake, less obvious if I stand on the 
brakes.  What swrong ???? Sounds like a warped disc or something? but 
they can't warp lying on the garage floor! I didn't disturb the 
hydraulics on the system so it is in theory the same as before.  Of 
course all the discs etc have been off and put back on (including the 
rear drums), but since the wheel bolts ensure all these components bed 
up then it's not that they're loose.  I didn't even take the disc off 
the hubs just undid the bearings and removed the lot.

Any ideas ? braking was great before, whilst it's still as effective, it 
shouldn't pulse the pedal. :(
