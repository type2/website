As I understand it, compressed natural gas (CNG) has an octane rating of about
130. It seems that a turbocharged 2800+cc Type 4 engine with, say, a 14.5:1
compression ratio, running CNG and water-injection would be pretty hard to
beat.

A friend of mine who has a VW shop in Texas won some major national sand drag
races running a sand dragster with a supercharged 2400+ cc VW Type I motor,
using methanol as the fuel. The V8 Chevy guys really resented the fact that a
VW-powered dragster was kicking their butts. Seems like CNG (which is
primarily methane) would a be a simpler and better fuel to use than methanol
or propane.
