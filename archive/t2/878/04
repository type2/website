Subject: RE: cooling flaps on T2

This might have answered my question about the amount of force used to open
the flaps. Maybe mine is fine now. If I push on the tab that holds the cable,
the flaps open and close smoothly, but without a lot of force. Enough that I
thought they were working. I currently do not have the cable hooked up since
the screw is stripped, hope to fix that today and get this thermostat issue
fixed.

thanks for the help,
Corbett
