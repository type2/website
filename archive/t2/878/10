Subject: Where are all the busses?

Hi All, 

Since driving my bus for about 2 months now, I've come to the conclusion
that there's only about 1 other bus in this area (Pasco County, Florida)
that anybody actually *drives*  I've seen a handful parked in driveways,
on the sides of houses, and even 1 at a less-than-reputable repair shop,
gathering rust as it sits quietly in the weeds.   

But I've only seen 1 other bus on the road.  It's a powder-blue bus with
a white top, and seems to be in really good shape.  There's  1 or 2
Vanagons running around, but they're far and few between.   

Am I just in a void of busses?
