Subject: RE: FW: Re: [T2]fri - Where are all the busses?

I'm outside of Fredericksburg VA and since January I have seen 0 buses on the
road. I have seen 2 vanagons one with out of state plates. It's pretty void
here also.


I live closer to N. Virginia, and I rarely see buses as well, but as Bob pointed out, it's because people just don't use them as daily drivers anymore. Drive my bus on daily basis in the Washington, DC area? Hell no! I have a company vehicle as well as a Honda Element. Just go to the Bug Out, Everybus, Natural Bus, John Brown's Buses, etc., you'll see there are still plenty of them around, just used for "special occasions" now. My wife always asks me why our new cars sit outside while my 2 VW's stay in the garage (a '75 Westy and a '74 S. Beetle conv.), to which I always answer "Because they are like land, they ain't making no more of them". We can always get another Honda/Mitsubishi.           Jeff
