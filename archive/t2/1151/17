Subject: Re: [T2] Head studs

I used Chevy headstuds and tap/tap handle. Used red Loctite. had to 
drill the holes in the head out a little, careful not to go any deeper 
(easier than you think). I also had to drill out the headers a little. 
Used it all as an opportunity to machine the mating surfaces of the 
header pipes with a hand file.

Has anyone ever cured their header warpage by heating the pipes cherry 
red with a torch and torquing them down with clean edges and new gaskets?
