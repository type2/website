Subject: RE: [T2] Creaking noise right front wheel

Hi Daniel,
Looks like you need to pull the wheel and find out.  It could be anything from
a loose bearing to a broken return-spring.Only way to be sure is to look for
yourself or take it somewhere and pay somebody else to do it.  Or you could
wait until whatever is complaining finally gives-way :^)
I would probably pump the beam full of grease first though, just to eliminate
that as a possibility.
