Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS Shout-out: Transmission Interchange

Got the engine and transmission removed.

Problem was a broken pience in the nosecone, the top half of the "u"
shaped braked which holds the pin with the springs in place had broken
off.

It's a 215mm clutch so the 3 rib should swap right in.

Hope the studs on this engine won't be too long to deal with the 3
rib. We'll see, I'm picking up the "new" transmission at 6pm tonight.

Thanks
jules
