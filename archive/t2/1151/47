 Sounds normal to me.  As with ALL bowden tube cable assemblies, the tube
thatthe cable runs through MUST be able to compress or lengthen or the cable
would constantly bein tension and would apply or release whatever it was
attached to whenever theconnections moved.  That is why there is "free play"
on the clutch cable so theclutch doesn't disengage when you accelerate.  Same
for the brakes. Yes, the cables ARE being adjusted, but only to compensate for
suspension movement.  Larry ............... back at the barnI am the Short
