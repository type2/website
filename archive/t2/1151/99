Really? I assume that's with no stopping/restarting....which if she 
brins her bus too, we could jump,  So I would think the fuel pump has 
the biggest draw- along with injectors, coil, etc.  I have a new 
battery, and we will drive it for an hour and see the voltage drop.

  I'd feel safe for 4 easily with a good spare at hand fully charged
