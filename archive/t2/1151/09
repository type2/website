Subject: Re: [T2] Head studs

Eron, this is real, real, tricky, and may not be salvageable.
 
Nothing but some type of metal repair is going to do it.  No epoxy/locktite is
going to hold up to the temps.  And it will only get worse with bodge
attempts.  Problem is that in order to alleviate this issue, they went to a
8/9mm stud in later years, so the 9mm diameter in the head is already
dangerously close to being too big for the boss, let alone if you overtap for
an insert.  Although generally I don't prefer them, here helicoil (or your
favorite equivalent) wire insert is you best shot.  You overtap it (which is
MASSIVE and nearly through the wall toward the inside of the port) and insert
the insert and then the stud.  In point of fact with manufacturing toleranes,
sometimes the overtap is through the wall and it is all toast.
 
Careful consideration though of your exact damage, if you didn't booger the
whole thing, you might get by with a new 8/9mm stud, chasing carefully,
torqueing perfectly, but unless you can gaurantee AT LEAST 5-6 full depth
solid threads in the aluminum, you will just be F'ing yourself for later.  If
you do try that I'd insert the stud and seat the gaskets with the ceramic
paste exhaust jointing compound they sell for Porsche.  Sometimes people will
only screw up the last few threads though not knowing that the stepped stud is
there which won't easily back through most exhaust flanges and they actually
kill it when trying to unscrew one without all the bolts and the whole
manifold lossening up together.
 
Best repair is a little MIG/TIG weld, retap when heads are off.
 
Oh and of course if this is lucky enough to be a 1700 with 8mm studs, then it
is easily repairable with a helicoil almost all the time.
