Subject: Re: [T2] Re: alternator charge light 1971 bus with alternator

there must be a std imperial socket that fits.. as I don't own a 32mm
socket.. but it appears the 1-1/4" is between my 30mm and 36mm ??
I think the 1-1/4" fits

as for the regulator.. I just gave half a dozen alternators away so I can't
look at them for you,, but iirc , it should be easy to pull the 4 screws out
right in the vehicle.  ...
