Subject: tank cover lid

Hi

I am looking for a tank cover lid for a bay window t2ab (71) including
the hinges (thats not the cap, the 71 Model has a lid on top as in
most modern cars). The previous owner had the glorious idea to remove
it in order to have the color of the van determined. And lost it
somewhere in the process... I scanned switzerland for it but to no
avail. Does anyone know where I could get a replacement? Thanks :)

Cheers!

Daniel
