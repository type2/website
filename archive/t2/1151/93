Subject: 79 bus Front Transmission mount question

Are there differences in the front transmission mount between  
different years of manufacture?  I'm talking about the the piece that  
bolts to the transmission nosecone and contains the fork that clamps  
to the chassis when installed???  A few years back I purchased a  
rebuilt transmission from German Transaxle on an exchange basis for my  
old one.  I left the mount on my old transmission when I sent it in.  
When I got the rebuilt unit, it came without the transmission mount.   
They happily supplied me with a replacement when I informed them of  
the situation but I am suspicious that the mount they supplied is  
different than the original.

anyway!

Ever since then, the replacement mount that they send does not seem  
quite right for 3 reasons:  1.  The studs in the nosecone onto which  
the mount is bolted do not seem quite long enough with the mount is  
installed (i.e.e the mount plate seems too thick for the studs).  The  
threads no not quite reach all the through the nuts that hold the  
mount onto the nosecone studs. Seens like there should be a couple of  
threads that extend past the end of the nut when fully tightened.    
2.  No matter how much I try adjusting, the gearshift lever is always  
up against the emergency brake when in first and third.  It was not  
this way with the old transmission/mount.  3.  I have difficulty  
fitting the transmission in-between the front and rear mounts when  
installing the transmission/engine.  I can eventually get it to fit  
but it is always a struggle.

The transmission has worked great otherwise (thanks German Transaxle)  
but I think that I might have gotten a a mount that was intended for a  
different year (3 rib vs 5 rib?).
