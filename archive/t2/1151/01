Hi Monty,

That blower has power at all times, the switch  (on the defroster lever 
at the dash) grounds it to complete the circuit. It's possible you have 
some other wire under the dash grounding that lever or else there is a 
ground fault elsewhere on the line between the blower and the dashboard.


Happy Trails,
