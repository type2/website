Scott,

You only need one port. Don't tap the other one, there is no advantage to
teeing the two. The vacuum port on dual Dellortos should be on the left hand
(driver's side) carb.

FYI, Dells for Porsche engines did not have a vacuum port on either carb,
since they typically used mechanical advance distributors. They are easily
used on a VW by drilling and tapping the left carb (or right carb if someone
wants to go agains the grain).
