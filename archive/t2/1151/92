Subject: How far/long can you drive with no charging system?

Red alternator light glowing with charging voltage not rising.  Put in 
new regulator today (Bosch from Spain) and then light would not come on, 
no charging. Tried that new regulator in daughter's bus, light came on, 
and it did charge.  Found an old used regulator, the light does glow 
with that one- why not with the new one? So alternator is bad or 
something in wiring is not right.  Is there a way to test the alternator 
output independent of the regulator?
We have two spare used alternators- is there a way to test them before 
installing?
    We had planned to go to Granny Grose's campout this weekend- and I 
don't have time to switch oputy the alternator. Can one drive 4 hours 
(180 mi) on just the battery and a spare if the lights are not used?  We 
can use a charger once there.  Or I could take the daughter's hardtop 
and use a tent- but I hear it can rain this weekend.
