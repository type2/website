Subject: puzzling stoppage

	Last night I experienced several sudden stoppages such as I'd 
never heard of.

	1600dp, Bosch alternator (original AFAIK); battery 1 y old, 
no hint of trouble to date.
	Engine warmed up, pulling nicely (only just run in from 
rebuild).  Discharge warning light comes on very bright (brighter 
than it shows at switch-on), then goes off as does everything else 
electrical.  Stomp down cluthc, coast to stop without traffic 
conflict (tho' at two of the incidents there was some degree of 
hazard).  Four-way flasher will not switch on.  During a few minutes, 
sit switched off; try to switch on ignition &/or lights  -  no go. 
Then a further attempt evokes the warning lights as usual, and the 
starter cranks the engine; a few sec cranking required for start (as 
if there'd been a small vapour-lock; normally, starting is immediate).
	This sudden stoppage without warning can obviously cause what 
is known in the USA as a wreck.  Can anyone explain what to do to 
prevent it?

thanx
