If you tip the trans,, bellhousing up,,  it makes it easy to remove all the
nuts,, and the fluid won't need to be drained,, sometime the vent will leak
a little near the nose cone... but you can deal with that..

and , myself, I have great luck re using the original gaskets,, be carefull
not to damage it when removing the bellhousing..
