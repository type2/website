Subject: AIRS Shout-out: Transmission Interchange

Howdy,

Any know what modifications would be necessary to put a 3-Rib 002
transmission from a '73 into a '75 with a 5--Rib 002?

I'd imagine perhaps the bellhousing would need to be moved over to
accommodate a potentially larger clutch on my 2liter GD engine (wish I
knew what was in there, looks like I'm probably finding out soon).

Thanks in advance
