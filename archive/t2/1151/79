	The vacuum regime in either one of those carbs will do 
whatever can be done at the distributor.  For that purpose, there 
would be no point in tapping the other carb for vacuum.

	*HOWEVER* :  if that vacuum ports happen to be a good place 
to allow water to be sucked in (a question on which I have no data 
and therefore no opinion, but my guess is it's the first place to 
try), then you certainly should  NOT  slap water into just half the 
engine, so you'll have to do what you say with a T union.
	I have the Brasilian Weber, and only one of them, so I look 
fw to hearing from any SVDA exponents who try that vac port for 
water-injection.
