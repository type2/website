Mark,

No idea how you were able to get the nosecone out without removing the
transmission, I can't get the thing to clear the axle tube.

Looks like a strong possibility of dropping the entire transmission
and engine out.

And since I'm going to have it all taken out, I'm wondering if I
should just drop some good known parts in....

Feeling a bit stressed and frazzled, 700 miles from home, but I've met
up with a local bus owner who has opened up her house and garage for
me to use until the situation is resolved. And she's been calling
around all afternoon trying to help me find parts... to no avail so
far.

They are keeping me laughing and smiling. Some bus drivers are just amazing.
