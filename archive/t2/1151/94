carry a spare battery, 4 hrs with a fuel injected bus is gonna be pushing 
the limit, especially if you have to use wipers (and some states require 
lights with wipers)

take three batteries and have a jumper so your daughters bus can recharge 
the extra battery.   should make it but having that extra battery will 
sure make you sweat less.

have fun then get it fixed.

me I welding and welding and doing some more welding on my van, trying to 
get new metal on faster than it is rusting away.

trying to get mine ready for a week long trip the end of June.  still 
having the lousy fuel mileage, got a oxy sensor but still need to get the 
bung welded into the exhaust, hopefully next week, then can start phutzing 
with the AFM.  still I shouldn't have to do this.


have fun
