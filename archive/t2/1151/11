Hi Greg,

I think you're on the right track concerning the lock mechanicals
being at fault.

I once had a lock where the lock stub that fits into the plastic
switch was so worn that it could not turn the switch far enough to
start. Pull the switch and turn it with a screwdriver, and worked
fine.

Since your steering wheel doesn't lock, it would indicate that motion
inside the lock is restricted.

John
