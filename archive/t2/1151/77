Neat blog, thanks for the link and photo. 

I just ordered the cables, figure I might as well replace them on both sides
while I'm at it.

I think on the '69  I need to get that large castle nut off, hopefully not
too hard.

Ps - That is neat that you can get waxoyl in a pressurized can. I have read
pretty good stuff about that, but can't find it here in the states, except
in large quanitities.

As far as I know, if it's threaded on the cable, it comes with the cable. 
That includes the black cover and metal end bits. Once you get the hub off, 
changing them is reasonably easy. I took a photo of the inside of the hubs 
for my blog:

On a 71 you just undo a bolt on the front of the drum. Great news as on my 
Beetle you have to undo a big hub nut with a large socket and 6ft of 
scafolding pole !

Good luck.

Phil
