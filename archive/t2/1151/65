Subject: [T2] Creaking noise right front wheel

hi,

my t2ab [71] is making this creaking noise lately. it's coming from
somewhere near the front right wheel, whenever i run over a bump or I
am on a bumpy road.
it's really bad when going slow (inner city traffic) and dissapears
when on the highway.
however, the creaking noise does not appear when i am on the brakes
nor when i am going over a bump in reverse.

first thing i did was to exchange the shock absorbers, but that didn't
change a thing. what worries me, is that the creaking noise gets worse
and worse. does anyone have an idea what might be the cause?

thanks!

daniel
