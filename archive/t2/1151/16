Subject: Re: alternator charge light 1971 bus with alternator

About the 1971 bus with internally regulated alternator.  Sorry its
taken me a while to get back to everybody. i've checked with my
friends and nobody seem to have a 36mm socket and i can't find one for
sale.

i remember reading something about changing the voltage regulator with
the alternator in the bus but you needed a 90 degre screw driver. i
can get the screw driver.  is that possible? Or am i miss  remembering
or simply miss understood?  Or just wishful thinking?

Thanks,

alvaro
