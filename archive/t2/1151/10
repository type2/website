Subject: RE: [T2] Head studs

The loose stud didn't damage the threads in the head at all.  The nut just
overpowered the torque applied to the stud itself!  I'll probably grab a new
grade 8 (10?) stud and re-install.  Any reccomendations on stud types?
Thanks all!

Careful consideration though of your exact damage, if you didn't booger the
whole thing, you might get by with a new 8/9mm stud, chasing carefully,
torqueing perfectly, but unless you can gaurantee AT LEAST 5-6 full depth
solid threads in the aluminum, you will just be F'ing yourself for later.  If
you do try that I'd insert the stud and seat the gaskets with the ceramic
paste exhaust jointing compound they sell for Porsche.  Sometimes people will
only screw up the last few threads though not knowing that the stepped stud is
there which won't easily back through most exhaust flanges and they actually
kill it when trying to unscrew one without all the bolts and the whole
manifold lossening up together.

Best repair is a little MIG/TIG weld, retap when heads are off.
