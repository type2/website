Subject: Re: [T2] Creaking noise right front wheel

Last year, during an extensive trip through the southwest, my bus (1970) 
also developed a similar right front suspension squeak that almost drove me 
crazy.  I greased the front beam but it didn't help.  But, over time, it did 
go away, can't tell you why;  but my theory has always been that some dust 
or sand got into things during my travels and eventually worked its way out.

The most sage advice that I got was in Santa Fe, where I found a VW 
mechanic.  "These front ends are tough," he said. "See if it just won't go 
away."

And it did.
