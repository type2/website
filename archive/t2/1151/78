Subject: Dellorto DRLA Vacuum port

I have an 1800cc 74 Bus and dual 40mm Dellorto DRLA carbs. One
carb has a vacuum port, the other does not but it appears to be ready
for one simply by drilling out the plug in the boss. I want to switch
to a SVDA distributor. Is there any advantage to adding the 2nd vac
port and tee-ing the two together?

Or should I just use the one vacuum port?

Thanks,
Scott Busby
