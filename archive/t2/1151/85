Chris,

Yes. You should tap two intakes with a NPT barbed fitting and tee them into  
your booster line. Just make sure to tap into opposing fire cylinders, like  
#1 & #3 (the most common).

Some say tap all four and tee into one, but honestly I havent been able to  
tell the difference.

Some will also say the factory Solex system only used one port (left carb),  
but since that system was crap it is best to balance the vacuum pressure  
between both sides when running a MUCH higher performance carburetor (in my  
opinion).
