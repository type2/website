Subject: Norcal Relics in Woodland, CA

Hi all:

Looking for Eric at Norcal Relics in Woodland, CA.  The phone I have is 
disconnected.  Anyone here in touch with him?

I'm looking for a full set of tin and maybe a left heat exchanger for my 
78 CA 2.0 Fuel-injected.

Don't ask <sigh> where the other tin went....

BEN
