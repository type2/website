chris I think you could improve it, but would be pretty hard to get enough of
a section cherry red to really move/stay easy, a forge might be more
appropriate than oxy/acetylene.   Plus I think it might go back with cycles of
heat, so better to me to let it keep its set and do this.
 
Tried and true to me is simple.  Buddy/you/dad with a long belt sander (or
even disc, my dad has a 15" diameter one) and hit both flanges until flat and
even with 40 grit or so.    I unfortunately have nothing long enough up here,
would have to jig a set in the mill, and mill them off, which I've done in the
past, but defines overkill, and is harder than it should be to do as those
frigging flanges are hard as hell and you got to just skim them because if you
try to take too much cut the mill grabs and wrecks the setup.
