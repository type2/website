There is one bodge that might work for you:

Loctitie makes a ceramic thread repair kit that worked for me on a 
couple occasions.

Search for" *Loctite* 28654 Form-A-*Thread* Stripped *Thread Repair Kit*"

I used this to repair the threads for my cam adjuster on an aircooled 
Honda motorcycle and it lasted about ten years that I know of. That was 
positioned right on the hot part of the head so it saw plenty of hot days.

I also repaired one Type IV head stud this way that had partial threads 
left (something to hang on to). The other head studs (not all pulled) I 
converted to Chevy studs.

I figured it was worth the effort and if it didn't work I'd use 
something more "real" after it failed. The key though is to hope that it 
doesn't fail 150 miles from nowhere... LOL!

Pretty simple, you coat the bolt in a release agent in the kit and then 
with the thread repair cement. Insert into the head and allow to dry. 
The thread release allows you to remove the stud later but you may feel 
that you'd be just plain happy to not be able to remove the stud 
(although if the stud ever broke...). I used the release agent.

I drove the Type IV for a couple years like that before I pulled it for 
the Corvair implant.
