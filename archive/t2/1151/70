Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS Shout-out: Broken down on US6 (-at-) OH/IN border

Picked up a 3 rib 002 from a local VW guy, Rick of the LEAKOIL clan
here on the OH/IN border. He sold it for what I though was a
reasonable price of $250.

It's in and working fine. No modifications were required other than
moving over the clutch spring, the  one on the new engine was broken.
Did clean it up a bit, topped off the fluid, and picked up enough
fluid to do a change somewhere down the road.

The verdict on the original 5-rib was a broken "U" bracket in the
nosecone. Will likely pick up the 5-Rib on the way back through here,
might consider fixing it, but third syncro on that one is pretty shot,
and I'm liking being able to shift into 3rd at any RPM with this new
transmission. Might fix the nosecone part for spare, and remove the
215mm bellhousing, I've recently learned these are sought after by 091
users so that they can use the cheaper starters and clutch assemblies.
I had no idea. That or it would be a good core for a rebuild. Hard to
send to the scrap yard.

Anyone know if the the gearing on the 3-rib (73?) and the 5-rib are
pretty close?

Tomorrow back on the road westward, next way-point should be somewhere
in Wisconsin. Hopefully no more AIRS calls on this trip!
