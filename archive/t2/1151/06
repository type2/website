I would suspect a massive short circuit somewhere. John's supposition about 
the battery may be correct as you did not have a fire. Look carefully at all 
your wiring. Remove the battery and check it out thoroughly. Bounce it 
around a little and give it a good shake in case there is something that may 
dislodge internally.
