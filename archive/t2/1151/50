I'll have to disagree a little.

That's not true.  The tube must be able to bend, but it must *not* be 
able to compress or lengthen otherwise it would mess up the whole 
geometry - 

Try taking all of the free play out of ANY clutch cable on ANY car and
you will be 
buying a clutch sooner rather than later.  As the suspension moves the
flexible part will
flatten or bow more to take up the slack.

That is my take on this.  The situation that started this thread seems
normal to me.
