Subject: Iginition key is stuck

Hi Volks,

Colleen took the westfakia to work today, and when she went to leave the 
parking lot on her way home this evening the bus died just as she was 
turning out of her parking space.

I went to investigate, and discovered that the key will rotate in the 
cylinder slightly, but will not engage the ignition or starter. It won't 
come out, either. The Steering does not lock, regardless of the rotation 
of the wheel.

I know I have a spare ignition switch around here SOMEPLACE, but I 
couldn't lay hands on it during the brief gathering of tools before I 
headed to see what was going on. At the time I thought it might actually 
be in the bus, but that proved not to be the case.

So it's either the electrical half of the switch is pooched, or it's a 
problem with the mechanical key-and-tumblers part. Or possibly both. We 
left the bus where it was; I will go back and work on it some more 
tomorrow. I know I can "hot-wire" it using a replacement for the 
electrical half of the switch; just have to find that switch or buy 
another. After that I will work out what to do about the key.

Any other ideas would be welcome.

Happy Trails,
