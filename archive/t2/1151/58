Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS Shout-out: Transmission Interchange

Depends upon which flywheel you have in there.  If the 228mm, you will 
need to swap bellhousings AND starters (pretty sure).  If 215mm (stock 
75) then you can use the 73 or 75 bellhousings (they may be identical, 
I'm not sure but they do interchange).  It would be safest to reuse the 
bellhousing you have on there now, that way you wouldn't have to 
think/worry about anything.  It's easy to swap them over but you will 
need to refill the fluid afterwards and use a new tranny-to-bellhousing 
gasket.  If you don't have a gasket, I think you can use permatex 3D or 
other form-a-gasket in a pinch - I'd say your situation qualifies.  :-)
