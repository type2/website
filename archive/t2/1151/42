Subject: emergency brake under load?

Last weekend I went to pick up some mulch with my '69 singlecab.

 

With the truck loaded with about 1 yard of mulch, the emergency/parking
brake seemed tighter. I am thinking this is a symptom of something, but not
sure what. Inother words, without the load, when I pull the
emergency/parking  brake the handle goes a certain distance (x). When the
truck is loaded the brake handle only goes about 1/2  the distance (1/2 x).

 

Any ideas on the cause of this, or what I should be checking.
