Subject: Top Gear's Richard Hammond just bought a Danbury Baywindow!!

Hi Volks,

Given Hammond's fame as a TV celebrity I would expect an increase in 
interest in Bays after this, even if his model wasn't aircooled.

It'll be interesting to see what he thinks of it come September...

Happy Trails,
