That's not true.  The tube must be able to bend, but it must *not* be 
able to compress or lengthen otherwise it would mess up the whole 
geometry - this is why these tubes are made in such a way that they 
cannot compress, but wound in a way that allows them to bend.  This is 
exactly the same way that a bicycle brake or gear changer system works - 
if the cable sleeve lengthened or shortened, your gears would be 
shifting all over the place and your braking would be funky.

I think the free is more so there isn't constant pressure on the 
throwout bearing - it has nothing to do with accelerating/decelerating - 
like I mentioned above, the cable length and sleeve length should never 
change relative to each other.

And just like when you turn your handle bar on a bike, it's not 
adjusting for anything other than the cables/sleeves are bending - 
that's it.  The braking system on the bus works in exactly the same manner.

Now, flexing/lengthening of the chassis due to excessive weight would in 
turn make the cable shorter relative to the previous chassis length 
(assuming the sleeve was in-fact lengthening) and cause the brake to 
tighten up, but I think further investigation/test is warranted as to 
the exact cause.
