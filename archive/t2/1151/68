Subject: Creaking

 I would look at the things that work when turning.Ball Joints and Tie rod
ends.  Neither of them havelube fittings from the factory. With the engine off
and rear wheels blocked in both directions, lay under the front of thebus
while a friend turns the steering wheel to and fro.... listen for the
creaking, and eitherput your fingers or a long screwdriver or a piece of hose
to whatever you suspect is making thenoise.On my 75 the noise was from the tie
rod ends.... 35 years old!!!   Larry ............... back at the barnI am the
