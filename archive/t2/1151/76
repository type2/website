Subject: re:Park Brake

I've poked around the samba, and the Bentley. It looks like the parking
brake cable casing I see near the wheel is part of the emergency brake
cable? So if I buy some new cables, they should come with those casings-and
I can replace it all. 

 

I also see I may need a puller to remove the rear drums, is this something I
should be able to get at a FLAPS, from the free loan a tool, or is this a VW
specific puller, or will I even need a puller? This is on my '69 single cab.


 

Thanks for tips on this procedure, I like to know as much as possible before
beginning, so I'm prepared.or as prepared as I can be.
