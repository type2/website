Hi John,
            I have a mount for my die grinder that can be clamped in a
collet.  I mainly use it in the compound on the lathe for quick ID work. 
"Poor mans"  tool post grinder.  My real tool post grinder is inconvenient to
hang from the quill.  Does a very good job on hard surfaces.  If you get a
manifold surface close to true in the mill set up, the grinding point wont
have to do much work, and wont wear enough to change over a couple of manifold
surfaces. If you want it dead nutz you could run the grinding point over a
fixed diamond truing point before every pass, like the gear grinders do. 
Waaay overkill.

I too, like the belt sander approach for that process. There is/was a shop in
Anc on Goverment Hill that had the cylinder-head sized one.  Probably plenty
of others.  Should be easy enough to make up a 2x4 rig to hold a home belt
sander upside down and true to a flat surface large enough to do a Type IV
manifold.  Plenty good to do a few manifolds.

would have to jig a set in the mill, and mill them off, which I've done in
the
past, but defines overkill, and is harder than it should be to do as those
frigging flanges are hard as hell and you got to just skim them because if
you
try to take too much cut the mill grabs and wrecks the setup.
