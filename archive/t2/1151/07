Same thing happened to me, Robert, and I pulled my hair for the longest time
trying to diagnose it before giving up and taking it to my mechanic.  He said
he couldn't find anything wrong, but he took the ground strap off and put it
back on.  Problem disappeared.

Good luck,
Jerry

Last night I experienced several sudden stoppages such as I'd
never heard of.

1600dp, Bosch alternator (original AFAIK); battery 1 y old,
no hint of trouble to date.
Engine warmed up, pulling nicely (only just run in from
rebuild).  Discharge warning light comes on very bright (brighter
than it shows at switch-on), then goes off as does everything else
electrical.  Stomp down cluthc, coast to stop without traffic
conflict (tho' at two of the incidents there was some degree of
hazard).  Four-way flasher will not switch on.  During a few minutes,
sit switched off; try to switch on ignition &/or lights  -  no go.
Then a further attempt evokes the warning lights as usual, and the
starter cranks the engine; a few sec cranking required for start (as
if there'd been a small vapour-lock; normally, starting is immediate).
This sudden stoppage without warning can obviously cause what
is known in the USA as a wreck.  Can anyone explain what to do to
prevent it?

thanx
