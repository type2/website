Michael ,
 
I've gone about 4-5 hours, nothing but ignition, no lights, no
radio/acessories obviously, and with only a moderate quality battery.  I'd
feel safe for 4 easily with a good spare at hand fully charged, but consider
carefully where you have to pull off, how likely you are to die and all.  A
good auto electric shop (hell maybe even autozone or advanced if they have it
in their book for their tester) should be able to load test one of the others,
even being externally regulated.
 
As to the regulator glow/no glow etc, wouldn't put much stock in it, I presume
the newer are solid state (last one I bought was) so what that has to do with
the lamp glowing, or not, vs an old relay style one, who the hell knows.

old used regulator, the light does glow with that one- why not with the new
one? So alternator is bad or something in wiring is not right.  Is there a way
to test the alternator output independent of the regulator?
We have two spare used alternators- is there a way to test them before
installing?
   We had planned to go to Granny Grose's campout this weekend- and I don't
have time to switch oputy the alternator. Can one drive 4 hours (180 mi) on
just the battery and a spare if the lights are not used?  We can use a charger
once
