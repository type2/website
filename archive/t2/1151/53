Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon engine install

Tom I swear to god, I'd pull the tranny myself (a joke except the outboard CVs
and they aren't usually that bad) assemble on ground/jacks, then hang it as an
assembly.  It is a joke to do in the vanagon with only 3 mount points, SO much
easier than on a bus, and only involves you needing to pull the half shafts,
and it is a great time to repack the CVs.  But it is easy enough to pivot down
the tranny and slide the engine on as well, so the choice is yours. 
Automatics I wouldn't pull the tranny since no aligning.   At one point, I
could one man single handed pull an air cooled vanagon engine/tranny assembly
in under 60 minutes start to finish with air tools, and put one in in no more
than 90, and I'm talking everything ready to run, just a bit more time with
hand tools on a sheet of plywood, on dirt even.  Need to have the rear of the
van up on ramps, even if you jack it onto ramps in multiple steps, or at least
the equivalent of that height. 
 Good floor jack and a 2' chunk of 2x10/12 balanced under the engine/tranny is
all you need, and a surface to roll it on.
