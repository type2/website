I've put my Stanford Hall VW show pictures up on Flickr here:

It was incredibly busy but I feel that the number of stalled selling 
"related" items is starting to outnumber the number of real stalls, 
especially the amateur selling off bits from his garage.

Also, why do people who you wouldn't think could work a screwdriver rush to 
an event about classic VW's ? Are the two related ?
