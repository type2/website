Subject: RE: [T2] Dual Port 1600 versus Single Port

Well Eron has a point, and not strictly super uncommon.  There were a fair
number of aftermarket, often cheapo chrome "dress up" manifolds made in 3
piece even for stock single ports over the years.  Some like em for ability to
space out a not totally stock width engine, or feel easier to align, at the
eventual risk of leaking manifold tubes.  Some were for single port heads
using interchangeable center sections to hang a Bugspray or a Weber
(progressive or other), or who knows what in the center to feed a single port
monster.
 
But like Mark originally said, dual port has aluminum end pieces, looking a
bit like a babies but mooning you spreading into two tubes out to the -dual
ports of course.

aluminum end-castings like mine has :^)  Then you can't tell that way.  The
chances of finding a S/P that way is pretty slim though...
