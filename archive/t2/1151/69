Subject: re:Park Brake

Thanks for the suggestions.so I am looking at the way the cable goes to the
rear wheels. It does not look quite right. It also looks to be in rough
shape. There are a couple cracks in the sheathing. I know the PO had put
some lowering boomerang things on the bus, which I took off last year. I
wonder if he had changed the brake geometry at the same time?

 

Does anyone have any pictures of how the brake cable is supposed to be
routed around the rear wheels?

 

Thanks.
