Subject: Re: [T2] Creaking noise right front wheel

Guys, thanks for all the replies and suggestions

I will go to the shop on wednesday and try your suggestions. The
'needle/grease' approach is interesting, never would have thought of that.
But why not try before replacing the ball joints? (which seems to be an
awful task!)

And if anything fails, there is indeed the 'sit it out' approach :-)

Will let you know if I find a solution...

Cheers!

Daniel
