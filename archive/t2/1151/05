Subject: Re: [T2] Head studs

When one of my heads started dropping studs (generalized fatigue of the
aluminum, I figured) I used Time-serts to fix the holes.  The inserts are
reasonably inexpensive but the tools to install them (the drill, counterbore,
tap, and driver) are not.  A friend of mine at a European auto shop loaned me
everything I needed at the time, so I saved that cost.

After having used them I can attest that timeserts are a fantastic product and
well worth the cost, especially compared to helicoils (maybe it's just my bad
luck, but I've always had trouble installing helicoils).

The other option is to tap the head for a step stud, but the timeserts are
much more elegant.

I don't have an input on threadlocker other than to say that I didn't use any
on my head studs.

Good luck!
Zack
