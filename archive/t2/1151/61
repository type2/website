Hi Jules,

I have done this swap. The 3-rib is almost a straight swap for the 
5-rib. No modifications to the transmission will be required.

BUT... As some have said already, if you are running a 228mm flywheel on 
the engine then the bellhousing will need to be moved from the original 
over to the replacement.

Another detail of note: The 5-rib bellhousing requires longer studs than 
the earlier transmission. But if you are swapping the bellhousing from 
the earlier transmission that won't be a problem.

Happy Trails,
