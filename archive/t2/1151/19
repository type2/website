Subject: FW: [T2] Head studs

Chris(and all),
What size are the Chevy studs?  As far as the warpage goes, I have a type
1('70) and it hasn't happened to me.  The header I just bought eliminates the
exhaust doughnuts at the heater-box junction.  I HATE those things.  Now
they're flanged.  Bought a Kymco header because they use thicker-walled tubing
AND 1/4" flanges all around(6 total, including the J-Tubes)  No warpage here!
I test-fitted it last night and it fits nicely.  I've already deburred the
flanges, but I'm considering chamfering the holes in the flange, too.  The
studs 'catch' on the flange holes when I'm installing it.  WWYD? Nearly time
to prep-and-paint(ceramic paint) before the final install.  Now that I have
the heat exchangers off I can have flanges welded onto them too.  I'll try to
get that done before winter.
