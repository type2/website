Subject: Re: [BP] Iginition key is stuck

Hi Volks,

Tonight I swapped a spare electrical switch onto the ignition harness 
and after starting it with a screwdriver I was able to drive it home. 
Come the weekend I will pull the lock cylinder and find out where the 
real issue lies. I am hoping it's only the electrical switch that's 
knackered but they say the proof is in the pudding....


Happy Trails,
