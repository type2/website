my tent has :
2  short t poles  peak poles
4  long  t poles  corner poles
10 straight large dia. poles  
4  straight smaller dia poles  front porch flap poles
4  straight poles with thumb screws, plastic feet,, and HIDDEN inside are 4 more
poles that slide out when you loosen the thumb screws! ..... these are the
corner legs.
