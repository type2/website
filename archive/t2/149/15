Subject: FS: 1500 piston and rings only

Well not for much...  I've come up with a fair set of low miles
(I'd guess 20k or so) 1500 pistons out of Steve's '67 engine
which I intended to use in my Scirocco until I got a NOS set
off a certain wonderful auction site.  Before I did so I bought
a set of NOS rings (70's Japanese and VERY nice quality) to
use with these low mile used pistons.  So if anyone needs
such things (seems unlikely who knows) I'll sell you the set
for what I paid for the rings plus $5 for my cleaning the pistons.
Or say in other words, $30 plus shipping.  Don't know what
use anyone might have for them, but again who knows.  They
are a tad worn, measure 82.92 on average down from 82.96
original size, but no collapsed skirts, very little minor wear, tops
look like new.  The top ring lands are pretty loose, better with
these new rings but towards the top end of spec, so be
aware what you would be getting.  The top land side clearances
are 0.004" slides moderately, 0.005" does not or goes hard so
I'd estimate them right around 0.0045" or so.  Still I don't want
to knock these, the pistons had no carbon inside just a light
oil browing and very little carbon on the faces.  Anyway if some
odd purist needs these, here they are.  Or if you want the ring
set alone, here it is but the price is the same.  The cylinders
are being overbored for 83.5's and are not available.  Oh these
are bus style 1500's with the thin rings not type 3 pistons with
the thicker.  And they are an original KS VW stamped set.
