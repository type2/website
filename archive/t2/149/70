Subject: Engine still running rough

So, I got the new 31 PICT in the bus (71 Westy with a 1600cc DP engine),
and it is still doing the exact same thing It used to do. It doesn't
seem to want me to adjust it's idle, it wants to idle anywhere from
600rpm - 1200rpm at its descression. It never will die, but if you come
off a hard run with it it goes down to 600 and then after about 30
seconds comes back up to ~1000rpm.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Jonathan
