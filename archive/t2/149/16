Troy,

The remark on splitting the case was mine, from last night on chat
(irc.type2.com #buslist) and I am sorry to say I did not explain myself
completely.  I have developed a suspicion concerning your leak.  Here is
my thinking, for others to comment on:

The problem, as you describe it is that you have an oil leak between the
engine and transmission that gets worse as the engine warms up.  It has
appeared within the last three weeks and has gotten worse rapidly.

There is no way to be sure until you pull the engine, remove the flywheel
and have a look, but I suspect that the plug at the end of your camshaft
may be leaking.  The reason I think that is that leaks at the front (and
it is *front*, not rear) main seal tend to come on gradually as the seal
wears and end play increases.  Cam plug leaks tend to be large and fast.
The *usual* course of cam plug leaks is that the plug actually pops and
you lose all your oil in a couple miles.  In your case, this has not
happened, but I believe that it has come unsealed and that as the engine
warms it gets looser and leaks worse.

To replace the front main seal, you do not need to split the crankcase.
To replace the cam plug, you *do* need to split the crankcase.

Now that I have made those bald statements, I want to ask the list... has
anyone ever put the plug back in with goop?  or tapped that hole and put a
plug in?  This is a problem I have never faced, myself.  I have read of it
and I have seen that plug often enough, but I have never had a problem
with it.

I *think* that it would be a tough road to tap it, since it lies on the
seam.  Any side force on the case halves would tend to cause a leak in the
seam, as I see it, but if anyone has a different experience, please post!
