After nine months of Bus-less in Montana I've managed to buy two busses
in one week!
I lost my 69 Dormobile in a catastrophic house fire on the 8th of
September (along with a '99 Harley) and had only a '71 Stupid Beetle for
the winter.
Well now that the weather has begun to warm I managed to clean up and
tune up the SB which I sold last week.
I purchased a 71 Kombi with no motor and some rust issues but overall a
decent bus to start back up again for $500.
I planned on fixing it up, cleaning it up and making it into a
weekender.  Lots of small jobs but do-able and drivable while
renovating.
Then the same day I installed the year old motor and two year old tranny
I salvaged from my dormobile, a '71 Westy comes up for sale in the local
paper!
I couldn't resist, I went and had a look.  Second owner, bought it as
his first car in '78, it now has 107k miles on it, and one and a half
engine rebuilds.  NO rust-through anywhere, not even the battery tray or
doglegs.  One dent on each rear corner(see photos), a 12 inch crease on
the slider, not deep.  The interior is complete, the major issue there
is the T molding.  Two tears in the canvas about 2 inches each.  PO
painted it himself two years ago, kind of a cross between B.S. brown and
a light Latte color. (originally white)
I wouldn't trust the motor very far out of town but it runs smooth and
the tranny doesn't whine or kick out of gear.  
My plan is to swap my 1700cc SP and two y/o rebuilt tranny for what's in
the westy resell the Kombi/Deluxe and go camping!  (wife made it very
clear we're to be a one-bus family!)
I do have a question of anyone who's worked on their fiberglass top;
please look at the picture of the front of my bus:

 and tell me how to un-warp the top right above the windshield on the
passenger side.
Thanks for any suggestions,
