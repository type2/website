Mine went away with my old '68 Westy when it was sold in 1993.  It never crossed my mind that I wouldn't be able to buy a new Weber for the replacement camper.  I can't find the Weber's box or paperwork, so don't have a part number handy.

I searched hard for ~5 years for a replacement Weber for my current camper [1600SP], and finally gave up and installed a Brazilian 30/31 PICT.  It's OK, but doesn't function/perform as well as the Original Solex carb.

The Brazilian carb will be replaced by a rebuilt original equipment Solex as soon as I can get it re-bushed
