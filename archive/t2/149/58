Dear list members from Texas,
I will soon have a 1700cc long block engine available for sale that is =
in need of cleaning and probably some minor rebuilding. It is the =
original engine on my bus. I'm having a new engine put in at this time, =
as part of a total bus rebuild project. The engine did leak a little oil =
(qt/mth) when it was last used (3yrs ago). I had no other major problems =
with this engine.
If you would like to pick this engine up, here in Kerrville, it will go =
for the best offer.
I will also have the original heat exchangers for this engine available, =
again, for the best offer.
If someone needs these parts, I would just hate to see them go to a =
landfill.

As my bus in still having the engine replaced, these parts should be =
available for pickup by the middle of May.

Please email me if you are interested.
