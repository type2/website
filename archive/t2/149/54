Hello Billy,

I do not know about asbestos. IF there was asbestos in
mine, there wasn't any in them when I took them apart.
I didn't find any traces of the stuff. As far as
insulation goes. I have pondered the thought of
wraping them in that fiberglass exhaust wrap that
people use to insulate their exhaust pipes. I do not
know if wraping them would get in the way of the
engine block when they are bolted back on or not. I
will have to look at the clearances when I bolt them
back on. If I had enough fiberglass wrap, I would wrap
all of the heater pipes that connect to them as well.
I think that doing that would maximize the heating
capabilities of these metal boxes. Well, I am off to
weld. Thanks!
