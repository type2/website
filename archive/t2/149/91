Subject: Re: [T2] Heat exchanger update, pictures

I looked at your pics......  I hate to tell you this but that is not a bus
heater box.  That is a 411/412 heater box for a 411/412 with a BA 4 heater.
They just preheat the air before it enters the BA 4 heater. As a heater box
that will be needed to heat a bus, it will not do a very good job. It is
lacking the finned heatsink to carry heat and the outer 'box' is way small.
A real full size 72-74 bus box is pictured in the 68-79 Bentley, section 5,
page 13. Or G and H here:

They are straight sided, not odd shaped like yours.
