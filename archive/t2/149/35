Subject: Bus Depot Trailer Hitch

Hello All knowing list,
The following question will not be very exciting, but none the less, I am
seeking the answer.
I ordered the hitch for a 71, and believed it was going to replace the
bumper brackets.  Well as it turns out, no, and there is a beam that
attaches to the "valance" across the bottom of the engine lid.
My question, there are 4 holes to secure the valance, and I seem to have 2
makeshift bolts and 2 plugs.  I am concerned that there will be some torque
on this "valance" and need someone to help me with the proper size of bolt
to put in the valance.
Please save me trips to the hardware store.....
Also in securing the bumper to the brackets, the PO had some weird setup,
and after a year I am going to do it right.  Does the bumper mount flush to
the bracket, or is there some sort of buffer between?  How about the bolt
here?
In short, if anyone can direct me to a source for such info, I will go
there.
Thanx in advance.

FEBIII
71 Hapy Bus
