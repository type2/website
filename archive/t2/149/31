=========================>
Forgot who is doing the latch work here.

I think I have a set of hinges, if this is what you are talking about.

They came off of Casper's old hatch that got smashed last Summer on our 
road trip when we got 'kissed".

The replacement hatch I found a couple of days later in the Yukon had a 
nice set of hinges, so I kept Casper's old set for my spares stash.

If hinge sets is what whomever needs, I will go look them up for that person.
