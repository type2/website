Pull the latches out of the doors. Like many such instruction, much easier 
to say than to do. You have to turn them just so to pull out and put back. 
Cock the latch closed for sure, then jockey it out of there. Clean them 
thoroughly. Inspect them for wear. If worn, replace them. If they function 
manually, lube them well and replace them. Same for lock cylinders. Clean 
and lube. If that doesn't work due to wear, replace them. Then add them to 
the lubrication maintenance every year or two so they won't wear out again.

Be sure to verify that the screw at the back of the lock cylinder holding 
the lever is tight. Your symptom can be caused by this. That screw should 
have a special serrated washer. If the washer got lost, use blue locktight. 
Wear on the lever can also contribute to your symptom.
