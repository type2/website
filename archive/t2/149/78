Subject: Alternatoer needed

HI,
I need an alternater for my 74 bus. I would like a
good used one since new ones are out of my price
range. I was looking at the motorworks catalog and it
says that there is the same 55 amp alternater works on
72-79 busses. If someone has a good used one to sell
please e-mail me.
Thanks,
Tyler
