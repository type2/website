Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger "rebuilding"

Does anybody have any knoledge of or experience with 
those high temp ceramic exhasut coatings. Would that be 
safe to use on heat exchangers? Also, wouldn't some sort 
of coating such as cermaic of Por-15 make it "safer" to 
use the fiberglass wrap?
The guy that did the Rust, noise and heat website swore 
by the wrap, wonder how the boxes on that bus are 
holding up.
