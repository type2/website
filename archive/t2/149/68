Subject: stool year question

List,

My father-in-law recently found a westfalia stool in the basement of a house 
that they inherited. It is the four legged yellow vinyl style and in amazing 
condition.

My question is what years does this stool go to? I am more familiar with the 
later plaid storage boxes and can only guess that his stool is '68 to 
72ish??? Any earier? later? TIA.

'78 Westfalia (Vegas)
'79 Westfalia (Rusty)
