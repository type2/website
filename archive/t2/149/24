Subject: heat exchanger "rebuilding"

Hello List,

I thought I would write about what I am doing to my
heat exchangers. Before I pulled my engine I removed
both heat exchangers. They were in pretty rough shape.
They have rusted apart from the header pipes inside
them. There are also a couple or more rust holes in
them. Well, I took a handy flat screw driver and
hammer and pried each heat exchanger apart at the
seams. I them cleaned each piece and bead blasted the
inside and outside of the heat exchanger sheet metal
as well as the pipes them selves. Today I ordered 2
pints of the manifold grey , high temp (1400 F) Por 15
as well as the 20oz bottle of the metal prep. Over the
next few days, I plan to weld in pieces of sheet metal
to sew up all of the holes that the rust left behind.
I will POR 15 each piece and crimp them back together.
I will then put a coat on the outside after I finish
up the tack welding. After all this is done, I will
probably buy some exhaust seam sealer and go over all
the seams to make sure that the air goes where it is
suppose to. All in all, I will have spent less than
$40.00 apiece making them functional again. If I can
get them to last a few years than I feel that I have
not wasted my time or money. Any way, I just thought I
would share.

Have a great day!
David Kelly
