Subject: Apps specifics and lectric fuel pump conversion.

hhhmmm I thought it was interesting but kept my mouth
shut as I didn't have anything usefull to add.. some
may say that is a first (keeping my mouth shut that
is). But maybe your right. Keep us informed tho!
---------------------
I think we should keep talking about this and decide
on implementation and whatnot, but we probably
shouldn't do it on this list anymore.  I doubt there
are very many people interested in the implementation
specifics 
of this app :) 
------------------------

Bus content: Thinking of installing a lectric
fool pump and running it off a relay that is activated
off the alternator ckt like the 
heat booster fan in the engine compartment. It would
only operate after the engine spun up though and the
Alt. ckt became active. My fan doesnt come on untill
the dash lights go out. 
Question: Think the residual gas in the carbs would be
enough to fire it to the point of turning on the pump?
Doc Tim?
