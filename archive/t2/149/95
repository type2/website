Joey,

Yes, no problem with the trans mount. Just a few other details. Get the fuel
tank these are different. Also pull everything with this motor. i.e. brain
double relay all cover plates and torch out the air cleaner bracket and
brain plug, don't forget the fuel pump. If you only have the motor let me
know. I can get you these things.

Hi all,

Will a engine from a 79' ( 2L FI ) mate up with a 74' tranny?

Thanks,

Joey.
