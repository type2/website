I have the 79 with the 2 litre type 4 engine, and I bought some used HE's at
a show, but these turned out to be for the wrong year. (The guy who'd sold
them dissappeared after taking my money.) Rather than go to the expense of
new HE's I also prised the old ones apart and using sheet metal from the
replacements was able to patch the originals very effectively. They've run
OK for 3 years now.
