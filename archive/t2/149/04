Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch friction plate

I replaced my 150,000 mi cluch friction disk (was going on a long trip;
pulled it prophylactically) with a "new" one (stamped relined in Canada
on a German F&S plate.  It required pulling 70,000 mi later because the
lining came off the rivets on the pressure plate side, worked itself
into the outside edges of the flywheel, and cause odd grabbing syptoms
when fully clutched and also some chattering in traffic.  Inability to
shift and a "chirring" noise required the pull- The pressure plate was
ruined by the rivets rubbing.  I got a LUK kit from Bus Depot, works
like butter now!
The original long milage disk was dry and still had a mm of lining- keep
it for a spare.
