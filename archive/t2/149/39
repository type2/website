When the data is complete for the Windows version or pocket PC or whatever,
I'd like a copy in whatever format so I can do a Java version that will
work on a Mac or Linux box. I can do a standalone and/or one that runs in a
browser window.

If I had a copy of Codewarrior I'd do a Mac version, once I learned how :-)
