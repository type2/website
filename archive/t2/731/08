Subject: Re: [T2] emergency flasher

DC+ comes in when you direct it to via turn signal switch, the electrical
process you described happens within the flasher, power flows (switched) to
the given lights, DC+ eventually finds chassis ground at the device/light
needing the switched power.

The bus uses it's body/trans/engine case as DC-.

Doesn't need hot and neutral at the same location like AC.
