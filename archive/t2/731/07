Subject: Re: [T2] 71 bus door seals

Home Depot.  Else, not cheap.

The correct seals, whether you buy them from busdepot.com or aircooled.net or
wherever, really are expensive.  I don't think the vendors are taking as huge
of a margin as you think.

I'd be surprised if JC Whitney had seals for a Bus.. not so surprised if they
had them for a Bug.  Good luck!
