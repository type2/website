Subject: I need advice on repairing my '72 bus engine

Greetings,
     I would first like to reintroduce myself.  My name is Stuart, and I
live in North Georgia (25 miles south of Chattanooga, TN.)  Anyway, I
have been a bus person for about 8 years now.  Around 3 years ago, I
went to remove the muffler on my '72 (1700 engine) bus.  I noticed that
I only had 3 studs (the ones that connect the heat exchangers to the
head) holding anything.  That's right, of the 8 studs, only 3 were doing
any holding, 2 were stripped out, and 3 were gone.  Realizing that it
would not be a good idea to continue until the stud issue was fixed, I
lost interest, and there the bus has been for the last 3 years.
     I want my bus back on the road.  What is the best method (other
that pulling the heads, welding and re-tap the holes) to repair the
stripped threaded holes.  I remember getting a catalog from some company
that sold thread repair kits, but I have no idea of the company's name.
Anyway, please accept me back into the fold, and help me get Daisy back
on the road.

Thanks,
Stuart
