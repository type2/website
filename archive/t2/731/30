I have paid attention to some of the older T2 list
members who have described having to remove their fuel
tanks, clean them out, chemically strip them inside,
and then coat them internally with some approved
anti-rust coating.  You should do some T2 archive
searching to see what I'm talking about.  Now I
personally haven't had a clogged fuel line on my 78
T2.   But apparently, it is common.  Every couple
o'months this same issue comes up that you are
discussing now.
