Subject: Yet another tire for the fire (no flames please)

The tires on my bus are Nankang 185R14 102/100R. Load range D.
Radial light truck. 8 "ply rating". 2 poly sidewall ply. 2 poly ply, 2
steel ply, 1 nylon ply tread. Max pressure 65 lb. All marked on the
sidewall.

The ride was good on the 2000 mile trip from Utah to Michigan and
they're not harsh on frost heaved roads in Michigan. My friends that
have never driven a bus can't believe how well they handle. It takes a
little muscle but buses are a cinch to parallel park.
