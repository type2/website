UPDATE: Ball joint/ torsion arm disappointment 69 Bus.

Thanks for all the replies on and off list!

For those that asked, I am running light truck tires. The good ones 
recommended for a bus. I love them and ordered two replacements for the 
two that were in the front but changed to the back at EveryBus due to wear.

That is interesting about the welds. I guess three of the four were 
completely broken. And one was only broken in one place.

Anyway, I took for the alignment today and he called and said the bus 
drove great, and to come get it. To my surprise, it really does drive 
great. The best it has in years. He had to adjust the draglink, tighten 
the steering box, and do the alignment.

Im as happy as a little girl. )- )-


Thanks!
Ric
