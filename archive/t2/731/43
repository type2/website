Subject: Re: [T2] Asbestos and exhaust systems/Accordian tube cuffs

From Chris:

Richard sed:

 The cuffs between the flapper box and accordian tube are also asbestos.

 **I just took my accordian tubes apart last night and took these cuffs out and washed them off.  Was I
stupid?  Will I die tomorrow?  Is that why I felt strange all day?  No, that's just me.

 Should I put them back on or is there a safer replacement??

--------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, there is a safer one. Get the orange silicone cuffs from 2 Vanagons. I say 2 because the Vanagon uses 2
straight ones and 2 angle ones. You need 2 Vanagons to get 4 of them.
Richard should be along real soon and post a link to a pic of them :)
