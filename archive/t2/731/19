Subject: FUSE BOX diagram

Good day Folks,

lots of electric email these days.. make me wonder...


Do anyone have a diagram of the fuse box?

thank you to Bill Moon, that lead me to the electric wired diagram from
the Vintagebus.com but I still looking for the fuse pattern on my bus,
or something that show me what fuse goes where...

That would be for a 77 Transporter

cheers
