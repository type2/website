OEM lasted 30+ years, JC Whitney lasted about 15 months. Beware. Quality
may be better these days, dunno.

I will echo this.  Suppliers go to a lot of effort to find high quality
parts for us.  It is usually worth paying a premium for the time and
effort they put into this.  Yes, a $80 door seal seems expensive, but how
much is your time worth in forcing a cheap-o seal to fit and then
having to replace it in a year or two?
