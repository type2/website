Nik,

So where did you get the motor?

Does it feel like it has a lot of torque?

1776=  69strokeX90.5 pistons  (stock stroke, larger pistons)

Generally refers to the 1776 built up in the "daily driver" articles
put out by DB&HVW's several years ago.

They used and engle 100 cam if I remember correctly...nice low end torque
and about 80-90hp if you used dual carbs.

Have no idea aboutthe 211 part.

Cheers, dave
