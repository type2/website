Nik,

There is no such thing as a "model" it came from<grin>.

This would be a stock 1600 engine with machine work done to the case and 
heads(for the bigger piston size) and a stock stroke crank from a 1600 
type 1 engine.  

Obviously you know that the cam is not stock, nor are the carbs.

Go to Amazon.com or your local(largish) bookstore and buy 

How to Hot Rod Volkswagen Engines (Paperback)
by Bill Fisher 

You will learn a lot even though the book was published years ago.

Cheers, dave
