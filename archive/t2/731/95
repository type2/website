Subject: Re: [T2] Crud in fuel tank...I need a miracle!

This is a bit of a time consuming option, but here goes. Disconnect the 
fuel hose from the top of the filter and add a connector and a length of 
hose on  the end so you can drain the fuel tank into a convenient 
container (a large plastic barrel perhaps?) on the ground. Fill the 
tank, and let it run right through into forementioned barrel. You could 
rig up a sieve or filter somewhere in the system to catch the crud, but 
I suspect letting it settle in the barrel will do. Repeat as many times 
as it takes to satisfy you no more crud is coming out. Classical 
chemical engineering analysis would suggest 3 times is enough.

This obviously has some serious safety hazards! I would be tempted to 
use water as my washing agent, but I guess the corrosion implications 
might put you off - unless you live somewhere nice and dry and warm.
