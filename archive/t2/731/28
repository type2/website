Subject: Re: [T2] Loss of power

When I hear the words,, loss of power....

is the parking brake on?
head winds,, up hills?

no?

Then if your going to take the time to look at the plugs... stick in a
compression gauge.

If you suspect fuel delivery,,, install your fuel pressure gauge...should be
about 5psi.. and if you don't have one of those,, <you should buy one, it is
also a vac gauge for a carb engine>
take a gatorade bottle and catch 30secs of fuel from the carb inlet hose.
you should get 400ml in 30 seconds

Install your vacuum gauge and see if it is steady at least,, hopefully over 15

Install your dwell meter.. make sure the dwell is steady,, and near 50.....

If you find low compression,, unsteady vacuum,, unsteady or low dwell....or low
fuel volume or pressure... then you really know what is happening,, and you can
take corrective action

If you find these are within spec... then you can start scratching your head..
wondering what is happening.

Coil is a tough one to diagnose.. start swapping parts and have fun! :-)

Hope that gets you ahead of the game!
