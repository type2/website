This is what I use, and recommend for repairing cylinder head threads. It is
not an easy job to do this with the cylinder head installed on the engine,
however. Possible, but not ideal at all, especially if you do not have a
lift. Drilling and tapping the head while lying on your back under the
engine is difficult, especially getting the new threads straight. If at all
possible, remove the heads to do these repairs especially since you have
several studs to repair.
