   Just sat down to figure out the mileage obtained with the 73 Westy
during our trip to Everybus
Total Mileage = 1578 miles
Fuel Used = 71.82 US Gallons /  59.8 Imperial Gallons
21.97 mpg (US) !
26.39 mpg (Imp) !!

The bus was fully loaded with 4 people and all the gear.
1973 Westy with stock 1700cc dual Solex.
=============================================================

I just looked at my figures... I live close to Phil, between him and Everybus,
but drove about 100 miles extra to go to Salem on the way to everybus.
74 Westy with 2.0liter Efi and 3.75 final drive trans
Total Mileage = 1621miles
Fuel Used = 77.6 us gals /  65 imp gal
20.88 miles per US gal
24.9 miles per imp gal
11.3L/100kms
13.5hrs on the first leg of the trip,Home to Salem VA,  then 3hrs the second
leg, Salem Va to Greensboro N.C.

I like to go one step further,, it sort of puts the cost of a trip into
focus...
on average $2.20 us per gallon, and 1.22 exchange to canadian.. it cost me
~C$7.70 per hour

I know it is about 2600kms round trip...100km/hr avg,, 26hrs on the road... 13
one way... I budget C$10 per hr  = ~260 dollars total costs ... and when I
acutally figure it out... It usually costs somewhat less..
this time... us$243.85 ..... ~C$300.00 , a little over budget,,, but that
includes the 48 beer and the 80oz of Bailey's!

Hope I did the math right..
Hugh Cares... I had a great time!
