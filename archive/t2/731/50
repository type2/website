Denny,

This is the place to buy the best....do it once and forget about it for 
another 25 years or ?????  replace again in 15 months?

Your choice.

Of course, nobody *really* knows if the current German OEM seal will last 
25 years or not, but it sure does fit better!

Cheers, dave

 I was going to contact Ron and get his take on the quality/fit of the $20 OEM VW Brazilian front door seals he now stocks, compared with his $60 OEM German product.
