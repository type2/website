Subject: Just how un common is the solid roof?

Hiya all,

I can't stand the scilence so I thought i'd ask a question.

I have a parts bus (78 transporter) that Im thinking about making
into a camper trailer.  I was thinking about adding the Pop Up roof
as well.  But I recall someone saying that the "solid roof" bay is
becoming increasingly hard to find.  My parts bus is, you guessed it,
a solid roof.

Ok the question is this.  Should I trade out for a westy or
campmobile donor so that I can have the pop top or just go ahead and
cut this bad boy up.

Thanks.

David.
