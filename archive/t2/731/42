Subject: Asbestos and exhaust systems/Accordian tube cuffs

Richard sed:

The cuffs between the flapper box and accordian tube are also asbestos.

**I just took my accordian tubes apart last night and took these cuffs out and washed them off.  Was I stupid?  Will I die tomorrow?  Is that why I felt strange all day?  No, that's just me.  

Should I put them back on or is there a safer replacement??

thanks,  Chris 72 Westy
