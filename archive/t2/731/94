If you had a clean tank, I'd be surprized that junk dropped down the 
filler pipe gets to the outlet pipe- isn't there a baffle around it that 
prevents this?  You can see the baffle when you look down the gauge 
hole.  As a stopgap, consider putting a T in the line between outlet and 
fuel filter, make it long enough to hold ABOVE the tank, cap it, and 
blow air into it if you have a blockage problem.  It can be stored 
coiled near the filter.
