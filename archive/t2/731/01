Subject: emergency flasher

I wondered how an emergency flasher could work.

2 terminals (555 label).  Round aluminum can.

It needs power (+ and -) so there's 2 terminals.

I thought it would need at least 3 (1 terminal = switch)

I had a bad one sitting here.  I cut the top off with a
dremel and looked inside.  Very cool!

It is a pulsing electro-mechanical switch.  When
you turn on E-flasher, or the turn signals, + volts
gets routed through the (eflasher or turn signal switch),
to the E-flasher-relay (in one terminal, out
the other) to the appropriate bulb(s).  The E-flasher
switch and the turn signal switch does the routing.
Ok, the + volts goes through bulb to ground.

The light(s) turn on.  There is a small coil of
wire in the flasher.  It begins to heat up.  The
coil rests against a thin piece of steel.  The
steel heats up.  It bends with the heat.  When
it gets hot enough, it clicks.  It also bends
enough to pull itself away from the other contact.

When heated to the point that it pulls away from
the other contact, the circuit is broken.  The
light(s) turn off.  The small coil within the flasher
also turns off.  No more heat.  No more bending
of the steel.  It cools down, contracts, and clicks back.
It makes contact with the terminal again, completing
the circuit.  The circuit is complete, the bulbs are
on again.  The coil is making heat again...

So simple.
