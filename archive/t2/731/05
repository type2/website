Subject: matching a vacuum advance distributor

Is this an archive search?  I would like to return to vacuum advance on a dual
port 1600 with a 34 PICT3 carb.  Right now it has an 009 distributor.  I have
three vacuum advance distributors that I salvaged from various vehicles over
the years, although I didn't label them.  Here are the part #s:

231 172 007

231 173 005

231 137 021 this one only has one vacuum line

My question is this: Can I just use any of these distributors or is one better
than another or will none of them work efficiently?  The vacuum advance works
on all three (i.e. I can see the arm move when I apply vacuum).
