Subject: ' 71 door seals

I plan to replace door seals all around on my ' 71.
As usual, Bus Depot looks like good quality and reasonably priced.
I was going to contact Ron and get his take on the quality/fit of the $20 OEM VW Brazilian front door seals he now stocks, compared with his $60 OEM German product.
As door seals is a current topic here, perhaps he would answer here and inform others.
Best wishes
Denny Johnson
