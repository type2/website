Subject: interior light in 71 bus

Hello list,

The front interior light (roof) doesn't work.

I yank the wires, I see they come down
to fuse box through pillar on drivers side,
in front of drivers door.

I have red wire and brown/white coming
out of the roof.

I test for continuity on the red wire.  I get
none.  Is there another red wire coming
from the roof harness?  I don't understand
how this wire could have burnt.  The fuses
are low amperage, and the wire is thick enough
that the fuse would have burnt way before the
wire.

any tips on replacing this wire?  I don't want to
destroy the headliner in the process.


Rich
