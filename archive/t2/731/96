Subject: Cheap Busses - need to go soon!!!

Howdy all - gotten rid of a few bays recently, but have 2 more that need
to go ASAP. One is roommate's 70 hardtop Westy. She is moving to Alaska in
less than 2 weeks, and the bus needs to be gone when she goes. She also
needs money for the move. More info at
http://www.faeriebuzz.com/cassady.html
She has dropped the price down to $950, and has almost that much in the
engine alone...
Also got a 71 westy, runs good, rusty, complete except I sold off the jump
seat, sink/icebox, headliner panels, and front half of poptop, but all
running gear is there, and everything else...just need the space - $699 as
is, or $450 if I keep the engine for another project...Would rather sell
it as-is, but will cinsider selling off more stuff. I just don't want to
be left with a big, unmoveable thing that no one wants and I have to get
rid of...
busses are in Raleigh, NC, and prices are negotiable...email for more
info...thanks,
