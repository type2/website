Subject: Why cut up a hartop for camper making?

Why cut it?  Make a "hard-top Westy" for a family of 4-5 and get better 
milage- my daughter gets 24 mpg in her 75 to which we added:
curtain rods, jalousie windows,
74 full width rear seat/bed (so 5 can travel even without a jump seat), 
divider curtain between front to rear area,
A fridge/seat with cup holders by the sliding door, and a Sears plastic 
seat/trunk that holds all the cooking utensils and foodstuff and a tent 
with middle entrance we can put out for holding extra gear and sleeping 
for 2 people.  A Walmart rectangular resin folding table that fits 
perfectly between rear seat and front is nestled behind the box for 
travel.  It's for eating/movie viewing inside (Fits over camping 
box/fridge) or picnic table outside.  I put 4 u-bolts in the walls 
behind the front seats to keep things bungeed in place.  On top of the 
trunk we stood upright (and bungeed in place) 2 rolled bed mats used in 
the tent or on the floor/front bed, as well as bedding stuffed into a 
duffel. A Sears Pakapotti fits fine between the fridge and box, and one 
can still walk through by stepping on the woofer top between the seats 
and over the packapotti that has a cover we made.  A "snack bucket" sits 
on the floor in the back or on the woofer top, made from a nice square 
cat litter bucket.  The garbage bag hangs over the fridge . An air pump, 
tire tools, Windex, paper towels, siphon hose, stock jack AND tube jack, 
wheel chocks, flashlight, and atlas all fit behind the front seats or in 
the seat pedestal wells.  Under the seat are 8" ply squares for using 
the jacks on soft ground.
    Under the bed seat are all the tools, camping ax/hammer, spare 
parts, stove, lantern, spare propane tanks, and an inverter to run the 
AA battery charger, shaver, or a 15" flatscreen TV/Monitor.
    In the back (over engine) is another mat folded flat over the 
seatbed, clothing bags, an "entertainment bag" with drawing supplies, 
laptop/dvd player, dvd's, cd's, books, etc, a toiletries bag including 
towels, and 2 folding chairs.  The tubular upright bags allow maximumum 
safe use of space and one can still look out the back between them. 
Outside, the fridge and camping trunk will let 3 people sit.  In our Fla 
trip we included a duffel full of snorkeling gear.   In the back engine 
bay on the driver side we keep a 10 amp battery charger and 50 ft of 
wire that can be plugged into an inlet to an outlet in the wall of the 
bedseat. That wall has a double 12 v. outlet for a fan or aimable 
cliplight.  2 outlets are on the front dash for the cell-phone charging, 
fan, or laptop.  When camping by hookups, I plug in the charger and hook 
it to the battery, where it will allow powering of all the 12 v stuff, 
using the battery as a capacitator to prevent interference in 
electronics.  If it is raining, one can put out the fridge and camping 
trunk, put the other stuff in front, and lay a mat diagonal on the floor 
so 3 can sleep (4 if front bed is used).  I designed a front bed that is 
a board on a collapsible frame over the front dash and between the seat 
beld holders, using a foam pad.  It will hold 160 lbs and the board 
stores UNDER the carpet in the rear floor, and the mat over the camping 
box.
I must say we have a 78 Westy also, but the 75 design is very flexible 
and one can still carry a lot of dorm stuff when moving.

  Ok the question is this.  Should I trade out for a westy or
  campmobile donor so that I can have the pop top or just go ahead and
  cut this bad boy up.
