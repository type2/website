8x9x56. It's the 1800-2000cc stud.

Remove the heads and have the stud boses drilled for these studs. Sometimes
the cost is as low as $20/head but it will depend on where you live.

I would have the work done locally and bring along your heat exchanger to
make sure the new studs align with the holes in the manifold.
