Subject: sunroof cable value??

All,
     I have a set of absolutely perfect sunroof cables that I want to sell.  
I mean perfect, no wear or kinking, no damage, absolutely perfect.  I have 
hooked several people up with good parts for free, or very little recently, 
but not with these.  As far as I know, sunroof cables are simply impossible 
to find these days.  I'd like to sell them for a full, but fair, price.  
This is one of the items I planned to sell to help finance the restoration 
of the 73 camper.
     What should I charge for these sunroof cables to get their worth, but 
not gouge?  I can't find any of them available anywhere to figure out 
reasonable pricing.
