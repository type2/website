Subject: Re: [T2] ' 71 door seals

Another variable that I haven't seen mentioned regarding door seals is 
whether the front end of the bus has any minor body dents. It apparently 
does not take much of a dent to mess up the fit of the seal. On mine, I 
bought a set of top of the line german seals and the driver side fit 
perfectly but the passenger side just would not work - too thick at the 
bottom front. I got a set of oddly shaped seals as part of a Bus Depot 
door seal kit and it worked perfectly on the passenger side but would 
not work on the driver side. So in my case it was a matter of trial and 
error to find a combination that works.
