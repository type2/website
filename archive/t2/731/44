Subject: Re: [T2] matching a vacuum advance distributor

From David White:

Is this an archive search?  I would like to return to vacuum advance on a dual
port 1600 with a 34 PICT3 carb.  Right now it has an 009 distributor.  I have
three vacuum advance distributors that I salvaged from various vehicles over
the years, although I didn't label them.  Here are the part #s:

231 172 007

231 173 005

231 137 021 this one only has one vacuum line

 My question is this: Can I just use any of these distributors or is one better
than another or will none of them work efficiently?  The vacuum advance works
on all three (i.e. I can see the arm move when I apply vacuum).
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 0237 137 021 is for a 68 bug 1500/68 bus 1600 SP engine. It would have a 30 pic carb. This dist is not a
good choice for the 34 pic carb you have. The vacuum signal is wrong for that vacuum-only advance dist.

The 0231 172 007..... are you sure about this number?? Is it really 0231 173 007?
If yes, this is a 73 bus auto trans dizzy. Using it and just hooking up the advance side will run nice.
Time it to 7.5 before. Specs are: Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-14deg Ret; Centrifugal: 14deg
(-at-) 1700 rpm, 15-19deg (-at-) 2400 rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400rpm

The 0231 173 005 came from a 72 1700 bus. Another dual vacuum unit that will work if you just connect the
advance side and time it to 7.5 before. Specs on this one: Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv, 11-15deg
Ret; Centrifugal: 13-16deg (-at-) 2000rpm, 23-26deg (-at-) 3600 rpm

Jim's site is great, http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm , but he only shows the short Bosch number for
the vacuum units. This number does not relate at all to the 3 or 4 digit number on the arm. That number
relates to the last 3 or 4 numbers of the Bosch long number. One of these days, I will have to ask him if he
wants the arm numbers for the short numbers...... Knowing the arm number is the correct number compared to the
short number makes the specs worthwhile. Having the wrong vacuum unit makes the specs worthless.....

The short number for the 007 is 07 101, should have 885 on the arm.
The short number for the 005 is also 07 101, should be 885.
The 021 short number is 07 024, should be 279.

A nice original bug dist is the  Beetle 1974 * 1600 Federal Manual Trans
Distributor: VW 043-905-205, Bosch 0231 170 034
Can Use: VW 113-905-205AL, Bosch 0231 146 101
Vacuum Can: 07 059  [should have 579 on the arm]
Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe and w/single vacuum hose disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv; Centrifugal: 7-12deg (-at-) 1600rpm, 20-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm

Very close to the 005 above.....

The 'can use' number above is also shown with this dist:
Beetle 1970 * 1600 Auto-Stick Trans
Distributor: VW 113-905-205AD or AE, Bosch 0231 167 029 > 113 905 205AL, 0231 146 101
Can Use: VW 113-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 115 078
Vacuum Can: 07 138  [should have 837 on the arm]
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv; Centrifugal: 13-16deg (-at-) 2200rpm, 25-28deg (-at-) 3900rpm

This one times at zero only because of the auto trans, in a manual trans application time it to 7.5 before.
