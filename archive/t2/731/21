Subject: More on the dash-mounted Bus Depot parcel tray mods

I've sent some pics to those who requested them.
In doing so I realised that I'd forgotten to mention there was an additionnal, if minor, amount of surgery required to have the part fit around the metal support bracket that is, in this application, left on the dash.
So the flanged sides of the part also have to be cut back a bit.
The pics, show it, although slightly out of focus. But enough to be helpfull.
I'll get a couple of "part-in-place" pics before I add the trays so those will be available on request also.
