Richard,

All door seals were not created equal! I spent a good part of last weekend 
whittling a "cheap" Brazilian seal to approximate the correct shape and 
still haven't got it right. The main problem with the seal is that the 
lower section on the hinge side is much thicker than the original. The 
rubber is also less compressible and the seal lacks the moulded corners on 
the handle side. All in all a total POS!

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
