Subject: FRI topic: tire machine for sale

Since it's Friday.... got a call the other day from car hobbyist Ron Long in 
Hagerstown, Maryland, who is selling a Coates three-star tire machine.  He said 
he would include it soon in a garage sale at his house.  Now I own an ancient 
Bishman, which works great for my needs, maybe 4 or 8 tires annually; but I am 
sure there are other VW-philes out there who would jump on this.  Here is the 
contact info:
