did an even more basic hardtop camper...

I have built out a "trunk" extending the flat over the engine to just
behind the sliding door.  (there are only two of us) put a big air
mattress in the space, with  a double sleeping bag on top
  when camping I throw a blue tarp over the van and bungee cord it to the
wheelwells on the drivers side.  have couple of telescoping tent poles
that hold up the other end over the door. shorten the poles so no one can
look in at night.

do the same.  couple ice chests as needed and camp stove.

use sun screens to cover front and rear windows when sleeping or changing.

real basic but it works
