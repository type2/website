I think those welds are put on at the factory, I have never seen a set
without it, mostly broken, but to put the dang things back in I've always
had to put the weld back on. you just can't seem to hold em well enough

the holder bracket inside the axle tube holds em pretty tightly in
alignment doubt the weld has much to do with it.
