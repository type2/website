Subject: Re: [T2] Why cut up a hartop for camper making?

I'm intrigued by that.  I have a 76 Westy.  I am a ham
radio operator and a jazz musician.  Right now I have
the stock radio, hooked to no speakers.  I need to rig
a killer sound system and I need 12V hookups for
powering radios, TV, VCR, DVD, etc.  And I don't even
have a cigarette lighter!  (Speaking of which, why? 
Other '76 models had them)  I currently only have one
battery.  But I know I need the other one, and the
relay (can someone explain how it works, or point me
to the archives), and probably an inverter to boot.  

My real question is how to wire it.  For my ham radio
(Yaesu 100 W output) I'll wire it direct with an
in-line fuse.  But for the 12V outlets, I need to come
off the fuse box.  Which one is available.  I think
all of mine are full.  What to do?

Thanks...KR
