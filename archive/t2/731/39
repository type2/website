Subject: Asbestos and exhaust systems

Still working on replacing my exhaust system.  I have everything off except
for the headers which I am working on now.  I have heard that asbestos was
used to surround certain portions of the exhaust but I'm not finding an
exact answer in the archives.  I took a shot of the headers here:

Am I dealing with asbestos?  If so, do I just put a mask on and take that
stuff off or do I go a different route?  If I take it off, it would have to
happen with the headers on still most likely.  The studs are so out of
alignment compared to the holes in the header that I can't get the darn
things off.  I hate to pry against anything but it may need to happen.

 

Thanks for the help,
