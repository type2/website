My daughter's 75 seemed to wander all over the road with every turn or 
bump (as if it was not self centering); turned out that a slightly bent 
tie rod gave no toe in or was towed out.....we replaced it and adjusted 
it with a telescoping rod showing 1/8" longer at the rear than at the 
front when placed in the rim indent by the tires first front, then back. 
  Much more behaved then.  You need the toe in to have the wheels stay 
self-centering.

Make sure you take the Bentley manual for the alignment specs if you 
take it in- the local Goodyear place I went to with our 78 needed it. 
This is from a 1977 spec sheet:
caster: +3 deg +/- 40'
camber +40' +/- 20'
total toe +15' +/- 15'
