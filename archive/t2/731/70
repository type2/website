I made that comment a while back.

If you look through all the ads online, newspapers, etc, you'll notice
that the Westy model is absolutely the most common.

There appear to be VERY few hardtops left out there. Probably because
they were used as daily drivers as opposed to the (relatively)
expensive Westies that were mostly used for occasional trips.

I'd love to find an early 70's passenger bus. (free, of course. heh)
