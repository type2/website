Subject: Mallory Hyfire 1 opinions

I picked up a Hyfire 1 (PN: 29026) and a Promaster coil (PN: 29044).

I did the classic Don move: Assume.

I *assumed* the Hyfire was a CDI kit. Silly me thinking that the name
Hyfire would be only one type of product. Sigh. So I have a high
energy inductive ignition. It was still a nice price for the pair
regardless.

Quote from the Mallory site:

"High energy inductive storage increases performance of single or dual
breaker point trigger. Perfect for street or racing use. Extend RPM
capability, achieve more sustained burn time throughout RPM range, and
get higher input voltage. "

Obviously I'm not going to mess with this until I get my power loss
issues ironed out
(lalalalalalala*I'mnotlisteningtotalkaboutrustytanks*lalalalalalala),
but I'd like to hear from others who've tried the Hyfire 1. I'm sure
it's an improvement, but how much? Should I just sell it, hope I can
get what I paid, and buy a 6a?

Thanks!
