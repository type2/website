Subject: Re: [T2] ' 71 door seals

German notwithstanding, I did have trouble making the german seal fit on 
the 75 daughter drives- it too seems thick at the bottom (had trouble 
making it stay in contour around the bottom, especially around the door 
"stay open stabilizer" and had to use glue....one must slam the door 
still to completely close it.
