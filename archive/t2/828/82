VERY IMPORTANT, make sure they DON'T use the "blue book" value, vehicles
that old are list in the "green Book" usually can be found at the main
library.  the green Book is for "Classic" vehicles, when my 78 was hit the
blue book value was $750, and they wanted to total it, the green book
value was $2,800  they fixed it...
