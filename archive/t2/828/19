Ayeayeayeayeaye, I want one of those.  Never  seen such a thing.  Wow!   And aircooled?  I'd love  to see more about that vehicle.  Good luck with the BN4.   Need one myself.  Cheers...KR

Still working on my engine compartment mount for my BN4.  Still scared to 
start cutting. I've been searching the web for pictures (Type 4 engine bay pixs). 
 Anyway, thought you might want to see this BN4 install.  It is installed 
into a 1975 Pinzgauer.  I like the exhaust vent with bowden cable attached.  Also 
note the long exhaust under the car as well as the parts breakout.  Very nice:
