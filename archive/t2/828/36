Subject: Bucking & Popping...Weber carb issue??

I am working on a 72 Westy for a friend.  Its a 1700
and It has a Weber single carb (I know, I know, but
thats what its got!!) Anyway, I have gotten it to
where it will start and idle nicely, but in second and
third gear with the engine under a load (ie
accelorating, giving gas) it begins to buck and pop
(kinda like a back fire) If I back off on the gas
pedal, it improves the situation.  
Heres waht I know:  Good compression, No air or
exhaust leaks that I can find, and timing set
correctly.  So whaddy'all think??

Peace, John Baker
