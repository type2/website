Heather,
If your mother paid for the bill with a credit card, especially American
Express, tell her to DISPUTE IT as soon as the statement is cut.

This sounds like such a load of BS that if he wants his money, MAKE HIM SUE
YOUR MOTHER AND PROVE IT IN COURT!

Infuriating, the way certain mechanics cheat and extort us, isn't it?

FYI -  Update - Mom is at the shop taking care of the receipts - I talked to
him shortly, and he had very little patience for what i had to say. He said
that the engine is an "interference engine" and that he was completely
positive about this and since i didn't know exactly, I backed down...I did
however bring up some of the other issues, and of course without being there
or seeing the old parts he took off of it, and found out there was a
miscommunication somewhere between all of us - and he had replaced the
INTAKE manifold not the exhaust...but I am still not sure I have ever seen
an intake manifold completely clogged...

So, I told mom to get as much information as she could, and ensure she has
all the receipts for everything she has paid for, and she even got some of
the old parts back. At this point, I do feel bad that i could not help her,
but I think the ball is in her court now...she is driving to LA as soon as
she gets the car back. So, lesson learned, hindsight 20/20, she has her car
back on the road, and less money in her pocket. I am not sure if she should
have the car looked at (By a reputable mechanic) to make sure that all the
stuff was really done.

Ideas?

Thanks for all the help, and sorry for bothering those who did not want to
read something other than vw stuff :)
