Hindsight is 20/20 but next time she should just sell her car "AS IS".

She could have written a bill of sale saying something like "This car 
is being sold for parts use only.  If the new owner intends to use it 
on the road any necessary repairs will be the responsibility of the 
new owner."

While you are *supposed* to smog cars before selling them, the 
California DMV will let you transfer ownership without a smog 
certificate.

The new owner will have to deal with the smog stuff if they decide to 
put the car on the road.
