Subject: connector corrosion - update

Hello, Just wanted to pass on this link.  They sell the stock type copper 
blade connectors (a bit pricey though).  With the right crimp tool a perfect 
clamp connection can be made.  Seems a lot easier than tinning the ends before 
crimping.  I cleaned my connections for now.  I will probably be ordering these 
in the future.  If anyone finds a cheaper deal, please email me.
