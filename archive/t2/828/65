DMV will process the sale allowing the buyer to complete smog, but if
a buyer took a seller to court, there are serious fines for not
providing a smog certificate. Not sure how well the "for parts only"
disclaimer would hold up.

 I have bought multiple vehicles in California from private sellers
 "AS-IS" without Smog certificates.   Have you?

 In each case I transferred ownership without SMOG.  The DMV gave me a
 temporary tag to drive the vehicle while the repairs are done.
 After the vehicle passed smog (often many weeks later) I would be
 given the permanent tags and title.  Each time the DMV people would
 smile and process the paperwork as if they do it a dozen times a day.
