From an electrical engineering perspective, capacitance and inductance
are two different yet related properties.  The typical points/coil
based ignition system is also refered to as an inductive discharge
system, as the energy is stored in an inductive element (the ignition
coil).  Capacitive discharge implies that the energy is stored in a
capacitive element and then discharged through a transformer (like the
ignition coil) to up the voltage.

Take a look at:

for a good summary of the difference between inductive and capacitive
discharge ignitions.
