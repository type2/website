<<Where is anyone paying $200 a day for storage???>>

In my shop--in my yard.
It's taking up my space, and prohibiting me from, taking in another
truck in it's place.

Hint---the word here is class 8 semi.

I know of towing outfits that get $500.00 per day, plus the tow.

Don't argue with them or it'll be $800.00.

An individual has plenty of bargaining power with any insurance company.

Just don't lay down and die, and be a yes man.

Line up all of your ace's first, then let them make fools of themselves.
