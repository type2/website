I talked myself and the wife into keeping the GWB.

Here's the plan. Tell me if I'm missing anything. heh

Clean the junk out of the 71.
Have Busted Bus take it with all the deluxe goodies so somebody can get use
out of it. (Couldn't make myself take the doors and such off... It's too
nice.)
Get a couple guys to help me remove the hightop from the GWB.
Roll the GWB into the garage.
Find a way to fit the top in there as well. (the door opener is in the way
so I can't put it on after the bus is inside.)
Fix GWB at leisure in the garage.
Cut a hard top off a bus in BB's yard (that's ready for scrap) or in a
junkyard if necessary.
Using SS screws attach it raingutter to raingutter with a seal between.
Smog and license it.
Drive it to the Arctic Circle in 2007.

Am I missing anything?
Am I doing the right thing?

It makes sense to me. As much as I'd love to fix the 71 as well, it isn't
going to happen with my financial situation (worse than I thought... I
discovered some bad stuff last week. Plus I just got audited by CA and have
to pay back $1500 in taxes. And still haven't paid rent yet this month...)
