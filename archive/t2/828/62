Subject: 79 Westy HELP

Hello everyone.  I'm new to the list and I just acquired a 79 Westy.  This is a project for my son  and I and we need a little help.  The previous owner stripped it down and I need to put it back together.  I'm wondering if there are books that will help me on understanding how all the furniture and accessories work in the bus.  Most of the help is with the wiring.  Thanks in advance for any help.
