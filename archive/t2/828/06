Dino,
       VW type 2 tail lights are enough of a problem without salt air.  The RH 
side gets battery fumes...

I like to remove the assembly, clean the spade lugs with my Dremel, then solder 
flexible leads maybe 10-12" long.  Clean the bulb socket with the Dremel wire 
brush, and reinstall the bulb using vaseline or dielectric grease; some guys 
like lithium grease.  Reinstall the housing etc. and then pigtail-splice and 
solder the leads to the wiring of the bus after readying some shrink tube.  BTW 
shrink tube and/or dielectric grease over the spade lug joints can be helpful 
as well.

Why leave 10-12" from the spade lugs?  It makes working in the engine 
compartment easier; and when/if the procedure needs to be repeated,  you have 
some wire to spare... YMMV...  If Dremel tool and soldering iron are 
unfamiliar, try to enlist a model railroad enthusiast to help you.  Those guys 
live by Dremels and soldering irons ;-))
