Subject: Re: [T2] Unfamiliar Oil Leak

 <<It lays a puddle exactly in the middle (side to side) and rear of the
engine, directly below the crank pulley. I cannot see where the oil is
coming from because the engine hanger bar is in the way.>>

Sounds like a pretty good place to me for it to be leaking.

<< So, where do these beasts tend to leak?>>

No place special, everywhere in general John.
Pretty much like any other engine.

The VW engines I wouild have to say are more prone to leaking at the
push rod tube seals ( much as the Deutz diesel leaks at the same place )
or the oil cooler.
the seals dry up and shrink there often. 
 
<< What are the likely suspects for T4 oil leaks leaving a puddle where
I described?? >>

Pretty good

If you really are interested in pin pointing the leak John, pressure
wash the engine as well as you can and get yourself a oil leak detectror
kit.

It'll tell you right away ( or pretty quick) exactly where the oil is
coming from.
