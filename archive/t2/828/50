I bought a Westy on eBay earlier this year.  It was a CA vehicle vs a  
Federal Vehicle as evidenced on the plate by the passenger front door  outside.  I 
took a chance that I could get it passed.  I paid for it,  drove her from 
Eugene to Carlsbad, CA and went to AAA.  I made sure that  all brake and turn 
signal lights operated and that the horn worked.  They  registered it and took the 
money and in lieu of a plate, they gave me a red  Temporary Operating Sticker 
with a big number on it corresponding to the number  of the month in the year 
that it expired.
 
The AAA person told me that I could continue to operate the vehicle until  it 
passed smog and that if it took longer than the time allowed they would give  
me as many extensions as was necessary.  
So no problemo.  I got a  tune up and timing adjustment and she passed with 
flying colors.
