It does appear that the Crane XR700/XR3000 unit are NOT CDI.
Crane does have CDI units and they specifically state that
they are CDI. The XR700/XR3000 do not say they are CDI.

"XR700 and XR3000 electronic ignition modules use an optical trigger
assembly to replace conventional breaker points and original equipment
(OE) magnetic and Hall Effect pickup systems. The XR700 requires ballast
resistance to limit coil current. The XR3000 is a high performance version
with a computer chip that controls coil current and dwell. When installing
an XR3000, all OE ballast resistance must be bypassed."

The XR3000 states:

"Produces up to 150% greater spark gap energy over stock points
ignitions."
