Mark,
    Thanks for your reply - the Subaru is a loyal (4wd wagon). I totally
agree that he is ripping her off - and am frustrated that i cant do anything
about it....

I quoted mom a dealer price of $171 for a EGR valve for her car, and $49.99
for a OE O2 sensor....she hasn't said anything about the oil pump though....

I just found out the guy doesn't even have a certificate/license through BAR
(http://www.smogcheck.ca.gov/stdhome.asp)...

I think she may end up having to deal with small claims court (not sure yet)
unless she can get him to lower the price before she pays the rest- because
he is BSing her. I cant do that over the phone, because i cant inspect it,
and my mom honestly doesn't know what TO inspect...

Thanks for the info,
~H~
