Subject: 6v wipers

    Ok, now that I've gotten it running, its time to get a few other things
working. I've decided to convert the 66 to 12v. I'd like to convert the
wipers to 12v without using a voltage drop. Does anyone know if the wiper
motor or armature from a 68 would fit? I see conversion armatures offered
but they stop at 64. I have a 68 that I'm considering parting out but thats
another discussion.
thx all
