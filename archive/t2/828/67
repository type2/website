Subject: Dual Kadron Timing w/ 009

I have a motor with Dual Kadrons 40s and a 009 Dist. I am looking for a timing
recommendation on the stock 1600 dp with this set up
When it arrived it was set at 18 btdc and topping out at around 43 btdc -
seemed to run nicely without any hesitation - I backed it to advance to about
32 btdc and it is not good - hesitates sputters backfires and looks rich from
the tail pipe

I need some advice from people with this set up or know it anyways -

any thoughts

Thanks
Eric
