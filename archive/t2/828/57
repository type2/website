Anyone in South Africa?  I saw an awesome product called the "Blaster" last
night on TV.  It is sold in South Africa and  essentially it is two blow
torches.  Each is mounted on the underside of the vehicle.  It is foot
operated like a high beam switch.  Supposed to detract car thieves!  Very
cool.  Would be perfect for our 68.
