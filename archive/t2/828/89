Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

A friend of mine recently went through this. They will try to total
your bus if the cost of repair is near their estimate of the value of
the bus. This is not necessarily a bad thing because they also allow
you to buy it back for a token hundred or two after paying you the
value.

The biggest fight is to get them to recognize the full value of the
bus by getting them to accept it as an antique. They have a book that
will give the correct value, but you can nudge them in the right
direction by showing them comparable closed auctions on ebay and ads
on The Samba. If they don't know the difference between a Westy and a
Rivi, show them westy comps for a VW camper as they go higher.
