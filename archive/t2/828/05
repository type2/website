Subject: It runs

For the first time in over 4 years my 66 sundial actually ran down the road
under its own power! My son riding beside me called it a death trap-but he
did it with a big grin. As a long time listee who's gone into lurk
mode-maybe now I can get remotivated. Question of the day-the list discount
for bus depot-is it listee1 ?

thx all
