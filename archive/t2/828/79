Subject: Re: [T2] Bucking & Popping...Weber carb issue??

Hi John,
This "popping" is usually a symptom of the heat exchangers/manifold not 
sealing up correctly with the head.
It's sometimes hard to notice that there is an exhaust leak.

Here are some resources:

Single Weber setups can be a PIA to tune correctly on the bus engine... 
also Icing is always an issue.
Is this sound consistent during warm up? Does it go away after the 
engine has been running a while?
