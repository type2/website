Hi,


When the brushes of the generator are worn, will charging of the battery
reduce before the red light goes on when it is reduced to a critical level?
Or is it an all or none situation where charging stays the same until there
is no more contact from the brushes when the red light goes on?

I asked it because I now have taken the brushes out of the generator and
they are badly worn... that is indeed why the red light was on. But charging
of the dual battery system has always been a pain - because of the already
worn bruses? - and I still have this alternator without regulator...
But I think for now I will install the dynamo again and look for a suitable
regulator when time comes...

Sorry for boring you and thanks for helping, I hope in some days I can cut
this thread!

Bart
