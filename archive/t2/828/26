Properly done crimp connections are airtight and are as robust as a
soldered connection. good crimpers are expensive though and usually handle
only one or few specific connector types. the typical crimper does a
mediocre job of it.
I dont think the degradation of old vw harnesses is usually the crimp
itself but the connectors corroding.
