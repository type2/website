Subject: Pinzgauer BN4 Install

Hello All,
Still working on my engine compartment mount for my BN4.  Still scared to 
start cutting. I've been searching the web for pictures (Type 4 engine bay pixs). 
 Anyway, thought you might want to see this BN4 install.  It is installed 
into a 1975 Pinzgauer.  I like the exhaust vent with bowden cable attached.  Also 
note the long exhaust under the car as well as the parts breakout.  Very nice:
