Subject: Bus accident

Been here before.  The problem is the damage is
probably more costly to fix than the bluebook value of
the bus.  They will only give you the value of the car
on the open market.  You can take that value less the
salvage value and keep the bus but basically if you
get hit in a bus and want to put it back to where it
was before the accident you are pretty much on your
own.  I've been thinking of getting a great big inner
tube and inflatting it around my vehicles just to keep
the idiots away.
