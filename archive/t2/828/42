Aye.

IIRC, the throttle linkage, heater cables, and a few other bits and
pieces under the engine are the only bits needed to be done before she's
operational again(assuming I got all the bits in the engine compartment
back in properly, which I wouldn't guarantee as I'm far more familiar
with Type 1 engines than Type IV and this was my first solo drop of the
Type IV). I figured it was about 45-60 mins work at the time, but never
got it done. Selling one's house and emigrating to a new country is a
rather busy-making task. :) And she was on a non-op cert, so I'd have to
tow 'er to the storage locker anyway. Wasn't a real high priority
compared to passports, plane tickets, etc.

But by all means, if somebody *really* wants to finish my install of the
rebuilt engine (and likely charge the battery, as again it's not been
touched since 11-2003), burning it off will work fine. But if it were me
(and I'm the guy that dropped the engine) I'd just pop the fuel line and
drain 'er into an oilpan. :)
