hello Heather     This guy is a rip off     All the subarus in 91 weren't 
inteference motors which means that the valves dont get bent when the timing belt 
breaks.  Now you didn't say which model the car was  but most common are the 
loyales and legacys  all which have hydralic valves so there isn't any 
adjustments to them .  they are famous about the oil pumps needing either rebuilt or 
replaced.  There is a rebuild kit for them which is about $12  The o2 senser 
is a single wire unit and can be replaced for about $50 or cheaper using a 
universal one like bosch # 12 o25  . I would have to check the egr .but the most 
common thing we see is the egr solenoid which sets up the check engine lite and 
cost about $100 from the dealer.   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
