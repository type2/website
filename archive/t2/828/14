John-

AFAIK, that phenolic spacer is required regardless of carb setup and with
stock FI. I assume it's there to maintain proper mix velocity into the
intake ports, just like a carb spacer is used on a conventional motor.
They're not terribly expensive ($5-$7 each?), but be careful tightening the
bolts down as they're quite fragile and will break if over-torqued. Hope
this helps-
