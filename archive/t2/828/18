Subject: 10 weeks until camping season re-opens in the Great White North

Hi Volks,

With the annual "12V heater" and "winterizing fuel additives"  
discussions a fading memory on the lists, thoughts are once again  
coming around to camping season. I know it *seems* like a hundred  
years away to those in the frozen wastelands, but in Southern Ontario  
it's much much closer... Just 10 weeks from tomorrow the buses will  
be gathering at the third annual True Canadian Winter Bus Campout.

February 18th,
Valens Conservation Area, just North of Hamilton Ontario Canada.

This year promises to be more of the same campfire-enhanced fun and  
fellowship enjoyed the past two years by bus-junkies too starved for  
a fix to wait for EveryBus in April. Plenty of campsites with  
electrical hookups are available, and there are showers and laundry  
facilities avalable.

Bring firewood if you can.... There will be a deep-fried turkey  
dinner this year and the usual FMBC Breakfast Burritos on Sunday  
morning. Please drop me an email if you're planning on attending.

Happy trails,
