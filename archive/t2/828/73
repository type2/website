Subject: bus accident

I was in a car accident with my bus this past Tuesday. Except
for some lower back aches I seem to be unharmed. I will be
going to the doctor this week to have myself checked to be
sure though. The driver of the other vehicle seems to be fine.
We were both were wearing our seat belts.

After the car accident I was contacted by the other drivers
insurance company. The agent wanted to go over the accident
details to hear my side of the story... Now her insurance
company is covering my repair cost as I only have liablity
coverage. I was told by their insurance agent that because
the age of my bus they might total the vehicle, or something
to that effect(?) depending on damage. This was before the
insurance company had looked over the damage though. Someone
from her insurance company has since stopped by on Friday
to look at the damage.

Here are some digital photos i've taken of the bus.

The damage looks as if it can be repaired but I don't know
about this and could use some advice. The driver side door
hinge area looks badly damaged, i'm not sure how this would
be repaired. The bottom base frame looks to be OK from what
I can see though.

Please send me your thoughts on the damage. Does this look
like it can be repaired? Also I could use any advice on how
to work with the her insurance agent over this matter, etc.
