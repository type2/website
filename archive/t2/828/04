I run a compufire DIS-IX kit without any issues for 45K miles. This is in
weather from 90 + degrees to -20 degrees in all different loading
situations. There are better & more expensive kits, but this one works just
fine.

I'll be using a MSD unit and traditional coil for my fuel injected motor, so
we'll see how that goes...
