If true, why does the camper use the solid regular 120v solid copper 
house wiring from the outside input to the inside outlet? (and to the 
converter for the fridge?)

  The wire must be copper, but even copper corrodes in the marine
  environment, and corrosion is the primary cause of electrical failures
  on a boat. Plating each strand of the wire with a thin coat of tin
  (called tinning) dramatically improves corrosion resistance. The
  additional cost of tinned wire is nominal, the benefits substantial.

Is tinning like soldering over the end?  I've done this for 
multistranded battery cable where I cut off the bad connector and heated 
the end with a torch and then ran solder throughout the end. I have 
noteced that multistraned OLD copper cable corrodes over every strand 
within a crimp.  Is there a painton substance or coating that will 
actually airproof the connection?
