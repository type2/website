Subject: Anyone in Santa Fe know reputable VW Shop?

Folks, I'm visiting Santa Fe, NM. I live in Phoenix. My 69 Bus's front 
left is making a clunk noise when I turn left. Who can I see to get it 
looked at. I panic easily over noises & am 512 miles from my own 
mechanic. Please help ASAP!
Thanks in advance,
Timothy.
