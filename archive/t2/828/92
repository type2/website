Do what you want to. Here are three options. 
1 take it to a VW shop that does restoration to give you the value of it.  It 
works even after the accident. How do I know you ask. I work at a VW shop  
that does it. The insurance company goes by how little they can pay you.
2 If they low ball you. You sue the other driver. When you sue them the  
insurance company takes over and you prove your case in court. With estimates  and 
photos of your bus and any Ebay or Samba ads that prove your case.
3 Be a nice guy and let the insurance company screw you over because you  
don't want to hassle.
Most people choose number 3. and get pissed at the insurance company when  
it's the owners fault for not hassling it out. 
You can show attitude to the adjuster but, believe what you want they could  
care less. To them, they are doing you a favor giving you any money. Don't get 
 mislead. Stick to the mission. The mission is to get all you can for a 
wrecked  old vehicle. Be cool and have your crap in order and together. That's how 
you do  business. You will not strong arm insurance companies. Contrary to 
popular  belief. You deal with them and if that doesn't work don't take there 
money and  go to court. Don't try and threaten them with aches and pains. You are 
either  hurt or not. If you are don't be tough. Go to doctors and they will 
pay. If your  not hurt then go through the process of collecting your money for 
the bus.
