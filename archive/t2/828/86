<<VERY IMPORTANT, make sure they DON'T use the "blue book" value,
vehicles that old are list in the "green Book" usually can be found at
the main library. the green Book is for "Classic" vehicles, when my 78
was hit the blue book value was $750, and they wanted to total it, the
green book value was $2,800 they fixed it...>>

Green book, black book, white book, it really doesn't make much
difference what color it is.

Whatever rthe estimate may be the adjuster is there to chop it up, and
save the Insurance Co. as much money as possible

He's paid a commison for doing this--and don't let him try and tell you
he isn't.

I had an estimate written on a wacked Mack for $19,000.00 and some
change to repair the cab and nose.
This was written at $85.00 per hour, including  parts.

The insurance guy came over and chopped up the estimate--no bok no
nothing, just a percentage coming out of his head.

"$12,575.00 dollars is all I can Pay"

I told him this----

"Good---
Now you can get this thing outa here right now---
But first your wrtiing me a check for tearaing this thing down for
inspection prior to writting the estimate, and for writting the
estimate, and then for the weeks worth of storage while it's been here
."

"Storage is $200.00 a day."

"The clock is ticking you better do something right now--and itisn't
leaving till you pay me "

"Oh--and the owner of the truck wants one of two places to fix this
vehicle.
Me or Mack truck.
Macks labor rate is $105.00 per hour, you better have it towed there"

Buy the time I got done with him he approved what I had written--which
was totally legit--but he pissed me off when he started nickel and
diming the bottom line.

DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO TAKE IT TO ONE OF THEIR "APPROVED" BODY SHOPS.
It's a cave and pave facility and they are paid to do jippo work just
for the nsurance company.

DO NOT TAKE A IMMEDIATE PAY OFF!!

The adjuster will offer to pay you off right on the spot---do not do
that!!

You'll be hosing yourself.

Get to a body shop you want to take it to first--then start playing
games with them---
