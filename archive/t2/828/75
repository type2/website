Subject: new heat exchanger

After taking a better look at the right side of the heating system I 
decided to buy a used HE and the tube that runs from the HE to the 
flapper box.  It's really nice having Chris and the bustedbus.com parts 
collection so close by!  He crawled under her and figured out what was 
needed and so on.  Great guy.  Anyway ... The new HE took about 2 hours 
to install.  The real test will be tomorrow morning during my cold and 
dark drive into work, but in testing today I would have to say the 
volume of air has roughly doubled.  It seemed nice and hot too, but it's 
45 degrees today.

Here are the pictures...

A special thanks to Chris and Jim for their help yesterday.
