Got this dizzy from a fellow busser who got it recently at EB2K3 thinking it 
would fit his 60 splitty and ended up not fitting. Anyway I paid ten bucks for 
it and its the OG dizzy for my 69 (113 905 205T) or the replacement for the 
earlier 205M and had a question about the drive pinion. There is about a 1/16" 
verticle play in the drive pinion. Is this play normal? I've not noticed it in 
my other distributor that came off of my 76. If normal what would be some good 
measures to take to prepare it for installation besides points, condensor, cap, 
rotor. There is a wire that looks like a ground wire (small braided) that has 
been spliced and is somewhat corroded. It has a fork style connector on the end 
and is held down by the points screw, definately aftermarket. Suggestion 
please. I want to see how the stock stuff differs from this 009 and I've never 
swapped the whole dizzy out and wanted to do it for sh*%$ and giggles.
