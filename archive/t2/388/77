Under the jacking points or under the torsion bar housings. You can also 
put them under the axle hubs but I don't like it there because of the 
potential to slip.

The rating should be on the box or stamped on the stand itself. If you 
don't know - go buy a new set. Cheaper than a trip to the hospital or a 
funeral.
