Subject: clutch cable

 My clutch pedal went "bang" this morning and it looks like one of the cable strands has broken away from the crimped end at the back by nut. The cable is 13 years old and I think the last one broken in the same way. Before I put my travelling spare on does anyone have any advice for keeping the corrosion away from that stress area? Just grease it up some?
