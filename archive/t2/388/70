Subject: Re: [T2] Yokohmam Y370's

Cy (ext. 622) from Tire Rack just called me back with the info that the
Y370's are indeed NLA.  He also said that the Y356's are OOS and not
expected until the end of June (or later).


Damn I must have got the last set of 356's. I got the load range D. Ordered
them last week came in 2 days to DC area(Faster than Bus Depot ;-) ) So far
I'm very pleased but then I had car tires on the bus before.
