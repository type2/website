Subject: Re: Distributor score

Dave I think you've taken what I'm saying wrong. I'm not talking about the two 
nubs that are offset that are on the very end of the drive pinion that slide 
down in the engine. I'm talking about the underside of the housing itself. The 
stopping point, where the shaft cannot go in any farther, right at the point 
where it looks as if it were turned down in a lathe , there are actually three 
evenly spaced nubs, ribs, that butt right up againsted the case. They are too 
wide for the distributor clamp and will not allow the distributor to drop in 
all the way with the clamp on. It will without the clamp.
