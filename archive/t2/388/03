Subject: powdercoating rims

hello

i know this subject was on the list no too long ago (or the VB list) but at
the end it seems one guy told to use Primer Zinc on the rims so the
powdercoating is more efficient!

Is this primer the  yellow stuff sold at auto part?   should i cover the
entier rims with the yellow zinc primer ?

i brought my  Bay rims yesterday to sandblast, so theyll be ready for
powdercoating this week...

I plan to powdercoat white, i already did this to my bumpers, but the process
wasnt perfect, there is some tiny small hole not covered by the paint that
start to rust... i presume its because i sandblasted them and didnt use any
primer or metal surfacer...

But the look of white bumper powdercoated is awesome! after one day running,
with bugs in the front and oil in the rear, you cant telle the difference
anymore... hahaha
