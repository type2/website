Subject: Mann oil filter question

It seems that the "regular" Mann oil filter part number for air-cooled
Vanagons is 920/17 but I've also seen a more "generic" reference to Mann oil
filter 719/5.  Does anybody know the differences between these two filters
and if the 719/5 will really work for the air-cooled Vanagons?

TIA.
