Hey Shawn,
I had this happen to me.
I removed the pipe cleaned with steel wool and used a propane torch flux and 
solder to tin the outside surface thus increasing the Dia. a smooth uniform 
surface is needed so remove blobs of solder by heating to melt point and wiping 
quickly with steel wool.
I then used a small hammer and tapped it back in place.
Never leaked and never pulled out again.
