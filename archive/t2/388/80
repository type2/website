this of course is with a manual tranny, auto trannies should almost always
be dropped seperately for a couple major reasons

.  the auto tranny is much heavier than the manual
.  the auto tranny engine does not need the same clearances as a manual
.  the auto tranny linkages are more complex and difficult to adjust and
really shouldn't be removed unless necessary
.  front tranny mount of the auto tranny is different and can slip out
