Subject: need help with bodywork 65' Splitty in CT

Hi everyone, well I am now a proud owner of a 1965 Splitty. :-) My only problem at the moment is the bodywork. It needs a Ton of it, and I've never done much bodywork before. I have a basic understanding, and I want to learn, and want to try to do it myself, but I don't want to mess it up. I am looking for someone who is willing to help me with this project, but I don't have alot of money, and realize this may make things difficult. I am willing to work out payment reimbursment by working it off in some way ( anything from yardwork, cleaning up shop to providing mechanical work that I can do ), or providing beer, or almost anything someone can think of. I don't want to just drop it off, and have someone else do the work, I want to help and learn from the expierence as much as possible. If there is anyone out there that can hook me up, and is willing to help me out, that would be so awsome. :-) I know that this maybe a long shot, especially living in CT, but there's gotta be someone out there.................. thanx in advance,Tracy85' GL "Ripple"65' Splitty
