Subject: Re: Distributor score

I think I got it figured out. The PO wallered out the clamp (got a new one) 
which let the 009 drop down that much further (thickness of the clamp) to 
engage the drive gear and still be able to clamp dizzy. Why, because whoever 
rebuilt the motor (AK, replacement case) didn't shim the drive gear properly, 
which remains to be seen because I have not yet pulled the drive gear to see if 
it has the proper shims. The "nubs" on the stock dizzy wouldn't let this 
wallered out clamp fit because thats not where it's supposed to fit anyway (as 
PO had it on the 009) which confused the heck out of me being that it is my 
first time R&Ring a distributor. So my next step is to remove drive gear and 
either put proper shims in it or add extra shims to boost its height?
