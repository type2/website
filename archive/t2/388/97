Make sure the clamp isn't bent or deformed. It should be flat and sit down
flat on the case.  To remove it, you have to take off the 13mm nut that
holds it down vertically. If the bolt is bent, you will need to cut it out
with a hacksaw, and replace it with a correct metric bolt of the same size.
Bent clamps can be straighted out with careful vice work. 009's fit in fine.
Make sure you have the o-ring on the shaft. You will need to verify where
cylinder #1 is on the cap and get your 1432 order correct.
