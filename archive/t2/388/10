I hate to wake the sleeping giants but what the heck.
I did read the archives and came the conclusion that the GL5-MT1 has been 
reformulated and is acceptable for manual VW gearbox.
I got the impression that the GL5 warnings were now unfounded.

Am I killing my trans or not?
Fat dumb and happy (or 2 out of three) running GL5-MT1 for 80+ Mi. on rebuilt 
transmission.
Please slap some sense into me if I need it.
