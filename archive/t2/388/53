Subject: Solex 30 Pict 3 Carb ... how much?

Hi all,

sorry if this is a stupid question to many of you, but I have been away for 
a while...
I have not had my beautiful old '69 Westy for a couple years, and while 
going through some things today, I found what used to be my spare carb.
It's a Solex 30 Pict-3, made in W.Germany, and it is really clean and in 
great shape.

I'd like to sell it now, but I have no idea how much these are worth...

If anyone can give me a general idea, I would really appreciate it.

As well as this, if anyone is looking for one of these, please let me know.

thanks for the space, and please pmail with your input.
