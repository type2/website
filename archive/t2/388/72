I used West Coast metric seals through Bus Depot I think. All the seals 
were very good. Now three years later the rear window seals are starting to 
split in the corners. No big deal to replace. Half an hour.

Sliding door deal is a trip - I still wonder if I've got it right side up.

Everything fit the first time. Some of the seals like the poptop seals 
required a bit of trimming.

If you replace the window scrapers (outside) that come with the aluminum 
trim be sure to save your OEM trim and resuse it. The replacement trim is 
poor aluminum and very fragile. The OEM stuff was stronger in my opinion. 
The replacement clips are a joke being aluminum vs. spring steel which I 
think the OEM versions were. I used some generic GM nylon trim clips with 
the head cut down as a replacement. Much better than even the OEM clips. I 
can provide more detail if necessary.
