Ah, then.  I was pondering the feasibility of making a set of inserts that
could be popped into the housing, with the lens off for servicing.  The
resin that I use is easily painted, but it's also electroplatable.

I can't afford to do anything large and have it plated, but the inserts
would be rather small and possibly more economical to have plated.  I'd try
chrome paint first, though.  If you spray paint in the mold before pouring
the resin, it permanently bonds with the resin and doesn't flake off.

Just trying to find new ways to make a buck... :O)

Thanks, Richard.
