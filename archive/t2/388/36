Richard,

Paint it with por-15 or squirt rtv all over it and then slide
heat shrink tubing over it and seal it.

If it corrodes or can rust, I paint it<grin>...

You know I'm a big por-15 fan.

Cheers, dave

 cable is 13 years old and I think the last one broken in the same way. 
Before I put my travelling spare on does anyone have any advice for 
keeping the corrosion away from that stress area? Just grease it up some?
