Hey Jeff.. You are doing a good thing adding a CHT gauge.  And the price
has fallen off considerably!
Bad timing for you ,,, cause ,if you had paid the price before you smoked
the engine,, you wouldn't have even know how valuable that gauge is!

At one point on the list ,, we had a lot of preaching to CHANGE YOUR FUEL
LINES....

Don't sleep with a heater running in your Bus, or you might not wake up

and we really need to tell people IMHO, If your not running a CHT gauge,,
you have NO IDEA what is happening until,,, <sigh> another Veedubya engine
is toast.
I should buy shares in the gauge company!

A vacuum gauge and a CHT are very significant information

YMMV.

Jamie.. I hate to say I told you so.... Rivers
