If this is the first in a long time then I would remove both batteries and 
use a pressure washer. Ultimately we pulled the engine, cleaned everything 
with simple green and SOS pads. It became obvious that that was the time to 
paint so everything got new paint.

We never cover anything, just be sure that the engine isn't red hot when 
you do it. The hoses and wiring is so "deep" in there that were couldn't 
get everything clean without removing a few things and doing it with an SOS 
pad and a bucket.

Once you get it clean it is easy to keep it clean.
