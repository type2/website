My Mexican engines come with BP5ES-A plugs.  I couldn't find the
suffix -A plugs ("-A" indicates some unspecified modification in the NGK
numbering system) but ordinary BP5ES plugs work just fine for me.  The "P"
prefix indicates a projected tip that supposedly runs cleaner.  I agree
that the "R" (resistor) plugs aren't a good idea if you're running stock
radio-supression plug wires.  I think that they are made for use with
non-supression wire.
