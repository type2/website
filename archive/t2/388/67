Hi Rick,

I have the CHT sender on my stock 1974 1.8L engine on the #3 spark 
plug. It reads as follows:

250-300 in-town
350 on a typical 60MPH flat highway.
400 with a headwind or up a long hill, and at 70-75MPH on a flat 
highway..

I've seen 435 on a very long hill with a heavy load. Once I crested 
that hill the temps quickly dropped back below 400.

Happy trails,
