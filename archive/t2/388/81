Ask the powdercoater if the powder material
is urethane or tgic ( t-g-i-c ).
The gloss black ( bar stool ) may not be weatherable.
If you use PPG urethane liquid paint, you will not be
powdercoating those wheels.
The automated process you mention may not be
to your advantage, as wheels have thicker metal
than the other product in the production run.
That means the wheels will likely be underbaked.
