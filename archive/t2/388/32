Subject: Fuel Line replacement - Nipple on fuel pump came loose

I finally got under the bus today to change the fuel lines on my '73
camper.  It feels good to get a nice snug fit of fresh hoses and clamps.
One problem occured, however.... when I was pulling the hose that goes from
the mechanical fuel pump to the gas filter, the small nipple popped right
off along with the hose.  I changed the hoses and put it back in place,
however I'm not sure if it's safe just to leave it "pushed" back into
place.  Has anyone else had this nipple pop off?  Is it normal?  Do I need
to pull off the fuel pump and somehow glue it back in place more securely?
Am I good to go?

All help much appreciated.  Also I will post a tech article for the
replacement of this model bus ASAP, following Billy's model for the later
models w/ FI.

Thanks,
Shawn.
