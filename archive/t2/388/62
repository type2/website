Subject: Gauge Calibration?

Hi Gang,

I installed the usual VDO gauges with my rebuilt engine, and wanted a
reality check on the temp readings I'm getting.

Oil Temp Sender is in the sump; CHT sender is wedged between cooling fins
near #3 spark plug.

				Highway(50-55 mph)			City
Oil Temp			170						180
CHT 				240						190


I'm wondering if the CHT readings are low due to sender location...I gather
from the archives that about 350 is the safe upper limit for a hill climb. I
have about 150 miles on the rebuild. I'm running high octane fuel (for now)
and have the EGR installed (for now...)

TIA,
