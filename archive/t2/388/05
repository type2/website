Subject: Re; Powdercoating Rims

Duponts Vari Prime ( zinc chromate acid etch primer ) is the best stuff
you could use for any metal surface prior to painting--available at any
better body shop supply store.

BUT--I don't know if in fact it will withstand the baking process that
the powder coating needs to cure--

I was under the impression that the powdercoating required bare, naked,
squeaky clean steel to work properly.
I might be wrong -

I would inquire with the powdercoating rep, prior to making this
decision.
I'd sandblast them, zinc chromate them, give them a coat of SW
Ultrafill, and paint them with PPG's Concept--(urethane ) Pretty tough
stuff, and looks like glass when the job is done.

Then I know they wouldn't rust---:>)
Later,
Terry

hello
i know this subject was on the list no too long ago (or the VB list) but
at the end it seems one guy told to use Primer Zinc on the rims so the
powdercoating is more efficient!
Is this primer the yellow stuff sold at auto part?   should i cover
the
entier rims with the yellow zinc primer ? i brought my Bay rims
yesterday to sandblast, so theyll be ready for powdercoating this
week...
I plan to powdercoat white, i already did this to my bumpers, but the
process wasnt perfect, there is some tiny small hole not covered by the
paint that start to rust... i presume its because i sandblasted them and
didnt use any primer or metal surfacer...
But the look of white bumper powdercoated is awesome! after one day
running, with bugs in the front and oil in the rear, you cant telle the
difference anymore... hahaha
