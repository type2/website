The local VW club meets on the first Friday of every month (which is
actually a regular city holiday called "First Friday"), and while we missed
last month's meeting, it was on the news.

I was surprised to find that one of the club members has a bus that was used
by the Dead on their road trips.  They posted the video from the news
coverage at the website, http://www.csravwclub.org/.
