Hi Guys,

Just before I unsubscribe,I wanted to take the opportunity to say
goodbye to the Type2 list and all you good people.
I've been a subscriber ever since the original days of one list for
all models of the wonderful Transporter and it's variants,
however I've been pretty quiet for a while now so for some of the
newer listees here,our paths never crossed...

Two days ago the last of my aircooled fleet was sold,and with
my '76 Double Cab gone to reside with my brother several months
ago,it's time to remain subscribed to the vanagon list only.

I just don't have the time to devote to the air cooled classics
anymore and besides,keeping 4 vehicles roadworthy,registered
and insured was getting a bit of a luxury.

Only one A/C VW remains with me and it is quite an odd
and indeed rare use for the VW 1200 industrial engine.
For anybody who cares,you can have a look at it in it's
unrestored state at...

I hope to restore this to running condition in the next few
months.

Anyway before I go I wanted to simply say thanks for all the
years of fun aircooled stuff,the help and advice I received,
particularly from the old stalwarts of the list and for all the
enjoyable cyberspace conversations I've had with some of
you over the past 7 years or so...I've really enjoyed it :)

Keep the aircooled dream alive,best of luck to you and may
the VW Gods be kind...;)
...and a special mention to all you Double Cab owners out
there...

Gute Fahrt!
