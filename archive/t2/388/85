Subject: RE: clutch cable

You're joking right?  You have a clutch cable for 13 years, you think it
breaks in the same spot, and you wonder if there is anything you can do
to have it last longer.  I'm sorry but I find this pretty funny.  I wish
I could keep a clutch cable from breaking for 2 years.  Some things do
just wear out.





My clutch pedal went "bang" this morning and it looks like one of the
cable strands has broken away from the crimped end at the back by nut.
The cable is 13 years old and I think the last one broken in the same
way. Before I put my traveling spare on does anyone have any advice for
keeping the corrosion away from that stress area? Just grease it up
some?
