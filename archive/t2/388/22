Subject: Re: [T2] Do I drop both Tranny and Engine together?

heya chris well dropping the engine and tranny together is the way that the bus was designed but you can although drop the engine without dropping the tranny.

i myself just did this not a week ago for the first time by myself.
it is easier to drop the engine by its self in my opinion.

you have to take the front part of the engine skirt off to put back in so that you can lean the engine back or tilt it back on the jack in order to pivot it back up into the tranny.

when doing this you may want help when reinstalling.
someone to make sure everything is steady then again like me you might work better alone.

be patient with this please.

it is easy to do now that i have done it once.
any questions for me just no problem e-mail me.
i went through it really toughly trying to figure it out 
i finally got it down with the support of type2.com and fullmoonbusclub.com.

holler i would be more than willing to help you since it is all still pretty fresh on my mind and i am fixing to drop it back out again to do somemore work.
peace
