Subject: RE: [T2] Re; Powdercoating Rims

hey nice shop you have in TN

here my powdercoater is a shop that make bar stool and other metal chair, and
they powdercoat their product .

When i bring my stuff they put it with their stuff... usually gloss black, if
i want white (for bumpers) i must wait a few weeks because they have a special
product for outdoor white that resist to UV, and white is less in demand.  Now
its kind of a big oven and the processs is automated.  I could ask for
specific color but then theyll do it with a small gun ...

Maybe for the rim i think ill give a try to PPG urethane stuff as stated
before... first ill ask a few question to the technical guy responsible for
powdercoating to try to avoid any small crevice!

There was a few good point on the list i will bring to him (thanks Mike
Paskiet and other).
