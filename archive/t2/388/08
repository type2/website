Switch to NGK either B6HS or B5HS (this is what the new Mexico 1600's use
except in a long reach). AVOID the BP and/or BPR NGK's, I have had problems
with those.

OK, I've got a stumper...1600 single port, 009 (I know, I know), 30/31
carb. I just adjusted my valves (only about 3 or 4, the rest were     
fine), changed my oil, and put in new Bosch w8ac plugs. Engine still  
runs fine, but seems like it takes a little longer to warm up, and the
kicker is that it now backfires at idle. Not a whole lot, and not     
really loud ones, just little pops, which seem to go away as soon as I
up the RPM's...                                                       
Any thoughts? Ideas?                                                  
Thanks,
