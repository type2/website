Subject: new battery, not alternator, maybe a short?

Okay,
so I went out and bought a new battery.
I test the voltage before I put it in.
Then I let the bus run and check it again.
Then I turn it off and check it again.
Good news, it is charging, so it can't be the alternator then, right?
leave the battery in and check again a little later.
It is dropping at a very steady pace. about .01 volts per second.
Does this mean I have a short somewhere?
I have been taking the battery cables off when I park it for more than a 
couple of minutes for now, but it is a pain and I want to fix it.
Also, someone said I could just remove the ground strap when I park.
Is this okay or should i remove both?
