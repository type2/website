Thanks for all your suggestions.  You all said...

Did that and double checked.

Haven't done that exactly but the valves do move with a turning engine
and the AVP short block is only 10K miles old.

I have bought new wires from 2 different sources without a change in
performance but you never know....

009 7-10 BTDC idle, 28-32 deg. total.  Seems to have a normal advance.

I think so.  It accelerates smoothly from stop to 10 MPH or so, then
loses steam.

Done that several times.  Will do again with an open mind.

Had a small leak early on, they are fully set and tight now.

Between 110 and 117, less than 5 lbs. more wet.

Tried 3 different carbs with no significant difference.

Bosch plugs in, new and good.  Using pertronix ignition, (I also put in
points and set dwell to verify it wasn't a problem).  See above re:
dizzy.

Now this is the idea that is most intriguing of all.  I assumed that the
fuel pump was a go/nogo kind of part.  But if the diaphragm is damaged
(rusty gas had gone through it), and it doesn't keep the float bowl
full, could it create a fuel starvation scenario, poor power at speed?
HMMMM.  Might be worth $20 to find out.  In a way, it's the only part
left.
