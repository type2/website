Subject: Engine bay cleaning

Hi all,

I really need to clean the engine bay in my '78, but I am a little hesitant. 
  Does anyone have pictures of their engine prepped and ready to be cleaned 
(ie, important parts tin foiled, bagged, etc)? Any other suggestions, 
personal experiences, thoughts, ideas, would be great too.  Feel free to 
respond off the list.

Thanks,
Susan
