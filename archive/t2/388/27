I've heard rumor that they're still produced for the Canadian market, but
they're not DOT legal.

Darn...

Thanks, David.  I didn't really want to get the Yokohama Y356's, but I'm a
bit tire-poor knowledge-wise and was hoping that the Y370's were still
available somewhere (still waiting on the callback from Tire Rack).  I was
going by the knowledge base at the T2 website, but didn't realize that that
particular article was out of date.

At the risk of plying dangerously close to the rim of another tiring tire
tread... ah, thread (ba-da-bing), would you happen to know the
stats/availability on a tire very close to the M&S Y370's?  (Private replies
are okay.)
