Richard,

IIRC, glycerine, glycerine, glycerine....I have seen several references
in some of the old owners manuals and a few other places.

I bought some last week at the local Wal-mart...you may have to ask the
pharamcist for it though as sometimes they don't leave it "out".

The pharmacist will have it because they frequently use it to mix 
medicines.

No, I have not used it yet, so I don't know how it is going to work....

Cheers, dave
