Subject: Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

"- Champagne Edition I ('77)
- Champagne Edition II - microbus ('78)
- Champagne Edition II - Westfalia ('78)
- Silberfisch ('78)

The Silberfisch was a German model, the Champagne
Edition buses were sold only in the USA (and Canada
perhaps??). Here's a 1978 Champagne Edition II so you
know what I am talking about:

I would like to get in touch with owners of these
special models. So my question is:

   Is there anyone on the list with
   any of these buses?
   Or who knows owners that are not
   on the list but who like to get
   in touch with me?

I have a 78' Champagne Westy that is great! It is no loner entirely brown
in fact I am probably going to paint it gray and white when I get to that
stage. What do you want to know about it?
