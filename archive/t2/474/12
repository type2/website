AHhhh. occasional problems are always so fun. I would see if you can
get it to happen on your own time, like this weekend w/ your friend.
When it happens, first thing is to check for spark. If you have spark
at this point and it doesn't start, it's almost definately a fuel
delivery problem. Then start w/ the bentley FI trouble shooting and
you should find the problem.
