Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch Red Coil again

Hello Andrea

Tanks for your advice on the red coil, I used a 1.1 ohms ressistance
conected to the terminal 15 of the coil, since this is my 65 bug that I used
just for fun in the weekends i gess is gonna be fine, I when to a test ride
of about one hour with no problem at all, I also conected a choke wire (6
volts) to the terminal 1 of the coil, due of the ressistance the amount of
electricity after the 12 volts go trough the coil then to the "-" terminal
must be drop enough to make the choke work properly (I hope) I have a lot to
learn about VW electricity so I am trying by now.

Thanks

Roberto
