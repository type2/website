Subject: Running in a new engine

Ashley's new engine is being fitted today. Apart from regular oil changes
and not lugging it, any other advice on running in ?

I've never had a new engine before so I'm not too sure what to expect. The
supplier just said "Don't go 70mph down the motorway straight away." which
is a bit vauge.

Should I limit myself to 50 or less ? How long for ?

What will I notice as the engine runs in ? More power ? Smoother running ?

What is happening in the engine while this happens ?
