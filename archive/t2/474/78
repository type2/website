Robert,

You might consider powder coating.  It's never gonna look like
"real" chrome, but not too bad either.  Go look at the local powder 
coaters after they do a run of "chrome" with hi gloss.

Go look at eastwoodco.com and look at some of their "hi-tech" colors.


I powder coated my tailpipe with hi-temp powder coat and it still looks
the same after about 400 miles...same for my heater boxes and their 
manifolds...even up close to the heads.

Cheers, dave

I have not yet installed it and I do not know how

I also would like shiney bumpers.  Is nickel plating possible and/or a good idea.
