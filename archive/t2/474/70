Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome plating...now I know!

 What are suitable alternatives?  I have a nickel plated exhaust pipe for my '72.  I have not yet installed it and I do not know how long it will last ($15 from E***).  I also would like shiney bumpers.  Is nickel plating possible and/or a good idea.

I also have had items rhodium plated, I cannot remember how much that cost, but I doubt that is practical for car parts.
