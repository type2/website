>Thanks for the lead on the gauges, Barry.  I ordered a set :)

Did you notice that there was a set price for shipping, if you ordered ONE 
set or 10 sets!!

You may want to call back order another set for one of your friends..  Makes 
a nice Xmas present, or just a nice thing to do


They would go nicely where the radio now is located, and the radio into the 
glove compartment for security.

I have been saving a brand new OEM radio blockoff plate, the correct size 
and texture.  Perhaps the casting fool could use as a model and have him 
cast with three openings for the 1 1/2" gauges???!!!???

Anyway, thanks for mentioning.
