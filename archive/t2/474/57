Subject: 77 Automatic Selector Lever Not aligning...

I've got a 77 Westy Automatic.

Recently pulled and re-installed motor, now the Drive
Selector doesn't quite line up.

Everything functions perfectly It drives fine, just
not ligned up.

Everything is shifted down one...
Park is closer to reverse
Drive is closer to D2
And D1 is can't be reached.
Etc...

How big of an issue is this ? and how would I adjust
it ?

thanks
bob
