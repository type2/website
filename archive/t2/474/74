Subject: RE: [T2] Chrome plating...now I know!

Hi  Volks- I powder coated everything that I could. Wheels, bumpers,
headlight rims,windshield wipers,and other stuff.  Comes in all colors
including a silver, while not chrome, is very nice. Cost- aprox. $400.00,
which also included all the engine tin. Very low maintenance. TBear
