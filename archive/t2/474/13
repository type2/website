Beth,

I've seen coils do this before, backed out of my driveway one day
and my bug literally died in the street.  Freaked out...checked for spark
and found none....replaced with *real* Bosch and had no problems again.

Drive it till it dies and then check for the usuall culprits..

Got gas?
Got air?
Got spark?...easy to check when it dies!

Cheers, dave
