Subject: vw mechanic's rates

Hey.  I'm starting a little side business fixing cars on my college 
campus.  There's a lot of VWs here, and so far those are the only cars 
i've gotten calls about.  One guy has a '64 bus that he says needs a new 
carburetor. 
    I know a lot of people on the list do work for other people, and i 
was wondering what everyone charges for labor.  I have a degree in Auto 
Mechanics, and I've always fixed my own buses.  I just need a little 
help with rates. 

Anyone have any advice?
thanks.
