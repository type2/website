Richard,

We have some of these items in stock. They are not on the website yet, but
they will be added soon. The large connectors are definitely NLA.

The only caveat for using the OEM connectors is that you need special tools
to crimp them, and they are expensive.

Germansupply is also stockpiling used FI wiring harnesses and we will be
offering a harness rebuilding service sometime in the near future.
