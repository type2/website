Subject: Fw: Can someone measure their frnt. tire to fender for me,

Rob,
Do you have a manual on the procedure?
From memory the best way to check a bus, when EMPTY the front suspension
should be just touching the top bump stops (as in all the way up). You then
need to load ~200kg (check manual on actual weight) onto the front floor of
the cab to represent driver/passenger BEFORE checking for level.
