Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome plating...now I know!

If you guys only knew what the EPA makes the platers go through to meet
their standards--you'd understand why the price of plating is
astronomical--

They are just passing along the costs of clean discharge water along to
the consumer--

the only
two places within 
250 miles that I could find wanted upwards of $300 *each* to replate 
my bumpers. 
OUCH !!!! 
where do you live? Here in Riverside, CA there fortunately have some
chrome shops left, but for how long? 250,000 to get on a waiting list
and licensing etc, sounds insane.. 
OTOH, Im having my other two empi 5 spokes for my notch chromed for $100
each..(before its too late)) 
peace,
