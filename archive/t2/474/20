Subject: muffler reinstall

Hello everyone

My neighbor did me the kind favor of welding my muffler. While I had it 
apart I sanded it as well as the heater boxes. Then I painted it all with 
high temp paint. I ran out of paint, but am close to finishing.
Does anyone have any advice for reinstalling it. I really don't want an 
exhaust leak anymore. Any type of gasket sealer that can be used for this?

Also, the cables that control my heat have been unattached underneath the 
bus. I can't seem to figure out how they reattach. Anyone have a picture or 
a good description?

Thanks,

Kyle
