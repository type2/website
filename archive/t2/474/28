Subject: Re: [T2] 2 different heater boxes

Not sure if you have a question here or not?
If I remember right, you have a 79 Calif version bus? The Calif version is totally different than the 49 state
bus. Here is a pic of the Cal version:

Here is the Fed version: http://www.bus-boys.com/exhaustcomp1979-fed.htm

 My driver's side and passenger's side heater boxes look different. Most
 noticably, the drivers side has an oval hole on top thar a pipe connects to.
 this pipe runs up into the engine compartment. the other end is round and it
 connects to the little squirrell fan. The passenger side is reverse. It is
 round at the box at oval at the other end. Also, the one is secured in a
 couple more places than the other is.
 Thanks,
 Kyle
