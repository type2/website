Subject: Chrome plating...now I know!

Folks,

I tried to get my old chromed bumpers for my bus rechromed last year and 
was astounded by the wait and the cost...the only two places within 
250 miles that I could find wanted upwards of $300 *each* to replate
my bumpers.

Now I know why....taken from a web page on refurbishing wheels(expensive 
wheels)....Now we probably also know why most of the chrome stuff we
buy has to come from Mexico and Tiawan....


"Chromeplating: The basic premise of chromeplating wheels is that there is 
a triple plating process which ends with the last plating which is chrome. 
Chromium is the most toxic metal known to man. At the moment, in order to 
get a license to chromeplate in the United Stated, you need to give the 
EPA a $250,000 deposit and go on a wait list. Once your license is 
granted, your $250,000 deposit then goes to a filtration system. As of 
yet, you have no plant, no equipment, no employees. So, the next time 
someone mutters as to why chromeplating is so expensive, you'll be able to 
explain."
