Subject: Looking for left Rear engine tin and heatshield 82 Vanagon

Hi All:

I am looking for the left rear engine tin, usually hacked up by the AC
installation (VW part # 071-119-521) and a heat shield that goes above
the exhaust (VW 070-119-227A)  for an 82 Air-cooled Vanagon. The parts
can have surface rust, but no holes or major rust.

You can see images of these parts at

I am sort of in a hurry (engine arrives tomorrow and other tin supplier
fell through) so I would want to do paypal and get the parts next week.

TIA
Regards,
