I don't believe so.  The reading of the position of the gate takes place
above the gate; as the "door" moves a pointer moves with it along a
resistive track.  The gate moves freely in response to demands from the
engine for air, which it couldn't do if it was touching the base of the AFM.

Don't think so.  The AFM would send a signal that would result in a too-rich
mixture is the gate was open *wider* than it should be, given the demands of
the engine.  (Gate "more open" = signal to "send more gas.")  If the gate is
swinging freely back and forth with no "sticky" points along the way then it
should be OK.

I don't think it'll hurt it, but why not just use some paint thinner, some
rags and some Q-tips to clean things up.

As the AFM ages the spring inside the AFM that resists the turning of the
air flap weakens, leading to a too-rich condition in all situations.  The
engine can handle this on startup but can't once it's warmed up.  After
you've eliminated all other possibilities you might consider opening up the
AFM and adjusting the spring.
