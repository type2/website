Subject: Bus on a Bottle

Juts thought I would let anyone know that cared, I scored the Jones Bus on a
bottle today.  Clerks and store managers thought I was crazy.  It only took 3
stores and sifting through many many bottles.  I am on a mission now, to see
how many different flavors I can collect......

It appears the bus is from VA, the license plate is readable, I would assume
someone from the list or the Full Moon Bus Club would know the owner...
