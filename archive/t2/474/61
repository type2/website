did you remove engine and tranny together??  I usually just remove the
engine alone, fairly easy on an auto tranny bus.

it is one bear to adjust, not because it is hard but you have to be in
several places at once

in the .010 auto tranny (75-79) it is not that big a deal. but it does
help to get it adjusted right. 

follow the steps in the Bentley manual section 7 pg 44-45 job 13.2.  it is
very sensitive so you will probably have to really fiddle to get it right
on.
