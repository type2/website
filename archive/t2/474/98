Somethings I agree with Tim about. Odd :)

If you are doing it as a side business w/o insurance, you will have to 
decide what kind of work you want to do and what kind of risk you want to take.

I started a small networking company back in school.  On my 2nd job, a drill 
went awry and went through the wrong part of a wall.  Very stressful and 
could have led to me having to pay for the entire room to be repainted.

I think Tim's basic minimums are a little high for tools and investment for 
a side business. Someone looking to do oil changes, timing belts, whatever.
You'd really have to examine what your goals are and what kind of work you 
want to be doing.

I don't think I've ever needed much beyond the basic tool set I have, half 
of which came from Wal Mart.

If you go "legit" and file business tax returns and all that, figure that 
you should charge your customers 3X what you'd make per hour working for 
someone else.  If you just want some spending cash, your customers can buy 
their own parts.

Don't take personal checks. Don't take "I'll pay you tomorrow" for an 
answer, either.  You will get burned. It's just a matter of when.

I've had businesses string me along for months.  It's not cool.

People will tell you not to worry about the insurance thing.  That's your 
choice.  Just ask yourself what's the worst situation you honestly want to 
deal with.  My dad has owned a repair shop for over 20 years now.  You would 
be surprised how many oil changes lead to strange vibrations.  Heck, even 
having a car broken into while it was on your property could cause problems.
Your rental or homeowners insurance probably doesn't cover you once you are 
doing something "for hire".

Think and plan carefully before you jump in too deep.
