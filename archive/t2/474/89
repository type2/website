> Who painted the wheels white!

For as far as I know all 1971-1979 wheels were grey.
Except....and there we go back to this Champagne
Edition thing again ;-)....

The 1978 Champaign edition II in microbus edition had
Foxred wheels. And it looks like the Westfalia edition
had Atlaswhite L91Z wheels. Both not the stock wheels:

And if we really go far into detail then we can talk
about certain specifications for German companies and
authorities that had specially factory painted
wheels...but I won't bother you with that. ;-)
