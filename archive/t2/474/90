Almost sounds too good to be true...anyone in the UK know more?

"The Canvas is made to order from the original patterns at the Westfalia factory in Germany. They are identical to the original. Made by Seamstress at the Westfalia factory. Flyscreens are white and zips in the colour of the canvas (as the original).The canvas has the same feel and appearance as the original.

The Canvas comes in 4 colours:Grey, Yellow, Orange and Beige. Samples are available on request.

NOTE: As the Canvas is made to order in the Westfalia factory it must be made clear that the Westfalia Factory priority is the canvas for the consignments of New Vans that come through their doors. Therefore there may be a 4-6 week wait for the Original Canvas once the order is submitted by us. Westfalia also cannot guarantee it will have all colours of canvas all the time."
