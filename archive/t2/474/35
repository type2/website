Subject: Can someone measure their frnt. tire to fender for me, early

i have a '70 bus and i've put it on as level ground i
can find, and placed a carpenters level on her.. it
appears its a little off.

i was wondering, just curious actually as to what
someone elses measurement would be, running 14" tires.
i need the measurement from top of tire to bottom of
fender well.. 

if mine isnt too far off im going to just leave it
alone.. but it sure does bother me, and im almost
positive my rear isnt sagging..

thanx,
