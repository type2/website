Great! That's the kind of information I am looking
for! The VW-'literature' is not really clear on this
subject. Untill recently I didn't even know that these
buses were called 'Champagne Edition'. From the
M-codes list I know that there were two 'special sales
campaigns'. I also know that these cars have a special
colour.

Over here in the Netherlands there never was such a
thing as a 'special salescampaign' for the T2. And
with very few US-specs-T2's driving around in Europe
you might never see one of these special models on a
meeting.

Thanks to all of you that have responded so far!



yours,


Vincent
