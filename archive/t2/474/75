Subject: Higher temperatures during engine break in?

A slightly different twist on the currently running thread on engine break in.
I am just breaking in my stock '71 type 2 after a total rebuild. I have only
run it less than 50 miles but it seems that the oil temp is higher than
before. I have a dipstick oil temp guage which has been installed for quite a
long time so I am familiar with how the temp acted previously. Yesterday while
I was making my first break in run, the air temp was in the upper 70's and I
was using the method in the Tom Wilson book of accelerating at 3/4 throttle
through the gears to 55 and decelerating again. I did this for 25 miles.
Before the rebuild I would not have expected to see a temp of more than
200-210 degrees under these circumstances. Yesterday it was up to 230 or so
after 25 miles. I was using Pennzoil 30 weight oil during the break in. Does
anyone have any information as to whether this amount of temp increase is
normal for a new engine? If so, how long should it take to return to more
'normal' levels?

Sincere thanks,
Bill Moon
