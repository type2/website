Subject: AMP FI Connectors

I recently located another vendor for the Bosch FI connectors made by AMP.
Previously Bus Boys was the only place I knew of but here's another one:

These guys even sell the male connector and boots.

The really large connector for the ECU and the smaller one for the AFM are
still at large.
