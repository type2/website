Phil,

Check the archives also, but....

Main thing is to vary the engine speed and not let it idle a lot.

What is happening is that the rings are seating.  This means that they
are "scrubbing"(honing)  the walls of the cylinders in order to provide a 
more "perfect" seal.

I can't imagine anything else in an engine that gets better as it
rubs together....think about it....valves and valve seats might benefit a 
little, but if they have been put together properly, they should already
seal very well....everything else is just rubbing(with oil we hope)....

My opinion is to "set" the rings by accelerating normally up to about
35-40 then be in 4th gear and floor it until about 65.  I usually do this
several times, and if I can find a gentle hill to do it on, it is even 
better.   YMMV

I might treat it pretty gently till about 250-500 miles and then
rock and roll!  You "might" notice both smoother and more power...at least 
I always "thought" I did!

Cheers, dave
