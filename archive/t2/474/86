Subject: BA6 and stock heater

I have a 78 westy, I was wanting to get the stock heater working. Is the
BA6 in the way? or can the stock work without the BA6?
Do I have to remove the BA6? I never have taken off the belly pan
before. The BA6 has never ran since I have owned it and the PO did not
know it existed on the ride. So  I can see on the drivers side some
wires that are wrapped in electical tape. So I do not know where to
start. 
 
Can the stock heater work with the BA6, or is it inline and blocking the
stock?
 
Thanks
