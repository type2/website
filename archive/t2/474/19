The heat shield looks like something a sheet metal shop (custom ducting
for HVAC systems) could knock out for you. You might even be able to
DIY, if you have the pattern...I'd guess the original probably used asbes-
tos, but the plumbing supply house carries fire-proof mats for sweating
copper in tight spots that you could sandwich between the sheet metal...
