Drew,

Some of the folks on the megasquirt list were talking about this also
and concluded that an oil pressure switch would work ok.

You might want to consider the plumbing of such a switch first and the 
turn on pressure.  Some of the hot rod houses sell oil pressure switches 
that have a higher turn on value than the vw ones(like 15psi).


I would think that just an led that would indicate that the fuel pump
is getting both ground and power might be a lot safer.  Radio shack has
such a thing with a nice bezel and fairly long wires with the resistor 
built iin.

Cheers, dave
