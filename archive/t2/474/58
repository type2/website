Subject: RE: [T2] Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

They were these "special edition" buses and bugs (I think) that they put out
in the late 70s. My father has a 77 Champagne edition bus, mint condition,
but needs a new paint job due to fading. I cannot tell a single difference
with the bus, save chrome bumpers, a different paint palate, and this little
VW Champagne Edition sticker between the windshield wipers. Other than that,
it's pretty much stock. Maybe kind of like the "special edition" cars we see
on the road today... not really all that special!
