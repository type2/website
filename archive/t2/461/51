Subject: RE: [T2] Carb Replacement

  On the few engines I have built and used these carbs on, I have used the
"o these piece o sh#t 009 dizzy" with-out a problem, great throttle response
and gas mileage, good torque and hp. I did step up and put the bigger
venturis and a larger air correction jet, mains and idles to get them smooth
and so far have been very pleased. 
  I am going to dyno one with a vaccum dizzy verses the 009 just to see what
the actual difference might be.

ronnieps. Just make sure that you order the bigger venturis and air
correction jet when ordering the carbs

This is the same road that I think I will follow, but I have questions. I
believe that it is recommended that you use a 009 distributor with these
carbs. It says this on the CBperformance website. I have heard from one list
member, that has this setup, and says that the 009 works great with these
new style "stock" carbs. 

What does the list think about this? I have heard so many bad stories about
this distributor, but all I see for sale is this distributor? Do they not
produce enough vacuum to use the old distributor? If they do not, then am I
going to be happy with the 009?

Thanks,
Corbett
