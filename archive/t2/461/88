Subject: Vanagon engine conversions

FYI

For all those with Vanagon's living in CA interested in swapping engines, I just received an email from Peter Broemmelsiek at Tiico:

"We now have approval for California and are taking orders for the engine conversion.  Delivery will be about 6 weeks for now as initial demand is very high. Please  contact me if you have a more urgent need and it may be possible to sort  something out sooner. Thank you for you interest."
