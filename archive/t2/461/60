Hey,
Is there a chance that the guy subscribes to the Samba, and is now aware of
your plans to bust his scam?

Just a thought . . .

Hey Y'all,
Tell me if this is a bad idea.  I have intentions to
try to bust at least one of these classifieds scammer
guys.
I'm selling a bug on TheSamba and the guy sends me the
typical email: I live in France, a guy in the states
owes me money and he will pick up the car, I want to
send you a cashiers check for more than the amount and
have you send me the rest...
Of course I know about this scam, so far i have played
along and agreed to his terms. So for you legal types
(Ted Finesman!), If I keep the "check" he sends me,
and all the correspondence along with the address he
wants the money sent to, do you think there is any way
that the authorities can track down and bust this guy?
Or am I wasting my time?  Do they (legal authorities)
even care about this kind of stuff??
I am not a fan of the police, and it feels kinda
strange that I am thinking about working with them to
bust someone, but it pisses me off that someone is
trying prey on the VW community, and if it saves
anyone from getting screwed by this person, it's
probably worthwhile.
Thoughts??
