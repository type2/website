ETKA is a computer program used by the VW-dealer to
look up parts and partnumbers. There is also some
additional info in it on enginenumbers, transmissions,
paintcolours and M-codes. It is a replacement for the
old microfiche system.

As far as I can see it the ETKA contains all VW-models
that were in in production around 1970, and of course
all the later models. The split window bus is not in
there for example. But the VW 147 is (also known as
'Fridolin', produced until 1973).

Normally you can't copy this program but some cracked
versions are circulating.

ETKA is a German abreviation. I think it stands for
either:

    "ErsatzTeile KAtalog"
    (replacementparts catalog)

or

    "Elektronische Teile KAtalog"
    (electronic parts catalog)
(excuse me if I made some small spellings errors
there)

The producers of the programm even have an internet
site:
