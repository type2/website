Subject: Front side marker housing & seals

Greetings List,

In my quest to have a nice bus I have new front side marker lenses but I 
can't seem to find the housing/backing plate or whatever you want to call 
it, anywhere.  This is akin to the rear side marker housing/bulb holder but, 
of course, without a bulb socket.  I'm pretty sure they are even the same 
size as the rear, so even if I could just get 2 new seals I could reuse the 
old plastic part. It dosen't seem right to just screw it to the door without 
somthing between it and the body.  I can't see spending $40 on rear side 
marker bulb holders just to steal the seals. That'd be pretty dumb.

Also, anyone know where to get a new rear hatch handle seal? The one that is 
about the size of a half dollar that goes between the door and the thumb 
handle. (not to be confused with the engine door)

This is for a '78 Westfalia

Many thanks,
Brandt
