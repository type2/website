I have seen a Highroof that is "unpainted" fiberglass, remains virgin on
the inside, but painted on the outside,,

Fiberglass gets its colour from the  "gel coat" , which is the first thing
put in the mold. Afaik, it can be any colour
All the Westfalia tops I have seen are gel coated,, but the question
remains,, what colour?

some Westfalia pop tops are weathered right thru the gel coat, and the
hair of the fiberglass sticks out

I painted mine, about 10 years ago,, and it still looks great, it was
weathered badly.
