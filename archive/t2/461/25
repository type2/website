Subject: questions about SIMA Inverter...

Hi, I am at wit's end here. I bought a used (with no manual) SIMA  
SPV-3 300 Watt Power Inverter. It plugs into the lighter socket and 
does its job. It has an on/off switch. When I turn it on, the little 
fan spins, and the lights go on, and the thing makes this alarm whistle 
sound. I suspect it is a dead battery, as the 2 lights indicate power 
and battery. If I unplug the unit from the lighter, the alarm continues 
for about 2 seconds then dies off slowly.

Here's my question: anyone know if there is a replaceable battery in 
there, what kind it is, etc.?

or is this a dead/old battery problem?

Is this some other problem?

Thanks in advance!

p.s. if you have a  manual you want to send me, please do!
