That's a nice price I must say! Over here at the
dealer they cost EUR 17,18 excluding 19% tax.

One thing is a bit weird though. The partnr on the
screen is:

   311 601 151 D

That's the number for the original hubcab. But the
title of the webpage is "Hubcap 251601151A"...and that
is the partnr for the Vanagon and 1980ties Beetles
hubcab. They fit to the older types and are also a
good quality but the rim is a bit thicker (it is justa
matter on how far you want to go on keeping your car
in original shape). So I wonder which part they are
selling here.

By the way: the price I mentioned is for the
Vanagon-hubcab. The original T2 hubcab doesn't even
appear on the 1983 fiche that I have! --> NLA for a
long time already!
