I got my '80 because it was losing power....couldn't get it into
second even.  

I found one of the wires on the resistor at the end of the wire
harness was broken....the computer wasn't terminated properly so it
wasn't getting the right info.

More recently, I'm experiencing difficulty getting it to
idle...running too lean and find that the "S" hose between my AFM and
the throttle body has enough of a crack to seriously leak vacuum and
throw off the AFM.

I'd look for loose connections, broken wires and vacuum leaks.
