Subject: Cheap Interior/Door Panels

If you need new door or interior panels, but don't have the budget for
the TMI panels, I'm happy to announce that I now have a much cheaper
option, courtesy of Just Kampers in England. 

These pre-cut MDF interior and door panels are similar to the TMI
panels, but not covered in vinyl. You can cover them in the vinyl or
fabric of your choice, or simply paint them. The price is much cheaper
than finished panels. For example, a sliding door panel is only $29, a
rear hatch panel just $19, and front door panels just $45 for the pair.
You could do your whole bus for under $200!

They're now in stock, and listed on the following page (mixed in with a
few other items; scroll down to the bottom 1/2 of the page).
