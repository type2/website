Subject: Pooting and poping on decel and downshift

Hi listees,
When decelerating and down shifting, I am getting the rapid popping sound from the rear. From my experience with this list, I know that the most common cause is an exhaust leak. My question is: If I had an exhaust leak that was too small to be noisy or heard, could it still cause this problem? Also, what are the other common causes?
Thanks in advance for the help.
