Subject: Re: [T2] Polishing Aluminum

Chris,

I tried various things on my fan housing(t4) and just could not
come up with anything  that worked for me....so I sent it to the powder
coaters.  

The black is what happens to aluminum when you try to polish it with 
rouge.  

I tried wire brushes, nylock brushes, all kinds of polishes, buffing wheel
with "chrome" rouge sort of worked, but was gonna take about 5.2 years to 
finish.  Lots of black on my polish wheel also....some sort of bead 
blasting might work, but sand blasting just made it clean and "rougher".

Skip the heartache....unless you have 5.2 years instead of about $75.00.
You've seen my engine pictures....

Cheers, dave
