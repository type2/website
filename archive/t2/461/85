Subject: gas heater 79

I am trying to figure out how to get the gas  heater working on a 1979 
camper, there is a switch on the dash with temp on it + or - and it pushes in and 
comes out if you let go. should we hold this or something to get it to run, 
should we hear the fuel pump run, does the bus have to be running , thanks for any 
help. the heater is mounted under the bus.
