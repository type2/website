Subject: Air Vent Covers?

A guy here makes scoops from fibre glass to aid air flow (there's varying
theories to say if they work or not) and will help keep water out when your
standing still as well.
I can get some if they look useful.
Here's a couple of pics (sorry their not the best)

And here's a better pic, not quite the same thing but gives the idea.
