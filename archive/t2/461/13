Not in North America perhaps. You Americans are so
spoiled with all the luxury you had on your T2's...

back-up lamps, padded dashboard, rear window
defroster, type 4 engine, ventilation windows,...

;-)

Back here in Europe we were choking in the back of our
1600cc 9 seater kombi's with no form of ventilation at
all!!!

My 1978 kombi was delivered like that:

- 9 seats (VW Type 231211)
- no ventilation windows in the back (only in cabin
doors (M507)
- and no fresh air ducting on the cabin doors to guide
air to the passenger compartmet

And all the windows in the back were solid pieces of
glass. Of course I am collecting M-codes for my car so
I upgraded it a little bit since I bought it in 1996.
