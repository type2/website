Subject: Popping out of 4th

   I just had an interesting converstion with Rancho on why trannies pop out
of 4th gear. There are a number of factors that cause this, but the number
one cause is the person driving the bus!
   The reason is that they rest there hand on the shifter while in 4th. This
causes friction on the 4th gear slider and shift fork causing excessive
friction and heat which prematurley where's the sliders out. 
   When people do the bungee cord thing or hold them in 4th this is even
causing more wear which takes even more life out of the trans. 
   The main cause of the popping out of 4th is that the main shaft bearing
is starting to wear causing the slidiers to work in a cocked position, which
eventually rounds out the slider causing them to start to pop out of gear.

I am sure there is more then this, but at least it's a start
