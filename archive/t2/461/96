When I turn it on, the little fan spins, and the lights go on, and the thing makes this alarm whistle sound. I suspect it is a dead battery, as the 2 lights indicate power and battery. If I unplug the unit from the lighter, the alarm continues for about 2 seconds then dies off slowly.

The battery in question is your starting battery - there is no battery in the inverter.

If it whistles when you turn it on, for a second or two and then goes off, this is probably normal.  Mine does it.
