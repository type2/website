It is either the contact in the turn signal lever or the high beam relay.
Do you hear any clicking at all when pulling the turn signal up?  If you
do, the relay is probably bad.  It is in the bottom of the fuse block,
which has to be unclipped to replace it.  The relays tend to fill up with
water from windshield seal leaks since they are mounted upside down.  I
always drill a small hole in the cover of the new relay to allow moisture
to drain out.
