So, my leak-down test results came in today.  My engine, in fact, did 
not fare well:

#1 - 30% at intake valve
#2 - 40% at rings
#3 - 40% at rings
#4 - 40% at rings

So, I'm going to bite the bullet and just get a new engine:

	- Why spend the $$ fixing the oil leaks in this one when
	  it still has all the underlying problems.

	- New engine is not that much more than a top-end rebuild,
	  so might as well go all the way (and get the warranty on
	  top of it all).

Buslab (who is doing the work for me) uses JCS (apparently just north 
of LA); they swear by 'em.  Anyone have pointers to JCS on the web so I 
can read up about them?

In any case, by mid next week, my engine troubles should be a thing of 
the past (lemme give the wooden desk 3 knocks, just to be safe :-)
