I saw this same bus at the Rainbow Festival a few years ago, way up a dirt 
road, in
the SW Montana mountains.  It doesn't just look good from twenty feet, either.
The guy that built it was a master carpenter.  It was for sale at the time, 
but the
thing was just too beautiful to drive.  Maybe too top-heavy to drive, too.

I sure wish whoever owns it will post some interior pics somewhere we can 
find them.
