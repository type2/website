I'm bummed.... Missed CYW because of a secondary venturi being sucked into
my engine. Am going to miss Kelly's as well. I guess I'll have to eat the
cherries myself. If anyone wants to stop by my shop and pick up a couple of
jars for Kelly's, please call me at 1-877-517-4811 during the day. Do it
quick before they are all gone :)... Ted
