Subject: What does ETKA mean ?

Folks,
    I've seen an awful lot of you referring to ETKA.  Can someone
please explain to me what it is.  I've got the Bentley manual, the
Haynes manual and the Idiiot's manual, don't tell me there's another
manual for me to put in the collection.  Well, actually do tell me.
