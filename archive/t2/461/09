Subject: Re: [T2] Window molding insert

It is standard but usually when one replaces the rubber they go with the
stuff that doesn't use the moulding in the rubber as it is much easier and
cheaper to go without.

Could some kind soul clarify this for me.

The plastic molding that is inserted into the outside of the window seal.
Is that standard on all U.S. spec Station Wagon buses?
All my windows have this trim.
