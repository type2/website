Subject: Re: [T2] intermittent loss of power

78 auto tranny pretty much stock

last couple days has had a loss of power momentarily usually while
accelerating, sort of like when fuel filter is clogged, changed filter no
effect.
  intermittent problems are the hardest too find I know BTDT,  while
sitting at idle  with head stuck in engine compartment I cannot get it to
duplicate.
  
  any ideas, will check out connectors tommorrow to make sure none are
loose.
