 There were no solid glass middle windows.
If you're talking about the back windows, they are a completely different shape, so no go there.

Sorry Billy, I have seen more than a handful of USA buses with solid middle side glass. Part # 221 845 301A [I

the vent windows..... shipping may be prohibitive however.
