Subject: Weber Progressive Kit

Hi,

I know a lot of people don't like the Weber progressive on a Type 4
bus, so I was hoping that someone out there would be willing to sell
me one for a song!

I usually have gotten them at Bugorama for $20 on the manifold set and
$20 for a carb, but being nowhere near a VW event, I was hoping
someone on the list could help me.

Thanks,

John
