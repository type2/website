Overhaulin - a Discovery Channel program on cable. Centers on
Chip Foose, of Foose Design, a California based street rod,
automotive customizer and rebuild specialist of epic skill; and
teams of specialists and fabricators picked by Foose. Someone's
ride gets nominated, and if chosen ... that ride, generally a
project car that's never seen enough $$$ to get the project
going .... is stolen and in seven days totally re-fabricated
into a jewel of Show/Go ride.
