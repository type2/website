Update on Engine won't turn

Finally got back to it tonight... The Flywheel is definitely grinding on the front (F is F) of the tranny bell housing. The Flywheel diameter is correct but either the Flywheel is too thick or the previous owner shimmed it so it sits away from the engine more (this came out of a Porsche, btw.) There is maybe 1/8th of an inch space between engine and tranny as things start to lock up when tightening the bolts. So anyway, it's grinding into the two raised areas at the inside bottom of the tranny. 

Someone mentioned grinding out the bell housing, which seems to be a feasable option. But now I'm questioning how this may affect the Clutch engaging/disengaging. If the clutch is going to be closer to the Transmission, is it going to be pressing on the Ring Bearing? (is that the name for that?) And what kinda issue is that going to cause? Clutch slippage, etc?

Thanks as always,
