Greg,

I had the same problem when I did my cab doors: the holes are just too small for the after-market rubber boots and door panel clips.

If you use the original rubber boot (361 867 425) the clips go in snugly and fit perfectly. Unfortunately they are hard to come by in USA.

VW in Germany indicates that they as available but they have to be special ordered from someone who can purchase directly from VW.

Ron (-at-) BusDepot problem can probably do this for you but I'm not sure what min quantities will apply. IIRC you need 21 per door.
