Subject: Re: [T2] New engine won't turn

I am still wondering..  I don't have a 215 flywheel to look at,, but I am
thinking you have a 228mm flywheel..
can you take a look at the ring gear.
the 228mm ring gear is distinctivly different place than the 210 and 215
the ring gear sits flush with the outer dia of the fly wheel on the 228..
and the teeth of the 210/215 are the outer most dia of the flywheel.

I can't seem to find a picture of the 228mm
