Subject: Re: New engine won't turn

Hey John,

Yeah, this all makes sense on paper. 

The original engine was a 1700 and I recall measuring the Plate and the inner Flywheel at 210.
The Clutch Plate was factory stamped
"Fichtel & Sachs AG
Schweinfurt
Typ M 210
made in Germany
(49) 3082-026-331"

and the Disc stamped
"Sachs - made in Germany
1861 441 234"

I didn't write down the numbers for the New (used) Plate, but I remember measuring it at 215 and Interstate VW said it was a 215 and I had no reason to think otherwise. And it fit the new Flywheel perfectly.
The New (new) Meyle Clutch Disc, again I didn't write down the numbers, but the box says
Ref. 1861 544 035
Art. No. 117 215 2401
and it seems to go together with the Plate and Fly just fine. Which all leads me to think the Fly is a 215mm.

But I notice none of the numbers match the numbers you referenced. Soooo....

The new engine is an Ebay purchase; a father/son project; said it was in a Porsche. It seems well put together but does have a couple of quirks (don't they all?) and this Flywheel may be just that. They said it was a 1.7; maybe it's actually a 1.8 or a 1.7 with a 215 Porsche Fly or something.

Ah well,
Thanks again!

The numbers are actually referring to the diameter of the clutch disc.
Here's the data from Bus Boys:

D.  211-141-031G Disc Plate, 210mm 1700 72-73

D.  025-141-031H Disc Plate, 215mm 1800 Bus 74-75 Vanagon 1900 Early
1983 (To VIN 25-D-002308)

D.  025-141-031D Disc Plate, 228mm 2000 76-83 Vanagon 1900/2100 Late
83-Early 89 (VIN 25-D-002309 To 25-K-097046)

So you see the 228 clutch fits 2 liter motors, the 215 clutch is for
1800 motors, and the 210 clutch is for 1700 motors.

So basically you would measure the clutch contact area inside the
flywheel. If you did not actually measure the clutch disc before you
installed it, you may have been sold a 228 clutch, or you may have
installed a clutch that is too small for your flywheel, if that's
possible.

I'm no use for physical description of the flywheels. Don't remember!
