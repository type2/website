I see no reason to shun the 34 PICT.  Yes, it it trickier than the  
previous Solex carburetors, and some of the aftermarket repros aren't so  good.
 
This site has some great info on VW's and their advice on the 34 PICT is  
right on the money.  I have followed many of their suggestions and they  work.

I am running this carb on my 71 Westy, and also on my 71 standard  beetle.  
Both have stock distributors with working dual advance vacuum cans  - an 
important prerequisite for the 34 PICT to function as it was  intended.
