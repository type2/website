Hi Paul,

The numbers are actually referring to the diameter of the clutch disc.
Here's the data from Bus Boys:

D.  211-141-031G Disc Plate, 210mm 1700 72-73

D.  025-141-031H Disc Plate, 215mm 1800 Bus 74-75 Vanagon 1900 Early
1983 (To VIN 25-D-002308)

D.  025-141-031D Disc Plate, 228mm 2000 76-83 Vanagon 1900/2100 Late
83-Early 89 (VIN 25-D-002309 To 25-K-097046)

So you see the 228 clutch fits 2 liter motors, the 215 clutch is for
1800 motors, and the 210 clutch is for 1700 motors.

So basically you would measure the clutch contact area inside the
flywheel. If you did not actually measure the clutch disc before you
installed it, you may have been sold a 228 clutch, or you may have
installed a clutch that is too small for your flywheel, if that's
possible.

I'm no use for physical description of the flywheels. Don't remember!

 Whether
 I have a 215 or a 228 - I think I understand Jamie's description to say
 that the Teeth (if you will) of a 215 are raised above (outside) the
 rest of the Flywheel whereas the Teeth of the 228 are flush. But
honestly, the description
 kinda confused me. Looking at the pics (as I can't get to the actual
 engines atm) the Teeth on both are raised, neither are flush (I can't
 see anything I would consider flush with); suggesting that I have a 210
 and a 215. But it does look like the 215? is simply thicker (front to
 back) than the 210; the Teeth in particular look thicker. As I recall,
 I checked diameters but didn't think about the thickness when replacing
 the clutch. Would a 215 Clutch and Disc fit a 228 Fly? Cause that's
 what I bought and installed and the reason I figured this was a 215.
 What do you actually measure to find out if it's 210, 215 or 228?
