always best to try to find the stock distributor for you van. search
the junk yards, search the sources on this and other lists. but try
your best to find the stock dist for your bus.

the SVDA is a distant second choice.

I had a Pertronix and it worked reasonably well, but when I fried it I
got a Crane and once dialed in it works dern well. and I think was
worth the cost and then some.

two things I always hated, points and valves,  got hyd lifters and
crane ignition worth it as far as I'm concerned.
