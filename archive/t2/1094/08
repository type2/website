Hmmmmmm,,,   4 bolt type.......    I don't know of a flywheel for a Type 1
with 4 bolts,, they use a gland nut with the pilot bearing

and the Type IV  use 5 bolts.. pilot bearing is in the crank...

also,, do you want a 180mm clutch,, or a 200mm clutch.   6v ring gear,,   O
ring ..  Type 1 flywheel
