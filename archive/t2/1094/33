This may be the key. I've had two Porsche pulls before. I don't
remember the issues exactly, but I remember being told the Porsche
flywheel can't be used. That may be your issue.

Is your motor a Porsche? i.e., with no bus-style oil filler? Well, it
wouldn't matter anyway, because if the motor was in a Porsche, it
would have the Porsche flywheel anyway.

 Yeah, this all makes sense on paper.

 The new engine is an Ebay purchase; a father/son project; said it was
in a Porsche. It seems well put together but does have a couple of
quirks (don't they all?) and this Flywheel may be just that. They said
it was a 1.7; maybe it's actually a 1.8 or a 1.7 with a 215 Porsche
Fly or something.
