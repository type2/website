The Flywheel diameter is correct but either the Flywheel is too thick or the previous owner shimmed it so it sits away from the engine more (this came out of a Porsche, btw.) There is maybe 1/8th of an inch space between engine and tranny as things start to lock up when tightening the bolts. So anyway, it's grinding into the two raised areas at the inside bottom of the tranny.

what about the starter, how will this fit or will it fit???
