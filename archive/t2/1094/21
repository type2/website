Wikipedia was adequate. It also has a good pic of the engine. That
sure does look like our bus engines! Interesting Porsche consolidated
and got one fan pulley by combining the generator and fan into one,
but look how much bigger the fan is on Tatra by having them separate.
I wonder how much cooler our bus engines would run with that bigger
fan.

So Hitler said he would settle the matter! I'm sure Tatra would have
settled for less before the war. 3,000,000 DM is a lot of money. But I
see Porsche wasn't trying to hide anything and freely admitted the
design influence. As they say, imitation is the best form of flattery.
Reading the Battle for the Beetle, it goes into a lot more than just
the Beetle's development, but rather surveys the entire automotive
development history of the time to show the evolution of thinking and
design influences from car to car. You can see that influences and
copying was quite common in those formative years.
