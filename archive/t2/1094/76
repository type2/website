Subject: Re: [T2] Perfect "3rd" gauge for the Bus...

My favorite third gauge is actually a trio, installed under the radio.  
I sourced a oil pressure, oil temp and voltmeter from a GTI/Cabriolet  
console cluster; added a couple of senders and "Bob's your Uncle", as  
my grandpa used to say.

I also have a CHT gauge which is installed in the clock space; my next  
gauge addition I would like to make is to add a bar graph LED  
tachometer running a semi circle in the 1/2" space between the CHT and  
the edge of the clock pod. I just have to decide if I should use the  
tach for a signal or use an optical trigger mounted on the cooling fan.
