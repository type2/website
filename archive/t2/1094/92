You're right, it is the bypass screw (the big screw) that sets idle speed, not
the volume screw (little screw).

The volume screw adjusts idle mixture, pretty sure.  You do have have to
adjust that when you tear down and rebuild the carb - there is a simple
procedure in Bently and also the rebuild kit instructions.  Better if you have
a CO analyser (I don't).

Anyway, the worst problem I've had with DVDA distributors has been when the
OEM vacuum can fails.  There are two diaphragma inside, one for advance and
one for retard.  On both of my 71's (one is a Westy, the other is a standard
beetle), the retard diaphagm developed a substantial leak, which results in a
significant pathway for vacuum loss directly into the manifold (the retard
vacuum line port the carb is located below the throttle plate and is
essentially manifold vacuum).  Got new DVDA vacuum cans from Aircooled.net and
solved the problem.

Having gone through that issue, I learned that if you try to set timing to
spec (i.e., 5 ATDC) on a DVDA without the retard operating, your overall
timing will be retarded by about 12.5 dgrees from where it should be, and of
course engine performance will be lousy.   Once I figured out I had a bad
vacuum can and how it affected timing, I first plugged the retard vacuum port
on the carb and set idle timing at 7.5 deg BTDC.  That is when I got the high
idle speed problem, and no way could I fix it properly by adjusting the "big"
screw.  On one carb, even with the bypass screw all the way in, the idle would
not slow down below about 1800 RPM - probably the seat in the carb body was
damaged from some PO trying to fix it and they turned the screw in too tight.
The other one would slow down to the correct idle speed, but hesitation off
idle was just awful.

Both of these are vehicles are 34 PICT-3 carbs.

Perhaps the carbs used on Euopean vehicles are different so they are
compatible with SVDA?  I have to believe they are.

SVDA distributors were used on Dual Carb Setups in Europe because they didn't
have to conform to US specs.  The DVDA is a US emissions thing.  I've run
several SVDA with the stock dual 34PDSIT as well as the 34PICT and the
H30/31PICT (I am doing so on three different vehicles for the past several
years my best bud now drives - H30/31PICT in a 68 Bug, 34PICT-3 on a 92
Mexi-Beetle [fresh 1600 DP a few months back] and a 71 European 411 Sedan 1700
w/Manual Trans).  These carbs are designed to work with either the DVDA or the
SVDA dependent on the market they are used on, so any additional open vacuum
ports VW/Solex usually plugs off and the engine is always timed by the
distributor, not the engine regardless how it's built close to it's stock
configuration.

The volume control screw is set initially on the bench at the factory to
provide the specified amount of fuel flow into the idling circuit and is not
dependent on the distributor installed.  A certain amount of gasoline through
this circuit and a certain amount of air through the venturi and throttle is
needed for a good idle.  Your actual idle is set by the larger Air Bypass
Screw.  Bentley has the details and they're spot on when setting the Left Carb
with either a SVDA or DVDA even though they mention nothing about it, because
it's the same.

When I set up the SVDA on my friend's 411, I initially set it at about 0 TDC,
fired her up, let it get to operating temperature, chokes off and then
carefully set the timing to 7.5 BTDC.  411's also have a neat maximum advance
mark their pulleys that I also checked against and it was spot on.  Once the
timing was set, I readjusted the idle, then re-checked the timing and I
believe I had to do a slight adjustment to compensate.  This one's a road
burner since then.

DVDA's make great desk paperweights.

Somebody correct me if I'm out to lunch on this, but if I'm right about it,
 a carb setup that was designed to run with a DVDA type distributor
probably will  not work right with a SVDA type distributor.  This would
include the
1971  34PICT, and the dual Solexes used on 1972 to whenever FI  started.
Those carbs are designed with an air bypass circuit that will  cause a high
idle speed condition unless the timing at idle is retarded (as  designed) by
5
deg ATDC as is the case with the DVDA.  If you use an SVDA,  your idle 7.5
deg BTDC timing is too far advanced, the idle speed is high, and  you will
want to fix it by closing the idle volume screw on the carb.  This  incorrect
adjustment may get the idle speed down to a reasonable point, but the  air
velocity through the carb bypass circuit is now way too low, and your
transition off of idle to accelerating will be very  poor.
