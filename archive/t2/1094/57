Hi,

The Type 4 case is aluminum, and the change was considered an
improvement over the Type 1 case. For example, Type 4 cases virtually
never need to be align-bored or overhauled on a rebuild. That having
been said, I thought an aluminum case would be the right way to go for
an ideal Type 1 motor, but when I looked into it a few years ago, I
was told that there are fit issues and a good builder would never use
one, and those who have tried it have had nothing but trouble. Maybe
that situation has changed today, but someone who is familiar with the
situation would have to speak up...

 Is there a general thought on the aluminum cases? I remember reading a couple
 of years ago when these hardened aluminum cases became available that there
 were some mixed reviews? I am putting together my shopping list and debating
 an old original core vs. a new aluminum case. I shooting for stock
 performance, nothing fancy. Just building a new engine for a frien who is new
 the the VW world and wants her engine to be as reliable as possible
