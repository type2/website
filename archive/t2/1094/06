Subject: flywheel ... 

So . I got a good used engine from German Supply .. great price .. appears
to run very well . looks like it's from a 71 bus .. I want to use it with my
1960 tranny .. so .. I be needing a 6 volt flywheel - o ring type - 4 bolt
type .. I think it measures 273 mm across . (my mechanic's apprentice gave
me that number so I'm not sure what he measured .. ) .. anyone have any
leads?
