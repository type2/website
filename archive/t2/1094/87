Subject: Re: Trouble Timing a 1973 Dual Carb Setup w/ SVDA 

Somebody correct me if I'm out to lunch on this, but if I'm right about it, 
 a carb setup that was designed to run with a DVDA type distributor 
probably will  not work right with a SVDA type distributor.  This would include the 
1971  34PICT, and the dual Solexes used on 1972 to whenever FI  started. 
Those carbs are designed with an air bypass circuit that will  cause a high 
idle speed condition unless the timing at idle is retarded (as  designed) by 5 
deg ATDC as is the case with the DVDA.  If you use an SVDA,  your idle 7.5 
deg BTDC timing is too far advanced, the idle speed is high, and  you will 
want to fix it by closing the idle volume screw on the carb.  This  incorrect 
adjustment may get the idle speed down to a reasonable point, but the  air 
velocity through the carb bypass circuit is now way too low, and your  
transition off of idle to accelerating will be very  poor.
