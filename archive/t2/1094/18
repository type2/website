Subject: Re: Yahoo! News Story - Van stolen 35 years ago in Wash.

Yes you can.  Here in the states they have what is called a "mechanic's lein"
which gives the shop fudicuery intrest in the vehicle - if it's been stored
for any length of time, or THEY WORKED ON IT in good faith, they can claim
such a lein.  Considering the quality of the work, I would assume they could
at least hold US $15K Worth of that van.  

The resto shop took the vehicle in
good faith the owner was the owner.  They have no obligation to run a VIN or
any such nonsense.  

I'm not sure if you're in Ontario, Canada, or Ontario,
California, but in California it is really, truly the law.  I've mechanics
liened motorcycles before for lack of payment - regardless of the owner you
hold rights if you performed a service on the vehicle - Upholstery, paint,
storage, etc...  Yeah, they are owed a LOT for their work.  Prolly more than
the van is *really* worth.  (Even tho it IS a nice van!)

NOW - having been a
hot vehicle, it HAD other issues, BUT (this IS important) that claim was
settled, the police file was closed which means  Allstate was declared (by a
court somewhere) to be the legal owner of said van.  It's no longer a hot van,
but Allstate's property.

So yeah - the shop could Lein against Allstate as
the de-facto Owner and get at least their money out ofit.  If he had the van
for a while and put a chunk of $$ into it, Allstate could likely settle by
signing the leined vehicle to the shop rather than spend $100K fighting for a
$27K vehicle.

IF...  I can get through this a $8000 bike for an owner doing a
default for a $345 valve and head gasket job (and having every chance to
rescue his bike)...  The shop can get their due from this sad story of a
*very* kewl van!

Allstate is no fool. They are getting it appraised. Note the shop that
was
selling it was listed as a victim. They should bill Allstate for
the
restoration charges since they claim ownership, or put a mechanics
lien on
it...

too bad you can't do
that on vehicles.... or horses...
if that was allowed.. you could steal a
vehicle, fix it up.. then back
charge the owner!

the restoration shop should
have run the VIN before they bought it.

I am not sure how it works.. but here
in Ontario CA.. there is a process in
place
if they are a registered used car
dealer,, etc etc.. and they can use a few
avenues to
get money back..
