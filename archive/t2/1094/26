	That was also the first reaction of a Weber specialist I've 
found.  He says their needle valves can't shut off fully any pressure 
above 3 psi.  The fuel pump was rebuilt since the camper was on the 
road, so now I have to challenge the 'devilish thorough' German 
mechanic to give me his measurement.
