The clips and boots for the 68-79 Buses are smaller than what's used on the
Type 1 applications because the Bus utilizes a smaller hole size:

N0143781  Clip
361-867-425  Rubber Boot

The clip has been out of production for over a decade, but I have it on good
info that it may be available as a repro sometime in 2010.  The boot is
available, but like Richard Atwell said, VERY hard to find in North America.

I happen to have 100 boots on hand fresh from German soil and I can get
more.  $0.95 each.  Pmail me off list if interested.

Proper installation of the boot and clip is to install the clip on the
panel, install the boot onto the clip, then install the panel into the
door/body.  You never install the boot by itself onto the door/body,
otherwise it will just push and fall thru when installing the panel w/clip
installed.  They should not have to be heated.
