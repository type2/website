Subject: the dreaded Brazilian Weber

	My 1600 dp features a carb with a large broad W cast into the 
body, and cast onto the side of the float chamber the words   Ind. 
Bras.
	I take it this is the fabulous Brasilian Weber.
	The main fact I have on it is from WASTE of N.J. :-  when 
those things wear out, they really wear out.
	This one was giving good power & economy before my engine was 
rebuilt, and has no obvious signs of undue wear.
	But now the mechanic says 'petrol just pours thru the carb'. 
He firmly believes the Solex 34-PICT is far better, but in view of 
its evil reputation on T2 I am shunning that, and hope to get the 
Weber going again as it was.  I have brought it home and found 
nothing wrong.  The needle valve is sealing OK (test method: turn 
carb upside down and find you can't blow into the petrol input 
nozzle; turn carb right way up and find you can readily blow in).
	It is easy to bend the sheet-brass float-holder so that the 
float closes the needle valve slightly earlier i.e. with the float at 
a slightly lower altitude.  Gaskets are all OK so I can't see 
anything else to do.
	Any suggestions would be welcome.
