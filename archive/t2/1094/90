Todd -

The "Taco Plate" is not the round plate at the bottom center of the
case.  "Taco Plate" is located on the bottom of the case near the rear right
just below where oil filler connects to the rear side of the case. Remember
Rear is REAR.  It's held in place with 2 each 10mm Hex/6mm Bolts.  Don't
forget to replace O-Ring or you'll leak.  And no, do not use the drain plug
for the sender location, bad point of accuracy in temps there.
