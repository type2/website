Subject: Resin Lock Knobs

I made a set of lock knobs for the Guac today:

My own poly resin ("Comic Flame" design), turned on the lathe. I "soft
cut" the threads by drilling the hole just a smidge smaller than the
diameter of the rods, and just twisted the knobs on.

Just something fun to do to the bus. =D
