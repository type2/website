Subject: re: Interior Door Panel installation

Here is a pic of my front door, with the rubber boots in the door, and the
plastic sheet in place.

I can't recall if I had to drill the holes larger to fit the rubber boots,
but I do know I put the boots on the door, the clips on the panel, then
pushed them together.
