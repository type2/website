This may be the key. I've had two Porsche pulls before. I don't remember the
issues exactly, but I remember being told the Porsche flywheel can't be
used. That may be your issue.

Is your motor a Porsche? i.e., with no bus-style oil filler? Well, it
wouldn't matter anyway, because if the motor was in a Porsche, it would have
the Porsche flywheel anyway.
