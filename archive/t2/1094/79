That's odd - you should definitely be able to at least tune idle, 
regardless of distributor type.

I would triple check that you have the wires hooked up.  Remember, they 
are different (correct) in a 76.  For the 009, you need to offset 
everything by 90 degrees in one direction or another which screws 
everyone up.

Just fyi, (assuming you're drive gear is installed correctly) while 
looking at the distributor from above, the top right post (towards 
front,right of the bus) goes to 2, bottom right (towards right 
taillight) goes to 1, top left to 3, bottom left to 4.  In other words, 
1 and 2 cross, 3 and 4 go directly to their cylinders that they "point" to.

Another thing that might help you orient things is to line up your 
timing mark at 0 on the timing scale.  Your rotor will now be pointing 
at a post connected to either 3 or 1, but not 2 or 4.  That will be a 
quick way to verify that you have things somewhat correct.  Then 
counting clockwise around the distributor, the firing order is 1432.

Hope that helps!
Mike
