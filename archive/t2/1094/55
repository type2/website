Yeah, but what if he didn't want it done that way, and what if he
wanted the fun of doing it himself....

Case in point - front and rear turn signals are wrong. That bus is too
valuable to not do it right.

Or maybe he was an OG paint guy and didn't want it painted...

The nomination procedure must have included interviews with the wife
to see how he felt about a restoration and to cover themselves against
a stolen car report...

My 2 cents...
