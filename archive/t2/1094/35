Subject: Interior Door Panel installation

Could someone please tell me the magic combination to use to install the
little metal clips and little rubber boots which hold the door panels on?  I
bought a box of the little rubber boots (which go in the hole first) from a
reputable online vendor.  they are almost impossible to install in the door
clip holes.  Even the metal clips themselves (I also bought new ones from this
same online vendor) are too big to go into the clip holes in the door even
without the rubber boots installed!  What am I doing wrong?  I've come close
to ruining a few door panels trying to get these things installed.  thanks
much, Greg
