Subject: Perfect "3rd" gauge for the Bus...

Hey guys,
 
     I'm not lucky enough to have found a clock for the 3rd spot in my 73's
dash, but I wanted another gauge set that would give me a bit more information
about my Bus motor, and how it was performing. I didn't have a lot of luck
with the Cyl Head Temperature sensor... I think I may have gotten one of the
ones that was flawed from the factory.
 
So I thought, what are the two things that would be most important to me? Oil
Temperature, and Oil Pressure. I'm not a fan of lights, but a fan of gauges. I
did a quick search and included "VDO" and came upon this:

Factory Part Number (Porsche):
911 641 103 03
 
 
It came off a 1978 SC Porsche 911. It's an OIL PRESSURE / OIL TEMPERATURE
gauge. I'm under the impression that it will fit the 3" slot in my Bus gauges
where the optional clock would normally go.
 
I'll let everyone know if it fits. I should get it in a week, so if anyone
cares, I'll post pictures. Otherwise, I'll post a message where I complain
about losing $50 bucks and something about needing to be more responsible with
my money, etc...
 
 
For what it's worth, I bought a VDO gauge splitter (maybe from Bus Depot???)
that gives me TWO sending units off the same oil pressure sensor. When the
time comes, I'll just remove the old one, and screw this one in, in place..
 
 
 
Thanks!
