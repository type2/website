Hi Greg,

When I did this, I had enough clips/ boots from both doors to fix one
(driver) door completely.  I then drilled the holes slightly larger for the
new clips/ boots on the passenger door, primed/ painted the bare metal/ on
the wider openings, and placed the new parts. I have pics - if I can find
them I'll send them along.

Cheers, Mike
