I agree - that tail script on the nose looks...  well, the bodily fluid I'm thinking of *isn't* drool...  Bleah!  (Quote me on that!)  And personally... I like neither the taillights or the moulding.  

The color isn't bad...  tho orange and yellow wouldn't be my choice... the little hotdog dashboards are cute...  Oh, sorry, the Weiermobile got in the way.  (What IS the story with that?  Gonna bastagize it next?)

Seriously - the brakes aren't bad, the colors really aren't bad either, and I even kinda like the soundsystem (tho those exposed woofers - let someone kick those kickers and OUCH!) but it were *mine* and someone "stole" it and did that to it without *my* sayso...  there would be hell to pay.  And what kind of a project is it if someone ELSE does the work?  It's like, well, buying SOMEONE ELSES car. No pride of accomplishment there. So yeah...  Lots of issues IMO.  

The real question is this.  Now that it's all purtyfied, how long before you see it on craigslist?  No... the REAL real question is, how much $$$ would it take to make this right again?  

No matter what...  GET RID OF THAT TAIL-END SCRIPT ON THE NOSE!!!!  Looks F(-at-)^&!nG dorky.  ICK!!

Sorry, but IMO .. those front turn signals and the script across the  
nose just looks like a$$.  Tail lights don't look bad -- even though  
they aren't correct -- but that gaudy moulding.. bleh.

.. and what's with all the pics of the Wienermobile?
