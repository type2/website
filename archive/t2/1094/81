 Also is likely in Atu (Atmospheres), NOT PSI...  I atu is = (appx) to 14 PSI.  (14.7 if I remember).  

And even WITH the correct sender and location and gauge, it's still not a bad idea to check to make sure it's calibrated - I had a full VDO temp setup off the plate that was about 10 degrees off at the topside - when you're talking Celsius rather than Fahrenheit that's a pretty big jump off the mark - especially at the top end of the scale!  Found a guy through my flight instructor who knew how to do the calibration (Apparently airplane mechanics do that sort of thing), which gave me HUGE peace of mind.

Druck is German for Pressure.

The oil pressure gauge is measured in "Druck" pressure, which as of this time,
I have absolutely no clue what that means.
