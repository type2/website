Subject: Re: New engine won't turn

Hi John,

Thanks for getting to the specific questions; much
appreciated. It confirms that this is the direction I need to be going.
At least I know I can grind a bit and still make this work; I really
don't want to deal with swapping Flywheels.

Whether
I have a 215 or a 228 - I think I understand Jamie's description to say
that the Teeth (if you will) of a 215 are raised above (outside) the
rest of the Flywheel whereas the Teeth of the 228 are flush. But honestly, the description
kinda confused me. Looking at the pics (as I can't get to the actual
engines atm) the Teeth on both are raised, neither are flush (I can't
see anything I would consider flush with); suggesting that I have a 210
and a 215. But it does look like the 215? is simply thicker (front to
back) than the 210; the Teeth in particular look thicker. As I recall,
I checked diameters but didn't think about the thickness when replacing
the clutch. Would a 215 Clutch and Disc fit a 228 Fly? Cause that's
what I bought and installed and the reason I figured this was a 215.
What do you actually measure to find out if it's 210, 215 or 228?

Peace
-Paul

I had the thought about the 228mm since the original post. I've
installed two or more 2L engines into 72 buses. As the engine goes
further onto the tranny you will discover more contact areas besides
the two humps at the bottom of the bell housing. So probably you will
have to grind those, and then put the engine back up to identify more
contact areas. Areas I recall are near the starter, but there will be
more around. As you clearance more, it may be loose enough for you to
turn the crank a bit and let the flywheel mark the contact points,
which will then be easy to see by the shiny scratches.

I used the AT starter to solve shaft length and bushing problems.

I've never had any clutch issues with these installations.

the 228mm ring gear is distinctivly different place than the 210 and 215
the ring gear sits flush with the outer dia of the fly wheel on the 228..
and the teeth of the 210/215 are the outer most dia of the flywheel
