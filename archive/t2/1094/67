Subject: "The FOOSE van

I was just thinking..and since it was Friday..the..13th..that in as much has
been expressed about what is and what should be..the van..and in spite of the
fact that it was.."taken' without his knowledge and .."done"..there had to be
some 'people' who knew what was happening, and wished nothing but
.."goodness"..with their .."OK", and when he sees the result, he will find
happiness, and completion..perhaps 2 things that might have evaded him, to the
point of ...non completion!  I 'speak' this..because it is FRIDAY THE 13th,
and because I have had a '38 Chev coupe in the .."works'.. for about 34
years..and only now..is it close to .."DONE"!  Sometimes I wish there was a
"Foose'Fairy" to just see completion! Westy will be first...much as 'it' hates
to share garage space!!
Cheers
Syd
