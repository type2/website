Subject: Re: [T2] New engine won't turn

I had the thought about the 228mm since the original post. I've
installed two or more 2L engines into 72 buses. As the engine goes
further onto the tranny you will discover more contact areas besides
the two humps at the bottom of the bell housing. So probably you will
have to grind those, and then put the engine back up to identify more
contact areas. Areas I recall are near the starter, but there will be
more around. As you clearance more, it may be loose enough for you to
turn the crank a bit and let the flywheel mark the contact points,
which will then be easy to see by the shiny scratches.

I used the AT starter to solve shaft length and bushing problems.

I've never had any clutch issues with these installations.

 Update on Engine won't turn

 Finally got back to it tonight... The Flywheel is definitely grinding
on the front (F is F) of the tranny bell housing. The Flywheel
diameter is correct but either the Flywheel is too thick or the
previous owner shimmed it so it sits away from the engine more (this
came out of a Porsche, btw.) There is maybe 1/8th of an inch space
between engine and tranny as things start to lock up when tightening
the bolts. So anyway, it's grinding into the two raised areas at the
inside bottom of the tranny.

 Someone mentioned grinding out the bell housing, which seems to be a
feasable option. But now I'm questioning how this may affect the
Clutch engaging/disengaging. If the clutch is going to be closer to
the Transmission, is it going to be pressing on the Ring Bearing? (is
that the name for that?) And what kinda issue is that going to cause?
Clutch slippage, etc?
