I just finished The Battle for the Beetle. It was sad to see that
because of travel restrictions within the occupying power zones that
Porsche did not get to see the VW plant until November 1950, just two
months before his death in January 1951. So while painful that his
visit was delayed that long, it was also a blessing that he did get to
see it before his death. His son, though, says it was an early death
due to harsh treatment by the French in prison.

Another poignant part of the visit was that in speaking with Nordhoff
at the factory, Porsche said, "Only since you proved it do I know that
I was right". (p 381)

That statement really got me to thinking about how all of us do our
best to do things, but in the back of our minds we are not really
sure. So while in hindsight we can see his genius clearly, this shows
us that Porsche was also human like the rest of us, and while applying
engineering principles he knew and believed in, the ideas were still
in the abstract, and it wasn't until seeing the factory that he saw
the concept in concrete reality.

It's kind of a self-esteem booster lesson, to have faith in what we
know is right even before we have physical confirmation.

Also, as a testimonial to Porsche's engineering integrity, the
Volkswagen car was to be inexpensive due to simplicity and  the
application of economy of scale in mass production. It was not to be a
crude car.
