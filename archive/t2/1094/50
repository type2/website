Subject: Aluminum cases

Greetings list,
Is there a general thought on the aluminum cases? I remember reading a couple
of years ago when these hardened aluminum cases became available that there
were some mixed reviews? I am putting together my shopping list and debating
an old original core vs. a new aluminum case. I shooting for stock
performance, nothing fancy. Just building a new engine for a frien who is new
the the VW world and wants her engine to be as reliable as possible, so I
don't need to rescue her when she forgets to check/add oil and lets her motor
sieze up )I think I have now properly educated her ont eh importance of
checking for oil spots and actually pulling out the dipstick occasionally
heh).
thanks,
Gerry
