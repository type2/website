Hi Susanne,

ATU is a designation I haven't seen before; but the markings on my VDO  
oil pressure gauges are rated in Bar; which is the same as you  
describe, ie
1 Bar = 14.7psi.

Calibrating a temp sender is easy... drop it in boiling water and it  
should read 212F/100c at sea level. If you are significantly above sea  
level then consult google for the correct boiling point for your  
altitude. What to do about the error factor I don't know.

Happy trails,

Greg
