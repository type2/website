That is correct. You will need a fuel pressure regulator if you are using a 
weber.

That was also the first reaction of a Weber specialist I've
found.  He says their needle valves can't shut off fully any pressure
above 3 psi.  The fuel pump was rebuilt since the camper was on the
road, so now I have to challenge the 'devilish thorough' German
mechanic to give me his measurement.
