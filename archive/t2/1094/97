Subject: electronic points/SVDA

Thanks to all for your help and suggestions. I have gone ahead and ordered
the SVDA dist from Aircooled.net and the electronic points.

I'll let you know when I get to install them, and how things go.

I also got the heater box flange kit. I have always hated those donut
gaskets, they always loosen up on me, or leak. I'll let you know how hard
this is to put on, and how well it seems to work.
