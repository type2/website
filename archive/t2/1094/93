Subject: Wanted: Beater Upright Engine (Bay Area, CA)

Does anyone out there in the Bay Area (Oakland, Berkeley, SF, etc.) have a beater
type-1 engine they'd like to sell for cheap?  Turn-key preferred, long-block or
short-block may be ok.

Bonus points to anyone who wants to do a cheap R&R for him on his '71.  

A friend is in a bind and looking for a quick fix after (probably) shredding 
his engine.  Unfortunately, he's not mechanically inclined (I've tried to get
him going, trust me), otherwise I'd help guide him through a tear-down and/or
R&R.

Full disclosure, he had a known oil leak, the oil light came on during a short
(~2-3 mile) highway run, he pulled over and shut down, but probably not quick
enough.  When he tried to restart the engine (after adding oil) the noise was...
not good.  

My guess is that he popped a ring (which wouldn't seem to be a big deal) but
who can tell until you get in there.
