Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Trouble Timing a 1973 Dual Carb Setup w/ SVDA

SVDA distributors were used on Dual Carb Setups in Europe because they
didn't have to conform to US specs.  The DVDA is a US emissions thing.  I've
run several SVDA with the stock dual 34PDSIT as well as the 34PICT and the
H30/31PICT (I am doing so on three different vehicles for the past several
years my best bud now drives - H30/31PICT in a 68 Bug, 34PICT-3 on a 92
Mexi-Beetle [fresh 1600 DP a few months back] and a 71 European 411 Sedan
1700 w/Manual Trans).  These carbs are designed to work with either the DVDA
or the SVDA dependent on the market they are used on, so any additional open
vacuum ports VW/Solex usually plugs off and the engine is always timed by
the distributor, not the engine regardless how it's built close to it's
stock configuration.

The volume control screw is set initially on the bench at the factory to
provide the specified amount of fuel flow into the idling circuit and is not
dependent on the distributor installed.  A certain amount of gasoline
through this circuit and a certain amount of air through the venturi and
throttle is needed for a good idle.  Your actual idle is set by the larger
Air Bypass Screw.  Bentley has the details and they're spot on when setting
the Left Carb with either a SVDA or DVDA even though they mention nothing
about it, because it's the same.

When I set up the SVDA on my friend's 411, I initially set it at about 0
TDC, fired her up, let it get to operating temperature, chokes off and then
carefully set the timing to 7.5 BTDC.  411's also have a neat maximum
advance mark their pulleys that I also checked against and it was spot on.
Once the timing was set, I readjusted the idle, then re-checked the timing
and I believe I had to do a slight adjustment to compensate.  This one's a
road burner since then.

DVDA's make great desk paperweights.
