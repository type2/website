	That involves ignoring some monster warnings on this list.

	I'm generally a Solex fan, and was therefore surprised when 
the 34 PICT got such poor appraisals from T2 sages.

	 I'm already out of my depth.  My distributor happens to be 
from a '71Beetle, so with luck will still feature this 'Dual advance' 
...  there's only 1 vac line from the carb to the dizzie  ...

	What I intend to do is to get my Brazilian 30mm Weber reco'd 
by the local Weber expert (who mentions that he's imported many 
hundreds of them, and two of them are normally used on the Formula V 
cars).  Only if I can't get the Weber working OK  -  which it sure 
did on my 'delivery' trip from the S. Is.  -  will I resort to the 34 
PICT.
