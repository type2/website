Subject: Trouble Timing a 1973 Dual Carb Setup w/ SVDA

The T1 to T4 swap is done and the 1973 engine with dual Solex carbs is firing right up. Unfortunately, the modified 009 with DVDA canister and pertronix ignition that was being used on the engine was on its way out. The ground wire was literally hanging by one single thread. We decided to throw the pertronix ignition onto an SVDA distributor that came from a 1976 Westfalia camper instead.

Unfortunately, the engine is not timing properly. Jon Stiles (also a Type 2 member) attempted to set the advance repeatedly, but the engine wouldn't stay on and at one point began to backfire. He suspects it could possibly be a vacuum leak.

Does anyone have recommendations? Should we be using an SVDA distributor, or source another DVDA instead? Does this sound like it could be caused by anything else?

Thanks in advance
