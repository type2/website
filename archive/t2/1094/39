Pretty hard to do, since Allstate is not the "person" who ordered the work 
done.  This is a case of fraud, not non-payment for work done.  The shop's 
beef is with the person who either ordered the work done or sold them the 
bus.

Allstate has lawyers being paid whether they work this case or not, so it 
will cost Allstate nothing to lawyer the shop to death.
