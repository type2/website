Subject: Re: [T2] Perfect "3rd" gauge for the Bus...

It's important to remember that a "cool looking" combo gauge such as from
the 911 (or any other make) will require that the proper senders are used
for accuracy.  I'm sure that the 911 senders are not the same as what VDO
offers to the aftermarket.  If you use an aftermarket sender out of the box,
you may get a worthless reading unless you have an instrument specialist
calibrate the gauge to that sender's specifications.  If you have the budget
to do this, then go for it.

A gauge splitter (or more properly called a sender splitter) sounds like a
great idea at first, but even VDO recommends NOT obtaining the oil
temperature from this location because the temperature sender probe is not
"immersed" in the oil to give a proper signal for an accurate reading.  If
using this 911 setup, a little research might be in order to find out where
the original 911 sender was installed and try to do the same (or close
to) on your 1700.  The 1700 "Taco Plate" (as it's called) is usually the
best place to drill and mount the oil temp sender (they were  a standard
installation on the 1700 914s of the era, I happen to have a factory plate
on my 411 Wagon for the standard VDO aftermarket 310-012 oil temp gauge).

YMMV
