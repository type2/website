I found the plate you were talking about. I won't be able to take a photo of
it 'til this weekend.

Too bad you live so far away. Pass the word about the bus. It reminds me of
the Gerry Garcia teardrop bus drawing.

Where do you live? There is a 1966 split window barn door for sale on Rt. 28
in Bridgewater MA for $800. The owner took out all of the windows and door
handles. The engine is partially disassembled and sitting in the cargo area.
The body is kinda rough and has been shaker can painted to make it look
enough to stop and check it out.
