Subject: Bussy's Gone

Bussy, my beloved partner of the past 18 years just drove away without me. I hand-picked the new owner and he worked with me to get me as much money as he could.He is very similar to me in how he will use the bus and the work he does on it - my project will be completed even if not exactly the way I would have, but he will actually do a better job cosmetically than I would have. I didn't cry, but that may come tonight!

The gray one is getting some action from The Samba and Craigs List. Hope it goes soon.

Thanks everyone who tried to help. Keep those positive thoughts / prayers coming! Situation has improved slightly, but a long way to go!
