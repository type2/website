too bad you can't do that on vehicles.... or horses...
if that was allowed.. you could steal a vehicle, fix it up.. then back
charge the owner!

the restoration shop should have run the VIN before they bought it.

I am not sure how it works.. but here in Ontario CA.. there is a process in
place
if they are a registered used car dealer,, etc etc.. and they can use a few
avenues to
get money back..  http://www.ucda.org/buydealer.html
