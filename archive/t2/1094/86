Plus, you're not doing anything special.  Find (or buy) a distributor 
with the same timing curve as the one for your model engine and you will 
be a very happy camper.

You need stock timing specifications, not the stock distributor.  You 
can find the stock specifications on the oldvolkshome website:

See what aircooled says and then let us know.  John is very 
knowledgeable so I think he should be able to help you out.

I have yet to hear of a distributor failing, but ymmv.  Definitely keep 
points handy, although, you probably won't need those either...

Or as many times as you pull the distributor out and/or change it's 
orientation.

Hook up anything wrong and you can fry it :)

I found where it's most noticeable is when you're shifting from first 
gear to second gear.  My friend denied it was ever an issue until he 
drove my bus.  I first had him try it with the hose disconnected and he 
said it felt like his bus.  Then we connected the hose and his mouth 
dropped.  It's very noticeable.

The compu-fire was a drop-in replacement.  pull out the points, screw 
the pickup in, slide the disk on the shaft and then put the rotor back 
on.  You might need to grind a little off the end of the rotor if yourse 
ends up touching, but that's a few minutes on a piece of sandpaper and 
it's by no means rocket science.

Unfortunately, I can't help you much there - I run EFI.

good luck!
