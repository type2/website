I've seen that! Maybe it was yours that I saw the picture of? I thought it 
looked really good.

My wife gets really mad when I do any modifications to the Bus that aren't 
strictly OEM looking. I "enlarged" the opening slightly around the radio 
area for the dash so I could slip in a standard din stereo, and she got 
pissed. The visible part of the opening is still the same size... hah... but 
when she saw me cutting slightly into that dash... damn.
