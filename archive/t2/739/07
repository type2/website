I don't have any pics Don, but it's really easy. Just remove your fan.
Then remove the fan hub. It can sometimes be stubborn. You can use
your fan bolts to force it off, but put some heavy metal stock between
the bolts and the case so you don't dig into the case.

Similarly, if the seal is stuck and won't come off easily prying with
a screwdriver, use a common 3 hook puller, but again being careful not
to score the case. Don't forget to buy an o-ring too.

 Does anybody have any pics of that? I need to do it too. There's oil
