hello Tom  Take a tap a trhead the bushing when it gets to the bottom keep 
tapping and the bushing will come right out   2   to install tape the new 
bushing on a scocket that just fits the outside edges of the bushing use a long 
extension and tap the bushing into the hole # the ground really doesnt matter if 
its braided or not   later  Mark Dearing
