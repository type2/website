Subject: Front brake drum (Fri)

Several weeks ago, there was a thread on wheel balancing.  My 1969 Bay is about 
to get new tires... problem is, nobody around here has the adapter that allows 
the older "drop centre" wheel pattern -- large opening in the middle, 5 bolts 
widely spaced -- to be used on their balancer.  The best suggestion is/was to 
find an old VW front brake drum and use this as an adapter.  The rear drum 
(with small splined hole) will not fit.  This is my Friday post:

WANTED... VW front brake drum, old 5-bolt pattern (no later than 1969), can be 
Bus or Beetle, beyond wear limit is no problem; preferably someplace around 
Baltimore/DC/Delaware area.  Email addr in words =
 
  mccomas (at) intercom (dot) net

Thanks everyone and have a great weekend!  Glenn in Queenstown, Md.
