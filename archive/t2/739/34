Coil is just what name says.  A coil of wire.  It heats
up with use, just as a toaster's coils do.  Or a light
bulb coil, glow plug, etc.  You put electricity through
a coil of wire and it heats up.

Coil heats up/cools down enough times, you stress
the wire inside.  It eventually causes coil of wire
to break.  It may run when cool (wire contracts, contact
is made, coil works), but then you get it hot
with use, wire expands, and contact is broken.

You might be able to test for this condition
by checking coil resistance, but if heat is
causing the fault, will be difficult to check.

get a new coil.
