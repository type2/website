I drove 100 miles one way to airport the other day.  When
I got close, engine started cutting out.  You could tell
it was fuel starved.  I just put this VW together after
sitting for 20 years, so I know tank is dirty.  The fuel
filter was getting clogged.

I could go fine with no load.  No hills, etc.  At the
hills, I would step on accelerator and begin ascent.

Fuel filter restricted.  Carb bowl not being filled up
as fast as it should be.  Using more gas than
is being supplied to carb...

I could last 1 minute up a hill, then have to pull
over to shoulder and let it idle for a minute.  I drove
back all 100 miles in the slow lane/shoulder.

I replaced fuel filter, runs fine.
