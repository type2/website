You might be able to find a shop that does "on car wheel balancing"...
That balances the entire assembly as a unit...But if it's not the shop
where you're buyin' your tires, you'll hafta pay for it...Also, if you go
this route, be sure to paint mark the rim and drum so if you have a
flat, you can return the wheel in its correct position... ;-)
