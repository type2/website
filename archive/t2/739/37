Long shot, but wiggle the wiring harness from the distributor to the body.
I had a bug once that would idle perfectly, reverse perfectly, but buck
and spit when I tried to drive forward.  Turned out that the wiring
harness was worn through where it bends around the fan shroud (not
applicable to t4s, but you get the idea) and would short out only when the
engine dipped a fraction of an inch on its mounts during acceleration.
