I like to replace the seats with air mattresses and store my hydrogen in 
them, then, when my butt hits the deck I know it's time to refill the "tanks"

Ahh.. been there tried that..  The tires also can't seem to keep the temps 
under control.  However, for access to the spare supply, the inflation 
system off a Hummer works great, just run it in reverse to get the fuel out.

The other cool trick is to use rubber cement and Hydrogen Peroxide.  This 
is what powered the first private space vehicle designed by the legendary 
Burt Rutan.  Just be sure to coat the intake manifolds with plenty of bear 
grease so that the rubber cement doesn't stick.  I would recommend WD-40, 
but for some reason my manifold keeps exploding whenever I open up the 
oxygen valve.. I'll have to work on a different WD-40 injector system it seems.
