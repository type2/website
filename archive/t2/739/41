Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 engine questions

I have checked both at noon time to find that the two I have are identical
beeing as Richard Atwell described, flat with a notch.  The oldest I have is
from my 76 bus engine (2 liter).  Sorry not to be able to show the
difference.

BusBosss Pierre

As for the fan, BusBosss Pierre would a pic of each be possible? (you can
p-mail me), and would they be interchangeable? It's an ongoing debate we've
had that the vanagon fan pushes more air than the T2 fan.

Cheers,
Richard
