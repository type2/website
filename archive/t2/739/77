Oh man, I absolutely LOVE the amount of room that the VW Bus has. I'm really an all-out Pontiac guy and never even considered the thought of buying a Volkswagen to fix up. (Not that there was anything wrong with it, or anything..). But my girlfriend (now wife) loves VWs so in order to help get her into the car hobby, I bought the VW Bus. 

When we bought our first house together, we used to to help her move from her condo. 

I use it all the time now to get stuff from Home Depot... the amount of actual USABLE space in the VW Bus is simply amazing....
