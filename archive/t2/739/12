Many years ago I had similar sorts of problems...I went through several
coils until I realized I had the plus and minus reversed on the coil.  It
would work for a while then gradually give up the ghost.

Hi Mike,

Sounds like it's possibly a fuel flow issue or an ignition problem.

If it's dropped a valve seat or  
burned a valve it will run fine on flats but poorly on hills, though  
the coughing and sputtering don't fit that possibility much.


It could also be the coil... I have had a coil that only failed under  
high load conditions. That's a 10-minute swap if you have a spare  
available.
