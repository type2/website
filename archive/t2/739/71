Move to TN, the land of the anything but a VW... <grin!> It gets worse... 95% of the guys I work with drive 3/4 ton 4wd diesel pickups. Some have plastic bull testicles hanging from the trailer hitch (meaning a REAL boy's toy). I show up in my VW Cabrio convertible with the top down... If it wasn't for an occasional visit at work from my wife and 5 year old son, they might be talking... Oh well, I like driving it!

I was thinking about getting a trailer hitch for the Cabrio to hang a cow bell or plastic bull testicles from... Might not be the same... <grin!>
