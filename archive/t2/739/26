I took a hulk, gave away the parts I did not need, stripped a few more, and then cut it into two halves that I could fit on my 6x8 utility trailer. Took it to a metal scrapyard and got $12 for the whole thing. (Was several years ago). 

Could not keep sections of the body but it would dhave been wise. 

Only the shell was crushed and very rough...
