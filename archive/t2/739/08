These temps sound healthy and normal.

 I can turn on the oil temp light (the oil reaches 227 degrees) after
 driving 4 miles uphill floored at 60mph when the engine is warm at the

 big rigs which climb at about 45mph loaded.

 At the top the VDO gauge gives heads temp of ~375degrees. Since
outdoor temp is ~80, heads temp is more like 385degrees. This is not
 necessarily exact since VDO gages are not always precise.
