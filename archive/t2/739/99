Subject: Ohio Bus campout Event ONE WEEK to go!! Vendors & Everyone

Howdy Y'all,
Since it is Friday, I will take this LAST opportunity
to pimp the Fifth Annual VW Buses 'n Boats Bash
Campout event just north of Cincinnati, Ohio next
weekend May 20-22.  The campout event is sponsored by
the Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full Moon Bus Club.
The event will feature riverside bus camping,
canoeing, technical demos, Cincinnati-Style chili
dinner, door prizes, music, raffle drawing, kids
activities, and MORE!!
Vendors are welcome, you can sell from your site and
pay only the published camping fees, no other fees
apply. Everyone is invited to come out an enjoy some
good ole Midwestern hospitality! Here's the web site
link with all of the information:

It WILL be a blast!!

Peace, John Baker
