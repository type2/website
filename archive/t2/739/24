I think all the clutch is doing for you is removing the load on the engine. It MAY also be providing a better ground when you get some tension on it (through the cable). 

Check you ground cable from the front of the tranny to the chassis. 

I'd also get out your multimeter and Bentley and check that AFM output. 

Question: is the cutting out sudden or a gradual lose or regain of power. Sudden stuttering is ignition. Gradual is a fuel problem (not enough). You may know this and if you do, never mind.
