I kinda wonder if it is a sort of 'manufacturing consent' (sorry Norm) kinda 
thing whereby the big auto makers just all do the same thing because they 
are all basically the same kinda people - educated with the same business 
principles and so now all manufacture the same vehicle or is there some sort 
of corporate conspiracy goin' on?  I'm sure a car could be designed that 
would last forever and that would be cheap to build and buy and maintain - 
like - say a beetle that would not rust had some good safety features and 
had relatively good emissions - cheap transportation for the plebs - but it 
would just never happen - I'm inclined to attribute the lack of such a car 
to corporate conspiracy as opposed to a type of 'manufactured consent.'

Then I guess ... people are ... hmmm - better not use the 'f' word. But what 
it is with the SUV guys - I just can't imagine driving one of those things - 
$40 K to buy - less than 20 mpg - more often than not there is only one 
person driving it - There is something about being human that makes the 
majority of people want to make payments on an SUV and live in a 5K square 
foot house .. for reasons I just can't put my finger on .. but then ... 
folks voted for W and I can't figure that out either.
