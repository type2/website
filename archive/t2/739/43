The diaphragms are still good!

The gunk is rust. There were chunks of white rust in the pump body as well.

I'm thinking the rust was blocking the valves keeping it from pumping
properly. Also, the internal filter in the pump was clean. Whether it
was cleaned/replaced by a PO or the rust grew in the pump to begin
with, I don't know.
