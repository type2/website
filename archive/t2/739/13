I had a very similar and vexing problem many years ago and it took months
to find the problem.

    turned out I had a very very tiny pinhole leak in the vacuum side of
my fuel line, everything cold it worked fine.  as the area got warmer the
fuel line softened just a little and the fuel pump started sucking air
under load so it wasn't able to supply full needed fuel supply.  took
months to find and it was pure dumb luck when I found it, simply replacing
that section of fuel line solved the problem....

good luck in your search. it sounds like it is likely some stupid little
problem that you have a better chance of finding (eventually) than some
mechanic working "time and materials"  and it won't cost you an arm and a
leg, but maybe it will a few grey hairs.
