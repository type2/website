The basic rule in TN as I understand it is that you can swap bodies but not frames as frame represents the car. New suspension, new body, etc. no problem. Of course if they caught you, you'd prob have to go through the same process as with a hot rod or custom or kit car. Would be lots to explain.

Actually hacking the VIN plates and swapping them would be very risky. Legal fines, jail, crushing of your $15K van might follow. Would you get caught? Prob not here in small TN town DMV offices. Still the potential $15K+ losses keep me far from trying it... <grin!> 

When the time is right for a later model driver (retiring our current Westy to garage queen) I'll be looking at VR6 Eurovan Weekenders and Sprinter TDi long-wheel-base vans for a homebuilt Weekender solution. $25K+ is still too rich for us.
