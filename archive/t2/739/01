Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Hose info needed....

From: "Mike's Bus" :

The hose on the front of the Brake master cylinder
As seen here (Labeled as "72")

Where does it go???
What does it do???

What size is it?? (I need to replace it)

 Could this hose being broke be causing my brakes to drag????

---------------------------------------------------------------------

A brake booster is a movable diaphragm. In order to move with vacuum pulling on it, the other side HAS to be
open to the atmosphere. In a passenger car, the back side is open to the interior of the car where it gets
clean air. On a bus, it hangs under the vehicle in the elements. If it was open down there, it would fill up
with dirt and water...... not a good way for brakes to work.
So VW sealed it from the elements and put a hose it to go to the dead air section in the B pillar.

That answers these 2 questions: Where does it go??? and What does it do???

#3 question:  It is part number N 904 023 01  it is 14 x 4
This means it has an i.d. of 14mm and the wall thickness is 4mm.

#4...... maybe, if water etc. went down the hose into the booster, then it will take the place of air and not
allow the diaphragm to return to center, which in turn will keep the master plunger engaged.
Likely? No, the spring in the booster should push it up the tube.

Have you been loosing brake fluid?  And not found any leaks?
