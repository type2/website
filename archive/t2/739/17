I'm a bit confused by this. The coil should not see any more load at
any time, right? There is nothing to give feedback to the coil that
says "Scotty, I need more spark". It always does it's job the same
way. However could a bad coil cause the spark to become very weak when
hot? If this is the case, would a visual inspection of the spark be
possible to see a difference?
