I first got a VW bus for the same reason I still have one. the only
vehicle that does what I want.  It's a big enough empty box that it will
hold all my junk but not a huge truck..and it is easy enough to work on
that I can still manage to stay away from the $$$ machines at the
dealership..

I know one person who has a Hummer 1 that really needs it, he manages a
ski slope and needs to haul junk up the mountain in the snow to keep the
lifts working, not to mention getting to work in the blizzard... but for
the rest of us...

and FWIW, the hummer2 is merely a Cadilac Escalade !
