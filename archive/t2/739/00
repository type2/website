In order for a diaphragm to move, it has to be open to
the atmoshere on one side. The brake booster must be
open on the non-vacuum side. In a normal car, the open
side is inside the vehicle, no problem.
On a bus, it is underneath and exposed to the
elements, i.e. water. So, VW plumbed it up to the air
chamber in the door post.
