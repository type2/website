Subject: 8x9x56 exhaust step studs

I bought some step studs from Belmetric to see if they are the real deal and
they are. They are German and identical to the Genuine VW studs. The one on
the left is Genuine VW, right Belmetric:

They are even more identical looking up close. They are only $3.89/ea but
the min. order is 10. I have several spares if anyone needs only one or two
for a repair and doesn't want to order 10.

Very nice company to deal with. They initially told me they didn't sell to
the public so when I called back a few weeks later I just used the usual
business name I made up to get me in the front door when I order by phone.
