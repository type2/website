I can see what he's saying.

Under load with the throttle wide open there is more stuff in the
cylinder. Particularly in the spark plug gap. That increases the
resistance the spark has to overcome to jump the gap. This would lead
to...

Exactly. Though you may not be able to see the difference since
there's no fuel/air mixture to beat when you're trying to see the
spark. But a spark that is hot enough to fire under light load may not
be hot enough to jump the gap when the cylinder is full.

If you're somewhere that you can borrow a coil to swap in as a test,
do it. 70's-80's Volvo and Saab coils can work in a pinch as well.
Most any internally resisted coil should work as a test. If it does
not have internal resistors, you'll need a ballast resistor which
should be on the vehicle you're borrowing from. Usually only really
old american cars/trucks unless a performance coil has been
installed...
