Subject: Beauty ring or trim ring source found

I saw a friend's VW bus with stock hubcaps and a set of unknown brand 
beauty rings. Thought his looked quite sharp.

Now looks like I may have found a good source for what some folks call 
beauty rings or trim rings...

http://www.wheelvintiques.com/

About $23-$25 each.

Page 36 of the PDF format catalog that you can download.

They have 3 styles of trim rings for 14" wheels 5" or wider.

If anyone pursues this let me know how they fit. my budget is still thin 
and being applied to Transvair hurdles right now.
