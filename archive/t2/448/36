Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

Chevy Vegas came with an oil pressure switch that would kill the electric 
pump if the oil pressure got too low (stalled engine). Dunno if they will 
fit the VW engine, bet they can be made to fit. Available at any FLAPS.

Ford products such as 80's vintage Tempos and the like came with an impact 
switch in the trunk that would kill the fuel pump in the event of a 
rollover or a crash. Has a reset switch for the rare occasions that it 
trips by mistake.
