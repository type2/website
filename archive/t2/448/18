Subject: compression check on 1700

Hi,

I am still looking for a 1700 for my 72 Westy.  I found one but I 
realized that I don't know what "normal" compression is.  What should I 
be looking for?  The engine I am looking at has 95 - 100 psi all around 
is that good, bad or ugly?

TIA,

Dave Williams
