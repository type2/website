Subject: '76 FI charcoal canister hoses

After having a loose hose on the crankcase side of the canister cause  
me a few days of heartburn, I decided to replace them.  The old hoses  
were in bad shape; the apparently once flexible material had hardened  
and was misshapen at the ends, and the original clamps were shot... the  
hoses slipped off their fittings easily, and made a poor seal.

I used common clear vinyl tubing (available at any hardware store) as a  
replacement.  1/2'' inside diameter tubing went over the fittings  
perfectly, with just the right amount of snugness.  Hose clamps were  
used to finish them off.

I'm hoping the clear vinyl tubing will hold up.  I don't think these  
hoses get very hot.  I kept the original ones around just in case I  
need to swap them back in, but I'm optimistic that the new ones will  
work okay.

hose

Materials were cheap -- 3 1/2 feet of hose (-at-) $1.39/ft, and 4 clamps (-at-)  
$.99/ea.
