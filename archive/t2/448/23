there are alot of places out there that design wheels and rims with the
5/112 bolt patern. you can check with your local tire/rim dealer about PRIME
rims. They make very nice rims and fit with little modification.

here is a pic of their rims on a 1976 bus

those rims are 16 inch rims with 205/55/16 which also only gives you about
3-4 miles per hour difference over the stock tire hieght as to not not throw
off your speedo


dont give up... there are ppl who do make tires and rims tat look cool...
use the net as there are a ton of manufactures with the 5/112 bolt pattern.
