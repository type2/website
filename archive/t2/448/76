Subject: hubcaps

I didn't think German hubcaps were still available for for 71-later busses but apparently GoWesty stocks them.

FWIW I cleaned up my original hubcaps with OO steel wool to great effect:

Since they turned out so well I've started to scrounge original germans ones from the junkyard. So far I've been simply looking for ones that aren't rusted out on the backside as the knockoffs seem to be plated poorly there and that's the giveaway.

I've noticed some OG hubcaps have a back that is painted grey. Does anyone know if they were all like that?
