I guess you could use the AIRS List for such, but the intention for the AIRS 
List is to provide a local resource for helping get someones broken bus back 
on the road.  To change it into anything else would destroy its intended 
purpose.   The list is a group of good hearted volunteers who put thier 
information out there for the benefit of others.......Having them grouped by 
geographical area is necessitated by how they could be of help.
