Subject: Type 4 tin assembly :-o

The Bus Boys link explained it!  I had a couple of pieces on wonky and I've
realized that my lower tin and rear baffling is specific for my old '77
convoluted exhaust system.  As I'm converting to a rear discharge '74
exhaust system it appears that some of the lower tin has to be changed, I'll
have to track some down.  It doesn't look like it will stop me from getting
the engine back in the bus this weekend though.  Thanks for the quick
replies, much appreciated!

Cheers
