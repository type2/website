There are several versions of the pedals afaik. 68-72 has one style of
linkage, 73-79 another. Within the last one, the pedal changed slightly in
76 and the pivot pin changed during a year I can't pin down.

Given all of this most of the vendors list all pedal components as 68-79
which is confusing.

I haven't seen a 70 pedal assembly at the junkyard in a while but I believe
it doesn't use that spring. That spring is used on the later assembly: one
end presses against the floor and the other end the the pedal. It wraps
around the middle of the pivot pin.

Only the later model pedal is depicted in the FI section afaik.
