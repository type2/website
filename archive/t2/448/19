Subject: Rear hatch adjustment on a 1970 Bus

Hi

I bought a 1970 Bus recently and had to get rear hatch springs from a
boneyard as the previous owner had mangled the hinge brackets that attach to
the springs.

I got the springs installed and attached to the door ok. It now closes and
stays up great. The only problem I have now is that on the left side the
door is up from the body about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch and on the right side
it's down about an 1/8 of an inch.

I tried loosening the two attaching bolts, but they only allow for up an
down.

How can I adjust for in and out? The hinge brackets on the deck lid look
fine.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Jim
