Subject: Gas pedal problems

If for some reason you can't fix the sticky pedal in the near future, I
suggest using a bungee cord to pull the pedal back into place.  It works
like a charm every time....

I've been known to use a similar trick when stuck in the middle of the
Mexican desert.

Best regards,
Shawn.
