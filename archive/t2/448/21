Bentley says 100-135 is good and 85 is the wear limit as they've written it.
The no mans land area in between is certainly a cause for discussion. They
also write than 28 psi is the maximum difference between cylinders.

If you don't have to correct the reading for altitude you are on the very
low end of good. At least they are within 5% of each other.

You could certainly do better. How does it drive?
