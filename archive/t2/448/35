Subject: what the heck, it can't hurt...

Hi
Why not ask, right? If anyone can use the services of a bus enthusiast, 
complete with some self learned mechanical ability and 6.5 years as a 
computer programmer, let me know. I'm in Hampton NH. If I could turn my bus 
hobby into a sustainable source of income I'd be rather happy.

Thanks
Mat
