A little is sprayed where a suspect hose or gasket meets a fitting.

It's the gasket between the throttle body and the air plenum. You need to
remove the air filter, the AFM, the s-boot, undo the accelerator cable and 2
screws holding on the throttle body. On some models (not yours) the linkage
for the EGR will have to be disconnected as well.
