Subject: Re: [T2] Gas pedal problems

before i trashed my 72 i replaced the under floor componets with the later
style ones and found them to be much nicer so you might go ravage the junk
yard.

If for some reason you can't fix the sticky pedal in the near future, I
suggest using a bungee cord to pull the pedal back into place.  It works
like a charm every time....

I've been known to use a similar trick when stuck in the middle of the
Mexican desert.

Best regards,
Shawn.
