Subject: 77 Bus FI question- lurching- now no startie

To All-

You may recall that last week I reported a "lurching" problem on my stock 77 FI engine. Well I am happy to report that the suggestions seem to have payed off. I celaned up the ground on the double relay and ensured that the heat sensor near #3 was secured tightly. A tough place to reach and the bolt seemed to be like 13.5 mm in size? Bizarre! Is there a proper tool for this?

Well after my three huor road trip I came back to start the bus the next morning (i.e engine is dead cold) and the damn thing won't start. When I turn the igntion on I get nothing not even a click. All I can hear is what sounds like a incredibly slight wirring (from what I assume would be the starter)or like gas escaping from a pop bottle near the back of the bus

I don't think it is the old wing issue with not enough juice to go to the igntion and all the way back to the stater. It sounds more like the starter iteslef? Thoughts? I am kinda leery of crossing the terminals on the starter myself as getting run over is kinda overrated. Anyway any suggestions welcomed. FYI the battery appears to have lots of juice.
