Subject: Re: [T2] cam gear numbers - anyone?!

Hey James,
I am looking at my cam right now and the part number is:

   021.109.111B (vw logo) 9H

It is dark in complexion (about the color of an unpowered computer 
monitor screen), definately not shiney like my new cam gear, and I also 
found a -1 on the cam gear.  Does that mean it's made of the mag allow?

On my new webcam gear, it says:

   REPLACES 021 109 111C

the middle numbers (109) are hard to read, but I think that's what they 
say.  There are also no offset number markings.

So, here's what I'm thinking:  I'll take the original cam gear and drill 
out the rivets holding it to the original cam.  I'll then take that gear 
(marked "-1") and bolt it to the new cam and test it in the case.  If 
that fits, see if webcam will exchange my unmarked (probably 0 gear) for 
a -1 gear.

sound like a good idea?

thanks,
Mike
