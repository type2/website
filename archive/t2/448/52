It is probable that your problem is still the "hot start" problem.  If you
hae not installed a Bosch WR-1 kit, I would advise doing so.

The whirring is your gas pump.  It should run when the key is in the
"start"  position whether the starter is turning or not.  It should not
run with the key in the "run" position if the engine is not running.  If
it does your problem is probably with the FI ground wires.  There are
three.  One is on the double relay and very obvious.  I believe you have
moved this one and it is probably fine.  The other two are attached to a
tab on the parting line of the engine case under the air distribution box.
If you shine a flashlight under the air box from the 3/4 side of the
engine you can just barely see them.  Make sure they are attached and in
any case wiggle them a bit to disturb the corrosion.  Also check your
frame-to-transmision ground strap.

A remote starter switch allows you to test this without being under the
car.  These switches usually cost less than $10.  they connect to
terminals 30 and 50 on the starter.

                             OOK!
