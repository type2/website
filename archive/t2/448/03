Anyone else interested to know who is living in the same town etc ? 
Want to know something about a specific city ? Might be a nice resource.
I cant see it being too much work to tabulate locations/names and 
e-mails ...

Hey there Volks,

That's why it's always a good idea to have your location in your sigline (ascii
only). 

Uncla Joel Walker used to do the "weekly statz". The "oldtimers" on the list
will remember this, but here's a example:

IIRC Uncla Joel did this buy hand (from peoples siglines). I would probably be
alot easier for someone to whip up a simple html form page that posts to a cgi
script that tabulates the Statz.
