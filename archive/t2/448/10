Subject: Gas pedal problems

I have a sticky accelerator. I'm going to replace to cable tomorrow, but while
I was looking around I noticed what was the remnants of a spring on the pedal.
I found a spring at the Bus Depot here:

http://www.busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211721549A

but mine was set up different. Mine went through the hole in the floor and
connected to both ends of the "S" shaped rod that hooks on to the bottom of
the pedal. At least I think that's what happened. All I have is a few coils
wrapped around both ends of this bracket indicating there used to be a spring
there.

So how is this supposed to be? Where does the spring in the above link hook on
to.  Maybe this is a dumb question, but I'm feeling pretty dumb, so if the
shoe fits.

One last thing. I just got a Bentley the other day, so if all of this is in
there and I haven't found it yet, just tell me to clam up and pint me to where
it is in the book

Thanks,
