Subject: lug bolt thread cleaning

Folks, I have a need to clean up some threads on some lug bolts
on my 78(got por-15 in them) and wondered if anyone knew of a tool
to do this that didn't cost beaucoup bucks.

Like this one  http://www.eastwoodco.com/email/default.asp?T1=28099

Any opinions/hints?

Cheers, dave
