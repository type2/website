Subject: Melling oil pumps and type IV motors

List,

After the involved discussion in the past few weeks about using a Melling
oil pump on a type IV motor, I decided to do some more research. My findings
are still somewhat inconclusive, but interesting nonetheless.

I called Melling and spoke them. I received a Melling catalogue #33103-1
today, and there is no listing for an oil pump for any type IV motor. They
list 8 pumps for various type 1 motors, covering pretty much every model,
6mm studs, 8mm studs, and several pump volumes.

Now this doesn't mean that there is no Melling pump that fits or can be made
to work in a type IV. People have been using type 1 pumps in type IV's for
years, and they can be made to work. But there is no current production
Melling oil pump which is specified for a type IV motor by the manufacturer.
