It's small like 2mm dia and mabey 25mm long. but that is from mem.
it's called a anti-chatter spring. While I have never seen anything
that actually said specifically it does X, I have always just
considered that it was there to help the distributor keep a smooth
path instead of bouncing and chattering at accel and decel.

? chattering distributor? then there is always that nagging thought in
the back of your mind that you are missing the spring. :) I have been
fortunate to have a few around when I needed them, so I haven't run
them w/out the spring.
