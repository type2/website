Subject: Main heater pipe

Does anyone know, off the top of their head, what the outside diameter of
the heat pipe that runs under a 1971 van is ?

I'm going to have the belly pan off this weekend of the annual waxoyling
session and thought that while I'm under there some new insulation might be
a good idea. I'm thinking that technology has moved on in 30 years an my
local DIY store will be able to provide something with better insulation
properties than the old stuff.

I know I have heat (tested it last night) but I want MORE !!!!

Oh, and handy hint - check the vents on the front of the van are properly
closed and have seals on them. Mine weren't so last winter it didn't matter
how much heat I got, it was still cold !
