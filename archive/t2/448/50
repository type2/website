I am aware of the AIRS list and I was thinking of a more informal, 
"Fun" directory of list members, not just those who are interested in 
rescue and help.
More like having a little profile of the member, just so we can get to 
know one another better and where we are all at in the world. I'm not 
thinking that this will be of any sort of safety resource, more a 
friendly resource. I am fairly sure that the AIRS list doesnt contain 
all the list members, though I could be wrong.
