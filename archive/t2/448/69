Subject: Type 4 tin assembly :-o

Hello folks,
Ref my 1977 2.0 engine rebuild.
I have my block reassembled.  All went well enough except that I decided to
go with hydraulic cam/lifters and filling those things with oil are a pain
in the butt!  They had discs instead of ball valves illustrated in the
references, I had a hard time charging them but referenced the archives and
the Boston Engine articles and they're installed but not fully pumped :(
I'll run them without pre-load like in Boston Bob's articles and preload
them later.  I also had a hard time getting my pistons back in the cylinders
as the oil control rings are 3 piece units and even with a new ring
compressor they were reluctant to install but the long block is finally back
together after six weeks work with all new or overhauled components
(BTW-thanks for the advice in valve guide seals...didn't bother with them).

My question today:  I'm battling another time-waster, I can't find any
references for the type of tin fitted to my engine in Bentley or Haynes {:-0
I should have made a diagram during disassembly!  The illustrations shown
don't appear to be type 4 pancake style motor tin like that fitted to mine
and I've searched the T2 library, archives and the net too.  Is there
anywhere where I can see a diagram showing how to put this stuff back
together...I never was good with puzzles!  Even good pictures of an
assembled engine with tin in place would help (especially the side-views,
area by the alternator and bottom view).  On the plus side my tin looks good
with fresh low gloss paint and Hoover bulkhead fittings...but it would look
better on the engine!

In the meantime I'm going to venture forth to try and flag down strange
busses for a looksee at their engines...thanks again!
