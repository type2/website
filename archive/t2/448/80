Subject: Emission Requirements for PA

I've got a buddy that lives in Philadelphia, PA and he is interested in
purchasing a bus.  One of his concerns is if there will be any emissions
requirements for a 1976 Westy.  Anyone out there in PA know of anything
special for registering and maintaining a bus in that state?

TIA,
