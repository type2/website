For those of you thinking about a Transvair...All three of you.... <grin>

For those of you following my snail's pace saga of a Corvair transplant 
into my '78 Westy while life keeps me busy, here's another chapter.

http://corvairpitstop.com/

I don't know them, never done business with them, don't know anyone who has 
done business with them.

I don't even suggest that you SHOULD do business with them, only that you 
COULD.

What I find interesting about their site is that they list WHOLE engines 
for sale. That should give anyone who feels like the Corvair and their 
parts are in short supply an idea of costs, and an idea of what any engine 
you might find should sell for (should you find one locally). Why pay $750 
locally when you know you could buy one from an online vendor for $500? 
Heck I bought a 110 HP engine and transaxle COMPLETE with spare 1/2 engine, 
ALL the shop manuals from ALL the Corvair years for $100. Made several 
great friends as well. They are out there and cheap.

Update: dipped and cleaned Corvair carbs. Bought new harmonic balancer from 
friend. Retrieved a pile of shop manuals (mentioned) above for all the 
Corvair years and models. Brought my transaxle home from the family barn 
for cleaning. Bolted flywheel, inspected pressure plate. Hopefully will 
build carbs and clean and paint transaxle this weekend.

See ya!
