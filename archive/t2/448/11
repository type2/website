Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Smell

Were you running the heater for the first time in a while?  Both my
daily-driver Super Beetle and my recently-resurrected bus kick out some
funky odors when fall arrives and the heat goes on.  Dunno if there's dust
or oil or other stuff in there that has settled in the ductwork and hasn't
gotten blown out over the summer, but that's my guess.  Also - the bus is
drawing its heater air from the engine compartment - so unless all the
tinware is sealed/grommetted/etc. and there's no blowby pushing out
anywhere, you're going to be wearing eau d'air cooled each morning from the
oil mist and other lovely scents wafting off your engine.
