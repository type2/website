Hello Hot Dog  & Buns      How long you been on this list???  What year bus?? 
LOL    I'm assuming its a type 4 motor since you said bolts  and not bolt . 
It is very unusuall for the 5 bolts to shear, not too unusall for the type 1 
flywheel gland nut to break, This was what happened to Kristia Laurites bus  
when she broke down and I fixed it before she was murdered . Save the bolts for 
me please so that I can check them out.  I like doing that to  figure out the 
causes, something I learned from Harry( The Maestro) Pellow   RIP  He would 
always do kind of like CIS things to determine what the causes were and his 
writings of such were great reading  for all 356 porsche owners. His books are  
collecter items now.  The Maestro Chronicles, Murphy is my co pilot,  ABCs and 
912 of porsche engines, the Maestro's newsletter, secrets of the inner 
circle,and his writings for the 356 regestistry .  I also miss the old Troy 
heitzenrater mag   GASS    german air suckers Society  Who I just talked to yesterday and 
is doing wonderful .   Later and have fun  mark dearing
