It really shows how much we take for granted our wiring.

 Ok to get some bus in here, Yesterday I changed out ALL of my positive and
 negative wires from the batteries, really splurged and went to West Marine
 and made a completely new assembly of #2 guage wire.  hooked it up and put
 a charger on it over night,  this morning it was pretty chilly before dark
 when I went out (ok it was dang cold!!!) hit the switch and talk about
 spin that starter motor!!!  was worried the motor was going bad, but it
 seems it was just the wiring,  also while I was doing it I replaced the
 rear start switch and put in a battery cut out switch too.
