Bart,

No problem...except getting explosive stuff spread around.

That was last Tuesday or so wasn't it?  Surely all of it has pretty much 
evaporated by now.  No problem on the tranny.

If gas could get inside, then so could water...and it's not gonna happen 
unless you have some other serious tranny problem...like a hole in the 
tranny.

Cheers, dave

 The tranny now shines like new anyway ;-)
