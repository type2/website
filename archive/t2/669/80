Yes George, there IS a Chris - - - er, I mean a success story with an easy
out. The right thing to do though, is use heat, and paraffin first to soak
into those stubborn threads, and use the biggest Easy out that will fit.

Here are some shots of the successful use of an Easy Out. Of course if this
hadn't worked, we'd have had a bloody great temper tantrum and whipped it up
to the machineshop. :-)



Merry Xmas to everyone!

As you have found, the EZ-out is very brittle, since is is made of

extremely hard metal. A drill won't touch the EZ-out.

 

You might be able to use the brittleness to your advantage by taking a

punch and whacking the EZ-out with a hammer to break it up. If you can

hit from the backside, so much the better.

 

If this fails, and you can get the part off, find a machine shop that does

EMD stud removal. The EMD machine literally dissolves the metal

electrically, so it doesan't care how hard it is.

 

One somewhat related question: Has anyone successfully used an EZ-out, or

are they just sad jokes on us amateur mechanics?

 

I find it to be cheaper in the long run to take stubborn studs to a

machinist before I gotch them up too much.
