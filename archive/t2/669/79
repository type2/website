Jeff,

There's a mailing list for DTM owners, although i'm not sure if its just 
for the type-1 engine DTMs or not.

you can subscribe to it by sending an email to dtm-subscribe(-at-)topica.com

You can also go here:  http://www.shoptalkforums.com/

and click on "air cooled technologies" or "type 4rum" for more info.

I've seen Jake respond in all of those forums.

For those of you who aren't aware, DTM stands for "Down The Middle" and is 
a new fan shrouding that Jake Raby has designed for both type-iv and 
type-i engines.  Looks pretty cool, but a little pricey for me at this 
point.

Cheers,
	Tom
