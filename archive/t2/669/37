Nope, standard issue 1.7 L heads, the 10mm stud that
you are talking about is a exhast port used on the
smog control, exhaust gas ported back to the intake,
most likley welded shut. There should be one on the
left head and two on the right one. Not porsch heads,
they only have three intake manifold studs, yours have
four. Phil
