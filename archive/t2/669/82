It is smooth.

Did you remove the nut from the rear (RIR) end of the upper starter bolt
(AKA the dee bolt)? The nut is accessed from inside the engine bay on the
upper right area of the engine case. The bolt passes through the starter,
tranny and engine case, it is smooth on the front side where it engages into
the starter body and the nut is on the rear side, inside the engine bay.
