Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone on the List towing in VA today?

Hello Dave  That was kelly Brown (Metal Wiz) bring Steve Dolans 67 hardtop 
westy up for me to fix.  Better late than never . I have already started on 
removing parts  and will be getting into the body work real soon.  First thing 
I'll do is stick a motor in it so I can move it in and out on it's own power. The 
motor that was in it was loaned to AJ one of the canaidians at last years 
Everybus. I'll try to take some pixs of thre progress .  Later and have fun  Mark 
Dearing   Salem Import Service  Salem Va       PS  Hey dave thanks for the
