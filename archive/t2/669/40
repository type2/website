For most on the list, I hope this is a useless piece of information, 
because you're smart enough that you thought of it before. This is for 
people like me, who tend to be a little duller.

You know those plastic cases that Sears and other tools come in? The 
ones that are hollow? I tend to cast them aside (not out -- what bus 
owner ever throws anything out?) because they get dirty, and the idea 
is to keep tools clean. The first time I tried to clean one, many years 
ago, water got into the hollow and then never, ever, ever came back 
out.

Well, I just figured out how to deal with this.

[smacks forhead again]

Blue silicone caulk. Just seal the holes off with the blue stuff, and 
you're good to go.

Duh!
