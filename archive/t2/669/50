Subject: Sheared off

Ok I have a question for those of you that have seen everything, or have an
idea about something interesting (at least to me).

I received a bus that was basically in a junk yard on it's way to the scapper.
It still had the engine and tranny in it. I pulled the engine today and this
is what is intrigueing:

The engine came out just fine, but after I had it out and was looking at it I
noticed the flywheel didn't come with it. On further inspection I realized
that at some point the flywheel bolts had sheared off. Tthe flywheel pulled
off the spline just fine and the bolt heads are there. The ends of the bolts
are in the case. What would cause the bolts to shear? I have never heard of a
tranny freezing up and shearing the bolts, but I haven't heard of everything.
Is it at all possible that by dragging the bus with the tow truck the bolts
could have given out? The engine turns over fine with a socket on the fan hub.
Great compression too, and turns like it should.

What scenarios would cause the flywheel to shear off the bolts?

Thanks for any input,
