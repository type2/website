Similar to a mixture adjustment screw on a carb, you turn the CO screw
clockwise to richen the basic mixture and counterclockwise to lean it out.
However, I'd play with the CO screw as a very last resort, only after
checking out every other part of the ignition and FI systems, as there's
many things that can make for a too-rich running engine.  The basic mixture
should really be set using an exhaust gas analyzer though you can also
monitor the output of the O2 sensor - if the car's so equiped - to get the
mixture in the right range.

One common problem with the older L-Jetronic systems is that the spring
inside the AFM that resists the turning of the air vane weakens over time.
It can weaken enough that no amount of adjustment of the CO screw will bring
the basic mixture back to spec, resulting in too-rich running in all
conditions.  The cure here is either a new AFM or adjustment of the spring.
