Subject: RE: seat

That large metal disk is the swivel mechanism.  With the seats out, remove
the three (or is it four) bolts that hold the disk down, remove disk and
runners (watch out for spring lever), clean up all the crud that has fallen
down there (like your old seat stuffing). then add a little grease and put
everything back in with the bolts - lift the lever and the seat runners
should rotate.
