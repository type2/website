Subject: brake warning light & battery light flickering on at moderatly

1974 all stock..
It would seem that if the fluid level gets low this will happen.
my fluid level is fine.
Also a bad/failing/flakey voltage regulator will cause this. If the
voltage regualtor goes kaput these lights will come on and stay on.
I just put a new one in.. it is still happeningbut perhaps to a lesser
degree.
battery with bus off = 12.4 volts
voltage at battery with bus running = 13+volts
next I am going to clean all connections having to do with the charging
ckt.
---- any other ideas???
as a side note.. I have been having some carb iceing problems as the
weather gets colder. On the 74 there ports to the heater boxes that
protrude into the engine compartment to allow for the booster fan
hookup.
As I dont use this fan and have an in line bilge blower fan, I had
these
ports or inlets blocked.. I am running a dryer vent (metal) hose from
the passenger side port to the intake on the aircleaner box. Seems
to have solved the iceing issue nicely.
