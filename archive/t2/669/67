Hi Sean,

Your post gave me an idea:
The easiest way to get late-bay tracks mounted in an early bay would be 
to start with the top plate of a swivel seat base, and simply bolt it 
into place on the early bus. The top plate of a swivel mechanism has 
the same tracks in it as the late-bay. Then the later bay or vanagon 
seats can be slid directly into a factory correct track. Problem 
solved.

There's a pic of a rusty swivel here:

The only hard part is finding the swivel plate, but those should be 
readily available from used part vendors or your local VW boneyard. I 
have a spare here, but shipping would probably be pricey.

Note: If you do find one in the local boneyard, can you send me the 
little rubber bushings that are used in  the lower swivel plate? I need 
a set of 4 for the westfakia, the P/S seat is getting pretty wiggly. 
There simply aren't any late-bay westies  or vanagons in the boneyards 
in these parts.

Happy trails,
