 Hi Phil,

 Exactly correct, I have owned 1.7L and 1.8L engines with these PITA
 ports in the heads. When a plug pops out the engine makes a hell of a
 racket.

NOT correct!  Ports going into the exhaust side in the head are Air Injection ports
for the SMOG PUMP. The smog pump pumps fresh air INTO the exhaust to complete the burn.
To control HC and CO emissions.

EGR is the opposite. Exhaust comes into the intake side of the engine, usually thru the EGR
filter and entering the engine thru the EGR valve(s) to dilute the air/fuel mixture to lower combustion temps.
This in turn lowers NOX emissions.
