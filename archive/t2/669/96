Richard,

They few times I called about the AVP that I got, I left messages and the 
call were returned fairly quickly.

I would expect a new, never fired engine to have some leakdown.
Rings haven't sealed to the cylinder yet, so plenty of clearance.

If I remember correctly 4% leakdown would be considered excellent in a
stocker type engine with some miles on it.

Umm, but 20% and non closing valve is *not* good...so exhaust valve is 
leaking air out...hmmm...I don't suppose you can see anything like a piece 
of paper or anything stuck in the valve opening anywhere?

Cheers, dave
