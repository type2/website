Hi Phil,

Exactly correct, I have owned 1.7L and 1.8L engines with these PITA 
ports in the heads. When a plug pops out the engine makes a hell of a 
racket.

I'd just like to add that there were 1.7L FI engines in VW 411's, 412's 
and porsche 914's, we (My dad, brothers and I) are currently working 
with a 411 engine for my Dad's project westy "Franklin". These engines 
used Bosch "D-Jet" fuel injection, the precursor to the L-Jet FI that 
our buses use. Those heads are identified by a 12mm breather fitting 
that is plumbed to the case breather with thick vacuum line.

Happy trails,
