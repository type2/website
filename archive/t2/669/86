Subject: Heater just stopped working?

Hi guys & gals,



I went on a nice 700 mile roundtrip this week and my heater decided it
was not going to work. It worked fine the last time I had driven it,
about 3 weeks ago.

The defroster works, air does get to the floor vents when you use the
lever but it does not come out forcefully. I checked the fuses up front
at a stop and they were fine. I looked in my repair manual and
supposedly there is a fuse in the engine compartment but I can't find
it.

I can't hear the fan that pushes the air anymore, so maybe the contact
on the lever went bad? Is there a way I can check that? I am a little
miffed because it has always worked (as well as I could hope) before but
it just decided to stop working now. Any ideas would be great.



Thanks,
