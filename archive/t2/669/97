Yesterday I was driving back from Interstate used parts in Lake
Elsinore and had just gotten on the 5 from the Ortega Highway when I
saw an avocado green and white with an orange belt stripe late bay
blast by on the 5 north. The bus had Washington plates too. Driver
appeared to be REALLY enjoying himself!

How many SUV drivers have a smile on their faces just from driving
down the freeway?

What really surprised me was he drives like me! 70 - 75 when traffic
allowed. I'd never seen another bus do that.

I have to remember NOT to drive like that when I go to Denver. Knowing
my luck I'd get caught in a speed trap. LoL!
