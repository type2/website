Subject: [T2] 95 Eurovan for sale in SC

i passed by the old shoneys building today right by wofford college and seen a white eurovan for sale sitting there...
went back and looked at it and seems to be in good shape without a key hitting the ignition.. i dont know whom it belongs to though...
just thought i would pass it on.
I havent ever seen it before around this area but had a sc tag on it...
Heres what was on the For Sale Sign
