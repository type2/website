Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder head temp guage report

Hi Tom,

I've been thinking about these guages. What is the probe like, and how
will you mount it on your head and route the wire?

By the way, gauge pods are plentiful at FLAPS, at least at the higher
end ones like Napa and Franklin. Seen some at Kragen too. Heck, Harbor
Freight sells a triple gauge set for $9.99. At that price you can toss
the guages and use the mount!

Thanks,

John

 Just opened and tested my new CHT guage. Ordered it from Aircraft Spruce &
 Specialty. It's a Microflight CH001 with included sensor. For $49.95 +
 shipping I think I got a useable product. 

 My question for the day:
 Does anyone know where I can find a guage pod to house 3 or 4 guages on top of
 the dash that is enclosed so you don't see the wires and connectors on the
 back of the guage? seems the one Bus Boys used to sell is NLA. Isn't that the
 way with all the cool old stuff?
