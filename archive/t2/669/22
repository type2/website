I saw a commercial for the Li'l Brats toys, and the Splittie is visable.  I 
told my wife that my 2 1/2 yr. old daughter needs these dolls 
:-)  Although, since I own a Bay, I'm not sure I can risk her going over to 
the dark side.  She needs a toy Bay, something that looks like the "magic 
bus", as she calls it.
