Subject: RE: [T2] Wandering

My 68 Westy seems to want to wander all over the highway without my
permission.
-------------------------------------------------

My bus has only recently solved it's wandering issue.  I replaced all four
tires, all four shocks, new ball joints, alignment, balancing, and replaced
brakes all the way around w/ brake lines, bearings, racers, and greased the
CV's......  turned out the nuts on the rear drums needed more torque.  All
that time I thought that the drifting was all in the front end, some of it
was, but most of it was from the back.  I had done my own brakes but didn't
and still don't have the ability to get the entire back end completely off
of the ground and stable enough for me to apply a 6 foot extension to my
breaker bar and NOT screw up my jack or dump it off of the stands.

In retrospect what I should have done after cranking those nuts down to the
extreme torque settings that buses require, was drive it around the block
and then torque it again.  If the bus is sitting on the ground when you
torque those down, make sure that you get those back wheels moving enough
(jacking or rolling) so that the weight of the vehicle isn't keeping the
tires/rims from seating correctly.  All that time I was taking corners like
an old time extended fire truck, just without the guy in the back with
steering wheel.

They weren't loose enough to come off, and I had put the cotter pins in, but
they needed a lot more torque than what they had.

  Something to consider anyway if you have had your rear drums off at any
point in the last year; and didn't have it on a lift when you were putting
them back on again.
