Shawn,

Joplin, not sure. 

Neosho for sure.  This guy is one of the nicest folks you will ever meet 
and has been working on VW's since he was a kid in his Dad's shop.  After 
you get moved, just drop by and talk to him.

***Highly*** recomended
Darryl's Auto Center
1418 N Business 71
Neosho, MO 64850-6820
Phone: 	(417) 451-3926 

There is also a club in Neosho...just ask Darryl, and lots of action down 
toward the Arkansas line.

http://www.volksmeisters.com/   (in Fayetteville, Arkansas)
http://www.nwavwa.com/		(in Eureka Springs, Arkansas

Big show in Eureka Springs every year...last weekend before labor day 
weekend....generally about 200-300 cars each year.

Cheers, dave
