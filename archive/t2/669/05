Subject: battery ind light and brake warning light flickering on... ???

Long ago I seem to remember something like this happening where
the battery ind light and brake warning light came on and stayed on..
was a bad voltage regulator.. I can remember if more of the idiot
lights came on though..
  These two lights flicker on momentarily when I am accelerating hard
like in getting up some speed for a hill.
  Do you think my voltage regulator is giving it up slowly?

TIA
