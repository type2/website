The first time I did a bottom end rebuild, I neglected to check endplay 
before installing the flywheel. When I started to break the engine it, 
it kept shearing the bolts that hold the fan to the hub. The list set 
me straight on endplay, and I shimmed it up correctly -- end of 
problem.

I wonder whether some error in setting endplay could have caused this. 
A lot more bolt(s) on this end to shear!
