Subject: Help! Can't get the (-at-)$#%#^ starter out!

WTF? Why doesn't it feel like there's a bolt or nut in the ear at the
top of the starter where it SHOULD be?!?!?!?!

I spent the past hour feeling around, and where the hole should be
it's just smooth.

Anybody got a picture so I can see where I *should* be finding the bolt or nut? 

I just dug through Richard's parts pics and didn't see one. The Samba
has lots of starters, but nothing so far (still working through them)
that shows the mounting bolts..
