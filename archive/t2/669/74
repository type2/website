Subject: Re: [T2] Broken EZ Out & adventures in replacing the rear 

I have worked as a mechanic for forty years and I
can't say anything good about a easy-out, except they
cause pain and heart break. I learned early on to just
drill out the broken studs and such or blow them out
with a torch and re-thread them. Of course this is
just my opinion, some people have good luck with the
damn things.. Phil
