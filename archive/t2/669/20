Subject: It's 80 degrees here in SoCal!

;-)

Just wanted to get your attention. Though that's really how hot it is
here! LoL!!!

(I should note, however, it's below freezing in Denver where I'm
moving soon. Sigh...)

I'm just updating that with all new battery cables and a freshly
charged and tested battery, I still can't get the starter to turn. I'm
going to pull it in a couple hours and take it to be tested (I have to
run an errand first). It's a bummer because that starter was put in by
the guy I bought the bus off of right before he sold it to me. It's a
new, not rebuilt, Bosch. :( Of course I didn't think to get the
receipt from him, but I think it would be out of warranty anyway.

It's probably just the solenoid but I dunno if I'll be able to find
one around here. I'll try though.
