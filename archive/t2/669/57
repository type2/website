Subject: Fuel over tranny

I had this fuel leak I told you about. When trying to drain the fuel tank, a
huge amount of fuel ran over the right side of the tranny. Can this do some
harm? Can the fuel be mixed with the oil in the tranny - which I refreshed
two weeks ago...
The tranny now shines like new anyway ;-)
