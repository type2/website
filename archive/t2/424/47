WET SILICONE #T75112

A unique combination of silicone and oil which lubricates, protects and

leaves surfaces coated with a never dry residual film. Forms a thin flexible

film that seals out moisture and corrosion. Restores body, moisture and life

to dried out rubber surfaces. Lengthens the life of weather stripping and

seals.  >>
