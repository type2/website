Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering August 8-10

Hello All,

This should be a Friday post, however I was out.  Please forgive.

Dixie Bus is shaping up to be the most expensive campout you have ever
attended.  It seems I took for granted the relationship I had with the host
camp.  I am unable to negotiate any rates.  So here is the skinny on what to
really expect.

$20 per night per bus, water and electric.

The logo I have selected for a possible t-shirt is a 6 color design, and
expensive....$20 per shirt.

I am forced to put out an offering jar to help cover expenses.  Bah Humbug.  I
want the band to camp free, I would like to compensate the band, and the chili
may be rather pricey.  However after this negative note, we may not have
nearly the turn out we normally get, so the chili may not be that big.

I have some door prizes donated by Snoopy of the Full Moon Bus Club..Thanx
Snoopy!!

I could really use a head count of who may expect to make the trip, chili
supplies you know.  and if you think you want a shirt, hit the reply button, I
need to know this week.

I am really down about the way this event has unfolded.  But I am determined
to have those who come, have a great time!!!!

Thank you for your time.



Kind Regards,
