Hey doc,

Jamie Rivers sells the best hitches, if you can wait a few weeks it is worth it.
He sells them for $150 US and worth every penny, I have them on both my buses
and can attest to the quality.

Hello,

I want to install a trailer hitch on my 73 Westy to pull a light trailer.

Does anyone have any suggestion and or one for sale?  I would gladly buy the
bumper too if it helps, mine is pretty funky looking.

Thanks, Andrea
