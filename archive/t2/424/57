Subject: Armor All or Not at All - was Rubber

I would need to see fact based reports on that...all I have heard about
those types of products is near urban legend status from doing numerous
internet searches...I am sure applying armor-all to your dash or vinyl top
on a weekly basis is liable to do more damage via UV rays then say applying
it once or twice a year. I think maybe we are talking a case of over
use/abuse of the product. If you are going to apply it that liberally and as
often it would be good to switch to something with UV protection like 303
Aerospace Protectant.

Just my two cents based on 15 years of detailing cars....

Scott

I think you'll find that silicone is the main ingredient in Armor All. I was
told
this over 20 years ago by a professional vinyl top replacement specialist.
People
spray Armor All on tops and it looks all shiny for awhile but long term it
sucks the
oils out of the petroleum products (vinyl, rubber, etc.).
