Hi David,

Thanks for the info.

I just want an engine that won't run lean and cook my valves. I figured 
that since european T4 engines were sold with solexes that someone on 
this list would know the "stock" configuration I'm trying to recreate.

Eventually I want to FI this engine but for now the dual-carbs will get 
the bus back on the road.

Happy trails,
