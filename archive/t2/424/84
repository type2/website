While there might be truth to some of this...there is no doubt that the
manufacturers use different processing and percentage of inert ingredients
that can make one brand of 30 weight different from another brand. As far as
that is concerned, I know they are different and as long as they meet the
certified guidelines they can put whatever they want in it.

2. to imply that a brand switch will cause harm might imply that there
are major differences between the brands. however they are all
certified by the same tests, so they must perform similar.
