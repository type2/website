Subject: EMPI muffler installation

I'm getting ready to replace the shot glass pack muffler on my bus with an
EMPI #00-3442-0, a direct replacement for a #3439.  It didn't come with
bolts for mounting, so I'm off in a few minutes for those and for some
hi-temp silicone to coat the gasket.

Is anyone who's on-line at the moment familiar with this particular muffler?
A few questions...

1. I'm assuming that the two clamps are intended to fasten the muffler (via
the bracket on the back center) to the manifold pipes.  Not a problem, but
I'm not too thrilled with using a hose clamp (included with muffler), when
the bracket seems to be designed for use with a bolt of some sort.

There's a band that clamps around the manifold pipe, the bolt that holds
that clamp tight, and the hose clamp that's apparently for holding the
muffler bracket to the band.  Right?

I was thinking about drilling one end of the slot in the bracket a tad
bigger so that I can slide the bolt head into the slot.  Good idea?

2. I've been advised to use hi-temp (red) silicone sealer on both sides of
the gasket.  I also plan on wire brushing all contact surfaces on the
manifold before installing the new muffler.  Good ideas?

I am SO glad for the expertise on this list!  Thanks.
