Subject: RE: [T2] cover on the side of the bench seat?

Elijah,

I'm right there with ya.  I've got two 76's.  The one bus, I
remember my father packing me up and taking me to the dealership
when he bought it new in Alaska in late 75.  It never had the kick
panel on the side of the two seat bench.  Nor did any of the others
that I remember. (two others).  I DO think that a kick panel would
look good there though and I do not understand why they were not
included.  Let me know if you find a source for these as I think
they would definately add to the overall interior.
