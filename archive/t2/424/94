Subject: Dead Wipers!

Hi Folks,

I just finished a 1,000mi trip from Boston, MA to Asheville, NC, in my 1979 
Westy, and my wipers died on my way into Asheville this afternoon.  The 
motor works, and the arms move -- IF they aren't down on the windshield.  As 
soon as I put them on the glass, however, the motor runs but the arms do not 
move.  I pulled the stereo and the glovebox and felt around underneath, and 
managed to tighten a bolt or two that seemed to attach to the wiper motor 
and gearbox, but still had no luck.

My question is, is there anything else that can be tightened or adjusted 
with the wiper rack in place?  It looks like a mahor PITA to get it out, 
especially given all the wiring under the dash.  It seems like something 
just loosened up, but I can't rule out that one of the wiper motor gears it 
just too worn to overcome the friction of both wipers on the windshield.

Any suggestions or solutions are greatly appreciated.....
