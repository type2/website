Steph,
 When I serviced video games we had some silicone stuff that we treated the
rubber bumpers on pinball machines with...it worked nicely. I had also used
it on the rubber seals of my Ford Maverick. It is a silicone gel lubricant.

Hi Everyone,

Is there anything out there on the market to refurbish existing rubber on my
van?
