There've been a few photo essays on them in the antique/classic car mags...
Quite the 'lash-up'...With parts from whatever's at hand to keep 'em 
rollin'...
Tho' the oddest I've seen (in photos, at least) is the Duesenberg that made
it to Russia and stayed and stayed...Still in use, but baling wired and 
patched
almost beyond recognition. An interesting aside, one aficionado group tried
to purchase it and restore it, but another group argued that it should just
be put in a museum 'as is'...
Another mag "Practical Classics" runs photos of 'found' autos worldwide...
Everything from Alvis to VW in the oddest places...With the obligatory 
shot of the hulk sitting in a barn/shed with the tree growing in the 
doorway...
