I'm a fan of the Petronix II with the matching high output coil. The
Petronix II has an active dwell feature that assures the coil is fully
saturated at all rpms, thereby delivering maximum spark at all
conditions.

I think most problems with electronic ignitions comes from them being
fried from incorrect installation or from leaving the key in the "on"
position without the engine running.

So, now I'm looking at getting either pertronix or compu-fire.
