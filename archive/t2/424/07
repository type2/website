My philosophy is always rule out the easiest, cheapest
possibility first...So, first, try to adjust the wing
nut on the tranny end of the clutch cable. Adjust it
way out, like almost to the end. Then put the bus in
gear (parking brake OFF) and try to turn the engine
over with your hands or a wrench on the gen pully nut.
If the bus tries to move or creep as you turn the
engine over, then you have found your problem, just
re-adjust the clutch cable til you find that happy
place where it neither slips out of gear no crunches
or grinds going into gear.
If you do this, and the bus still does not to be
engaging in gear, then look elswhere.
