Subject: hot wiring? 

i'm having some ignition switch troubles on my 70westie. i shorted 
out one of the wires, and i guess inreturn it fried the electronic 
end of my switch. so anyways..as i'm waiting for a new part to come 
in, i was wanting to find out how i can simply hotwire her so that i 
can get to work these next couple of days. can someone please help?
thanks for your time, -Chris
