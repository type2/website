Subject: Wipers won't park

My wipers in my '70 Westy work fine, as far as the actual wiping goes, 
but when I switch them off, they just slow to a stop any old place.  I 
have to fiddle with the switch until I can get them to stop at the 
bottom.

How does the 'park' feature work?  Is it internal, inside the motor 
itself?  Can it be repaired?

THANKS!
