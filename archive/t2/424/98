Subject: Can't hold your oil?

I have a '73 Type-2 that has just recently begun to spew ALL KINDS of oil!! 
If I fill the crankcase and then let the engine idle it holds oil just fine. 
However, just taking it for a quick test drive of about 4 blocks will be
sufficient time and length to throw most of the oil out.  I have tried to
isolate where the oil is coming from and the best that I can ascertain is from
the left portion of the upper block.  
 
I had recently put in a new alternator and in doing so I replaced the bottom
support bracket (bottom pivot bolt for the alt) due to massive wear on the
bolt holes.  The bolts that hold the bracket to the block were pretty much
useless.  So I re-tapped the threads and put in new bolts.  Unfortunately,
while tapping, I accidentally bored into the crankcase (just barely....up
where the dipstick is) and therefore I couldn't put the dipstick back in (I
made another dipstick out of thinner wire [i.e. clothes hanger]).  So, to make
a long story short, I went ahead and attached about a 3-inch piece of rubber
hose to the end of the dipstick neck and then on the other end of the hose I
put a bolt, and then tightened them both up.  This was just so that oil
wouldn't leak from where the dipstick would normally be.  However, I am
thinking that this is causing too much pressure in the crankcase because I
don't believe that the dipstick was an air-tight seal, and once my RPMs get
high enough, all my oil is being forced out.
 
Does this sound right? Does anyone have a better idea on where I should start
troubleshooting this?  Would closing off the dipstick neck (airtight) cause
behavior like this? Or does this sound like a problem with the PVC?  Any help
would be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
Roman
