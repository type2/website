Figured that might happen.

arrangement.  It has been like that on my van for a month now without any
ill effect but I will go back and install a rubber muffler strap U clamped
to the tail pipe end and the bumper mounting bolt, soon.

I'll drill out that slot at one end so I can slide a bolt head into it,
then.

Yes, $39.00 is a good price.
