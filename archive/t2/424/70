Subject: Oil: Iis my dad full of it??

Listees....

The saga continues. Bought an 82 Westy in texas and it's under the care of 
my father. Scary. The previous owner has always used P*nnzoil in it...and of 
course i've always used Castrol in my VWs. My father is going to have the 
oil changed before the trip....yes scary...and he says that we have to stick 
with P*nnzoil as switching to another brand will burn the engine up.

Is this just like a rumor that swiching brands is bad or is there some truth 
to it?? Can anyone explain why it wouldn't hurt the engine to switch to 
Castrol?

Thanks,
Daniel
