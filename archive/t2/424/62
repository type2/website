Had a similar one on a 1600 engine and although I thought I kept the rust at
bay with plenty of Hi-Temp paint, it was the internal rust at the seams that
did it in within a year... ;-(
I've wondered if it's the closeness of the engine to the muffler that contrib-
utes to the shorter life span of VW mufflers... Most other vehicles have a
length of exhaust pipe before the muffler (some longer, some shorter than
others), but the VW muffler gets it almost direct from the 2 and 4 cylinders.
