Subject: Re: [T2] EMPI muffler installation

Hi Volks,

I've had 2 Empi mufflers on my bus.

The first was a header-style pipe ending with a short muffler. This was 
cheap ($200cdn new) and had a nice combination of sound and 
performance. The muffler lasted a year before it rotted through. The 
garage that sold it to me then replaced the muffler section with 
another in good condition from one with a busted set of pipes for $50. 
The second time around they fabricated a hanger bracket to support it 
and it lasted a year or so longer.

(I had forgotten how crusty that engine was. How embarrassing!)

The second was a dual-pipe muffler that I picked up near-new and unused 
for $100cdn. It looked great and sounded terrific. It lasted about 6 
months before it spit a tailpipe off. That includes 3 months of winter 
storage, btw. After I replaced it with a stock style pipe I noticed 
that the strain of supporting the EMPI dual exhaust has cracked my head 
exchanger just ahead of the flange.

Anyway, that's my EMPI experience. I think I'll stick to Leistritz next 
time, or go with something stock style in stainless steel.


Happy trails,
