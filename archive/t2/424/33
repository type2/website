They will work as is, but if you really want to jet them optimally for fuel mileage, I would go with the following:

132.5 main
170 Air Correction

For a very safe-running engine that gets lousy mileage, try:

137.5 main
155 Air Correction

132.5 mains are not a common size but are available.  130 and 137.5 are more widely available because they were "stock" sizes.
170 Air Corrections are on the large side, to offset the increased displacement.
