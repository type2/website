Okay...  I think I know what you're talking about.  Butyl rubber 
sealant.  You can find it at your local builder's supply or glass shop. 
I don't remember the brand name, but there's one brand that's way better 
than the 'home-owner's' grade. Comes in a yellow tube. (Caulking gun 
size.) Sikaflex? Google Butyl rubber sealant and you'll probably find it.
