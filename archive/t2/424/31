Subject: Re: [T2] cover on the side of the bench seat?

> A somewhat related question I wanted to post separately is whether or
 not there is a cover on the side of the bench seat legs.  My bus does
 not have this but I wonder if it was removed.  I saw it on a bus on ebay
 a few weeks ago and it caught my attention.  I looked at the microfiche
 diagrams and saw it only on the fold down seat so I was confused.  Look:

 If somebody could explain this I would appreciate it.  If this is
 something I need for my 76 bench seat and can help me out with then pmail.

Well......the part is NLA on ETKA.  So I went looking in my 68-71 parts book.
2 were offered in 2 colors for 2+ models......but I do not know when they stopped. My book goes to Dec 71.

221 883 891B for models 221, 225, 241; M13 [M13 is front bench seat]
8/67 - ?        043 grey black
8/67 - 7/70   86X brown
This part has a * in front of the description 'Trim plate - bench seat, front' which means USA market.

224 883 891 for models 224, 228, 244  [these are right hand drive buses]
8/67 - ?        043 grey black
8/67 - 7/70   86X brown

I have never seen one..... except on split buses. The drawing in my 68-71 parts book is different than the one
pictured on the website and etka. The one on the website appear to have rolled ends to go around the legs. The
parts book shows it appearing to have two top hooks and one bottom hook to snap into place.
