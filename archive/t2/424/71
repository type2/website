Well, Bob, things just did not work out on this one . . .

This was a '76 Safare that was stored inside a heated garage for the past 14 
years.  A two owner vehicle.

Obviously, it had very low original miles, came from California, and was 
absolutely rust free.

Some of the good things with the Safare was a 'furnace' that you would light 
off when camping.  Ran off the propane, same as the two burner stove.


All this is as of 1989, when the Safare high top was put in the garage:  Air 
conditioning, electric refrig (two batteries), stove, and furnace heater all 
working.  Engine running fine.

No oil spots in the garage at all.  White floor.


Interior is immaculate for the age.  It is all there and the fabric seats 
were like new, even both front seats; no dry rot at all.  The wood did need 
to be refinished, and the plastic edgings were brittle with age, but all the 
cabinetry, including the funny round push button handles were all OK.

It even had a portable hanging stainless steel 8 quart water pot that you 
could fill with drinking water and it would hang over the sink, and you just 
opened the spout to get a cup of water.


I have come pictures at home.  You would see ORIGINAL paint that only needed 
a bit of polish (remember, no rust?!?!.  OK, some speckles of rust on the 
front bumper, but probably came because of stone chips and probably the 
original paint on the bumpers!!)

Most remarkable was the front spare tire that has the ORIGINAL tire cover 
that has the company's name that made the  Safare (in California)  It is 
like NEW!!!   I have a picture.


It has the Safare label on the rear turtle top, and it has a small skylight 
in the turtle top with a fan  to exhaust the air thru the screened 
skylight!!.

All cushions there and even the special cup holder that fits into an 
aluminum fitting on the dash so you can  hold two cups.  Same butcher block 
material as all the rest of the Safare

Oh, yes, it even has the REAL butcher block that fits over the sink for 
cutting food stuffs.


The curtains are not original, but were made by the current owners wife, 
just before it was put in the garage.

It has a trailer hitch the the original owner installed and used to tow a 
jon boat.

What else??  As a California '76, the cat converter is needed.  This has the 
cat converter, and the crossover pipe, and very acceptable heat exchangers,  
and NO HOLES under the battery (passenger side, I did not look under the 
driver side battery.)


Well, I guess the price at $750 WAS a bit steep, so I guess I will pass on 
this one.


Some kids put $200 down and are scheduled to pick it up tomorrow, Wednesday.


Maybe if they don't come, I will try to get the owner down a couple of 
hundred, and I could use you help them.

Bob, thanks for the offer.

Mike Werner, you know the REAL story . . .. Thanks for your help today...  
Tell Jimmy to offer him $1500!!!  If the owner bites (Mr. Integrety), I'll 
come up with the greens....
