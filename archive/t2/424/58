My guess is that they're gonna turn up a red flag at the Motor Vehicle Dept.
computer when/if he tries to register it. IIRC, a guy I knew bought an Alfa
Romeo in NJ that came from Canada. He thought it was a great deal, 'til
he took the title to MV and the little old lady behind the counter handed 
him back the title..."No" was about the gist of the conversation...
