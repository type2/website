Wow, weird coincidence, I'm going through the same thing. I'm finally
getting my '79 bus fixed after a long saga which involved replacing

both heads last summer.  I took the bus to (another) mechanic and it 
looks like the heads are shot after <1000 miles.  I am getting the same 
low compression readings you are and thought my gauge was wacked, too.  
A leakdown test shows 80% leakage (!)  The mechanic just got the heads 
off Friday and said they leak like a seive (pouring solvent in, it all 
drains right out, as the valves are not sealing).  I don't have the 
boom, but had the same starting & idling problems (which will happen 
when the compression sucks so bad).

My suggestion to you: get a leakdown test done and see if your heads are OK.
