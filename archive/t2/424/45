I can't find the picture I took of the putty but it goes in corners where
the frames meet. It was applied logically in places where water could run
after assembly and installation.

I looked up Jim's suggestion, Butyl rubber sealant and it says it provides
excellent adhesion to Aluminum. It's also available in aluminum grey colors
so I'm confident that it's the same if not extremely similar.
