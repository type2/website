Subject: 78 Westy Interior

Were there different interior scenarios available?  I am looking at a 78
Westy, it has an icebox, not an electric fridge, it doesn't have a stove...I
thought by the late 70, these items were standard.

Also, who knows what this in line gasoline heater is all about.  It is under
the bus, it has it's own exhaust pipe and all.  It is not any of the BN** I
have read about.

Just wondering....

Kind Regards,
