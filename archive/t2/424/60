Actually, I think its the other way around. If you use it religiously it will
probably keep a good seal. But, when you stop using it and it starts to break down it
will eventually cause cracking. One of the reasons vinyl tops have lost their
popularity in recent years is probably because so many were destroyed by ignorant
owners and once they go bad they look horrible. There are probably some good products
on the market now but as long as people continue to misuse Armor All there will
always be urban legends so I always err on the side of caution. Soap and water and
talcum powder for vinyl and rubber.
