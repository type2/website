Subject: Bus Depot Electricity is Out

Our shop's power is out due to a storm. This has shut down our phones,
and is preventing us from returning email addressed to the shop.
However, the website is still up and running, as it is hosted remotely.
Also, we are continuing to ship orders (by flashlight). 

We close in 90 minutes anyway, so if power isn't restored by then, I'm
sure it will be up by morning. Sorry for any inconvenience.
