Subject: Carb Question

I've got a buddy that hasn't made the jump to computers yet, so I am
emailing for him.  He has a 74 1.7L with a single Weber carb.  The bus takes
a bit to start and sputters and diesels when you shut it off.  We took the
air cleaner off of the top of the carb and there was quite a bit of gas
pooled in the top of the carb.  When he tries to start it the carb shoots
gas out of the top and doesn't really want to rev quickly.  The engine idles
at 900 and the timing is dead on, but when you give it gas it acts like it
is flooding.  We had just changed the points and he fired it up to time it
and we had one good backfire and the problem started shortly thereafter.
I'm at a loss as to where to go now.  I don't know much about carbs.

TIA,
