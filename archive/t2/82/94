Subject: Re: Paint Question

Now lets think about the logic here.

- How much rust under paint is needed to absorb the oil?
- What if I am painting an area with many small rust spots? Am I supposed to
paint each individual spot and not let it overlap onto the bare metal?

In other words this is nonsense. The "oil" you refer to is a chemical
(usually phosphoric acid) which changes iron oxide (rust) into iron
phosphate which is very hard and inert (non reactive to oxygen in this
case).

Tell yout FLAPS guy his he has his head up his tailpipe :)
