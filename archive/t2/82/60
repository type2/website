Subject: Re:Paint question

Hello list,

"... The top coat is acting funny.  It's sorta making spider web-like
patterns in some areas.  These
webs are slightly raised above the rest of the paint, almost as if the paint
is wrinkling; a funny looking bubble... "

    Let me jump in on this one.  The last time I had the engine out of our
71 I decided to paint the apron and wound up with the same sort of thing.
It really got me aggrivated  because here I was, trying to make things look
better and I made it look  worse.  So THEN I decided to read the
instructions.  You know what "They" say....If nothing else works, try
following the directions.  Lo and behold I found my problem right on the
label for the primer.  It said to make sure and apply the color coat within
2 hours or wait 3 days.  You guessed it, I put the color on about 4 hours
after the primer.
    So my advice is to read the instructions before trying to fix the
problem, or you may wind up with the same thing again.
