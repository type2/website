Hi Adam,
     I bought one several years ago from "  The Bus Stop"  now "Rocky Mountain Motor Works" . They have a tach and a holder that fit
the blank clock panel in a bay perfectly.

New used, whatever to fill the dead spot on the instrument cluster.  Tach preferred.  Let me know if any one has one they can part
with or point me in the right direction.
