Nick,

Did Bugformance come up with a solution to your problem?

Couple of thoughts:

a) i had heard a few years back from a honda mechanic (i believe)
	that using the silicon grease on your ignition parts
	is really unnecessary and can even be bad.  This contrary
	to the fact that silicon grease is still packaged with said
	parts!

b) check, re-check, and re-check again that you're spark plug wires
	are going to the right place -- this gets me every time

c) compression test -- make sure you don't have a burnt valve

d) inspect plugs (are you running rich?  lean?) and check plug gaps
	this might give you information on what the problem is, or,
	you might find (as i did) that one of my plug gaps was off
	(luckily, I figured this out before i burned a valve)

e) verify dwell with dwell meter

f) verify ignition/fuel-system wires are all firmly attached.  sometimes
	your wire will be "attached" but not making a good connection
	because the connector is too big for the spade you're connecting
	to.  Just take a pair of needle-nose pliers to the connector
	to make it a bit tighter and you'll be glad you did.

Otherwise:  is it only missing at high-rpm, or all the time?
