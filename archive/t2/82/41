Subject: Re: [T2] Which is more desirable

If your looking for a one word answer it's simple. "42" now that that is
out of the way I feel like expanding :) By desirable are we talking
money? If so, i am surprised how sometimes people are giving mostly good
busses away and other people are asking waaaaay too much for rust
buckets. It really seems to depend on the conditions at the time. By
desirable is that usefullness? The westys have come in so many
configurations that one is bound to help you out. And if you can't find
what you want, there are enough pieces/parts of busses out there to make
your own. 

Whatever you drive, there aren't many vehicles that you can own which
would make complete strangers come up to you in a gas station and ask
about it. They usually have a story also, such as used to own one etc.
All of these and many more make each and every one desirable. The
community associated w/ these vehicles also make it more fun to own and
old bus. (good people, willing to help, unique). 

One other thing is the technology of the bus. The later in bus
production the more current the tech on the bus. For example, (i think
it's 73) disk brakes made it onto the front of the bus. I like this
feature. Also Fuel Injection was also introduced and increasingly larger
engines to handle moving that behemouth through the air. In westys I
feel that the layout of the interior got better w/ later years, but that
is a completely personal opinion. Now with older busses you lose things
like the FI & disc brakes, but some people would rather have the older
busses because they are more familiar (mechanically) with those. Plus
the older busses do IMHO seem to have just a little bit more character
than their younger brothers.

If you are looking at three particular busses, post what you know about
them, such as concerns about a particular thing. I'm sure many people
will pipe up :)
