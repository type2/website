Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum lines on 2 Liter


Thanks to Joey Armsworthy, who not only sent me the answer on this that
I needed, but sent along a nice diagram of all the hoses. For the
archive this is how things are. There is a reason there are different
vacuum hose bibbs, they are connected as different circuits. On one
(the small hose) the throttle, dist, & air cleaner connect to the same
circuit. The larger line hooks the decel valve, fuel regulator and
manifold together. Armed w/ this knowledge i shall no go forth and
conquor what's left of the install :)
