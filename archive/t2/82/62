Subject: DOT 5

read an article on DOT 5 brake fluid that said it is
like a teflon base instead of the glycol base 4. more
expensive but higher boiling point temp and doesnt
absorb water. Said you need to completely purge your
brake sys. before changing over but it is better for
"all" brake systems.
 Any experts out there that could expand on this?
