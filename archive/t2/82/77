Scott,

Mr. Bartnik has been kind enough to provide an excellent article for this
procedure in the library. check it out at http://type2.com/bartnik/pushrod.htm

its really quite easy.

the only thing i can add is to make sure you do this with a COLD engine.
the rocker arms & pushrods can get very hot. (ask me how i know)

good luck,
