Subject: Re:Aux. Heater Blower - BN4-Powercat

Al and listees,
    While I haven't used a blower purchased from Bluebird Custom
Manufacturing, I had one that looked just like it and moved the same amount
of air, in our last bus.  I can tell you that the blower I had moved plenty
of air and was a big help with heating and defrosting, it also was noisy and
you could feel vibrations from it in the floor in front of the passenger's
seat.  I  don't know if their unit will do the same thing or not.
    Most folks get the Atwood marine inline bilge blower.  From what I've
seen, it runs quieter and smoother than the unit I had.
