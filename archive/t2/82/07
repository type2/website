Subject: RE: [T2] So what does this mean for parts?

So maybe EV parts may become reasonable (but made
in Mex or Brazil)?

VW VAN PARTS FORMULAS

Bus Parts= Reasonable price for the item + $10
shipping and handling + a 1-12 week wait

Vanagon Parts= Reasonable price for the item x 3
+ $45 + $10 shipping and handling + a 1-24 week
wait.

Eurovan Parts= Double the cost of vanagon parts
plus 1-12 month wait.
