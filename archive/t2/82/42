Wow what a response. Thanks so much. Here is a little ( and I mean little
) more to go on. All are the same price. I have a new motor in my 74 Bug
to use.

70 Westy - No motor, new top, rusted dog legs, dent on front face
78 Westy - Exterior Fair, Interior good, motor leaking (-at-) rear Seal, no
fuel pump = not running
74 Sportsmobile - Straight up pop top, body & interior low end of fair,
ignition key missing = not running

Thanks again,
Jim
