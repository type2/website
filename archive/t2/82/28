Subject: Re: [T2] lOOKING FOR A STOCK TACH OR CLOCK FOR A 70 TRANSPORTER

I put a small Autometer tach in my '71 clock spot by taking out the
sheetmetal filler for the clock and cutting the sheetmetal just large enough
for the tach to grab onto. Looks almost completely stock. I prefer the
Autometer to the VDO because their products seem to be more substantially
made (and made in America). If you want to use VDO, the adaptor from RMMW
would save you the labor of cutting the clock blank.



New used, whatever to fill the dead spot on the instrument cluster.  Tach
preferred.  Let me know if any one has one they can part with or point me in
the right direction.
