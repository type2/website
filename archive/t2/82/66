Subject: Re: [T2] DOT 5

As previous replies have said, this a "do not do".

DOT 5 is a totally different fluid to DOT 3, DOT 4, or DOT5.1, the
difference will eat your seals away (though slowly in a car system, the
subject is more urgent in MTB disk brake systems with far less seal mass to
be eaten away, happens quite quickly in a MTB) (NB: As you would have worked
out, MTB disk brakes were what I investigated the matter for, a hydraulic
closed system which needed DOT 5.1, and hearing the horror stories of people
who thought that there was no difference between DOT 5 & DOT 5.1, TOTALLY
different fluid. )

The higher boiling point will make little difference in a car (BUS) system,
unless you're running a racing Porsche or whatever where you're cooking the
fluid all the time, it was mainly introduced for high performance motorbikes
with a low volume brake system, but high brake temperature expectations.
That being said, if you want the higher boiling point, go to a Honda shop &
get DOT 5.1, that is compatible with DOT 4.

Hope this is of use.
