Subject: Gas leak

Hi all. I've been lurking for a few months but this is my first post to
the list. I've got an 80 Vanagon that has a gas leak. It appears the
leak is in the overflow tank n the drivers side. The leak seems to be
coming from where one of the lines fit into the tank. Any ideas how to
fix this? Thanks in advance for the help.
