We sell the tach, too (from VDO), for less money of course.   But the
ring/holder is no longer available (from Motorworks or from us), as the
vendor discontinued it.  However, you can still cut the blank plate in your
dash and hot-glue the tach in, with very good results. Would have been
easier with the ring, but can be done without it.   (Incidentally, if anyone
has found something that works in place of that discontinued ring/holder for
the VDO gauge, I'd love to hear about it.)
