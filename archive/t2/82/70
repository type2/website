Subject: Paint Question

Hi,

I think your problem might not be the quality of the paint, but what you 
used as a base.  You mentioned that you sanded the rusty spots down to bare 
metal and then used por 15 (which is a rust converter) on the bare metal and 
then painted overtop of it, right?  Well a while ago I was talking to some 
guy at my local flaps and he said that rust converting paint (of any 
manufacture) should only be used on rust because there are special oils in 
it that are supposed to seep into the rust to "convert" it and if there 
isn't any rust there to convert then the oil will just sit there on top of 
your paint.  I am not too sure about that one, but it seems to make sense to 
me since the spider designs in the paint you described sounded like they 
were caused by oil underneath....  who knows, just wanted to toss my $.02 in 
there.  Good luck!
