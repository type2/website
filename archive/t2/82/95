Wow... airtight, that's the ticket!  I think this
weekends project will be to duct tape my entire bus
and close off all those pesky little air leaks :-)
Around all the doors and windows, no vent hole left
uncovered!

That should generate all the heat I need...  hmmm,
come to think of it my freezer is air tight too ;-)

Gosh, I'm going to have to rethink this!  Back to the
drawing board.  

Wait, I hear Hanford is shutting down their reactor...
Maybe I can pick it up cheap!  My ex-fiance's dad is a
nuclear engingeer and I think he can help me rig up
something.  Where to get new fuel rods... Hey, anyone
know if the former soviet union has compatible reactor
fuel? That and what grade concrete should one use to
enclose a small reactor?  If this works I can claim
the ultimate engine conversion/heater system on the
list!!!  Woohooo!!!

Irreverently,
Brian
