Subject: Second Battery

I bought the Hella second battery kit from Ron (about
$20) but the directions are vague enough as to leave
me clueless on how to successfully wire a second
battery (Deep Cycle)into the bus for use while camping



Hey Al

I have been using a battery isolator on my 67 Sundial
camper for many yeary without any concerns at all. I
also have a 79 Westy with factory second battery setup
and it too works as it should. The deep cycle second
battery runs my fridg and I have wired the radio
direct to the second battery. The actual wiring is
pretty simple and maybe someone out there has the
wiring already drawn out for you, anyone-anyone

If you need any help, let me know.
