I painted my bus from rattle cans and anyone who sees it can tell you
while it isn't factory new it is better than anyone would expect.

now I was almost forced to do this as it was my daily driver, so I did one
panel at a time. 

the difference was that I used high quality auto paint, same as used for
touch up work.

now have bright white over metalic blue 78 bus.  never like any of the
later stock colors .

so I suspect your problem has more to do with the "cheap" part of the
equation....use quality paint.....I used a Duplicolor paint if I recall.
