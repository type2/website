Subject: Looking for a Wiper Motor for a 74

Hi all,

I'm looking for a working wiper motor for a 74 Westy.

My current one is well, dead, and it's asked me kindly to take it out and
let it rest.

I can find a bunch of other years, but I can't find mine.  If anyone has one
that's for sale, please let me know.

Thanks,

Stephanie
