Subject: BBB VI wow

   We just recieved the ultimate auction prize. A limited edition 60's
BARBIE, this is a must have for all you bus people. This doll along with a
HAND MADE BUS QUILT by Melissa Jess and from SNAP-ON Tools we got the evr
needed grub screw socket, a 11mm flare open end wrench for those brake lines
and bleeder screws and a FULL SET of ratchet box end metric wrenchs. This is
just the beginning of our AUCTION  items and again is NOTHING compared to
what we have in our raffles which includes 2 not 1 rebuilt split bus
transmissions and a complete REBUILT TURN KEY 1600 engine with new crank,
cam, and lifters and everything else remanufactured. Hope this gives a
little more incentive for those that were just THINKING of coming
