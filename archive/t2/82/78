Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky pushrod tubes


Joel,

There was one thing "left out" of the procedure....when I did mine, I
expected to be able to just push the tubes back in to the holes.


No way!  I tried everything, but the angle and depth that you are working
at makes it difficult.  I found a socket that i tested to clear the walls
on the head, but still provide a godd surface to the push rod tube.

I then used a few light taps of a rubber mallet on the socket with a long
extension to get them back in....they are very tight.....they have not
leaked a bit since then.

Cheers, dave
