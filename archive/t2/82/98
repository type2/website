Subject: Re: [T2] Sewing - 

Barry-

My wife uses a treadle powered Singer for EVERYTHING she sews, which is a
lot of stuff. I use an older Necci machine myself, and we also have 4 or 5
others for special purposes.
The point of this is that, as a once-upon-a-time tailor, I can tell you that
sewing is not all that hard. But, just like working on the mechanicals of a
bus, it takes some time and practice to get good at it. Remember to add at
least a half-inch on all sides as a seam allowance. (Ask me how I know.) I
might suggest that you start with something a little easier than seat
covers, though. They can be tough due to the curved corners and odd angles.
Maybe a set of curtains or a cover for the bed cushion (square!) would be a
good place to start. At any rate, go for it. Sewing is one of the skills
that I'm prouder to have; it has endless uses.

Regards,
Dave
