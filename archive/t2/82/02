So are there any other Electrical Engineers out there in List land?  I'd like to hear from a few on this whole dual battery issue.  With that said, if you get more than 1 EE involved in a technical discussion, there WILL be disagreements. 

I've actually done a lot of work with batteries for automotive use.  I spent a couple years consulting with GM on their Saturn electric car program in Southern Cal, so I probably know a bit about automotive electrical systems that the general VW public may not know.  I'd be willing to join in a discussion about dual batteries, but I don't want to get involved in any ego-based arguments concerning electrical theory.  It would be nice if all the EE's on the list could come up with a consensus opinion that we all could benefit from.

There are a lot of misconceptions, old wive's tales, tall stories, etc. on electricity in general.  It would be nice to clear things up a bit.
