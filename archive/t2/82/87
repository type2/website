OK---Here's the solution to sewing a straight line---even on an ole
treadle machine---

Go to a store, or singer sewing center, and they have a magnetic plate
that you can lay along side the foot of the machine, and when you run
the material through the machine--it keeps it straight going into the
needle---works good--I used one of these to make my Wal-Mart orange
curtains---

Later,

I got my mother's old Singer sewing machine a-working. The belt is new,
and this old treadle machine will stitch through just about anything I
can get under its foot. 
Now, here's a great source for material; WalMart!! 
I picked up some solid vinyl for $3.77/yard, and some decent upholstery
fabric for $4.97/yard. Reasonable prices for end of role materials. They
had quite a few varieties of vinyl, and I picked up the solid,
fabric-backing type of dark brown vinyl. 
But I still cannot sew a straight line, so I plan to measure twice, cut
once, and sew as many times as I need to get it right. (seat covers, if
you were curious..)
