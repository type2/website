since the last email, I went and inspected my 1974 California Westfalia,,,
and found that it has the bent wire hinge bolted in place where the other
style is built for.

The body has a wide notch and 2 holes per side to accommodate the early
hinge.
The hatch door has the bent wire hinges that bolt in to only 1 hole per
side, leaving the other hole empty.

You can see the wide notch beside the hinge on my 74 with apparently a
78ish door

I have a 78 that I just looked at ,, and it does NOT have the wide notch
on the body,

It appears as though you can interchange the late door on the early body,,
but probably not the early door on the late body unless you want to do
some welding or other fabricating to make the hinges fit.
