Subject: 78 starter

So on my recent trip to the East Coast I had starter issues.  Once my bus got
hot and I turned it off it wouldn't start unless I tapped on the solenoid.  So
I would crawl around underneath with a small hammer and tap tap tap - then it
would start right up.

I'm hoping that I can jack up my bus and pull off the rear wheel and pull my
starter without pulling the motor (My new Bentley seems to imply that this is
possible.)  So ... is it possible to buy a new solenoid?  Is it possible to
just clean up my old one and reinstall it?  Is it possible to even pull off
the old solenoid from the starter.  My starter and solenoid only have like
.... 65,000 miles on them but that are 25 years old -
