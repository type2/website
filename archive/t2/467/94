I claim absolutely no expertise on this at all.

I will say, though, that others on the list whose legends approach "Guru" status have said to me on-list and in person that this is just not true, and that the MT-5 is no bueno.

Since there doesn't seem to be anything in writing from a manufacturer about this issue anywhere, myself, I purchased Stalube GL-4 at my local Napa for about $12/gal.

I just bought a new transmission so I'm not EVEN going to take chances.  The GL-4 is agreed upon by everyone to be okay, everything else is in debate, why mess around?
