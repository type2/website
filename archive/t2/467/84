Subject: Holding the long starter bolt

Hi All,
    While speaking about starter replacement Rick G.
said.................
The only trick to re-instaling the starter is to get someone to hold
the long bolt (so it doesn't spin) on the starter end while you
tighten the
nut in the engine compartment. Or hold it place with something really
sticky.

 Another option to keep that bolt from spinning, and being able to
start the nut in the engine compartment by yourself is to make a clip
like the one show in

The long tab of the clip fits up against the head of the bolt, and
keeps it from turning, while the short tab is kept from turning by the
flange on the starter.
