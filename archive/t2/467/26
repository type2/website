My reaction when I first saw the new Microbus was laughter.   Saying that 
its ugly might be an understatement.....................However......I've 
heard much worse statements made regarding baywindows busses, so its almost 
like throwing rocks in a glass house.   The same can be said about the "New 
Beetles" vs the real bugs.  Will I be first in line to buy 
one?........No.......Would I drive one?.......probably........

Actually my number one complaint is the TV screens mounted in the back of 
the seats.....but the TV debate is for another time and different forum....

Mike
