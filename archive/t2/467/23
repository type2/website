Subject: Re: [T2] Engine hatch swap?

My mistake, I misread post, I was thinking the top rear hatch not the
engine.  Sorry....  The engine lid hinges are different over the years 72-79
forgot when they switched but I know 73 and 78 are different.

but can anyone confirm if the top rear hatch is swappable for 64-79?

Now I am just curious.
