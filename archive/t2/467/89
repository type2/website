Subject: Help: Looking for a throttle microswitch for a 1977 VW Van

After years of looking I have just bought a lovely 1977 VW campmobile.  It
was originally sold in 1977 in California and has a 2l engine with a Bosch
L-Jetronic fuel injection system.  The engine runs a treat but under full
load (i.e. when I put my foot down) it stutters a bit and becomes unhappy.
I took it to a mechanic who knows about vw fuel injection systems and he
showed me where there are two wires hanging down near where the throttle
cable reaches the engine, and where there is a piece of the fuel injection
system missing.   He said that this was a 'full throttle switch' and that I
would need to get another one and then the van would run nicely.  So that is
what I have been doing.  Using the internet I have investigated everything
there is about the exact part I need but have been unable to either find it
or get a part number.  I do not know if the part is made anymore or if there
is something similar I could adapt and use instead. (like if the switch was
used on another car...?)

It seems that for one year only and only for Californian models the
'throttle valve switch' (which is sometimes used as a full throttle switch
but sometimes used with more functions) was replaced with something called a
'microswitch' which only had a full throttle function.  I think this is what
I need.  One worry I have about using anything else (i.e. perhaps I could
convert to the system that was used in 1976 or 1978 is that I do not know
what else was different on this 1977 California engine - maybe the ECU
exchange for example??)
