Subject: Best heating options: propane, elec., gas, stock?

I'm at a point finally where I have some money for heat in my bus.
I had originally intended to go stock, as it seemed I could probably do it 
for 200-300 bucks and sweat.
But I read from the list that if everything isn't sealed properly you get 
oily, smelly air.
I don't know how difficult it is to seal properly - is it the perpetual 
search for the pinholes and seams?

Gas heaters seem like more pain and potential problem than its worth.

Portable Propane heaters seem weak and laden with annoyances like 
condensation.

I was wondering about getting a power inverter, wiring it up to a second 
battery, and getting some form of electric space heater. You can get pretty 
decent looking 1500 Watt inverters for about $200, and the space heaters I 
saw went from $40 - $80 (for use up to 200 s.f.)

Anyone have experience using the electric option, or strong advice one way 
or another?

Thanks
Mat
