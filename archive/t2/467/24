Now I am just curious.

Sorta...The outside dimensions of the top hatch are the same, but the cap-
tive nuts in the hatch and the bolt holes in the hinge are spaced differently.
I did use a '71 top hatch on a '79, but had to drill thru' both to get a 
second
nut and bolt on for positioning... Changing the holes made no sense to me
since the impression left by the hinge on both hatches was the same...Only
the holes had changed to prevent old hatches from fitting newer Buses and
vice versa... :-(
