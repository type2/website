Can we really blame VW for giving Americans what they want? VW is in 
the business of making money and in the US that means fully loaded 
cars with lots of bells and whistles. For example the T4 offered in 
the US for the last few years was only available in GLS and MV 
platform powered by a VR6. In Europe (to some extent Canada ) the T4 
was available in an array of trim levels and body options. Europe is 
a very different market than the US. Discuss amongst yourselves.

For example, check out JWB's (you guys remember JWB, right?) T4.

Also check out this T4 on auction at
http://tinyurl.com/rys4 (note, this auction is very suspicious to say 
the least!)

or go to www.ebay.de and poke around.

I just cannot see the Barnes and Nobles parking lot filled with 
stripped down T4s with soccer stickers on the tailgate.

Although the look of the Transporter has changed as well as its 
systems the spirit of the Transporter lives on just not in the US. 
The T4 which has been replaced by the T5 is a platform just as 
versatile as T1, T2 or T3.

BTW, I encourage you to visit www.volkswagen.de and have a look at 
the new VW camper. You can cut to the chase by going here

As for the "New Microbus " round headlights at the very least :)
