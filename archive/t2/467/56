Subject: ...still won't idle cold

Wil,
I agree that the auxiliary air valve and most notably its air supply hose is 
the number one suspect. If there is any leak that allows tramp air between 
the outlet of the AFM and the auxiliary air valve input, then when the air 
valve is doing its job (allowing additional air input to the manifold) it is 
doing so in a manner that this additional air is not properly sensed by the 
AFM, so the control unit doesn't compensate with additional gas, and the 
mixture that gets to the combustion chamber is too lean; therefore no idle. 
So check both ends of the hose that supplies the air valve, and the hose 
itself for a crack.
Roland
