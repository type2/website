Subject: Front End Swap (was Spinning Wheel)

Hey-

After poking around on my funky front axle, I have decided that it is too
far gone to try the weld fix. I do, however, have a good front axle on my
parts bus which leads to my question: Rather than swap only the axles, I am
thinking of simply unbolting the whole front end (suspension, brakes,
steering, ect...) and swapping the whole thing to avoid all of the
disassembly and reassembly. It appears that all that is required is to
disconnect the shift linkage, brake hoses, remove the vacuum brake servo and
connecting rod, and then the four big bolts on each side, swap the whole
puppy, reassemble, and bleed the brakes. Has anyone done this? Thoughts?
Suggestions? Anything I have missed? Any suggestions on how much of the
brakes to remove?

Thanks!

Cheers,
Matthew
