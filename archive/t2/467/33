OTOH, I'm having trouble finding a good cordless drill from the 1960s!  :)

I can't say enough nice things about my 14V Makita cordless drill.  Yes,
it's made of plastic, but it has taken a 15 foot drop onto a concrete
floor without damage.  When doing continuous work, one pack stays on
charge, one pack on the drill, swap when they slow down, work all day.

The good stuff is out there, but you won't find it at WallyWorld or buy it
for $10.
