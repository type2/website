Subject: GAS HEATER

Hello everyone,

I am trying to prepare myself for the dreaded cold months ahead.
I have a gas heater in my 72 van 1800 engine.
There is a switch in the van to turn it on.
I turn on the switch and I can hear the fan blowing and can feel the air
blowing
in under the rear seat but it is not hot air.
Is there a way to test to see if the flame is lit in the gas heater?
should this switch activate the gas heater to start the flame?
It seems that the fan is working, just not getting the hot air.
Your help is always appreciated.
