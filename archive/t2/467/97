For a "G" note just for the seats---
I'd trade the whole Bus in and get some seats that are in better shape-- 

Karl--you are right--these guys are on a bad load of paraquat laden
Peyote weed---

How much could it possibly cost to buy the material--lets say--from the
upper bunk of a toilet Westy--and have the front seats recovered?----200
bucks?????

I know---it's the new foam rubber--and the new piping at the seams
that`s the big dollar item---:>)

PLEEEEESE----

My Daddy told me once that there was an ass for every seat---but this
deal is really ridiculous----

Genuine Albanian Carpathian Mountain Range Yak leather seats with a
vibrator, and lumbar support's in them wouldn't be this expensive---:>)

Later,
