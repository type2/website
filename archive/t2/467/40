Maybe not, maybe so. My Makita 9.6v has been running since 1991. Two 
batteries, one on charge, one in use. Doesn't go very fast but it does 
anything I ask. When I get rich I'll buy a DeWalt or Bosch or Milwaukee. 
Actually I have the Makita for the little work and my big 1/2" Milwaukee 
120v (non-cordless) for the heavy stuff. Yes, nice tools are worth their 
money.
