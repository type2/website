Subject: Re: [T2] microbus/concept cars

Exactly the point I was trying to make......I wasn't really commenting 
on the new van's looks (although I do think it's repulsive) but merely 
on the fact that, unlike the Beetle, unlike the Mini, this is not a 
loving revision of the beautiful original "splittie".  What most VW 
enthusiasts were hoping for was a modern updating of a classic, not 
something that looks like a troop transport vehicle from 2085. 
 Actually, if you look at the dimensions, it is bigger than the Honda 
Element and most large minivans.

Anyway, I passed on my thoughts to VW online, and I'm sure they will 
consider them very carefully.....
