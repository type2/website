Dan,
The proper way to measure output  off the alternator is ith the battery
diconnected---and hooked up the the battery fed wires--or off the back
of the alternator--
But--without the proper testing switch in line prior to the diconnected
area--you stand a chance of frying the alternator--
Ifyou rad right off the battery--you'll get a false reading--if it isn't
stone dead.

You can turn every accessory on in the Bus, and run the engine and maybe
get a decent reading without cooking the alternator using a multi
meter--to see what is putting out--


Later,

Terry
