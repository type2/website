It's funny how it has been this way for 30 years or so.

That's the first Eurovan camper that's appealed to me in a long time. I really don't like the white/grey color scheme and laminates used in the US models. I rather prefer the wood to the white RV look.

My big objection to the design in general is that it doesn't honor the old bus in the way the New Beetle does: it toy and novelty appeal is too high when they should be striving for an enduring design. I hope they get it right by 2005.
