Subject: Re: [T2] New Microbus

Bob,
I've been to Motorola world headquarters too many times to
count---looking for the new Bus--all to no avail---

It turns out I've been in the wrong place--at the wrong time--all
along--

I have had my ear to the ground, and have found out they have some off
the wall garage for testing the Phaeton, as well as the Microbus in an
industrial park just west of O'hare field--

I also found out they had the Toureg for 3 years prior to VWOA
introducing it this year--electrical software glitches--and they are
still having problems with them---
Same with the Bus and Phaeton--
What ever happened to points and a condenser????--:>)

I'm still on the job with camera in Van--

Later,
