Yes.  Count on a full weekend for this job.

You missed a couple of items but you will discover them as the beam comes
down.  The clutch cable and drag link will have to be disconnected for
instance.  The job as you describe it is possible but the trailing arms
are usually removed as the beam alone is very heavy.  Adding the trailing
arms and steering knuckle will double the weight.  You will need at least
three people and a jack to do this job safely.

                             OOK!
