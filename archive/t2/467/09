Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder---
And after seeing this gorgeous vehicle in Flame Red--blasting down the
road locally--
It is really a neat looking vehicle---
It is ultimately orgasmitron--
I want one--BAD.
After Motorola works out the electrical problems--that's how I've seen
it--they are working out the software bugs for VW.

Later,
