Hey Mat,

You will never get the amount of juice you are looking for using a 110V
heater in a bus.  You alternator is pretty lacking in the output department
and the inverter will not be able to keep up with the demands of the heater.
A dead battery, a fried space heater and possible electrical fires are the
usual results.  Getting your stock system sealed up and functional is your
best bet by far.

You are in Hampton, right?  If you want to make a voyage out to Newmarket, I
will help you get everything all hooked up and blowing some hot air for you.
If your heat exchangers are solid you can probably get things going for
under $100.00.  Otherwise you are looking at $400-$500 regardless of what
approach you take.

A gas heater is your best bet if you want to really be warm in your bus, but
if you don't mind wearing a sweatshirt on cool days, your stock system
hooked up with a recirculating air return and a bilge blower in the main
heat tube will probably be all that you will ever need.

I'm at a point finally where I have some money for heat in my bus.
I had originally intended to go stock, as it seemed I could probably do it
for 200-300 bucks and sweat.
But I read from the list that if everything isn't sealed properly you get
oily, smelly air.
I don't know how difficult it is to seal properly - is it the perpetual
search for the pinholes and seams?

Gas heaters seem like more pain and potential problem than its worth.

Portable Propane heaters seem weak and laden with annoyances like
condensation.

I was wondering about getting a power inverter, wiring it up to a second
battery, and getting some form of electric space heater. You can get pretty
decent looking 1500 Watt inverters for about $200, and the space heaters I
saw went from $40 - $80 (for use up to 200 s.f.)

Anyone have experience using the electric option, or strong advice one way
or another?

Thanks
