Hi Robert, Richard,

Check out the Type2.com site and look under the "Bartno-Tek" link.  Sean 
Bartnik has the 78 Camper Supplement scanned and online.  I printed out all 
the pages, cut them to size, and stapled them together to make my own 
version of the camper supplement.  It's not original, but it's free...

Good luck!
