Subject: Re: [T2] long FI rail

Nope, that is the 78/79 left rail. I both like them and hate them.....the long part goes thru the tin grommet
and lasts longer without getting a hole rubbed in it but.... the bend in it curves it right to the frame rail.
This does two things to the rubber hose between it and the pump: it causes a kink if you are not very careful
and you have to put a larger piece of rubber hose on the fuel hose to cushion it where it lays against the
frame. It will rub a hole in the hose.

> Not to advertise, but this auction picture shows a left side fuel injection
 rail that is metal, all the way through the 'firewall'.
Is this size somewhat unusual??  Most of the fuel injection rails I have
seen were the same size, left and right.
