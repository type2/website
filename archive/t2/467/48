Subject: Heater Cables

Hello All,

I hate to bring this subject up...again. I have read the archives til I'm
blue in the face and haven't found what I'm looking for. I need to replace
two heater cables. Not just right and left...the ones that go to the
heater boxes. I've already done those. I need to replace the other two.
Both are on the left red lever that says defrost.  One of these cables
controls whether the heat goes to the foot vents or to the defrost vents
by the windshield..fairly short cable since it doesnt have to go far. The
other cable goes about midway toward the back of the bus and controls
whether heat goes to the rear of the bus.  I have yet to see anyone
advertise these two cables. Many years ago (10+) I went to the dealer to
get a replacement and they looked at me like I was from another
planet..."There ain't no such part!"  Anyone have any ideas on where to
get these cables?
