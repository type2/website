Subject: RE: [T2] Best heating options: propane, elec., gas, stock?

I actually did put in a divider in my '69 one winter. I built a wood
frame that held a surplus side window glass an mounted it on the
seatbacks.  I stuffed some strips of foamrubber to seal the edges and
dropped a flap of canvas between the seats.  It did help.
  Now I have a Propex propane heater in my Vanagon, just recently
installed; and expect that will do a lot to make life comfortable.
