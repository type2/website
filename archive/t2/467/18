Subject: Engine hatch swap?

I need to get a new engine hatch for a '79 I am selling for a friend.  Since
there is no hatch present I am going to have to visit the local pick-n-pull
to get one.  What other year engine hatches will fit on a '79 without
modification?  It appears that the same seal fits all from '71-'79, but I
seem to recall that there are differences in hinge size and position and
possibly the latch as well...

Thanks in advance,
