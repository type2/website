I have heard but never tested the theory that all hatches from 64 - 79 are

interchangeable.  As for hinges and latches I don't know, just heard the

hatch itself was the same, can anyone confirm  or deny this?

The '71 has the removable apron and the hatch is longer than the hatch
on '72(?) and up...It also looks slightly different...The later hatches have
a "bulge" (that contains the license plate light) that tapers to the edges of
the hatch. The early hatch bulge only covers the license plate indentation...
I don't see how both hatches can utilize the same seal...?-(
