Wallet-friendly Bus Depot to the rescue  :-)

I sell original Westfalia Green Plaid rather inexpensively by the meter,
as found in '76-79 Sage Green campers. This is the genuine article,
directly from Germany. It also looks quite good in '76-77 chrome yellow
campers, even if not exactly original. (It has the same colors/shades as
found in a yellow camper, except heavier on the green - which looks fine
since even the yellow camper has the same green carpet.) Since the plaid
fabric is generally the only part that wears, you can often remove your
existing upholstery, sew in new plaid, and reinstall it. I also have the
early Vanagon camper striped fabric as well. Alas I don't have the other
plaid colors (but might in mid to late 2005, if things work out).

The Green Plaid fabric is $59 per running meter (about 3 x 6 feet).

I once did exactly what you suggested - brought plaid fabric to a local
upholstery shop and had them recover my seats. Prices varied greatly so
I got a couple of quotes and went with the cheapest. I paid about $200
to have both front seats reupholstered, fully installed and including
new seat padding, but using my existing vinyl seat backing since it was
still good. My only regret was that they had to replace about 6 inches
of my vinyl piping, and while the color they used was close it was not
an exact match. Still a very good job for a low cost. Especially
considering that this included installation; even if you buy pre-made
seat covers, they require installation with hog rings; it's not a "slip
on" installation. 

And yes, as another alternative, you can look for a set of Vanagon seats
(which fit late '76 thru 79) at a junkyard and have an upholstery place
recover them instead. Vanagon front seats tend to hold up better than
Bus ones, so junkyard ones are often in pretty good shape yet quite
inexpensive. However, as I recall, you will have to either remove the
Vanagon seat armrests (if the ones you buy have them; they're standard
on '85-up) or remove the armrests on your door panels, as both armrests
won't fit at the same time. (However, the Vanagon seat armrest mounts
have a tendancy to break anyway, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing to
do away with them.)

Of course, if you're in the camp that can't stand the plaid, we sell TMI
seat upholstery for busses in the color of your choice. Myself, I like
the plaid. It has personality. :-)
