Subject: Re: [T2] BA-6 Gas Heater Part numbers?

"I have found that a regular VW coil will work, I've been using one for
several years now after the heater coil failed.  (this is on a BA-4 so
there might be some differences YMMV)"

Does anyone know what the resistance should be between the + and - poles on
a good coil? I was thinking I could at least test the one I have. It looks
just like a regular VW coil but I have been advised to test or replace it.
