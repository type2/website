Subject: Need Photos of Sink and Water Area

I bought a 78 pop top camper bus (type II).  The previous owner had removed 
all of the original cabinets and installed custom cabinets to suit his needs at 
the time.  He saved all of the original cabinetry.  I took his out and put 
the original back in.  
  He got rid of the propane stove tank and I have since found and installed a 
replacement.  Now all I need is some information about re-installing the 
water tank for the sink, and find the "trap" pipe that goes under the sink.  I 
have the water tank, but have no idea how it all "fits" in the cabinet.
  Please, if anyone out there with a 78 camper bus could send me a photo of 
the inside of your cabinet showing the sink and water tank areas, I would be 
very grateful.
  (PS....anyone know of any good VW mechanics in the area that know about 
heaters?  The "heat" coming from the heaters will eventually fry all my brain 
cells if I don't get it fixed RIGHT by someone who knows what they're doing.)
  Thanks in advance.
