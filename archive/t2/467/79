Got $1000 for new seats?

After the sticker shock you have to be impressed by the lengths GoWesty!
goes to restore campers for their clients.

I have a nice set of Vanagon seats in my 78' that I really like. They slid
right on the tracks and are sooo much more comfortable on a long drive than
the stock ones. The only problem is that they are grey cloth/vinyl and I
would love to recover them the stock brown plaid that the rest of the bus
cusions are. I wonder what an auto a upolstery  shop would charge to do
this and If Go-westy or some place more friendly to the wallet can sell the
material?  My other option is to recover everything else in gray....
