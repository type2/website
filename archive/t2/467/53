Subject: still won't idle cold....

Hi,

Well, I've let the ole' '80 Vanagon sit a few weeks and got back to it
this week.

So far....

new plugs, points, cap, rotor, fuel filter, air filter, 
exhaust, exhaust manifold gaskets.

It would idle rough before I started this but the timing was off and
the points were pitted so the dwell was probably off.

Now that things are in spec I'm guessing I've ripped the scab off the
cold idle issue.

I'm down to guessing its a couple things...

- auxilliary air valve? (top of my list for starting but not idling
when cold)

- air flow meter? (second  on my list for not working or being 
set wrong but I'd need to take it to the shop for them to check 
with CO meter)

(I would think maybe fuel pump or lines but it runs fine as long as I
don't let it sit and idle....I can drive it at highway speed.)

I forgot to mention that I've also recently been underneath and
reinstalled the tinware cover over the middle section...covers the
aux. heater and access to the fuel filter I recently reinstalled.

I noticed some odor of gas near the newly installed filter...square
plastic purolator kind.

I see now noticeable leaks of any sort......is this normal?

(or thermo time switch or cold start switch which I think are working
since it starts cold just fine.  Part of the little snap connector on the
thermo time switch is broken and some engine oil gets on it but I've
cleaned it and put it back on as best I can with no improvement.  I
may simply solder it on to make sure.)

This is an aircooled 2L Vanagon with fuel injection.  Anyone figure
I'm completely on the wrong track?  ...thoughts?????  appreciated,
thanks.


Sincerely,
