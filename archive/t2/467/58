OK, one more post, then I am disappeearing agin...

First, if you want cordless, then of course the ore recent the better.
Battery tech has improved *immeasurably* in the las 15 years!

Second, as I take these tools apart my objection is not to the plastic,
tho I don't care for it, but rather to:

plain bearings vs. roller and ball bearings;
riveted construction vs. screws, nuts, and bolts making disassembly
impossible; and
rotor and stator insulation that is *waterproof* or at least not water
soluble!

The modern plastic cases are actually easier to work with.  The aluminum
cases have corroded shitlessly, alas, since the aluminum electrochemically
the "hottest" metal in the tool and acts as the electron donor.  This does
not bode well for flood-damaged  aluminum and magnesium engine cases,
tho:-(
