Subject: hand brake won't hold

I know there was a thread on this a little while ago, but I couldn't
find it in the archives. I adjusted my rear brakes over the weekend.
Before I adjusted them, the hand brake was pulling out increasingly
further out. By the time I got to them, the lever pulled all the way
out. I know, I know, bad owner (smack on wrist). Anyway, now that the
brakes are adjusted, I can't get the handle to click and lock in. It
pulls out a few clicks (4-5), hesitates like it wants to hold, and then
gives up the ghost, smacking back into the dash. Fortunately, I parked
on a relatively flat spot, so first gear will hold it in place. Could
someone re-send me a copy of the resolution to this? It would be nice
to have a parking brake.

BTW, for those that read the "Am I hosed" plea from me a couple of
weeks ago: I called the local ACVW guru at Trafton Foreign Auto, and he
diagnosed that I have hydraulic lifters. The library confirmed this in
an hydraulic lifter piece by John Anderson. This explains the spongy
response when attempting to adjust them before. Followed John's
instructions, and its running much better now... quieter too. (easing
finger off the panic button)
