Subject: [T2]how to clean up used fridge/sink

was given a sink last night for my bus out of a westfalia
 
i am not sure how long it has sit or what not....
wanted to know the best way to clean it out in case the jug on the back is like  yuck in there....?
i know i can run hot water through there and dump it out before install but what would be the safest way to clean it out/sanitize it... before use for camping this weekend...?
 
i dont want to use clorox or nothing afraid it may leave a trace of it behind in the water tank....
the fridge i can clean up pretty east but the inside of the water jug i want to make sure and eliminate any nasty that may be lurking behind.. ?
the tank it's self looks very clean and doesnt have a stinch to it but yet i dont want to chance it until it is sanitized....
thanks
peace and love
chris
