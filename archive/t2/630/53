There are shims that go behind the fan itself (inside the cooling tin).
Sounds like you have too many if it gets quiet when you push the tin
towards the front of the bus (fan out too far, rubbing forward part of
shroud). 

I had the same problem in my '69 bug when I changed the generator a few
years ago. I got real good at pulling that fan without pulling the tin
while making adjustments.
