Chlorine in small amounts won't harm you. But to remove the
smell/taste after bleaching it out (and yes, it is a great cleaner for
potable water sources):

Soak the jug in 50/50 bleach/water. Let it set for a day or two,
occasionally shaking it.

Rinse it out VERY well, several times over a day or two. Head to the
pet store, and get some DeChlor or similar
(http://www.koivillage.com/water_treatments/weco_dechlor.html) and add
as instructed. Repeat until no detectable odor is present. Might only
take two treatments. It mostly depends on the plastic the jug is made
of.

I've done this with the big punch jugs we used to use when I was a Boy
Scout leader. Works perfectly!
