Have you done a search on the archives? Lot's of good stuff there. 
Basically, the problem with cold weather is fuel condensing in the very 
long inlet manifold runners. You can reduce the problem by jury-rigging an 
aircleaner from another car onto the carb. Some fit directly while others 
will need an adapter. These air cleaners let you pipe warm air in off the 
rhs head (you also need some tin ware that brings the heat from the head 
into the engine bay). I've just done this but haven't been able to test it 
properly. Now the weather is warming up (I'm in Australia)!

Also make sure that your fast idle is working. To set it (and the choke), 
press in the accelerator one or twice before starting. If it doesn't idle 
fast something is wrong! The fast idle will stop when you rev the engine.

Cheers,
