Karl, does it have the fall over safety switch that shuts it off? Just
something else to check for. Some do some don't.

Thanks for all of the information about space heaters. Much appreciated.

 

On Jamie Rivers recommendation, I went to look at the Caframo 9200.

Some of the heaters I had looked at at Wal-Mart seemed just a bit on

the shoddy side. The Caframo is very well put together, and it also has

a five year warranty. I liked its low center of gravity. I also liked

the fact that the exterior case does not get hot... which hopefully

will prevent it from igniting our dog in the middle of the night. It

was $49.00 at Boat USA. A bit more expensive than the Wal-Mart models,

but probably those didn't have five year warranties.
