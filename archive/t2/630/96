Great Tires!

I have them on my 79 westy.  Smooth rolling, good in rain and wind, they wear 
evenly and well.  I've even had them in heavy, wet snow over the coastal 
range twice without chaining up.  I just took it slow and steady and smiled as I 
passed several FWD cars and SUV's that were in the ditch!
