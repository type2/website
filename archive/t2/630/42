Subject: Re: [T2] cheap replacement muffler

As you drive around notice the rear mufflers on the Asian minivans and SUVs. Small enough for a VW... 

Mazda and Nissan come to mind... 

Might be a good aftermarket solution with a warranty! Buy the muffler, take it to a muffler shop and have the pipe you need bents and welded. I had dual pipes installed to used VW quiet pack mufflers on my Corvair implant for $50 and he supplied two rubber hangers for the pipes. While I waited no less. Just a small town muffler shop, non-franchise.
