Subject: Re: [T2] cheap replacement muffler

Hi Mike, 

Cheapo mufflers? 

I'm running a $20 Autozone muffler intended for a
Corolla or Nissan, on my 1971 Westfalia. I only did it
because I had a quietpack on, the can rusted out - it
was from 1991!, and I couldn't buy another can -
they'd changed design/size of collector merge.. So
mine now has old headers, 3" collector flange, and new
el-cheapo muffler..

Works great.. YMMV.. Btw I used a rubber and metal
hanger that I got from a muffler shop to hang the
thing, Autozone includes fittings for the cars the
mufflers are intended for.. I was careful to route it
out to the side to avoid exhaust fumes..

My bus is now very quiet.. Performance is just fine..

Btw, I'll be planning to swap over to a proper system
when funds and time permit, but probably not until
after Winter.. One bonus is that the Autozone muffler
can is aluminized - so no rust!
