did you pull the flywheel and look at the dowels? are the holes buggered
up?
there is a jig that allows 4 new dowel holes to be drilled in the crank
without breaking the case open. so essentially you have an 8 doweled crank
end but you just use the 4 new holes.
I dont think I would try it myself even with the jig. I would think best..
a vw friendly machine shop, lesser... see if you can get a loaner jig and
have a local machine shop do it, lastly... just go to a local machine shop
cold and see what they think.

or is it possible that the gland nut or threads are buggered? you need to
have the flywheel off and evaluate.
