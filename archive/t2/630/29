Just ordered a set from Discount Tire here locally last Wednesday. They
should be in now, I go to have them installed tomorrow. I wo't be able to
report on driveability because the Rivi is still travelling by towbar
<grin>. 

Check with local suppliers. Discount Tire quoted me $376 for 4
mounted/balanced. I told them I could order from Tirerack.com for $60 each
+ $10 mount/balance at Wal-Mart and the guy dropped my quote to $332.xx out
the door (tax and all) for a set of 4.

Total cost using Tirerack.com + shipping + local mounting would have been
about $320 with the added hassle of shipping and no local warantee. Going
this route I have the Discount Tire nationwide warantee.
