Anyone had experience with Yokohama Y356 tires?  Tirerack.com carries 
these and I'm thinking of ordering some for my '78 Westy.

According to the web site, they have a D load rating and an 1850 lb. 
maximum load, which seem sufficient. I've had Yokoha tires a a number 
of cars and I've generally been pleased. I have found them to be a bit 
on the noisy side, but I can't see how this would be a big issue in a 
bus.

Thanks.
