Subject: cheap replacement muffler

Hi all,

Has anyone out there ever used one of the $20-30 replacement mufflers from 
AutoZone (or any other cheap muffler)?  I've been looking around for a 
muffler and figured something must be wrong if they're so cheap.  But, as 
long as it performs to spec, makes my bus quieter, and I can cobble it into 
place I'd be happy.  Any thoughts?

Also - thanks for all the starter help!  I ended up taking both the starter 
and solenoid apart, cleaned everything, and tightened the loose rivets 
holding the brush housings in place.  Don't know what I actually "fixed", 
but it works fine now.

Beep,
mike
