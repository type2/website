Subject: Rear axle play

I installed all new bearings and seals on the rear axles of 71 bus and
torqued to spec. After about 200 miles there seems to be a lot
(.020-.030")of play in the ball bearings. It is radial play not axial.
The nuts are still tight. Is it normal to have some play? Can find
nothing in manual.
