Chris,

take the faucet apart.  IIRC there is a rubber O-ring that works on a
plunger to pull water via vacuum into the faucet chamber.  this needs to be
intact (if not go to hardware store) and greased with a little food-grade
silicone lube (ask at camping store for water purification pump parts).
there also needs to be a marble in there for a check valve. this is if I
remember correctly, I had to haul mine to a junkyard because of monster
rats.
