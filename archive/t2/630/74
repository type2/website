......" dont want to use clorox or nothing afraid it may leave a trace
of it behind in the water tank..."

Install the sink unit, fill the water tank and then add a few DROPS of
the clorox.   Now go drive around for 30 minutes and then drain and
flush the tank until there is no more smell of the clorox.
