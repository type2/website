I used to have an EMPI dual quiet pack and it was just terrible quality,
bolted to a wide collector but was actually quite constricted, the header
fit like crap too.

For type 1 engines, I recommend the Quiet One (header and muffler kit) sold
by CB Performance.  Fits good and has a thunderbird (USA) muffler, not too
quiet, not too loud, good throaty sound. it is a single quiet pack design
with a wide collector flange:
