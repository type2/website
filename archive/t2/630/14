Subject: Re: [T2] stud size

Hi Kyle,

There are some differences between those studs between different 
engines and trannies. Last summer I dropped a 2L engine from an 
automatic and found the studs were too short when I installed it on a 
5-rib (1974/75) bell housing.

It's pretty simple to swap the studs over. Just double-nut them and 
they spin out pretty easily. The exhuast studs on a type4 engine are 
9mm at the engine end and 8mm at the heater box. They're not cheap... 
last set I bought cost $9CDN each!

Happy trails,
