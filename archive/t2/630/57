OK, I was working on a '69 bug with generator. It happened at least 3 years
ago so details definitely missing. The NOISE is what made the whole thing
memorable enough for me to recall any details at all.

Working from back to front:

Pulley/shims for belt
Generator
Backing plate (OUTSIDE tin/shroud)
Fan shroud/tin
shim(s)/washer(s)
fan

The backing plate is the "rounded square" plate with 4 holes that bolt to
the fan shroud/tin with #6x1.0 (10mm head) short bolts or machine screws. 

I was replacing my stock "narrow" fan that had cratered (one weld broke --
then it was fins all over the place) with a later model "wide" fan.

Found that by removing the deck lid I could get my arm and a 30mm socket in
front of the shroud to get the fan on/off. Locked the pulley of the
generator with a big strap wrench.

Removed old fan and fins I could feel. Counted fins in hand and empty spots
on fan. Phew! all there, no need to remove the tinwork.

When I removed the fan from the generator shaf there were 3 or 4 shims
between it and the backing plate. I figured that since I was putting on a
wider fan I should leave those out.

Started the engine and got a tremendous howl. Put all the shims back in.
Started the engine and got the howl again. Took some of the shims out.
Started the engine, no howl.

I seem to recall that the backing plate had a narrow "scoop" on it's
forward side and was supposed to sit a certain way to provide cooling air
to the generator. Alternator may have it's own fan and a different backing
plate.

Backing plate definitely did NOT go inside the shroud. Fan was completely
inside the shroud except for a "lip" that stuck out the forward side
slightly. The "lip" was narrower that the rest of the fan. Made the fan
look a bit like a chopped off cone.

I did it all without pulling the generator off at all.

Fan housing? Got photos?
