I cleaned the tank for my 76 with bleach, rinsed, dried, repeat etc., but
could not get rid of the strong plactic smell.  Also, while not currently
leaking the threads at the bottom for the drain and pump were cracked and
stripped because of the soft material.

I opted to have a replacement made out of Lexan.  It's the same material as
the popular Nalgene water bottles.  It's a harder material so the threads are
strong and seal well with teflon tape without the need for silicone or clamps.
The material is resistant to mold, smells, etc. and is clear so you can easily
see the water level when you open the cabinet.

If enough people are interested I could have some more made.  The price would
probably be around $150.  Steep, but not unreasonable for a custom made
replacement for a no-longer-available part.  I've been very happy with mine so
far.
