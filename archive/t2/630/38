The typical problem with these boots is that cracking starts to develop
between the ribs of the lower bend of the boot, allowing unmetered air to
enter.  If that's the issue you're facing there's a good fix available:
Automotive Goop which is similar to Shoe Goo, if you're familiar with that.
Remove the boot and clean it to within an inch of its life with hot water
and dish soap.  After it's dried, smooth on the Automotive Goop where needed
and allow to dry for a day or so.

I did this with a boot over 5 years ago and it's still going strong
