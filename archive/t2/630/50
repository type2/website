Subject: testing engine out of bus questions (asap)

Hi everyone,

Sorry for the urgency of this, but I'm trying to do it before it gets dark 
here.
I'm trying to test a 78 FI engine out of the bus and have a couple 
questions.

What do I do where the brake booster hose enters the intake air distr on the 
drivers side?

On the passenger side in the rear of the van, next to the engine hatch there 
is a black cylinder with some hoses coming off of it.  One hose goes from 
the top of it to the top of the air cleaner.  One goes from the bottom to 
the passenger side of the fan housing.  What do I do about these? (There is 
also some skinnier hose that goes up to the metal hose that runs across the 
top of the engine compartment near the hatch and up the sides into the air 
scooops)

On the drivers side in the front of the engine there are 2 big white plugs 
with a bunch of wires that plug into  other big white plugs that are mounted 
to the front of the engine compartment on the drivers side. Do I just leave 
these unplugged?

Do I need to use a fuel pump? Do I need to have a return fuel hose set up to 
the gas can also?

Will I need the FI control unit? If so how do I remove it?

hope I remembered everything.
Thanks everyone,
Kyle

p.s. Michael Knight I know you suggested I try the 1800 with the carb first, 
but it was missing a bunch of hoses I didn't have and am not familiar with.  
thanks so much for all your help though.
