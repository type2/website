Subject: Blown Double Relay Pic

So the Double Relay that I tested and failed was looked into. Literally. 
Since after replacing the relay my fuel pump kicks in perfectly and the bus 
runs. So I decided to take apart the relay(Bosch Black PLastic Type) and see 
if I could tell where it was bad. I am not an electrical engineer but I can 
see it. There is a burnt spot on the circuit board it may be  a little hard 
to see in this pic. The spot is at the lower part of the board just left of 
center.
