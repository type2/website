Subject: aircooled intake elbow

Looking for the intake elbow (boot) for a 1980 air-cooled vanagon.
Part# 071 129 967 (afm to throttle body)
The elbow has been replaced with the water cooled elbow part#  025 129 967a,
and the alignment and fit is very poor.  The Bus Depot paper catalog lists the
item but it is not
found on the catalog web site.  I am also looking for a good speedometer
cable, the upper
cable that connects from the egr box to the speedometer - but I need the later
clip style, not
the early screw style.
