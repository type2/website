Hi Jerry,

The engine in my westfakia did much the same thing this year. A 
compression test in February gave me a result of 120/120/100/110 and a 
retest this summer gave me 120/120/115/120.  I'm not complaining. Plans 
for a winter rebuilding session can be put off for another year.

Best guess I've figured out so far is that the low compression in 
February might have had something to do with the bus not being a daily 
driver at that time of year.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
