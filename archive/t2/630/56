Subject: Re: [T2] Fan squeeling UUUUUUUUUUUGH 

The shim or stiffener or whatever it's called is
in place betweent the fan and the alternator. 
The alternator is bosch and the other items are
whatever (Mex/Bra).  It is, of course, an upright
engine.  

I read some stuff on a bug sight that mentioned
seating the fan downward with authority.  I did
so and that seems to help.  No more squeeling at
idle.  But the noise is still there.  

Looked at Bentley, Haynes and St. Muir.  All say
to mount the fan housing inside the tin, but I
cannot seem to get it to seat that way.  The rear
part of the fan (rear meaning towards the rear
bumper) seems shaped so that it won't fit inside
the tin.  The rest of the fan housing is inside
the tin.  

Do I need to work harder tomorrow at getting the
rear part of the fan housing inside the tin?
