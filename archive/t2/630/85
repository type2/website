I know my cool local FLAPS has atleast the tin screws (are they the same as 
the type 1 engine)? I have about 6 or so I'm not using I could ship those to 
you. They might have the other stuff, you could call them and find out and I 
could pick up for you and ship them, although I"m not sure if the timeline 
would work for you, might be a few days before I could make it out there. 
Anyway they are Roy Rodgers in Nashville TN. Not sure maybe they would ship 
directly to you? (615) 834-8031

I wish Bus Depot would sell hardware for us but I understand as 20 cent nuts 
are just not very profitable to them.

Sometimes I get pretty lucky with Home Depot for hardware suprising enough. 
There's one guy there that can almost find anything I need even though it's 
metric. It's worth a shot to try your local hardware store. I just use what 
works myself.
