Subject: flywheel rattling

Hi Volks ~~~
I've had the misfortune to find that the rattle I hear upon start up is not
the engine tin --- it's the loose flywheel. Apparently the PO didn't tighten
things properly when he changed the clutch before I bought Slo Rojo (lesson:
get a torque wrench), and now it seems that I can't tighten it enough to
prevent rattling.
Is there such a thing as a shim (or any fix for that matter) that I can use
without splitting the case and having the flywheel and crank machined? How
long do you all think I have on her (as a daily driver)? Is this a slow or a
rapid degeneration? I'm getting a rattle on cranking, and a squeal that is
intermittent while in gear. The squeal usually stops after a few minutes of
driving.
Give it to me straight, Doc.
