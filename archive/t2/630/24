Subject: re: cheap muffler

I have been interested in replacing my exhaust also but the complete
system. Has anyone ever installed one of the dual muffler systems sold
by bugpack, empi, bus boys, etc... They seem to me like a great
improvement, just don't know how well it will shimmy into fit. About the
$20-$30 mufflers I personally have never had good luck. I got one that
supposedly was to 'spec' for my MG but it really bit the big one,
noticeable decline in power and it just sounded terrible. My 2 cents is
save up and drop the dough for a good complete system, for me that was a
PECO exhaust on that particualar MG.

Thanks,

Max
