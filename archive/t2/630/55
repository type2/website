I reread your post soryy but I guess the previous post will help you out 
more. But "out of the bus" poses more problems. Put the weber on it and do 
it that way if it is truely "out of the bus" testing.


-You would have to pull the ECU/brain and connect it.
-The relay would have to plugged into the two white sockets, remove from the 
firewall unless you have a good spare and ground it to the engine or bell 
housing.
-FI Fuel pump will be needed and you could wire just following the Bentley, 
proper wires to the relay and ground.
- While you are doing that you need a wire from the solenoid on the starter 
to the relay. Also one from the coil to the relay.
-Then just go through the hose connections and plug & patch to make them all 
work or terminate apropriately.
-Fuel supply(gas can) will need two hoses one to the fuel pump and one to 
the pressure regulator.


If I missed anything I am sure others can chime in and hit the problem spots 
on this type of testing "out of the bus" on a FI Type IV engine.



Good luck, take pics, drive safe, drink milk,
