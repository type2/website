Subject: [T2] flywheel rattling

Hi Jamey,
          I may be a little late coming to this discussion.  Mike's advice is 
quite reasonable, IMO.  Many years ago I acquired a Type 2 that had been worked 
on by a Texaco station someplace around Chicago.  The 'rattling' was really 
severe, not just some tinny sounds but real metal hammering.  It turned out 
that the Texaco gorillas had used an impact wrench on the gland nut, having 
CROSS THREADED it before applying the impact wrench.  The crankshaft was 
ruined: internal threads at the flywheel end were not restorable.

If you grasp the flywheel, can you move it relative to the crankcase?  [Maybe 
you should use a prybar or screwdriver to be more persuasive.]

I hope this is not the case you are talking about.  If your PO failed to 
tighten the clutch assembly, rather than the gland nut, your machine shop 
should be able to fix that by installing heli-coils in the flywheel, or re-
drilling and re-tapping the flywheel, perhaps at the midpoints between existing 
(loose clutch/flywheel bolt) locations.

If your gland nut is loose, you may have the same opportunity to re-drill at 45 
degrees from the existing holes..... but in any case be sure the threads on 
crank and gland nut are OK; also that the seal surfaces remain smooth.

Good luck!
Glenn

I would take off your entire clutch/flywheel assembly and bring it to a 
machine shop.  Have them check it out to make sure it's within spec, 
then have them balance it (clutch/pressure plate, too).  It might be 
badly out of balance causing excess vibration.
