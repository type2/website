Subject: Fan squeeling UUUUUUUUUUUGH

All right, the alternator is fixed and I'm back
to trying to fix the ORIGINAL problem.  My fan is
squeeling.  I found that someone (DCO probably)
left out several of the bolts that held the fan
into place.  It ran silently, even without the
bolts, ever since I bought this bus.  But now I
cannot seem to get it aligned properly.  If I put
my hand above the carb and push the whole thing
forward, the fan will turn silently.  But I
cannot get it to stay in that position.  

Any ideas?
