Subject: RE: [T2] getting sink to work....?

ok thanks so much everyone.... i ran water through the tank several times and added the suggested drops of clorox.... then emptied.... will redo later on but i am going after the closet part today so will have to take back out to load closet so didnt want to set it up permanetly yet,...
my question now is how do i get the sink to work...? or maybe it is one that doesnt work? maybe quit working on PO dont know...?
 
friend of mine has the same setup in his 72 bus but his is all original where i have took a transporter and have added the westfalia setup cabinets and all...
 
he was telling me that i have to have the pipe running out the top as a vent so that it wil work...(which is a big question cause i have a penthouse pop top){kinda looks like a riviera pop top popss straight up for whole section of bus}
 
used the example of like opening a can of condensed milk for coffee...
if you poke one hole in it  it runs slow.... but if you add another hole it pours more freely...
i filled the tank with water and just turned the spicket(<southern for faucet lol) on and well nothing came out at all?
so what should i do to fix this..
first off i do not have the pipe running out the top of the bus for vent.(again i have the penthouse top? so what about the pipe?).. it stops at the top of the sink and also just have it straight out the bottom..
i plan on installing the correct pipe to the bottom so it dont dump on ours or anyone elses campsite though but havent yet cause i dont have the pipe...yet~!~! visit to lowes will handle that though...
 
when i install these pipes should the sink then work?
or maybe could there be something wrong with the faucet it's self?
 
the hose is attached to the faucet and to the bottom of the tank and i tightened them down with clamps so the pressure is there on that part..
once again thank you all for your help it has been abundant
peace and love
chris
hope this all makes sense... i have a tendacy to get carried away when i type and think at the same time.. hehehehe~!~
one more thing ran water through the pipe cleaned boogers out and also ran water into sink and it comes freely out the drain pipe so that part is good faucet just doesnt work?

You might want to cycle some of the water through the pump as well just to 
make sure there is no boogers hiding in there.
