Subject: re: gas pedal problems on 72 westy

Some people may object to this - but I've had great success using a bungee
cord attached to my gas pedal.  Say what you will, but if your pedal stops
springing back and you're in the middle of the desert, you do what you need
to.

Several years and no problems since.  I use a small black rubber one, and
you can hardly see it.

Regards,
Shawn.
