I tend to park in the shade whenever I can and avoid driving in the midday summer heat but the engine temps really go up after stopping especially if you've been stuck in traffic prior for 10 minutes. I also read in the Probst FI book that hoatsoak is really good at clogging the fuel injectors.

Now that the hotsoak season is upon us, do people have any tricks for dealing with this?

I was thinking how watercooled vehicles run a thermostatically controlled fan even after the engine has been turned off but the old aircooled engines has no such feature.

After that long discussion on supplementary cooling fans that aren't practical for all the obvious reasons (battery consumption, cooling efficiency) would circulating air in the engine compartment have any effect against the hoatsoak?
