When we got G, the sliding door would unlatch, but not open.  It turned out
that the steel "U"-shaped bar, that connected the door to the slider
mechanism on the rail, had rusted enough to freeze it in the closed
position.  The slider itself (on our `77 bay) is made from some sort of pot
metal and doesn't rust, but the rust on the bar itself was enough to lock it
up.

To fix the problem I managed to get the door open enough (barely) to
creatively unscrew the fasteners holding the slider mech in the door and
remove the mech.  A short section of wooden 4 "x 4" was used to prop the
door up when it was fully open, but the door was self-supporting when closed
more than halfway.

After removal, everything but the bar was removed and the mech was soaked in
WD40.  However, this did only a little to free the bar and allow it to
rotate in the slider.  After three days of soaking I became impatient and
used a propane torch to carefully heat the slider enough to allow the bar to
rotate.  (Remember to remove the nylon slider thing, first!  On G, the nylon
bit was riveted on.  The rivet was easily freed and removed, and because
there was enough lip left on it, it was re-installed.)

After the bar was removed, it was polished and properly lubricated before
reassembly.  I also cleaned the oil hole out so that future problems could
be averted with periodic lubrication.  My guess is that it was never lubed
after purchase by the original PO.
