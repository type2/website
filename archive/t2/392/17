just as a core. There's a guy that makes a living by running up and down the 
state to
all the VW FLAPS delivering rebuilt engines and trannys and picking up cores 
to deliver
to the builders in SoCal.


Man, this has got to be a tough way to make a living.  I can't  believe that 
someone is going to pull a tranny and deliver it for $50, even if they can 
get it for free.  Shysters in the yards I go to want $100 to pull either an 
engine or transmission, and that's just part time $$$$ for them.
