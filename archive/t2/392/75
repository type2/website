Hi Mickey,

It seems strange to see this issue come up in the summer, we usually 
only have to answer this in the fall.

You CANNOT effectively heat a bus with 12 volts. You can't even do a 
decent job of defrosting the windshield. The total output of the 
alternator/generator of the us would not produce enough electricity to  
heat the bus properly, and even if it could you will need most of that 
power to light the spark-plugs and keep the lights on. We've been over 
this many, many times. The only decent electric solutions I've heard 
are a 12V blanket or an electric vest (motorcycle wear).  Neither of 
those will do a thing for the windshield.

The stock location for a gas heater is in the engine compartment (BN-4) 
or under the cargo floor (BA-6).  The engine compartment location is 
easier to install into but it doesn't do much to heat the drivers 
compartment. I have successfully fitted a BN-2 (Beetle) heater under 
the floor of the bus inline with the main heater pipe, this gave 
excellent heat to the defroster vent and to heat the drivers 
compartment. Look in the library, there is lots of info on this.

Why not simply repair the original heater boxes? In your climate they 
work great if you look after them.

Happy trails,
