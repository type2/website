Subject: Fuel Line - Single Carb vs. Double Carb

Hi,

I didn't receive any replies concerning the double carb setup.  As
mentioned last week I am compiling a technical article for fuel line
replacement for carburated buses.  Can someone please tell me which
additional steps are required for changing lines to a double carb?  (i'm
only familiar with the single).


Thx,
Shawn.
