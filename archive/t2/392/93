Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

Haven't tried this, but sure read a *lot* of reports today on the advance 
of silicosis in a very short time when doing it every day....scared me to 
the point of doing something soonest.

I also looked at the fancy stuff that is being sold for sandblasting which 
is basically a forced air hood(like someone mentioned earlier) for 
only "$499.95".   I could build one out of 120v hi capacity computer
fans and dryer hose for a lot cheaper than that.....and had already 
considered it before this thread started....with the added benefit of
keeping you cooler on these hot days.

Buddy and I discussed such an arangement with a sandblasting "room",
just walk in, put your "helment" on and start sandblasting....you could do 
some *really* large stuff easily that way.

Cheers, dave
