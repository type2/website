Subject: Funky Poptop

Hey-
The poptop on my 73 Campmobile is a bit funky. When closed, it rests on the
front corners, leaving a gap in the middle at the top of the windshield. Has
anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions as to a fix, or ideas for what
to use as a seal that would be big enough to cover the gap (1"ish)?
Cheers,
Matthew
