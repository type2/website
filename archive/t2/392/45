I have to agree with Greg... and I can add that I have changed a number of
plugs ,, or done compression testing  with that sensor on the #3 plug in
different vehicles,,, dual carb and efi engines.

I remember I was very aprehensive the first time I seen one,,, but IMHO,
it is the only place to put the sensor... everyone else with very few
exceptions have them under the #3 plug, and so comparison readings are
much easier to make.

But the best part by far is the ease of re-installing that plug with the
sensor holding it and the socket in place.
