Subject: RE: [T2] Installing interior wood panels

OK, if the question >>>  I am trying to figure out the best way to attach 
them [panels] to the doors and other walls of the bus >>> can be translated 
to:::

"How can I match up the panel clip holes of the front doors (et al) with a 
3mm white birch panel, so that I can drill holes in the birch paneling and 
attach the panel to the door(s) with press-in fasteners (such fasteners as 
found on many Westy sliding door panels and rear hatch panels)".


Then I can offer this: Make a pattern of the door panel holes by taping a 
sheet of butcher paper ( a couple of brown paper bags, split and flattened 
and taped together will do) to the inside of the bare door (sans panel), and 
find the holes by finger touch, and mark then accordingly.

Now, 'accordingly' could mean different things to different people, so I 
leave you to your imagination and ingenuity, because like my mentor once 
told me, "an action passed [to another] is an action completed."
