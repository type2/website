Subject: more work to do...

Well list, I thought I had de-mothballed my '71 sufficiently for a few
days of test driving to work and back.  Apparently, I've got a few more
serious issues to address (none of which were issues when it went into
mothballs).

1) gas in the oil.  Nice to see the subject has just come up. It's hard to
narrow down an archive search with words like "gas" and "oil".  Anyway,
I've only put about 60 miles on since the de-mothballing oil change, so I
hope (nay, pray) that I haven't ruined anything.  I guess a carb rebuild
is likely in order.  Might just spring for a new Bus Depot carb so I can
attempt my first carb rebuilt at my own pace.

2) red light glowing.  Ain't that a peach? I haven't had this problem
since I was a college kid with a '70 beetle. I reckon I'll be out there
today with the volt-meter to see if it is the generator or the voltage
regulator.  I'm paranoid to crank the engine with the gassy oil, though.
I guess step one is to fix the fuel issues.  I seem to remember there is
some procedure (polarizing?) that needs to be done to a new voltage
regulator.  time to scout the archives.

3) Starter.  Had to whack it with a big crescent wrench to get it to work.
 It's so much easier to access than a beetle's starter, that I just may
put up with this quirk for a while.
