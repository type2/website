Subject: Pirates of Silicone Valley

Just thought I'd mention,

	I was watching the made for TV movie "The Pirates of Silicone
Valley" the other night, and noticed that about 80% of the cars you saw in
the movie were Volkswagens. With the exception of a yellow Chevy Monza and a
back-hoe, all the other cars that they were actually driving, were
Volkswagens. Wozniak and Steve Jobs drove several places in a Volkswagen
Bus. It was a bay-window Bus with the camper top. Then when they were
getting ready to go to the school to show off their first computer, Wozniack
dropped it into the back of a VW Thing that was parked at the end of his
driveway.
