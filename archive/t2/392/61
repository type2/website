Subject: Portable DC Heater

Hi,

I have a '71 Westie day camper and I'd like to find a 12v electric portable
heater.  I purchased a VW gas heater a while back but I can't find a good
place to install it in.  I'm setting up a second battery just for the
e-heater.  Any body know where I can find one in the Portland area?  I've
tried Camper World and  G. I. Joe's so far.
