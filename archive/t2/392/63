Its been a while since I worked on my FI so this is pretty rusty.
First if you don't have a bentley, go get one. It has a fantastic FI
section that will step you through the diagnostics & get you running
w/ minimal tools. Much better than guessing.

enough preaching. If none of them are firing do you have the FI system
hooked up properly to the coil? There should be an extra connector
that goes to the same side of the coil as the green wire from the
distributor hooked to the 1 terminal (i believe). try that.
