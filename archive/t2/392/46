Hi All, 
I have a sandblaster. I've used it before, but since I care about my
lungs enough to have quit smoking, I no longer want to sandblast without
a respirator. The problem is that all the half masks and full masks in
the stores say "Do not use for sandblasting". So I went looking around.
I seem to be able to find a whole lot of respirators that say not to use
for sandblasting, but I'm not finding any that say that they were made
for it. How good is a PAPR for this? I know it's not approved by NIOSH
for sandblasting in the workplace, but I have a 3M Breathe Easy unit
with a hood that only needs a battery ($200 battery - ouch) and filters.
But what kind of filter do I use? Is this a particulate only or should
it be good for organic vapors as well? Is HEPA good enough? What do
y'all do to protect your lungs while sandblasting? I'll be sandblasting
probably just a few times a week after work until my project is done... 
Thanks,
Jen
