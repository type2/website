Subject: door latch diagram

Hi
I'm looking for a diagram of the front(passenger) door latch mechanism, and
preferably a cutaway of the door panel so I can see how to approach the whole
thing. While putting an extra screw into my interior door panel, I managed to
hose my door latch. Now the door closes marginally well, but first you have to
hold the latch open and push the lock button down.

It's a '78, by the way.

Thanks
Mat
