Subject: EFI maybe??

I bought a 78 project bus (2.0L EFI) that doesn't run and I need some advice 
on the EFI.

The bus won't start, but turns over fine, is sparking at all plugs and has 
compression.  It sat for a while so I drained the gas and changed the fuel 
lines and now I'm wondering if the reason it won't start is because the fuel 
injectors are plugged.  What is the easiest way to diagnos the problem with 
the EFI or is there some sensor that I don't know about that would prevent 
the bus from starting???
