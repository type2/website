Subject: re booster hoses

I just happened to fix my booster hose a week ago. 
Master cylinder was knackered, and I could get a good
idle woth the servo hose blocked, but not when
connected.  Tried to find the leak but the hose was
too old and shagged.  I got some universal heavy duty
hydraulic hose.  Not specific vacuum hose but I dont
think it will ever deform or get sucked in.  I ran
about 4.5 metres from the one way valve at the inlet
manifold to the plastic connector on the back of the
booster.  Cost about $10 aussie /mtr

Made a HUUUUUGE difference to my engine (1600 t1) and
the way it runs under load, mixtures better, brakes
waay better.  

Changed the M/C and reckon I could outbrake Colin
Mcrae and stuff it up the inside.... well maybe not
but the boosted brakes already have all reconed wheel
end stuff and I didnt think it would make that big a
difference, but it did.

My $0.02c worth.
