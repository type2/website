Well, the majority of vehicles on the road don't have antilock, and most
of them are running on tires less than four years old, even if the vehicle
is 30+ years old.  Yes, you should allow a bit more stopping distance, but
if your brakes are in good shape they should handle an 80-0 stop with
little problem.  Now if you are hot-footing it down a mountain road with
continual braking you might overheat them, but a single stop is well
within their design parameters.
