Not an expert but owned a 73 and 74 bus, both a year old and both had a
return spring that runs from the end of the accelerator cable holder
thingy (in the cross arm between the carburetors) to the body.  If you
stick your head in the engine compartment, and look at the rearmost body
panel just above the coil and the rear engine hatch, you'll see a tiny
hole, and maybe it still has the rubber grommet in it.  That's where the
other end of the return spring attaches.  Greg
