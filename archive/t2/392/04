Subject: Locksmith Needed!

Hi, 

	I sent an e-mail out a couple of months ago asking about a
locksmith. I had one person contact me, but I lost the original e-mail that
he sent me. If this is you, please contact me again. I am looking to have
all the locks on my bus re-keyed to a new set of keys.

I'm going to provide the lock cyls for the drivers side, and passenger side
door, the lock cyl for the hatch, and for the sliding door, and a total of 4
blank keys.

Let me know what you would charge. I'm looking to have this done in about 2
weeks... as in. I'll be ready to send them in two weeks.. but I won't need
them back for another month (if it takes that long).


Thanks!!!
