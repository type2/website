Subject: Re: [T2] emissions rich/lean

I had a similar high reading like that and it turned out to be a few
different problems.  First make sure you have even compression on all
cylinders.  I had bad rings on 2 cylinders causing a bad imbalance.
After fixing my compression problem I ended up having to replace 2 bad
injectors on the same cylinders that had the compression problem.  Also
make sure all of your hoses and connections are tight.  That means no
vacuum leaks at all.  I continually failed the CA emissions test until I
took the time to go through all my hoses and either replace or reseal
them.
 
Also do you have any info on NOx output?  What about the rest of the
numbers they gave you?  What state are you trying to pass emissions?
There are many factors that go into chasing down these problems but once
you solve them you will have a more efficient and better running engine.
