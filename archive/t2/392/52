Subject: Re: Installing interior wood panels

In my '71, I used repop chrome-button panel clips like the original westy panels.  I used cardboard templates to make the panels and I marked the 
original clip holes & so didn't have to drill a thing.  I think several of the online vendors carry the clips.
