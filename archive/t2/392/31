Subject: re changing steering coupler on a 70

Can anyone on here help me with changing the steering coupler disk on my 70? I
got some advice from Steven Dolan before, plus I have my Bentley handy, but
the bus is not co-operating(imagine that).
I have the column loose, the plate loose on the floor, the column goes up and
down somewhat.

How do I get the plate off the bottom of the column? I see pictures of the
column with no plate in the way, sitting on top of the coupler.

How do I get the plastic bushing out of there without breaking it?
In the Bentley, there is a horizontal clamp bolt that must be removed from
underneath. The advice I got only mentioned the four vertical bolts that come
out to slide the disk out.

Suggestions?
