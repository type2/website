Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

Terry,

need more info on this.

Every 3m one I have looked at 
http://products3.3m.com/catalog/HttpController?searcherrorchar=Please+enter+a+term+longer+than+1+character.&searcherrorterm=Please+enter+a+search+term&boundary=childsearch&node=LLZTGMM7V7ge&root=GST1T4S9TCgv&vroot=GSRXV6BQXBge&theme=us_mro_3_0&command=SearchOutlinkHandler&from=0&to=10&search=keyword&term=sandblasting&x=0&y=0

says *not* for sandblasting....why?

I've learned more about respirators today than I could ever imagine.
The ones at Lowe's(IIRC) also said the same thing....although it seems 
like if you buy one with a P100 particulate filter, that should 
cover it.

Part numbers?(model 5000, 6000 ,7000)?

I really need this as I have been doing a *lot* of sandblasting and powder 
coating lately.

Cheers, dave
