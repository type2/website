yes.

not sure what years, but my bus ('79) did not have it, but i pulled one from
a 76 which did. i think they were on a different key than the rest of the
bus, at least on my '76 parts bus this was the case.

i rekeyed my bus recently. it had a different ignition key, and the engine
door was different, so three keys for everything, no good.  i took the
cylinders from the parts bus, all of them, transferred to my bus, now it has
one key for everything, including the engine hatch lock.
