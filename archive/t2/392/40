Subject: Re: [T2] EFI maybe??

Brad,

There is a black wire that runs from the POS side of the coil to the
double-relay (IIRC) on the driver side of the firewall. If this wire is not
attached, the bus WILL NOT fire, it will turn over all day long though.

Ask me how I learned this lesson.

If you have spark at all 4 cylinders and you know there is gas in the system,
the chances or 4 clogged injectors is about nil. I would personally verify that
your electrical system is intact.

I would scour the ignition system first, points working? coil give bluish spark?
cap not cracked? etc...

Then dig into wires and connections: start with that black wire then follow each
connector and ground wire in the FI harness starting at the ECU on the passenger
side above the battery. If they are all connected, then you will have to dig
into FI troubleshooting.

www.type2.com has a great library for diagnostics too...
