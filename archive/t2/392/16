Subject: respirator for sandblasting?

Hi All,

I have a sandblaster.  I've used it before, but since I care about my lungs
enough to have quit smoking, I no longer want to sandblast without a
respirator.  The problem is that all the half masks and full masks in the
stores say "Do not use for sandblasting".  So I went looking around.  I seem
to be able to find a whole lot of respirators that say not to use for
sandblasting, but I'm not finding any that say that they were made for it.
How good is a PAPR for this?  I know it's not approved by NIOSH for
sandblasting in the workplace, but I have a 3M Breathe Easy unit with a hood
that only needs a battery ($200 battery - ouch) and filters.  But what kind
of filter do I use?  Is this a particulate only or should it be good for
organic vapors as well?  Is HEPA good enough?  What do y'all do to protect
your lungs while sandblasting?  I'll be sandblasting probably just a few
times a week after work until my project is done...

Thanks,
Jen
