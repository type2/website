Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door problem

Hi Elise,

The problem hard to diagnose from the info supplied... Is the handle 
turning at all? Is the door binding somewhere? There are two latches in 
the door and without more info it is hard to say where to start.

You may need to remove the ice-box fridge from inside the bus, it is 
held in place with bolts that go through the passenger seat bulkhead. 
Once it's unbolted it can be lifted up out of the way and it will be 
relatively easy to service the door from inside. Personally I find the 
icebox/sink to be more trouble than its worth, and I gave mine away 
years ago. Your mileage may vary.

Take the interior door panel off and look for a cable release mechanism 
running across the interior. This cable has a tension adjustment to 
keep the sleeve tight. Try pulling on the cable... this will activate 
the rear door latch and may open the door. Tighten the tensioner and 
replace the liner and you're done. If this doesn't fix the problem then 
it is either the rear slider mechanism (which is located under the 
beltline cover below the rear window) or with the front door latch.

Let us know how it goes.


Happy trails,
