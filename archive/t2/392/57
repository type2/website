Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

Howdy,
Thanks for your response, but I didn't mean I was going to use a paper mask - 
I meant PAPR - Positive Air Pressure Respirator. It has a battery powered 
pump, three filters and a hood, but not an entire suit. It is not a supplied 
air system, but it is positive pressure. The Pf (protection factor)is 1000.  
It is not as good as a suit, I'm sure, but It will have to do, I guess.  The 
unit was more expensive than my sandblaster.
Is a P3 HEPA filter best?

Thanks,
Jen
