Subject: Tjaspers Key Plea

Hey, Ted, you might mention what year type 2 the door handles are for, and 
what year type 2 you have (for the rear tail lights)

BTW, just why is it that you cannot re-key the door handle locks??  Will 
everyone have the same problem, that is, the handles are made such that they 
locks cannot be rekeyed.


And you should send along the key that works with the existing ignition.  
Otherwise, you will still be locked into two sets of  keys, one for the 
ignition and one for the four door locks.

And if that's OK with you, why not just send one of the new door handle 
keys, and the extra two door locks (sliding and rear hatch) to get them 
rekeyed to the new handles.

Rough day.  And if you also need the ignition rekeyed, a super rough day 
(check out the cost of a new ignition switch w/keys - )

Barry sends regrets.
