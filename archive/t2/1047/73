Subject: RE: [T2] '79 tranny same as 914 tranny? 

Couldnt you then just swape sides the planetary gear is on? I did this
accidentally one time when i replaced a shift fork in my bug an did in fact
have 4 revearse gears and one foreward gear. Heh i was pretty confused for a
second when i tried to take it for a quick test drive. In the bug at least it
will go in either way.

I think
they are reversed, might just be final drive but thought it
was in the tranny.
now if you want a 4sp reverse and 1speed forward
it is the perfect fit.
