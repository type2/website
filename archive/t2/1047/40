Ok, when you say tach drops, how are you measuring that?  Does that mean 
the engine died which would lead to the tach going to zero, or you 
actually lost tach signal?

Does this only happen off of a cold start or can you repeat this over 
and over?  What happens if you start the car back up and run it at 2k... 
does it die again?
