Subject: kustomising on TV

	I don't know whether the Discovery channel is simult out 
there in the real world, but the satellite for this part of the S. 
Pacific showed last night an episode 'That's All Volks' of Overhaulin 
-  a somewhat idiotic programme I've scarcely seen before  - 
plugging L.A. hotrod businesses e.g a VW parts shop in Huntingdon 
Beach, but especially body repairers/kustomisers.  The unfortunate 
target was a '64 splittie, and most of what was done to it was of 
dubious value.  The team boss was very keen to ease in 225 tyres, 
regretting that only 205s would fit readily; the general trend was 
towards a straight-line 1.9 L showpony with chromed huge alternator, 
but some ideas may be relevant to T2.
