Better Late than never on this.

I did this as well a couple years ago. Reversed them on my
1974 Westie (well, it's got a 1700 fuel injected motor in it) Automatic.
Welded Bottles on it and they are still on it today.
Didn't have any problems with an alternator or anything.
Mine are not that loud, I have good power (for an automatic bus)
and would do it again in a second.

I don't think I would do harley mufflers though.. aren't they supposed to be
loud?
If you do it, make sure to support the muffler with a bracket as well, not
just
the manifolds.  Any after all this time they aren't rusting :)

I had replaced mine with one of those empi 4 pipe jobbers and it was rusting
the next year. Not with this.

I don't have a problem with exhaust behind the bus, made sure the tips
extend out a little further than stock.  The older busses with upright motors
throw their exhaust straight back on some that I have seen.

I like it
James
