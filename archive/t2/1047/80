Subject: Generator Light

This is probably a simple question and I just haven't found it...

I have a 1971 Westy and the generator light is ON.
Checking the voltage with a meter I get 14+ volts.  So, it is charging and I
have been running it for months.

What triggers the light even though the generator is working?

Loose wire?  Bad ground?  Where?

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
