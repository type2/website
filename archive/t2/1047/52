Subject: re: initial setup and adjustment of hydraulic valve lifters on,

Abe, read this from Boston Bob.  The best treatise on hydraulic lifters 
I know of.  I set mine to zero clearance. If yours are are feeling 
squishy, back them off until very first contact is made (zero or .006 if 
you like), and run them that way for a few hundred miles before 
attempting to screw them in more.  Take a vacuum reading and listen to 
your engine every time you adjust them. If your vacuum drops after 
adjusting them back them off again and run them that way for a few 
hundred more miles.
