Subject: tank sealing

 Hi Ned,
         I have used "sloshing sealer" from the light aircraft industry with
good success.  Pull tank.  Empty gas. Clean out as much rust and debris as
possible  Remove any internal filters as they will be solidly clogged if you
dont.  Pour in sloshing sealer. Turn tank over and over so it gets a good
internal coating all over.  Pour out excess.  Ideally a gentle air supply is
fed into tank to help evaporate the solvents.  Of course, do this outside and
away from flame or ignition source.  Wait until it dries, may take a few
days.  Reinstall tank, and it will be good for a long time.  Excellent
product.
