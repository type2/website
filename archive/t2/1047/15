OK, so I haven't driven a bus in a long while, but I've been working on 
one bit by bit.  My '68 Westfalia is in the woods near Presidents Park, 
where I occasionally go to reinstall the interior pieces cruelly removed 
by a previous owner.  Good thing they kept it all, just too bad they 
removed it. 

Last time I was up I took a load of MP3's but the ones that rang best in 
the pines was a gravelly little outfit called Ass Pocket Full of 
Whiskey.  Does that count? 

And btw Bob, Yes I do ski.  Maniacally. Come to the Vail Camp 
http://www.adaptiveadventures.org/ and we'll have a blast.  Of course a 
wheeler would want a VW, it's about the best vehicle for a guy who wants 
to do all his own work /and/ everything is on the right level, no more 
cracked ribs from dangling over the front fenders looking down into an 
engine compartment.

The Femmes Rock,

Brad
