I have the same experience as Boston Bob. Sometimes you can NEVER get
them all functioning with 1.5 turns.  Must be an air bubble trapped and
never escaping, and expanding more than the oil as they heat up.

 >>>Then pull the covers off and see which ones are soft (press on the
bottom side of the rocker).  The ones that are hard can be tightened to
1.5 turns past contact.  Put the cover back on and run the engine some
more.  When the last ones have pumped up, adjust them to the correct 1.5
turns spec and enjoy your hydros.
