Subject: RE: [T2] Takes forever to stop

Todd; if you're comfortable with driving it enough to make this check, I'd
stop it as hard as you can three or four times in a big parking lot or
somewhere else free of traffic.  Immediately get out and feel the wheels to
see how hot they are.  The fronts should be warmer because they are doing
most of the work but all wheels should have heated from the brakes working.
Right and left should be equally warm front to rear.

Does the brake pedal hit the floor?

My first guess is that the brakes need to be bled, if the brake parts are
all new.

If I'm going like 50 miles an hour, it literally takes me forever to stop. I
mean, there are times that I'll be coming up at an intersection, and I'll be
doing about 30, and the brakes aren't stopping it as well as I think it
should, and I sometimes cut it close...

Is it just me, or is there something wrong with my brakes?
