And No, the 914 trans has completely different
 body mounting locations, as well as 5 speeds
 reverse in the bus.
The ring gear can be rotated over to correct that
but there are other difficulties to overcome.
Look at the shifter too.
A better swap would be a 901 gearbox from a 911.
As well as the engine.
