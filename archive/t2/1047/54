Ok.. so it wouldn't be a fuel problem as fuel wouldn't cause you to lose 
tach.  Now you need to figure out where the tach is getting lost.   
Maybe you should hook up a test light to the positive side of the coil 
to see if the voltage is disappearing at the same time.  Maybe you have 
an intermittent connection..
