Yes, you can swap a bus engine for a 914 engine.
The mounting pattern is exactly the same.
The depth of starter engagement is different.
You will need your bus flywheel, you can use
the 914 clutch plate and disc.
Notice the dipstick location.
The 914 fan housing is not fitted for the bus dipstick.
I don't think you would want the bus dipstick in a 914.
The engine tin is also 914, you will want bus tin.
The long block is a very easy swap.
