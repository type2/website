Subject: If it's not one thing...

I finally got some time to work on the Guac today. Found a vac leak at
one of the injectors. Took care of it, loaded my daughter in for a
test drive and.... Nothing. Well, not exactly nothing. I dragged my
left rear wheel down my driveway. There's a 4 ft skid mark. Apparently
the left drum is frozen/rusted/whatever.

Sigh.

I'll get the wheel off tomorrow. I wonder how much pb blaster the
shoes can absorb. ;-)
