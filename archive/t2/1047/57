Subject: Re: [T2] The Guac needs help...

Try a jumper wire straight to the coil from the positive post of the  
battery, disconnect the switched-power wire through the ignition  
switch.  If it quits crapping out, the problem is in the switched- 
power circuit .. if it still craps out, switched-power probably isn't  
the problem.

Another thought -- look at the wire from terminal #1 of the coil that  
goes into the FI harness -- that wire triggers the injectors, and if  
it's grounding out on the engine or body .. well, it's the same as  
pulling the green distributor/condenser wire off the coil.   
Electricity follows the shortest path to ground, and that'd be *much*  
shorter than all the way through the coil...
