Subject: initial setup and adjustment of hydrolic valve lifters on

Me engine was recently replaced with a rebuilt one that has hydraulic
lifters.  I was told to set the valves once after a few hundred miles of
initial breakin.  I assumed the procedure would be similar to regular (solid
lifter) procedure, but I find that it is hard to tell when they are set
correctly because (I think) the non-solid lifters have a lot of give in them
and keep accommodating ever larger feeler gauges by shortening in response
to the insertion of larger feeler gauges. I was especially concerened
because the #4 intake was very squishy and felt like it was supposed to be
open even when #4 cylendar was in firing position.



1)      Should I worry?  Will the magic of hydrolic lifters sort this out
for me?  Could I mis-adjust the valves and expect them to find the correct
setting on their own?

2)      If not, please describe what (if anything) should be done
differently from regular valves?  Is 0.006" the correct clearance?  I have a
sense the push rods can be compressed with minor pressure, how does one
handle this?
3)      I can't find anything on the web or in my books about hydrolic
lifters, everything just says they don't need adjustment, but I'm concerned.
I'm really not interested in wrecking this new engine. Also couldnt find
this in the archives.
