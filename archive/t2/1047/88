Subject: smog requirements in Vegas for 77?

I'm thinking of registering/storing my 77 Westy at a friends house in Vegas.

Does anyone know about the smog test procedure there for old vehicles?

Do they do a visual check on engine components like in California?  Or just a tailpipe/dyno test? 

My bus has dual carburetors, not fuel injection.  The engine runs clean, I just don't want to install fuel injection simply to pass a test....
