hey guys  you have a volt meter ,just run the tests. take the 2 wires  off 
the gen. hook your hot wire to B+ and use a small jumper wire to hook to Df  and 
connect it to the neg lead of metter start the engine and rev up some. touch  
the neg/jumper wire to the body of the gen. do not leave touching too long. 
it  should jump up to around 36 volts. If not gen is bad.  if it does hook the  
2 wires back up and go to the regulator. unplug the big red wire or wires on 
B+  , if there are 2 wires you need to hook then together . connect the 
postive lead  of meter to the B+ on regulator and the ground to a body ground. . 
start the  engine and rev  voltage should be around 13.5 to 14.5 V.If lower then  
regulator is bad.   Also check the grounds at the gen and that the  regulator 
is grounded to the body   later and have fun  mark  d
