hyd lifters are set totally different from the solids.

. at TDC, screw rocker in til it just touches the valve stem, then
turn 1 and 1/2 more turns in.  the lifter should be slightly
compressed.

repeat this on all valves in all positions, then try engine, might be
slgihtly noisy at first but should be quiet after a minute or two.

may need to reset after a few thousand miles, then check maybe once a
year
