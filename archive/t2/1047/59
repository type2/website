Subject: Transmission Woes and my Bus is awesome.

Just wanted to let everyone know that my VW Bus is awesome. I only drive it maybe once or twice a month, but whenever I do, the excitement comes right back. Not like Pontiac excitement, but like easy going, relaxed excitement... 

Which brings me to my question. My transmission is really hard to shift. Getting it into pretty much any gear (except reverse) is really difficult. Third and fourth are a little bit easier, but getting it into 2nd is nearly impossible. I have a new shift plate, I've got a new bushing thing (that block with the square metal bracket that has the rubber bushing in it). But it's still really hard to shift. I basically have to fiddle with it for several seconds before I can get it into gear, and if I'm not going the exact right speed for that gear, it won't allow me to put it into that gear. 

Any idea what the problem could be? Is it that the shift linkage just needs to be adjusted? Or is it more likely a problem with the synchros? If that's the case, what options do I have? Do I just get another transmission? I'd really love to be able to drive this bus, but because of those problems, I'm nervous about even taking it around the block.

Thanks!!!
