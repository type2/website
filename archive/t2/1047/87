So I  have had my '69 since Febuary of this year. I had some minor problems
with  it for about the first month I had it. ie. starter, Gen, voltage
regulator,  So most of my electronics have been replaced. It had a electronic
ignation  on it when I got it but it wasnt being nice and overing heating my
coil. It  came off and shes running happy now. I kinda miss the way it ran 
with
it on  there though so question one is where should I look at getting one  and
which ones work well. Question two may be a you have a bus now so its  normal
answer and thats ok. There is always a small coating of gas on  everthing
around the carb and a puddle to the left of it. I have rebuilt  the carb a few
times and it hasnt done anything. My air mix screw doesnt  seem to do anything
either so that may be the cause of the problem and I'm  not sure how to fix 
it.
Thanks for any input I'm always looking for things.  




hey   i preferr the crane fireball xr700  ingnition  system.   sounds like 
you need a new carb, do not get a reman carb get  new.  replace all the fuel 
lines with good fuel line when doing this, I  also hope you have a fire 
extinguisher and have it mounted where you can get to  it in a hurry if needed.  Old 
saying  "rust gets them slowly,  Fire gets them quick"  later   mark d
