I am on the road on the West Coast, but am from
Cambridge.  Assuming they will have to get towed
somewhere, Wood's in Allston is fine but I like
Metric Systems in Cambridge or Greg's in Natick.
For situations as described, I recommend Greg.

Greg's Repair
800-439-1679
47B Summer Street
Natick, MA 01760

Note that his shop is on a main commuter rail
line, so Boston's extensive public transit is
just as reachable as it is for the other two
(though dogs are never welcome on any public
transit).  I've never stayed in it, but there
is a campground in Natick (Pine Hollow).

If ending up at Metric Systems, make sure you
ask for Whitey.
