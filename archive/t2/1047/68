That sounds like synchros. Second gear tends to "get it worst of all"
because it gets more use as you pass up and down the gears. Does it get
easier to shift when it warms up?

Synchros means rebuild or find a good used gearbox. Others will probably
chime in about trying synthetic oil to improve shifting. I haven't tried
it myself.
