Subject: desired AFM at idle

I have access to a oxygen sensor-based meter that measures AFM in the
exhaust.  I can't find any indication of what the target AFM is at idle.
I'm assuming that once fully warmed up it should be right around 14.7 but am
unable to find this in writing. I have 1977 VW California emissions, sensor
is before the catalytic converter, automatic transmission.

Thanks in advance.
