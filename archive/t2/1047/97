Subject: Please help me diagnose cause of loud droning noise

I have this loud noise coming out of my bus on the freeway, I thought there was something wrong with my new exhaust, but last night I noticed that it nearly goes away when I am turning right.

It has that bad performance muffler sound, the drone, it does it when I am going straight or turning left and is obvious when I am going over 35 mph.

After noticing that it went away while taking the right hand sweeping turns I pushed the clutch in and out and figured out that I could barely hear my engine under the noise.

Possibly not connected, yesterday while putting around SE Portland doing a few errands I heard a thumping noise and could feel it, my passenger could hear it but not feel it, I tuned on to a different street and it was still there, so I don't think it was pavement related, it went away after a few minutes and I couldn't reproduce it.  When I noticed this thumping I was going under 15 mph.  I think it did change with speed.

I need to get this fixed quickly (school and 2 jobs, that old line), any information on related experiences and their outcomes will be greatly appreciated.

I was going to get pissy with the guy at the exhaust shop the next chance I had.....

Thank you,

James in Portland, Oregon
