So I have had my '69 since Febuary of this year. I had some minor problems
with it for about the first month I had it. ie. starter, Gen, voltage
regulator, So most of my electronics have been replaced. It had a electronic
ignation on it when I got it but it wasnt being nice and overing heating my
coil. It came off and shes running happy now. I kinda miss the way it ran with
it on there though so question one is where should I look at getting one and
which ones work well. Question two may be a you have a bus now so its normal
answer and thats ok. There is always a small coating of gas on everthing
around the carb and a puddle to the left of it. I have rebuilt the carb a few
times and it hasnt done anything. My air mix screw doesnt seem to do anything
either so that may be the cause of the problem and I'm not sure how to fix it.
Thanks for any input I'm always looking for things.
