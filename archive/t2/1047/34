Subject: My Bus for sale (take 2)

Ok, so something weird happened and the message I sent showed up as 
unreadable...

Let's try this again:


Hi All,

So, after a long and hard  bit of contemplating I've decided to sell my bus.

She's a 1979 California model with fully working sunroof!

I pulled the engine (b/c it failed emissions). I've replaced the O2 
sensor, cleaned everything (heads fuel injectors, etc.) and got the tin 
(some of it) powder coated.

All new pushrods, pushrod tubes, spark plugs, wires, etc.

I have a ton of brand new replacement parts (clutch/ebrake cables, 
plugs, oil filter, etc.) for when things need to be replaced.

I took everything out of the bues and started to sound proof it. I've 
been diligent about removing any rust in the process.

If you live in Philly, and need a space to work, then you can take over 
the space that I rent in East Falls.

I wish that I had the time, money, and expertise to quickly finish my 
project and start driving again but time seems to be something I don't 
have alot of.

Here's some pics:

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I have all documentation about the bus, including everything the PO gave 
to me.

Cheers,
Harry
