Subject: Takes forever to stop

Hey guys,

      Just thought of another thing that I'd like to take care of. The brakes in my VW Bus are horrible. This is my first Bus, so I don't have enough experience with them to know if it's normal or not, but I really have to apply a TON of pressure in order to get the Bus to stop. Whenever I apply the brakes, I can hear the engine revving up a little bit (I assume this is because I am using engine vacuum for the brake booster).

I have a 73, so I have DISC brakes in the front and drums in the rear. They "appear" to be working normally, and all the pieces are basically new within the past 3,000 miles. 

Anything I should look at?


If I'm going like 50 miles an hour, it literally takes me forever to stop. I mean, there are times that I'll be coming up at an intersection, and I'll be doing about 30, and the brakes aren't stopping it as well as I think it should, and I sometimes cut it close...

Is it just me, or is there something wrong with my brakes?

Just for comparisson sake, my 2002 Crown Victoria stops in 1/10th the distance. It does have four wheel disc brakes, but I figured due to weight, it would be the best to compare it?


Thanks!!!


Todd
