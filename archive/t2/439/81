Subject: Stripped plug thread in UK solved

Hi all
Many thanks for all those who replied last week. I managed to get a garage
local to where I work to put in a helicoil yesterday. They were able to do
it with the engine in which was good as they had not planed on removing the
engine that day. Remember this is a type 1 engine and number 2 plug is not
the easiest to get to as it is under the air cleaner bracket. Swarf was
removed by a combination of vacuuming out and coating tap in grease.
Hopefully if there are any small bits left over after that they will get
blown out through the exhaust. With any luck this should last another 2000
miles when I can remove engine and rebuild for unleaded. However I think
I'll take some of that JB Weld stuff just in case it decides to come out
again. I'm so glad this has resolved itself as  at one point it was looking
like a trip with the J**P and a tent. No substitute.

Thanks
