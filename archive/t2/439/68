Subject: horn no beep

Horn hasn't worked in a while.  Got a working horn ... but horn still not 
beeping.  How do i begin tracking down this problem?  I've got a multimeter 
and the idea to check the signal at the steering end and horn end of the 
circuit.  Where can this circuit go wrong?

thanks,
