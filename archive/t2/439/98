There are a couple points where I would differ.  On an absolutely unknown
engine, I would adjust the valves to .008 rather than .006.  They might
clatter, but they would run and there would be no chance of burning them.
I would also insist on 15" of vacuum. 10" will get the engine running,
but it would not idle there and would overheat in short order.

I am surprised this is not in your library but I could not find it there.

It was the fifth article for me searching "dolan procedure."  You can move
it to the top by searching for "dolan procedure basic engine"  Searching
effectively is a definite art.  It would be helpful if the person in
charge of the archive would set up a pick box for "search only in
(subject/body)" and if the summaries displayed did not start at the
beginning of the header.  They are bloody useless for selecting posts as
they are.

                             OOK!
