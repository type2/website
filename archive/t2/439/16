Subject: RE: [T2] 68--To 79 Type 2 & Vanagon Westfalia Accessory Window

I love the boot, that is much better than fabricating something heavy to put
around the ac unit. The mounting is also very slick and easy to store.

Have any suggestions for mounting on a 73 Westy that does not have the
luggage rack in the front? 

I was thinking of a tray the hooked onto the door at the bottom of the
window. This tray would hold the ac unit. Under the tray have some support
legs that got straight down the door, padded of course. I am not sure of the
length to stop the door from being dented by the weight. Storing this would
be somewhat of a pain unless collapsible. Just some thoughts I am still
trying to work out in my head.

I will not have time to try until next summer. I am to busy trying to get
this gas heater installed and saving up $1300 for a new complete AC system
for the bus. Anybody ever use a system from Gilmore Enterprises? they make
complete kits for bugs, and busses. They are just finishing up the mounting
bracket for the T4 engine. The kit comes with everything, even the under
dash blower for $1300. What about other systems, anybody ever get a kit from
somebody else? How do you like it?
