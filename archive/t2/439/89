 in this same picture (how convenient!, thanks
 Jason!), does anyone know 
 where I can find the flexible accordian looking tube
 that joins to the 
 right side of the heater fan?  (it connects it to
 the plastic tube that 
 runs over to the right which connects to a metal
 tube which goes to the 
 heat exchanger.)  Or are there other solutions for
 replacing this NLA

Piece of cake!
That plastic hose has been replaced by a paper one
that resembles the left hose. But it mimics the right
one perfectly. It is part # 211 261 236A. Bus Depot
has it for around $5. Check at your local VW parts
stores locally.  The left hose is part # 211 261 235A.
They are 2 diferent diameters, so you cannot
interchange them. The right one has the oval end to
slide on the plastic lower tube.
