Subject: nose crunch pictures posted

Well, here are the pictures of the nose damage to the bus. I also took a
few shots of the little dings and scrapes and start of surface rust that
is showing up. 

I will be getting a check cut to me this week for $2800, to pay for the
damage to the nose. Any chance that if I can find the right place, I can
get all of this fixed for this price? I don't care so much if the body
isn't perfectly straight or not, I just want to get it back into shape
and repainted. A little wavy and I won't be too concerned about it.


This is in or around the San Francisco area, and why the cost was
probably estimated to be so high. Maybe I can take it out of city/state
and get the word done cheaper. 

Thanks,
Christopher
