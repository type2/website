that is a great & truly useful article.

i was wondering, as a kind of guide to go along with it,
does anyone have a list of all the tools that would be 
needed to complete the procedures listed?

or i guess an easier answer - what would be the "Muir equivalent"?
(ex: Phase I, Phase II, etc.)

i would like to get all of the necessary ones together & make
sure i have them in the bus(es).

TIA,
