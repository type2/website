Subject: isolator , locating.. solution found 

Ok, with some help from you guys, the wiring schematics and some diggin 
around the regulator was hiding behind something else. My engine compartment 
is a bit more 'cluttered' lol.

Just talked to the battery guy as well and it seems that my issue shouldn't 
be too hard to fix and implement.  The red wire comes off the alternator 
which I splice into and connect to the Battery Isolator. Since the main 
battery is already in a circuit I don't have to separate it and connect to 
the isolator (it will charge normally).  The isolator will keep the other 
battery separate and charge it when needed.

This sound, 'sound'?  I'm far from the electrical engineer I wish I was.
The other battery is about 70% charged from the store.. should i charge it 
up before connecting it to the van?

Thanks for all the help.

James
