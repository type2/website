Subject: New (old) question: Isolator VS. Relay

Okay~ I thought I had this decision made:-( I want to wire my second
battery in the next few weeks. I did a lot of research from the type2
library. From what I can understand, for the VW westy the relay is the
best option for casual use. Ron from "bus depot" forwarded an email
describing the advantage of the relay over the isolator. One obvious
reason is that if the diode dies it will drain the starting battery
without letting you know. Also the wiring is maybe to heavy a gauge for
the charging system of these 27ish year old vehicles. I have both a
Bosch relay from "bus depot" and this isolator kit from JC Whitney.

Please can I have some help with the decision on which would be best to
use and why. Maybe I don't understand, well obviously:-)

Oh I have not purchased the second battery either if someone has
specific suggestion with a setup. I have a 1977 westy. I basically want
to run the radio, interior light and the outlet inside as well as the
lighter plug for a fan etc.

Much help is grately appreciated.

Peace

Meg
