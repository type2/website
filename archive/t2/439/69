Mike and list,

This simply is not true.  The breathers on the heads are a must for D-jet!
It is one of the main imputs for the fuel mixture to be right...and it is
NOT true that all 412, 411 and 914's had this.  In 74 all went to L-jet
(afc) except the 914 and the 412 with the manual transmission.  The 914's
followed suit shortly thereafter.  Any good vw book shows this with the
engine codes.

It really is not a matter of what you are familiar with when it comes to
FI.....yes, D-jet was an improvement over carbs, but is tricky to diagnose,
especially for someone new to it.  AFC is much easier, but still many folks
are afraid of it as well.

So before you know it all, know it all.
