Subject: Re: [T2] FI Idle mixture ?

Wow cool! My problem is we went to Yosemite and parked overnight and the van 
would not start in the morning and it was cold out. Yosemite has a mechanic on 
staff and a gargage. The mechanic said he leaned out the mixture for me (I 
had completely flooded he car trying to start it) but after that the van would 
not start unless I stepped on the gas pedal. I do not think he knew about the 
cold start valve, and neither did I at the time. I just wanted my car to start 
like it did before.   Laura :o)
