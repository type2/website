Subject: New member - Question (Battery Isolator)

Just found the list.. looks like a good source of information.

Background: I have a 78 bus w/ 1700cc fi motor.
Question: I am trying to install a battery isolator in the unit. I have one 
(90amp) and a deep cycle battery I am going to use. However I simply cannot 
find the regulator in the engine compartment to hook it up to.  The crappy 
haynes manual is no help.  I have been told it should be mounted at the back 
on the firewall. A silver little box with 3 wires into it. I can't find it.

The main battery is on the passenger side (rear) of the vehicle. A single 
thick wire comes from the positive on the battery and shoots behind the 
firewall.

Any insight or help regarding this would be fantastic.
