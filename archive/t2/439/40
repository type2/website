I highly recommend buying a tone finder-type wire tracing tool.  These
allow you to trace wires by hooking up a tone generator (using an alligator
clip) to the wire you wish to trace, and then using a tone finder "somewhere
else" to find the other end of the wire... as the finder gets closer to the
wire, you'll be able to faintly hear the tone, getting louder as you zero in.
Finally, if you touch the tone finder to the traced wire's insulation, you'll
hear the tone quite loud and clear.

These things are invaluable when trying to trace down wires where you can't
see the path.  You should be able to get one at any electronics store that
sells telco/networking equipment (Fry's Electronics in the San Francisco Bay
Area has them, near the RJ crimping tools and other telco-related stuff; I
bet you could find them at Home Depot, too).  The one I have is called "Fox
and Hound".
