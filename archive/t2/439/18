A few weeks ago, there was a thread describing the merits of a 
certain type of motorcycle jack for pulling the engine from a Type II.

I bought one and yesterday I used if for the first time. I'm just 
thrilled. I could not believe how easy it was to pull the engine out 
and push it back in. No balancing left / right and front / rear. No 
juggling to make the studs line up with the bell housing. The only, 
and very minor, disadvantage is that the wheels protrude from the 
jack frame just a cm or two. It requires a smooth surface like a 
paved driveway to roll it.

I highly recommend this item. Thanks to a tip from a number of very 
helpful list members, I got it by mail order from Harbor Freight for 
$71 total!  It is just great.

Jack
