I'll concede the L-jet being easier just based on the fact that it was a
new, improved FI and is still largely in use on many of today's modern
vehicles while the d-Jet was pretty much discontinued by the mid-70's.

I don't see how they can have anything to do with fuel mixture.  They have
hoses that "T" into to the flash-back valve that has a 3rd hose that goes to
the NON-pressurized air distribution box (so you're not sucking non-filtered
air into your heads).  Has nothing to do with fuel mixture and the FI system
will perform the same with or without it.

All US model 914's with the 1970-1973 1.7 (engine codes W, EA, EB) and
1973-1976 914's with 2.0 motor (codes GA, GC) had D-jet FI while all of the
US model 1974-1975 914's with 1.8 (code EC) used L-jet.  There is evidence
that some of the European models had carberetor(s), but I can't say for
sure.

So as you say, "So before you know it all, know it all."  :)
