Yes, but that Trike won't. 
Just open the sliding door
.......and it slips right in :)
If you are exchanging the engine,
then you need to keep the v-gon tin
and swap the v-gon exhaust.
Keep the v-gon flywheel and fan housing,
alternator,oil filler and dipstick.
Fit the v-gon air cleaner to your 78 AFM.
I'm doing this in my head-
Can't you just go outside and look :) ???
