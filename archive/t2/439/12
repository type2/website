Subject: Distributer timing

I have a distributer with a vacuum advance and retard diaphram
part no 0 231 173 007
     VW 021 905 205 F



does anyone know a proper timing setting and let me know if it is with which 
hoses connected disconnected etc.

I suspect it is not set properly.  It is on a 1700cc FI engine. it starts up 
right away and stalls about three times and the fourth time stays running.  
I have already changed the cold start injector, same result???  runs good and 
strong when warmed up. this is during hot summer days and cold spring days as 
well
