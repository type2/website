That picture is great for my question, can anybody tell me if you can remove
the large round black thing just to the right of the voltage regulator? I
assume that it is there to allow access to the filler tubes, since mine
should be right behind it. How can this be removed and put back in? Any
other way to get to the filler tube?

Thanks,
Corbett
