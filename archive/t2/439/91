Paul, you need to have the little flaps in there.  That stops hot air from 
coming up the paper hoses and out of the heater fan opening when the fan's 
not running.  If this hot air is allowed up there, it will come out of the 
heater fan opening and get sucked back into the main engine fan.  I know 
it's relatively only a little heat, but every little amount helps when it 
comes to keeping our engines at cool temps.  I have a metal fan in my 74 SC 
and a plastic fan in my 79 camper.  My 74 was missing a flap but I made one 
from a small sheet of metal and it works great.  greg
