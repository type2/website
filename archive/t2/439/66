Jim had wisely said...

... 	If you are running a less expensive "diode-type" isolator, you are
also going to face another problem (don't shoot me, m'kay...), which is
compounded by the need for a higher charging voltage when are running "new
school" maintenance free batteries.  The diode isolator will cause a voltage
drop across it (ouch!)   ...     If you want a better quality isolator which 
WON'T cause voltage
drops, check out Hellroaring Technologies in beautiful Polson, MT - they're
on the web (though I haven't checked recently).

...

Thanks Jim,
No shooting needed :-)  I happened to come across the same information you
just gave in an article I read online.  The Isolator I got isn't a cheapee 
as my friend
is nicely and continually pointing out for me. (He bought it under a staff 
discount).
So I believe that the isolator should be ok for this job. If it doesn't I 
will check into a
new regulator able to crank out a little bit more. If I remember right it's 
a
Cole Hersee unit. I'll try it and see what happens.

Staying stock is alright.. but curiousity and a twisted sense of ambition 
usually
sends the stock thoughts out the window.
