Subject: can't seem to get bus started

I've been messing with my 69 for months now. I originally had a 009 on the 
bus and after setting timing and adjusting the carb (per the method on one of 
the websites I was referred to by the list I think it was Kens Buggy Barn) my 
bus seemed to hesitate and run worse than it did before. Several list members 
told me that was the nature of the 009. So I decided to get an OG dizzy 
(used). Got the 205T dizzy, made sure the vacuum adv was working, replaced 
the condensor/points, internal ground wire, cap/rotor, I even had to take out 
the drive gear and put in the 3mm thick shim and made sure (I think) that the 
drive gear was in properly as far as is alignment. Took off the valve cover 
to make sure timing marks on the pulley were dead on and now I have a 
question; When the timing mark on the pulley is lined up with the case, where 
in the range of motion of the #1 intake valve should it be? Because when I 
turned the motor over by hand (wrench), where the intake valve bottomed out 
(fully open) the timing mark on the pulley was 90 degrees to the left. I got 
a buddy over to help me and we got it started but it ran rough/rich and 
backfired alot, ran for a while with the throttle sprung open a little to 
make it idle. Buddy went home, bus shut off, no start no more.

I don't fully understand because the motor didn't run bad really with the 
009, I just wanted to get rid of the hesitation. So why so much trouble with 
the 205T?

So I put the 009 back on checked everything and no start. Bus does smell to 
be dunping too much gas though.Please help!! I feel this is something real 
simple that I am overlooking and when it is discovered I'm gonna slap myself.
