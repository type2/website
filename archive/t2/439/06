Subject: Re: [T2] luggage rack seal fit

I found the same problem with mine. To much air pushed under the luggage
rack= alot of noise and vibration when the wind is blowing just right at the
front while driving. It also seems to push more air clear back to the
pop-top and I can feel the air leak in past the canvas. Not something I want
this winter as that cold air falls right down on you. What I thought about
doing is buying some of the pop-top seal and cutting the bulb just on the
sides so that the water would still drain but keep some of that extra air
out.

Others sell the clip with the neoprene bulb. I'm thinking that the bulb is
the best solution to get air out with some parts cut out to permit drainage.
