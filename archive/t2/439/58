So do your power brakes work better also?

Fortunately, my creative mechanic friend followed the vacuum line from
the
manifold to the booster.  Somewhere under the Bus he found a spot in the
line where a previous owner had spliced in a plastic "t".  One end of
the
"t" was open.  There is your vacuum leak!  Problem solved.
