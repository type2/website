Subject: Terryville CT show results :-)

Wow, after having a terrible week, I sure had a nice surprise awaiting my inbox this morning.......I entered my 85' into the Terryville show last week, and figuring that I hadn't won, because I never do, I left before the awards ceremony. I emailed the guy in charge of the show just to see how I did, to see if I could get my results to improve upon the bus according to the show survey, and he told me that I had taken 3rd in my class.....Figures that the one time I leave before awards that I actually take a place......I just thought that rocked, and that I would pass on my good news and vibes to everyone else...........
