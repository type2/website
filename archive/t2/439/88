Subject: Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use

I am in need of a new oil pump for Possum and I did a little searching.
Aircooled.net has some 30mm pumps they recommend for type 4. But they
mention something about high pressures when cold(200psi) and having to
maybe modify the oil pressre relief valve. Don't know if I want to do that.
I am adding an external cooler with thermostat since I like to tow a small
sailboat and want to keep it cool. Aircooled's pumps are $30.00, pretty
good I say. So then looked at Bus Depot, been pretty happy with Ron's
stuff. They list a Melling Pump for about $70.00. More than twice the pump
at Aircooled.net but which one should I use? I like the idea of spending
$30 over $70, but I want the better pump too. Any help here in making this
choice would be nice. Also Bus Depot sells an Oil Pressure Booster kit any
idea what that is all about? I am getting low oil pressure when the bus
warms up at idle. Say 10-15 lbs at idle when oil temps are at 210-225.
Strong pressure on startup 60lbs. Running at 65-70mph when temps are in the
210-225 range I get about 25-30lbs sometimes less. I say thats not so good?
