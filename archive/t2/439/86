Subject: part needed

in this same picture (how convenient!, thanks Jason!), does anyone know 
where I can find the flexible accordian looking tube that joins to the 
right side of the heater fan?  (it connects it to the plastic tube that 
runs over to the right which connects to a metal tube which goes to the 
heat exchanger.)  Or are there other solutions for replacing this NLA 
part?  tx, Greg
