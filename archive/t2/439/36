it just pops out and snaps back in, use a fine blade screwdriver under an
edge, work it around until it pops free.

well the Elctronic control unit ECU is behind there too, so you would have
to remove the ECU to get to the filler tube, I replaced my filler tube
when the engine was out and I could also get to it from beside the tank
with the firewall removed.,   but of all the jobs I have ever done on my
bus and I think I have done most of em, this had to be the biggest PITA
job with the highest (-at-)(-at-)**#*$&(-at-)(-at-) language rating...simple job in a gawd
awefull location,  give yourself plenty of time, like all day, and take
your time,, take breaks, and have a 6 ppack cooling for when finally
finished.  and stubby screwdrivers were a blessing, get some new ones 
that are nice and sharp and square and free of blemishes


good luck
