This is a Federal version engine.  I've never understood why they didn't 
create different wiring diagrams for California and Federal variations, but 
they didn't.  Instead, the California-only components - ICU, Oxy relay, 
etc. - are all there, but with an asterisk, indicating California-only. 
You'd think they'd also show an external resistor pack, with terminal 
numbers, and a double asterisk for Federal only, but they don't.
