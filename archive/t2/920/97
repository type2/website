Yea I don't post much anymore I just lurk. I figured I best chime in or a
certain somebody would have him thinking "it's a piece of cake". Most repop
parts have to be worked to fit but that's just the way it has been for
years. You try to figure out who has the best fit and how to deal with their
shortcomings. Fabbing parts is not that big a deal to me as I have done
several bays and even more splits in the last 10 years. I buy what I can use
fairly easy and fab the rest. We now have a good source for split parts
getting geared up so I'm phasing out my parts business and getting back to
the resto shop where I started.
