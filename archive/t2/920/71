Subject: Bought correct rocker panels, but the bend is not what I

I bought the rocker panel for the drivers side of my 77 Westy, and the Danish part

 http://www.cip1.ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=TAB%2D402%2D501

does not have nearly as much curve as the body does. It's the one that is 6" high. If I clamp the bottom of it to the bottom of the Westy the top of the new panel is bent out at least 4 inches. Is this just normal, and they expect me to curve it around? I've never done this before so it's all new to me. I thought it would be pretty much identical to the bend the original section has.
Thanks,
Courtney
