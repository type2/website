Subject: heater box question

I was recently having lunch with an old friend who had a bus a few years
ago.  He asked if I had my heater boxes replaced due to asbestos.  He said
that about 5 years ago he received a notice about asbestos and he contacted
whoever it was that sent the letter and they flew a guy out to Sioux Falls,
trailered his bus, took it to a local dealership and replaced the heater
boxes - all for no charge.

I was just wondering if anyone else experienced something like this or
knows anything about this and if there is more information available.
