Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure

The oil light is pressure, not level.  While,
obviously, if you have no oil you will have no
pressure, having a marginal amount of oil doesn't
mean you will have a marginal amount of oil
pressure.  

My last T4 oil light flickered when I took it up
mountains (heating it up) and had too thin oil
(10w30) that persumably sheared under the heat. 
I went to thicker oil, no problem.  If I were in
your boat, I'd be looking at overheating
(cooling, fuel, and tuning) or other pressure
problems more than the amount of oil.
