Subject: Late Bay Seat Padding

Hey;

I'd like to re-cover the front seats on my '79 Westy this winter.   
I'm looking for a recommendation which supplier can provide the  
contoured foam for the seat.  I'm looking for top quality and want it  
to look like original equiment.

Thanks,

Tim
'79 Westy
