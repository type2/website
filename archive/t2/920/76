I had the same problem with bus depot. About 1.5 years ago.
Chris, you can rotate the piston if once installed the bleeder screw
is at the top of the caliper.

Use air to remove the piston, turn it (with you hands) and put it back in.

I use no special too to do this. Other than wood and a foot air pump.
