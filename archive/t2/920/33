Subject: Re: [T2] Good wipers?

I bought 8 sets of Michelin blades for my Vans BMW and Bus thinking that
it would be the long term solution---

Michelin---

Yea Baby----


Nope---

Wrong answer.

They are doing the wiper blade mambo already--and only 4 months old--

I heard about some clear big dollar blades that were supposed to be the
answer---

Anyone here ever hear or try the $30.00 blades?
