Subject: Carbs : Driving into elevations?

Hi all,

Our bus is the first carbureted car I have owned so new knowledge base
to build.

'68 VW Riviera w/ dual 32-34 PDSITs (I believe) on an upright 2L.

We live in the Portland OR area, 500' elevation.

My question is when driving into the mountains upto 6000' what can I
expect?

Pinging?
Mixture to go rich?  Danger of over-heating?
Would Carbs or timing need adjusted along the way?

Should I be concerned at all?

-Greg
