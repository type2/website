Subject: Re: [T2] Good wipers?

I agree with Mark.  I can remember 25 years back you could get a set of
wiper blades to last almost 2 years, even in the Ozone-rich/Smoggy SoCal/Los
Angeles area.  The quality of rubber on replacement wiper blades since then
has really gone downhill.  Even ANCO (which I always recommended over Bosch,
etc.,) has gone to crappy rubber.  I always replace my blades in October and
then again in April.  It's a ritual.

What's weird is the blades on my 2 year old Kia Spectra EX are still like
brand new.  Go figure.:-P
