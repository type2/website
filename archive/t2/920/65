Volks,
	Chris got a good bashing from the list for including a vendor in his 
gripe. Perhaps it's inappropriate and should have not included the name, 
but if you want to publicly bash someone please include an answer to his 
question, which is what he really wanted to know.

Chris,
	I have rebuilt pistons on my old MB and hopefully this information will 
carry over to the bus calipers. I didn't get my pistons aligned very 
well and had to readjust them after assembly. There was a section of the 
piston surface that contacted the pad that was raised. I used a file 
pressed against this edge to rotate the piston to the correct angle. I 
had just rebuilt this so there was still assembly lube on the seals 
which might make it easier to rotate, but worth a try. Good luck!
