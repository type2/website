Subject: ADMIN: Mailing lists will be down this weekend

Listees,

On October 7th, the VintageBus and Type2 mailing lists, as well
as the type2.com and vintagebus.com web sites, will be down for
2 to 3 days while the computer that hosts them is moved to a new
location.

You do not need to do anything.  All of the mailing lists will
still work and send mail to all current subscribers once the
server is turned on in the new location.  You just won't receive
any mail from the lists, or be able to send any mail to the lists,
for a few days.  The www.type2.com and www.vintagebus.com websites
will also be affected.

Please contact me offlist at mattroberds(-at-)cox.net if you have any
questions.

Our ISP, Atlasta Networks, is moving to a different hosting facility.
They're moving from the Level3 facility in San Diego to the Integra
facility in Seattle.  Atlasta is based in Seattle, but a few years
ago, the San Diego data center was a better deal.  That has changed,
so the server is moving.  The server will be securely packaged and
shipped to Seattle via private courier, along with other hardware
from Atlasta.

When I find out what it will be, I will post our new IP address.  The
DNS records will be updated as needed, so the change will be mostly
transparent, but some people may need or want the new IP address.

Again, contact me offlist at mattroberds(-at-)cox.net if you have any
questions.

Thanks!
