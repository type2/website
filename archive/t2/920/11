Subject: Re: [T2] ADMIN: Mailing lists will be down this weekend

Hi Matt,

Is this a good time to break out the "standby" backup Yahoo group???

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/type2-temp/

This would be helpful for those with a dire need for info or urgent  
need for Assistance.  I know I'll be traveling home from John Brown's  
Buses at that time and it would be useful to know that I could still  
find help if needed.
