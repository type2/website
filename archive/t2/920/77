Subject: rocker panel... bend is not what I expected

When I first did some T2 rocker panels a gazillion years ago, it flipped me out 
at first, because the curvature of the replacement part was quite a bit less 
than the curvature of the original (factory installed) part.  Just get yourself 
several pairs of Vise Grips with 3" or 4" faces; spot weld at the top; then 
pull the panel around and clamp at the bottom; last, finish welding 
everyplace....
