Subject: Re: Good wipers?

I've found that the wipers and Rain-X don't actually make too much of a 
difference, because the windshield is old and nearly vertical. It has far 
more micro-scratches and pits in it than other older models of autos.

I used some rubbing compound (about 3 bucks a tin) on the paint to take off 
a lot of the pollution and grumph that was there before waxing. It worked so 
well, I figured - why not? - and tried the rubbing compound on the 
windshield too. I used a rotary buffer to help make quick and even work of 
it. It was a big improvement. All the teeny, tiny scratches are gone, 
windshield is clear and shiny, and only the larger pits on the shield show 
up when it rains.

I may do it again and then get new wipers this weekend.
