Hi Volks,

I can't believe that no-one has posted this yet...

RAIN-X works much better than even new wipers, because it treats the  
entire windshield. I usually treat the bus twice a year with the  
stuff and the raindrops run off like there's a forcefield in place.  
No wiping required. It's excellent.

Now if only they would come up with BUG-GUTS-X.....
