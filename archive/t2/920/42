FYI. I've been hearing reports that Bosch's newly

We [Mercedes] have had those blades on the 220 S class
and the 203 C class and 211 E class since the 2000
model yr and they do not survive the summers here in
fresno, Calif. Not sure where Bosch came up with "they
last 20% longer than other premimum blades". They last
as long as the cheapest blades!! Newly introduced?!?
Yeah, 6 years ago.....
