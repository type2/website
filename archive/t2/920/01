I do have the book and it does rock (I have the Muir, Wilson, Bentley
and Haynes..don't think Ive ever really looked at Haynes tho).  I've
also seen that list somewhere but I can't seem to find it.  I thought
it was on ratwells site but I can't seem to find it now.  Anyone out
there know?

Thanks again for all the help
