Subject: Purolater elecytric fuel pumps

I am going to be installing a Purolator electric fuel pump, Pro 12s into my
'75 Westy.  Wanted to check the group, before I do, to gauge how good or how
bad these pumps are. My Westy motor, has a "lumpier" cam, hydraulics, twin
choke Dels, and the rest is pretty well stock, except for the exhuast system.
Opinions?  If this one is not strong enough, can I go to the FI pump with an
exit flow pressure regulator installed, and is new VW "braid over rubber" fuel
line sufficient? Thanks.
Sid
