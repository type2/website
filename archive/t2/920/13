Subject: FREE Corvair Engine

Hey Folks,
    Well, as most of you know, I was all fired up about putting a Corvair engine in my '75 Westy. Well, since acquiring an '84 Vanagon Westy with a seized engine, I have abandoned that project. I have sold off everything I obtained to do the conversion except one '67 Corvair engine. It is NOT complete, but it is only missing the Carbs and throttle linkage. It was also from a Corvair that either had air conditioning or a smog pump, not sure which, but that means the oil filter is mounted horizontally rather than vertical. If you want the engine, you MUST come by my house and pick it up-if you are attending John Brown's Buses, I live only 20 minutes away, you can follow me home Sunday and I will help you load it. I also have a Powerglide auto trans that is also not complete, it's missing the TV lever and maybe a couple of other parts as well- that is free for the taking as well. Wife says I've got too many engines sitting around the house, gotta get rid of some (hey, she has more plants than I have engines!) First one to contact me gets the engine and the trans if they want it.    Jeff
