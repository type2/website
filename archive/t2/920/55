Subject: I got the wrong part!

I ordered a left-sided caliper from Bus Depot and I got a right side 
instead!

According to Bentley, the pistons are oriented a certain way based on 
the rotation of the rotor.  The pistons are upside down.  Bentley says 
to use a special tool to reorient the pistons.  Ri-i-i-i-ght!

Should I re-order and take my chances again?  (fifty-fifty)
