Subject: RE: [T2] Carbs : Driving into elevations?

<SNIP>
My question is when driving into the mountains upto
6000' what can I
expect?

Pinging?
Mixture to go rich?  Danger of over-heating?
Would Carbs or timing need adjusted along the way?

Should I be concerned at all?



Luckily for you, most of the engine-damaging problems
associated with fuel/air ratio (pinging, overheat) are
caused by too lean of mixture.  If your carbs are
adjusted correctly for sea-level, as you go higher the
mixture will get richer which can cause these effects:

Slightly lower MPG
Lower cylinder temps (this is good)
Slight Power Loss

Basically the excess fuel is cooling the cylinders as
it vaporizes (and reducing power and being wasted in
the process).

A REALLY rich mixture can damage a catalytic
converter, but I don't think you would get that rich
below 10,000'
