Subject: John Brown's Buses

Hello Everyone,
     Well, John Brown's Buses is just a few days away, and I just wanted to remind everyone that this is an alcohol free campground, so don't forget your red cups! If you need a red cup, stop by and see me (Yosemite Yellow '75 Westy), I'll have plenty-just don't walk around with an open container, Please! I'd also like to get an idea of how many children 12 and under will be attending, as I'm getting small pumpkins for a pumpkin painting contest on Saturday. If you're over 12, please provide your own pumpkin! Remember, Saturday is also "Railroad Days" in the town of Brunswick, so traffic in town may be congested if you plan to arrive on Saturday. If anyone has any questions, please pmail me at the address below, and please let me know if you have a child 12 or under who will be attending.   Thanks,   Jeff
