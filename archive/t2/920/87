Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure

The attitude of your bus makes a big difference. Mine,
even when it looked level, could read full and be a
quart low. I went so far as to use a level on the door
threshold to try to keep track of what is level
according to the oil sump. In any case, when that
light comes on, it means the pressure is below 6psi so
revving the motor is not a good idea! The oil pickup
is pretty much centrally located in the sump. Level
attitude will help. Revving causes what is called
"windage" which actually causes the oil level in the
sump to be blown by the wind off the crankshaft
rotating, causing a low spot in the middle. I added
baffles to my oil pickup and a 914 windage tray to
make sure there was always oil available at high rpms
and in hard cornering.

I had a situation where a shop (I do all my own now!)
had not installed the proper o-ring where the oil
pickup tube joins the case. Whenever I allowed the oil
level to get down a bit or in hard cornering, the pump
would draw air through that opening and I had to take
the oil pressure sender off and use a turkey baster to
pump oil into the oil line to prime the pump! It
worked, but what a PITA! Carry extra oil always with a
T4 motor especially. -BaH
