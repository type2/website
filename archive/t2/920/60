Chris,
Did you try contacting Bus Depot before posting this message?  Not 
everyone gets everything perfect on the first time.  I hope you're not 
trying to put down Bus Depot as we are more than grateful to have them 
around.  Everyone is human - if you haven't already, give them a chance 
to rectify the problem before you complain to the list.

Thanks!
Mike
