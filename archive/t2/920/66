 This is a Federal version engine.  I've never understood why they didn't
 create different wiring diagrams for California and Federal variations, but they didn't.  Instead, the
California-only components - ICU, Oxy relay,  etc. - are all there, but with an asterisk, indicating
California-only.
 You'd think they'd also show an external resistor pack, with terminal
numbers, and a double asterisk for Federal only, but they don't.

Try using the 68-79 Bentley and the 78 wiring diagram. Same wiring as 80-83 Fed Vanagon.
