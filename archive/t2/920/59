 I don't *think* I'm reading it wrong.  There's a note on the wiring diagram
 for the AFC 1980, 1981 which reads "... a series resistance is located
 between fuel injection control unit and injectors."  That leads me to
 believe that I should see some sort of resistor symbol on the wire run from the injector to the FI Control
Unit (ECU), but there's nothing there.  The wire run from the injector to the ECU is diagramed as a straight
run, and my continuity test bears that out.  On the other side of the injectors the wires run to terminals
with numbers that match those on the dual relay.

 Now, maybe the series resistance (for diagram purposes) is embodied right in the injector symbol (sort of a
bow tie attached to one end of a  rectangular box, the box having a diagonal line through it) but there's no
indication of terminals or connectors, and the injector symbol isn't included in the "symbols used in wiring
diagrams" section of the manual.  Of the symbols included there, the symbol closest to the injector symbol is
one defined as "electromagnetic relay", which kind of makes sense; the injector triggers fuel flow, not
electron flow.

Tom...... since you live in Calif, do you have a Calif or a Fed version bus?

This makes a big difference in which wiring diagram you are looking at.

Fed = points in the dist and a resister pack

Cal = electronic ignition and NO resister pack
