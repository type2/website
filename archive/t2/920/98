Subject: top upsouping caper?

	I just scored success by simply squirting CRC 5.56 up into a 
speedometer which had been sticking at 51 while revs, and speed, 
increased considerably above that.
	This was not a VDO or other VW speedo, but of a broadly 
similar mechanical type - on a '94 Jawa 49.9cc which I'd mildly 
upsouped to do 58-60.  To measure effects of developments on this 
vehicle (water injection, tornado muffler, etc) the speedo is v 
important.
	No regular demountable joint was evident, so I gave up the 
first idea of revealing the works outside the can, and lashed out 
blind, squirting up thru small holes.  A couple brief squirts of CRC 
5.56 (a penetrating oil aerosol, propellant LPG I think) restored the 
lost 19% speed.
	Some oil condensed on the glass, and between the needle and 
the glass, so I immediately rode around awhile on the theory this 
would prevent things from sticking; and now the speedo is working 
like new.  The glass and face have been subtly renewed as a bonus.
	I don't want to recommend this method before calling for any 
bad experiences from similar expts on cable-driven mechanical 
speed/odometers.
