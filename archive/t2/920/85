Subject: oil pressure

Well, I had a chance to play a gig last night up on Lookout Mountain,  one of my favorite drives.  The Bopmobile is leaking about a quart  of oil every three weeks.  I checked it a couple of days ago and  it wasn't quite a quart low so I didn't fill it up.  I meant to  fill it yesterday afternoon but forgot all about it until I started up  the mountain.  I also forgot my 5 gallon jug of Castrol.  As  I started up the mountain I was able to maintain 30 MPH in third.   But the oil pressure light kept flashing on and off.  As the grade  got steeper, I would shift into second.  It occasionally flashed  even with the engine revved in second.  So now I'm thinking I've  leaked more oil than I thought.  When I got to the top of the  mountain I found a 7-11 and bought a $4.16 quart of Castrol (must've  been the good stuff).  I poured it in and checked the oil.   Exactly on the full line.  Played the gig at Covenant College,  which used to be a hotel where Al Capone and other
 gangsters liked to  hang out and gamble.  Going back down the mountain I never saw the  light.  So one quart makes a big difference in oil pressure.   I've always heard that it's better on an engine to run it a quart low  than to overfill it.  Evidently that's not the case in Type  2's.  Thoughts?   Cheers...KR
