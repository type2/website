Subject: Re: Bought correct rocker panels, but the bend is not what I

Actually if your working on a baywindow you don't have the correct rocker,
it may say on their site that its right but it's not. The lower drivers side
rocker is the same as the passengers side under the cargo door. That rocker
is only about 2 inches tall. There's a body line there like for a left hand
slider door, What you have is a generic fit all rocker they sell. If you use
it you'll lose the body lines totally. If you don't care about correctness
you can make it work but personally I won't. OEveedub sells the correct
rocker that actually fits decent, the the rest of the parts I just fabbed as
I don't think anyone sells all the correct parts.
