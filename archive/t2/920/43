When I used it I found that it caused the rain to bead too much. As a result unless the rain was heavy requiring me to use the wipers often, the windshield would "mist up" forcing me to use the wipers more than the intermittent wiping before Rain-X. In my opinion, it reduced my visibility.

If you haven't done it yet, run your hand over your windshield inside a zip-lock freezer bag. You'll find it's anything but smooth after years of grime have microbonded to it. Do the claybar treatment on the windshield like you would to your paint, then dry and use the ziplock bag again noticing how smooth the surface is now.

I find this greatly improves the wiper performance. It also helps when cleaning the windshield with a squeegee at the gas station.
