Subject: Odessa Buses?

I get my type 2 in digest form; someone said they were going to  a bus thing 
in Odessa, DE this weekend [instead of JBB, HF, WV]. Could you  tell me when  
& where in Odessa?  & also if I might come  &  look them over & meet/chat with 
other busers [bus  drivers]?  I'll even try to bring in my  bus.
