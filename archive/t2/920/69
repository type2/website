How odd.  I do have the 68-79 Bentley, and all the wiring diagrams are 
listed in the electrical section's index.  But all wiring diagrams except 
the "Supplement to Wiring Diagram A" (first item listed) and "Fresh Air 
Circuit and Rear Window Defogger Circuit" (last item listed) aren't there, 
and clearly were *never* there.  It's not that these diagrams have been 
removed, they were just never bound in my volume.

Bentley Publishing has obviously played an elaborate, multi-decade long hoax 
in order to frustrate my ambitions to understand my wiring harness!
