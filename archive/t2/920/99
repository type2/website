Subject: claims for electric car

	Bus fans who've mentioned notions for converting to electric 
traction will be encouraged by the respectable notice below. 
	Could some busEE bee ease into this mtg and clue us in?  What 
type of accumulator looks best?  Do they want a well-disguised 
testbed for road tests, contracted not to blow cover by burning 
rubber?

The Tesla Roadster

Tesla Roadster has far more drawing power than previous electrical 
vehicles, including the
General Motors EV1.  The Roadster has 0-60 mph times of just 4.0 
seconds, a top speed of 150
mph, a range of at least 200 miles on the highway and 270 miles in 
stop-and-go urban driving.
Using the U.S. government's calculations, the carbon fiber-bodied 
vehicle will get the
"equivalent" of 130 miles per gallon.  Join us for a technical 
presentation on this new
electric vehicle.
