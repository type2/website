Nobody but Raby currently sells a kit.

Have you bought the Wilson book yet? It's a great guide to building
ACVW engines.

Unless you buy Raby's kits, you'll have to buy the stuff piecemeal.

I suggest you start by tearing it down and having the machine work
done to your case and crank first. Inspect cam/lifters or replace.
Then you can start ordering the bits you need to assemble. You'll need
the machining done first to know if you need non-standard bearings.

I've seen somewhere a list of parts you need, ie: Bearings, seals, etc.
