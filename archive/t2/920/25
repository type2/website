Subject: $700  88 Vanagon seen FS-central NJ

Please forward to known vanagon bussers:
On Johanna Farms Road between Ringoes and Flemington
88 dark blue Vanagon with middle seat still in; 108,000 mi
Looked clean in engine comp. and underneath, dad said it drove (son did 
not drive it for a year) No rust through, paint appears original, clean 
wheel wells and rockers; looks like rear bumper corner had been pushed 
into body where it is creased; chrome bumpers, sliding door track looked 
like surface rust, when I checked milage, there seemed to be no glass 
over speedo/odometer.
Son is Peter Riker  Cell: 908-797-9195
