Time the 009 based on TOTAL advance. IIRC you want it at 30 degrees
total advance with the engine revved up (3500rpm?)

I'm sure someone else on the list has the exact numbers, but setting
the 009 at idle is just to get the engine running well enough to set
the total advance.

BTW: The 009 sucks. Just so you know. ;-)
