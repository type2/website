Subject: Loose Distributer

Hi,

I went to change my distributer cap and rotor this weekend.  went to pull 
the rotor off and the whole distributer shaft? pulled right up from out of 
the hole in the case.

Looks like last week when it was at my mechanic, they forgot to tighten the 
distributer back up....No wonder why it wasn't running as good as it should 
have....

anyhow, its all tighted now and timing is reset.....

does driving 100 miles with a loose distributer cause any damage...other 
than running hot if the timing was off?

Kim
