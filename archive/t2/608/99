Subject: TO bearing misaligned with pressure plate?

Anyone run into the problem where the cross shaft positions the TO bearing
so that it is not concentric with the circular face on the pressure plate?

I installed an aftermarket HD cross shaft and get a noise like a bad TO
bearing or gland nut bearing. When I pulled the engine I found fine metal
filings on the pressure plate around the area where the TO bearing contacts
it. Closer look shows that the circular face of the pressure plate that
meets the TO bearing has been pushed off center. This is evident by looking
at the center of the disc.

I noticed when I installed the HD cross shaft that it carried the TO bearing
a bit off center but mistakenly thought it would function correctly.

Anyone else run into this?
