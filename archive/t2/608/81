Subject: Re: [T2] what dual carbs for a T4 2. liter

FWIW I've got a pair of "virgin" 2.0 Alfa Romeo Alfetta Dellorto 40mm DHLA I'd just LOVE to trade for a second pair of matching Dellorto DRLA 36mm carbs. (That would give me a spare set of DRLA carbs for my Beetle project. 

These are virgin because they've never been rebuilt or altered. They came off of a running engine in 1995 - I took them off myself.
