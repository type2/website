Subject: Suggestions for tracking battery drain?

Anyone have any suggestions on methods for tracking a battery drain?  All of a
sudden the battery is dead after two or three days.  The battery is new, less
than a few hours of run time and few starts.  Nothing has really been hooked
up lately.  The is on my Bus that's not on the road yet.
