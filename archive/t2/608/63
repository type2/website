yep, sounds like you are progressing nicely,

You are learning usefull information about your bus instead of watching some
stupid sitcom on TV and wasting brain cells on mundane drivel.  You are
learning enough to be in control of your vehicle while the people watching TV
are learning to be zombies mindlessly responding to the laugh track.

I suggest that you shop trash piles on garbage day and pick up some carpet.

I roll out this trash carpet under the bus and it sure makes it more
comfortable lying under my bus.

I also double up the carpet just in back of the bumper where you kneel (for
hours) with your head and torso stuck inside the engine compartment. Your
knees will thank you for it.

I have also had good luck getting new carpet scrapes in dumpsters behind
carpet stores.

When the carpet gets funky, just roll it up and throw it away in your own
trash pile.

It is going to be real satisfying to hear that engine start up; even better
is driving off to the A&W.
