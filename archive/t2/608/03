William,

To my knowledge, you never drive a tap with a drill....

If you find a socket that will fit the square end of the tap, you can use 
a 1/4 inch drive with a long extension on it...that should let you work 
the tap in a few turns and then back a turn (repeating) until you hit 
bottom.

Cheers, dave
