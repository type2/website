NO - they are NEEDED!!

I was being sarcastic....  sorry, you took it the wrong way.
It was in reference to all the bug and early bus engines I have taken apart and 
found half the cooling parts missing. 
I bought a 67 camper a couple years ago and the engine was sitting in the cargo area.
It was just rebuilt. But it appeared that they had pulled the engine for a massive oil leak
and then gave up. There was a new main seal next to it. I looked the engine over carefully. 
The problem was #1 intake pushrod tube - they missed the hole in the case and bent the end.
After pulling the heads to reseal all the tubes, I found they left out the air deflector plates on 
the bottom of each pair of cylinders!
