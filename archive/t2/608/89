Subject: Installing Pertronix Problems

Hi all:

I know I've seen this issue come up before, but I can't seem to find the
answer in the archives.

I'm attempting to install a Pertronix Ignitor electronic ignition in a stock
distributor for a Federal air-cooled Vanagon.  Pertronix part number is
1847V which is listed as the correct application for this model.

The problem is that the magnet sleeve doesn't fit down far enough on the
distributor shaft to allow the rotor to settle into its place.  It looks to
be about 1/4" too high.  Looking inside the magnet sleeve I see 3
"shoulders" that help orient the sleeve on the rotor shaft, but I'd guess
they also are preventing the sleeve from descending.

How have others dealt with this?

TIA.
