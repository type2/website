Subject: re: [T2] what dual carbs for a T4 2. liter

Hi Mike,

I ran with stock 72-74 Solexes on a 2l from last summer through to this 
spring. For a 2L engine they will need a 132.5 or 135 main jet. The 
Solexes gave me anything from 14 - 25 MPG depending on state of tune 
and driving style. The 14 MPG was due to some loose bolts on the float 
bowl lid, and the 25 MPG occurred through three consecutive tanks of 
fuel cruising to and from EveryBus at 55 MPH. The first of the three 
was mostly coming downhill from WV though, so it doesn't count. The 
second and third tank were on more or less level ground.

If you can source the parts I would recommend considering FI as an 
alternative to carbs. Not because of the gas milage so much as the 
excellent throttle response at all rpms and the improved start-up 
performance. Coming back from vacation in Ohio this month I averaged 
20MPG on the highway at 60MPH fully loaded.... That's not too bad at 
all, there were lots of hills in that run.

Like David said... If you want to pull a westrailer, be sure to get 
some gauges. My CHT gauge has been a benefit and a curse. A benefit 
since it keeps me from destroying my engine, and a curse because I have 
to keep watching it on the hills. I also have an oil pressure gauge and 
will soon add an oil temp gauge as well. The oil pressure gauge saved 
my engine this month.

What will help your motor run cooler?
- Complete and intact engine tin with all seals in place.
-Fan and shroud clean and unobstructed.
- Proper valve adjustment and tuning procedures help a lot... coil, 
rotor, points, plugs, wires, air filter, etc. Get the best bang for 
your buck!
- Timing is also important... It'll run real nice with too much 
advance, but it'll also get hotter than you want.
- NO vacuum leaks... they make the engine run lean.
- Don't lug the engine. With a heavy load on I sometimes have trouble 
cresting long hills at 55 MPH without pushing the head temps above my 
pain threshold. So I ease off the pedal and head for the slow lane if I 
am not already there. At that point I start watching the oil pressure, 
because low RPMs are going to reduce cooling and oil pressure... not a 
nice thing to do to a hot motor. Any less than 55 MPH and I downshift 
to third.... the engine is better off racing a bit than it would be 
lugging.

Happy trails,
