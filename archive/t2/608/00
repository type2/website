Subject: re: [T2] Alternator Interchange?

I'm going through the same issue...

Bus Depot has a remanufactured alternator for $80 outright, plus 
shipping... NAPA's site isn't working right this moment... AutoZone has 
a DuraLast- whatever that is- for $101 + $20 core +tax, and it's a 
special order item.  BusDepot has Bosch for $120 + $31 core + shipping.

If you live near a NAPA regional warehouse, you might be able to find 
an alternator today.  Since I don't rely on my bus for daily 
transportation, I'll order from BusDepot whichever I feel like I can 
afford (big difference for the Bosch... is it worth it?)
