Subject: [T2] For Sale - 1978 Westy

>> I've listed it on eBay, take a look, share the listing with people that
may be interested if you like, and by all means give me feedback if you
think my price is out of line!  :)

It depends on what your reserve is. I think the $3000 buy it now price is
fair for a Westy in that condition, but you may not get it now because we
are getting into off-season. Westies do well in camping season, and taper
off afterwards. Look at the other westies being offered on ebay right now,
and the recent completed auctions and you will notice the prices are getting
spotty. Some get what you'd expect for a westy, and others aren't.
