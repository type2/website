Subject: [T2] AIRS / Support Request Mendicino, CA  UPDATE

Hi Folks:

Received the update form the owner of the bus.  Apparently the fan
pulley worked look because the keyway bolt was loose.  The pulley
crashed around and mangled the end of the crankshaft.  The VW shop
down in Fort Bragg says it will be about $1750 to remove and
reinstall the engine, tear it down, replace the shaft and the front
and rear bearings and maybe the pulley.

I guess we have to figure out the following:

Do we tow the bus back to Sacto drop the engine ourselves and take it
to a rebuild place?
Let the guy down there do it?
Tow it back here and drop the engine and order a rebuild from a place
like BAP or another shop recommended by the list?

The owner is not going down now until Wed. as he is trying to think
about this.  The van is sitting outside the VW shop because he has
not authorized the repair.

Any visions of clarity on the part of the list members would be appreciated.

Thanks,

BEN
