Subject: Reminder: Toronto Buses & Beaches Picnic - Thursday Evening,

Hi Volks,

WHO: Anyone with a bus/Vanagon/EV who wants to attend. Well-behaved 
beetle owners are also welcome. ;^)

WHAT: Not a campout, this one is just a picnic. On a weeknight. Last 
year we had a "pot-luck" shish-kabob theme, and it seemed to work quite 
well, so I'd like to repeat that again this year. I will bring a large 
BBQ, and will have the westrailer along as well. Bring some kebab 
ingredients, and your own beverages, dishes, etc. This is a public 
beach -- RED CUP RULES APPLY.

WHEN: This Thursday evening.

WHERE: Cherry Beach, Toronto.

Cherry Beach is a wonderful little chunk of mother nature embedded just 
to the east of downtown Toronto. If you haven't been there, you're 
missing one of our cities best-hidden secrets.
