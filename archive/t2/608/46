timing. Phil


But as you say, it doesn't run that well that far after TDC. Plus, I agree
with Don, the 20 to 24 degrees isn't enough advance. I think 30 is too
aggressive, but 28 BTDC is more accepted as a high RPM timing setting on
upright engines. Just set your distributor at high RPM (2500 to 3500) and
let the idle setting fall where it may. TDC or slightly advanced, up to 7
BTDC is common. I know the oldvolks spec sheet tells what the distributor is
supposed to do, but unless you are dealing with a brand new unit, actual
performance can vary from spec to an acceptable parameter.
