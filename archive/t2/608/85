Subject: Re: [T2] Germany vs Brazil Master Cylinder

I've found the BZ (Varga) master cylinders often have to be honed, the
honing of the bore sucks. Never had this problem with the German units. The
resulting sticky bore creates bleeding problems since the piston doesn't
full return.

If you get Varga hone it before installation to avoid the headache, at LEAST
check it.
