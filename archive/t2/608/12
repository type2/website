Hi Folks:

This one should be easy.  We need advice primarily.  A little sketchy 
at the moment but I'll post more details after 3 PM PST.

My friend Carl who teaches in my department here picked up a bus last 
October.  It sat through the winter then got the body shop work up 
paint and dents,  in July.  He picked it up from the Body shop on Wed 
and immediately took it camping on the coast 3 hours from here.

It died out in the little town of Fort Bragg, CA and currently sits 
at Mendicino Coast European Motors in Fort Bragg.  Carl's been told 
his crankshaft bearing went and it will cost $900 plus parts.  This 
engine has less than 300 miles on a rebuild from a shop somewhere 
south of Sacramento.  I've asked for more details and might talk to 
the mechanic if needed.

Here's what I need.

Advice about the shop if anyone knows of it.
Once I get the details advice on the repairs, the cause,  things to 
watch out for, etc.
Anyone in Mendicino area with engine pulling experience to double 
check the diagnosis.  Carl is not a mechanic (yet but he will be 
after this!  <g>)  The Muir book is on order for him and he just got 
as Bentley book.  Either Carl or I would reimburse the person for 
their efforts.

I can't go there myself and Carl is going there tomorrow.  The car 
ran fine when I drove it in the two days he had it before he left. 
All the gauges looked normal (the PO replaced the idiot light with 
gauges)

Thanks,

More soon,

BEN
