Now if that isn't honesty, coming from a dealer who could just as easily
insist that the German one is the only way to go, I don't know what is. Well
done Ron.

The Brazilian ones come from Varga, who is a long established Brazilian

manufacturer. We have been selling them for years without any problems,

and I''ve used them for years myself as well. While I'd be more than

happy to sell you the expensive one, frankly if I were buying one for my

own bus I'd save the cash and get the Varga.
