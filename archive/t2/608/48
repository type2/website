Subject: One wire on Alternator question.

Ok, below is a quote of the typical stuff I've found in the archive. I've got my alternator/regulator harness re-wired, but I can't figure out where the black wire goes on the Alternator.

Sounds like it's always on, so does it just tie into the BIG RED wire at B+? And on a 76' Kombi does it just goto the test terminal? In witch, it doesn't really need to be hooked up does it? 

TIA
Chris

In the older wiring diagrams it went to the diagnostic computer socket in
the engine compartment.
