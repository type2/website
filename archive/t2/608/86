Subject: installed distributor, hose shoots off, TDC?

Hello everyone,
Since I'm putting my bus back on the road and since my computer is working 
again I decided it could be invaluable to rejoin this list.  I hope I get to 
see some of you soon too.
Yesterday I pulled my distributor took it apart most of the way, cleaned it, 
and put it back together. Someone told me to try pulling the points apart 
and sucking where the vacuum line enters the dizzy while i had it out.  They 
said the points should stay open, but they didn't.
Also, When I put the distributor back in someone told me to turn the engine 
until the timing mark was at 0. Then to make the rotor point towards the 
mark in the distributor for the 1st cylinder. I did that and put the dizzy 
back in.  Now when I try to start it it tries to turn over a couple times 
and then a T fitting that goes into the intake air distributer on the 
drivers side shoots off. (Before I took out the dizzy to clean and inspect 
it was running, but not as great as it can).

Someone suggested that the firing order is off. Any thoughts on this?  If so 
how do I tell and how do I correct it.

Thanks,
Kyle

p.s. for those of you in or passing through the chapel hill/pittsboro area 
of NC I just moved into a new house with 40 wooded acres and a deep swimming 
lake.  So come visit in your journeys.
