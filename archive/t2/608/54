Subject: shifting likage and vacuum cutoff

Dear Bus folk,

	I'm in the middle of installing my used motor into my '72 
Westy.  Things are snowballing a little bit. While you have the motor 
out you have to drop the tranny too, CV joints, boots, input shaft 
seal, shift rod stuff...
	Well that brings me to my first observation.  It looks like 
on my '72 that the rear shift rod bushings are reversed, at least 
from the Bentley and other technical articles I've read. I am 
assuming this is the case since I'm looking at it right now.  Any 
others with the same experience?
	I've taken the whole works apart and things seem worn, but in 
one piece.  I plan on getting all new parts where I can.  The stop 
plate was shot. Dry as a bone of course.
	The other question I have is about the vacuum advance cutoff 
on the '72.  I see the 4th gear switch on the back of my tranny 
(wires cut).  My two-way cutoff valve is MIA.  Where is the 
temperature switch located?  I assume that in order to have vacuum 
advance in 4th gear I will have to get this set up?   In this part of 
the country (Minneapolis) 54 F is more than half the year.  Can 
anyone educate me on this?

Thanks

Randy Carpenter
