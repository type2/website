The Brazilian ones come from Varga, who is a long established Brazilian
manufacturer. We have been selling them for years without any problems,
and I''ve used them for years myself as well. While I'd be more than
happy to sell you the expensive one, frankly if I were buying one for my
own bus I'd save the cash and get the Varga.
