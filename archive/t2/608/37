Sounds like maybe the positive battery cable was
touching metal to metal somewhere causing it to short
out and fry.  This exact thing happened to a bus I was
driving last fall, of course it wasn't a VW bus, it
was a 66 Passenger school bus that is owned by the
YMCA where I work.  All I did was replace the positive
battery lead making sure there were no bare spots
touching anywhere, and the old beast roared back to life...
