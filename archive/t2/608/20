Subject: FIRE! Almost. I'm screwed, need help BADLY!

So okay. I drove down to the Napa warehouse to pickup the alternator to replace my bad one. I come home wrestle my old one out, slap in the new one without any issues and I go to turn it on to see if the Alternator light goes out finally. 
My lights were all nice and bright, so I turn the key and it's like 'ClicK' like the battery is dead, and all the lights are now super low. So I go back to make sure the battery connectors are tight and to put the battery on the charger. That's when I see the billowing white smoke! I grab my extinguisher and set it 10 feet or so behind the bus in case anything catches. 
After MUCH coughing and struggling, I get the SUPER HOT battery cables disconnected and bail out of the area to let it air out. 
Now I'm left with a thoroughly charred wiring harness. It's totally bare wired from the heavy B+/B+ wire up through the tin, and as far back as I can reach, witch is about an inch past the number one cyl. fuel injector. The damge gets less and less severe as you move beyond the alternator. The bundle that splits off to go to the voltage regulator is fine.
I've got the alternator off now, and will be taking it to Napa tomorrow to have them test it to see if it's still good, or if maybe it was the cause. I have a LOT of re-wiring to do tomorrow too. 
What could have caused this? I never had any problems with it before except of course that it didn't charge the battery (hope the battery isn't toast now). Where should I even START looking for shorts at? (Please keep in mind that I'm Schematic Illiterate)
Anyone in the Seattle area really good with electrical problems? We got Soda on tap, and plenty of beer and/or wine.
Man, today was going so good too!
