Subject: Timing makes my head hurt

I thought I'd got this sorted. TDC at idle and everything sounds lovely.
But I'm not convinced I'm right.

Engine: 1600 Type 1
Number: ADTR1071
Distributor: VW Vac advance
Van: 1971

Bently lists AE engines (7.5 degrees after TDC with Vac hoses on) but not
AD engines. I spoke to the engine supplier and they suggest 5 degrees
before TDC with the vac hoses off and plugged. However the engines (they
are Remtec rebuilds) come with 009 distributors on them and the VWFLAPS
isn't really sure of the settings with a vacuum advance dizzy.

Can anyone confirm the numbers for this ?
I'm dynamically timing as I have a Petronex installed.

Oil temps are 100 - 106 degrees centigrade once warmed up. Supplier (VW
Heritage here in the UK) says they would expect 90-100 degrees normally and
I don't need to worry below 120. 106 seems to be the upper limit up hills
and at any speed up to 60mph (haven't been on a long motorway run). Temp
drops to 100 once in town. I have dunked the probe in boiled water and it
seems pretty accurate. Mind you, five minutes after a run where the temp
had been 100, I was able to clean the oily end of the probe with a kitchen
paper towel without burning my hand so either the stuff cools quickly or
the test & probe weren't as accurate as I thought.

Thanks

Phil
