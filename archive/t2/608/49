Subject: Floormat Glue

With all of the lovely weather we've been having, my
floormats (for lack of a better term) is melting off
the metal on the seats.  Anybody know of a good glue
that will keep it from sliding off again?

Apparently somebody used a glue previously and so now
there's black gunk all over the floor from where the
floormats ended up.
