Subject: Yet another Bus for sale.

And I'm not super thrilled about it, but after some tough love from some
of you, I made the decision.  The engine came out two weekends ago, and
it will see some benchtime and restoration.  The rest of the rustbucket
needs to leave my driveway.  So, it's listed with pictures on TheSamba. 
1974 Parts Bus.  White/Orient Blue.  If anyone needs anything from a
'74, and wants to pay shipping or is in the Seattle area, give me a
holler.  Or a beer.
