Subject: Parts Needed for '73 1700

Hello Volks this is a parts role call. I need them for a bus of a friend. I 
am helping him to get it on the road and campable. This is a 73 Passenger 
Bus, no middle seat though. He wants to convert it to a weekender later. 
Right now he needs some missing or damaged pieces.

Cooling tin misc. -  The big flat pieces that run between the Heat 
Exchangers and the case.
                       -  Muffler Heat Deflector


Alt. Parts           - The Oval Plastic cover on the Alt. tin, the one that 
hides the adjustment screw.
                        - The plastic ring that goes behind the tin and 
infront of the Alt.

Other Parts        - Oil filler tube, the plastic base part that the filler 
cap screws on.

Thanks anyone who has these for sale can pmail me.

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, "el Verde"
