Having been severely reamed on a long-distance engine repair (not a VW,
but painful nonetheless) I recommend that you tow the vehicle home and
deal with it yourself.  Unless you know the remote shop really well you
are taking a big risk that they will tear things down and then try to up
the bill on you.  If you can borrow a pickup and rent a tow dolly getting
it home won't be all that difficult.


Dear friends on the list:

We are doing exactly  what George recommends.  Friday Carl goes to 
All-Star Rents and Saturday he and I drive down to and back form Fort 
Bragg with the bus in tow.  from all of the other responses I got, I 
am more than convinced we can fix it here for a fraction of the cost 
and if not, I'll do my first engine drop in years and help him get a 
rebuild.

And before he takes it out again, he buys tools and read MUIR cover to cover.

Thanks again!  You folks are why I drive a BUS!

BEN
