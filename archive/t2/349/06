<...not always, at idle I lift the relief valve at 65 or so psi and can't
remember it ever being below 40psi no matter what the temp.  now I will
admit when the engine was rebuilt we honed a new oil pump to almost
perfect spec...> I'd still check the calibration on that oil pressure gauge,

<...just got back from a week long 1,200 mile trip into the Anarondack
mountains in upstate NY, and a long drive down I-95 on the way home from

Have a safe trip amigo,
