And don't forget the ball joints, the front wheel bearings, and that big-ass
pin (linkpin? kingpin? bigpain? something like that).  Any one of these as
well as the ones listed in the previous e-mail (but most likely a
combination of several of them) will translate to a very loose feeling in
the front-end. 

If you try to adjust the steering box to tighten the steering without
checking/replacing all the 30 year old parts that make up the front
suspension and steering you'll end up with a bus that is hard to turn, won't
return to "0", a ruined steering box, and a bus that still jumps all over
the place.
