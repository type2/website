In my particular "microclimate," most of the other cars are the biggest
SUVs available--all less than three years old.

Well, like I said, in the accident with my Thing(tm) that just wasn't the case.
The wheel on the front crushed severely, absorbing quite a bit of impact
energy.  The tire absorbed more, until the bead came off the crushed rim.

Also not true in my case.  The compaction of the front of the car stopped
at the tire on the hood, the tire absorbing what impact energy remained.
The hood also did not "shove straight back and cut the driver's head off,"
as I have heard repeatedly.

I'll take my chances that it doesn't hurt any.

The Thing(tm) has much more crumple-able stuff out front than a bus,
so I'm not really sure how much good a front spare will do the driver
of a bus.  It's also nice not to sleep cuddled up with a tire...........
