This is definitely a type2 list question, so I am posting my reply over 
there as well hoping others will pick it up. Lucky for you I watch both 
lists. ;)

There are several things that I can think of that would cause this 
problem. The first and most likely candidate is a vacuum leak. Check it 
with a vacuum gage and make sure that you do not have a leak. If you 
find vacuum low use a squirt bottle of water and spray it around all 
vacuum connections. Listen for a drop in idle.

The next thing I would check is the fuel pressure. If you have low 
pressure this could cause the problem, so verify fuel pressure with a 
gage, and take corrective action if it is low.

The last thing I would check is the AFM. As the other reply suggested a 
loose plug on the AFM could cause these, but so could a stuck flap, a 
loose spring or a faulty resistance track. Make sure that the flap moves 
easily when you push on it, and that resistance is smooth with no drop 
outs on the AFM as you move the vane. For this test an old analog ohm 
meter is better than the new digital ones unless you have a super nice 
digital with a display that graphs for you.

Let me know if you need more help or specifics on how to do a particular 
test.
