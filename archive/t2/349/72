Subject: Tapping at fan

I figured it had been a while since I last checked on the engine so I went
for a little ride on the highway and took a few measurements after: dwell
was ideal, vacuum 18", rpm ~875, battery 13.71V.

I was about to put turn the engine off when I heard a faint tapping by the
cooling fan. I haven't heard this before but I'm speculating that the
fan/crank is moving back and forth slightly, just enough to make the tapping
noise.

I'm going to take off the plastic guard in the morning and check that the
bolts behind it on the fan assembly are the correct torque.

Has anyone had this experience?
