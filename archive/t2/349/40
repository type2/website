Rik,

Total advance on a type 1 is generally set at 32 degrees(maximum).

Lower CR as per Berg, you can set it 2-4 degrees higher for *maximum*
advance.

Use the total advance numbers over anything else.
Type 4 uses much more total advance...you will fry your t1 with anything
over 32 plus the difference for lower CR.

Cheers, dave
