Most of the cars on the road match the bumper height of the bus relatively
well, particularly if overriders are installed.  The bumper is designed
with a little "give" to it (that's why the mounting holes are slotted, to
allow the bumper to slide).  If you get hit on the bumper at low speeds
you are unlikely to sustain damage.

OTOH, the tire mounted above the bumper will transfer any impact loads
directly to the front sheet metal of your bus.  There is no "give" to
that, it just dents.

Also, the high-mounted tire will cause more damage to the other vehicle,
since it doesn't match the other car's bumper.  That's the major complaint
against the "evil SUVs"

I really doubt that the spares made that much of a difference.  A wheel is
a very rigid object for its mass and doesn't really make that good of a
"crush space".  A tire on the hood of a thing is more likely to be pushed
through the windshield into the faces of the passengers than it is to
cushion an impact.

The dynamics of energy absorption during a crash are very complex.  Just
putting an object between you and the colliding vehicle doesn't always
help matters.

True.  One caveat, though.  If your bus lacks hard points for the shoulder
harness, make sure the ones you fabricate are as strong as the later
factory ones.  Picture having that attach point tear loose and whip around
your body with a jagged piece of body sheet metal attached!  Not pretty!

PS:  Driving as if you were an Aztec sacrifice strapped to the front of
the vehicle is also helpful.  This was one thing that John Muir was
correct about.

PPS:  I believe that the accident rate would plummet if the law were
changed to prohibit seat belts and air bags entirely and to mandate that a
6" sharpened steel spike be installed in the center of every steering
wheel.
