I'll have to search the archives for the "ideal" tire stats.

I'm stuck with these until I can purchase new ones, probably a few weeks to
a couple of months.  Thankfully, they are in good shape tread-wise.  Careful
driving 'til then.  It'll help that it's only my son and me riding for now.

Don't know.  I'll look again today.

Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move
the spare to the front of the bus.  Too bad that there isn't a safe place to
mount my 5-gallon fuel can.

As in "Larry the Cucumber"?  No trip to Chuckie Cheese's is complete without
several Veggie Tales "Silly Songs" in the show. :O)
