Define your term "rebuild".
Blowby can be verified with proper
compression and leak-down tests.
You may find a broken ring or ring land at #2.
Loss of power at one cylinder amounts to 25%
of total engine output HP.("very low power").
General blowby can be caused by re-ring used p/c
which failed to seat, and will indicate with the tests
Gray goop may be original assembly lube if the
strainer never got cleaned since the 10K rebuild.
Was any of it magnetic, or shiny aluminum flakes ?
Did you drain the oil in a white pail and find all the
contaminants in an aoto-paint style paper strainer?
You may be due for another rebuild.
Buy the Tom Wilson book first, even if it's going to a shop
Confirm hot idle oil pressure and running temperatures
before disassembly. Maybe the bottom end is still good.
Stop by if you are ever in the neighborhood:)
