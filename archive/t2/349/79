Hello Richard,

Hmmm... This is making me think. My bus is a 74. If I
remember correctly, my back up lights worked the last
time I actually had the tail lights installed. I will
go over the differences in the wiring for 74 back up
lighting vs. the late model bus back up lighting. This
is an example of one of the bugs that has to be worked
out when putting a late model bus F.I. in an earlier
bus. No big deal. :)

Thanks for the info. Now that I know what those wires
are for I can see if they are acutually needed or not.
Thanks again for all of your help!!!! 

Thanks guys!!!

Regards,

David Kelly
