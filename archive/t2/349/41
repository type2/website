Bentley's at the top of the one-of-the-next-thing-to-buy list.  I have a
Haynes at present.

After I'm sure that I've got him in relatively safe driving condition.

Waiting on clients to ante up. :O)

Just started seriously working on him.  Haven't replaced much of anything
other than fuses.  Actually, I can cast soft bushings and grommets out of
RTV silicone, but haven't had any reason to yet.

the rear, and Gas Riders on the front will suffice, for quite a bit le$$.

Are Gas ____'s available at WalMart or a FLAPS, or specialty shop?  I can
get the OEM's after a few big jobs start paying off.

box, but let's just hope it's the tie rod ends.

Would it hurt to adjust the steering box?

The switch handle is literally loose in the column.  It allows the high beam
switch to work, but no turn signals.
