I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing
because the body will deform before the bumper can absorb the impact. The
Euro models had the extended bumper for the tire carrier for a reason: with
the tire mounted you increase your chance of nose damage if someone
accidentally backs into you.
