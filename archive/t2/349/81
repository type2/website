Subject: Re: Fuel Starvation

Teri,
I had a similar intermittent starvation problem in my '79 a couple of years
ago.  One day, after a series of lunging spasms as I tried to accelerate,
she died of starvation with a huge lurch; she would start, but not
accelerate or go.  Dead in the water.  All of this happened after I did the
obvious and changed out the fuel filter. As I was entirely stumped, I had it
towed to my fav German shop and they found that the rust and other particles
in my gas tank had clogged the fuel outlets.  They were able to clear the
way with compressed air or something, but said that that didn't rid me of
the particle problem - I would need to remove the tank and clean it out in
order to do so.  In the meantime, they recommended I keep the tank more than
1/2 full to avoid those particles filtering down and clogging the outlets
again.  I have kept the tank over 1/2 full ever since and (knock on wood) I
haven't had the problem again.

I've had an intermittent problem that has gotten drastically worse.  It
started months ago with some slight bucking under load, and has gotten
progressively worse until I can't start and run reliably right now.

I have a fuel filter and plan to swap that out.  Fuel pump, maybe?  I'm
going to try to get this done at work today, so any hints about what I
can look at are most appreciated.

Thanks!
Teri
------------------------------

It's a '79, FI.  Changed the fuel filter back in Nov when I noticed the
problem wasn't going away.  It used to seem better when it was warm, now
it just sputters 'till it dies and won't start 'till it sits awhile.

Thanks!
Teri
