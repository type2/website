well I have a 78 that is pretty close to stock, have guages, rebuilt about
25kk ago and use Mobil 1 synthetic.  here in the midatlantic it gets
pretty hot and humid in the summer.  I won't let mine get over 240 and
would pull over if it got to 250 even on I-95 on long runs

huh?? my psi NEVER gets under 37psi even at idle, you mean I have never
used my oil cooler

not always, at idle I lift the relief valve at 65 or so psi and can't
remember it ever being below 40psi no matter what the temp.  now I will
admit when the engine was rebuilt we honed a new oil pump to almost
perfect spec

true

no they didn't put a guage in because it was an economy car and had no
extra features it didn't need

just got back from a week long 1,200 mile trip into the Anarondack
mountains in upstate NY, and a long drive down I-95 on the way home from
Boston to Baltimore in about 8 hours, stopped only for gas meet me at
everrybus and look at the guage as I pull in if you don't believe me,
should arrive early afternoon Fri if the auto tranny holds up.
