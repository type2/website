Will do.  I'll also get under him and see if there's anything doable in the
mean time.

Haynes doesn't show where the plug is or what is needed to remove it... like
y'all didn't know that... help?

Just for the record, I've run into a problem that I didn't have 2 decades
ago with my first bus.  Almost every time I park the bus someone comes up to
admire it and talk 60's/70's (in spite of the sadly PO neglected body)!  One
guy even followed me home to ask about Giacomo and to talk about his own
bus!!!  Totally cool. :O)

One dear fellow mentioned that he use to have a number of VW's (seemed like
the whole family had their own bus/beetle), and now no longer needs his VW
tools and books.  Service manuals, VW-specific specialty tools, even a work
bench-mounted engine frame.  I made an offer to purchase it all from him,
and he's going to get it all together and think about a price.  Nice.  I'll
list the goodies when I find out what they are.
