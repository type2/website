then there are the exceptions, couple years ago a tractor trailer driver
fell asleep at the wheel on I-81 near Scranton, he drifted sideways
accross three lanes into my side, turned my bus sideways and hit the tire
mounted on the front with the side of his trailer near the rear
wheels...the imprint of his tandem rear wheels remain in my bumper and

windshield, had I not had the tire on the front I probably would have been
pulled under the trailer into the rear wheels...and not speaking here
