Yes, that's the original configuration.  The hard plastic hose stops short
of the front engine tin and the high pressure fuel injection hose (sounds
like you have the original hose there if it's cloth covered) takes over from
there.

I'm going to guess that it's not since the online vendors who sell
"complete" fuel injection hose replacement kits, as far as I know, don't
include it in their "kits."

I have a feeling that this hard plastic stuff is somehow better suited for
the environment it lives in then the normal flexible FI hose.  Many, many
years ago I had a similar situation to the one you describe so I just
shortened the hard plastic hose an inch or so and lengthened the flexible FI
hose an inch or so and all has been fine ever since.
