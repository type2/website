Mike,

You will find this happens a lot....it is a *good* thing!

I get in conversations at the gas pump about every 3rd time I
fill up....with someone who admires the bug and wants to talk VW's!

Stopped by a flaps yesterday and bought some GL4 tranny lube...talked to 
the counter man who wanted to know why I didn't want GL5..explained it was 
bad for VW's...he says, "you have a vw?!"..walked out and looked at it
and started talking about his cache of 10-12 bugs/vert/t3's sitting in the
woods getting rusty....this happens a lot in Arkansas.  :-(((

Gonna go see them soon!!!...now if I just had more room....

Cheers, dave
