It was thought of, though.  the steering wheel mount of the baywindow is
designed to collapse in a frontal impact.  The bumper mounts were designed
to slide to take minor bumps (provided the bumper is repositioned after
that impact!)  The manufacturers were doing crash tests long before the
government got into the act.

Every rule has exceptions.  My father would not be with us today if
seat belts were required in the '60s, as he lost a drag link and had the
top of his pickup cab sheared off level with the hood by a billboard as he
was hugging the stick shift on the floor.  Does this make me reject seat
belts?  Nope, because I realize that there are 100 ways to die by not
wearing seat belts versus 1 way to die by wearing seat belts.
