I had on 1 old engine a rod bearing that made a bunch of noise like that 
and I drove it for another 9 or 10 months. Toasted the rod and crank but I 
didn't care (mail order JC Whipme engine that came with the car). Ran hot 
from day 1.

On another engine I had a hammering noise that turned out to be a worn 
wrist pin bushing (rod to piston pin).

Is this sound a fast sound (crank speed) or 1/2 rpm (cam and valve train) 
sound?
