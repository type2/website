Subject: Second hand type IV motor

Hi all,
I just picked up a 2L dual carb motor, identical to the one in my bus.
The motor is complete from exhaust to clutch, the PO said it runs fine, and
looking at the bus it came out of it was well maintained. A bargain at $400
(~$240US).
As I know the seller, I plan to use it as is, after a thorough tune up of
course.
The question is are there any checks I can do before installing to check
condition, or would it be advisable to try running it out of the bus to hear
it running and maybe a compression test etc?
Thanks,
Richard
