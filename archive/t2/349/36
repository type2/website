Have you adjusted the cable to Bentley spec.?

Give it an hour on the freeway.  Low, cool speeds won't do much.

Do these before any further road testing.

When was the last time you replace the shift rod bushings?  And no, you
do not need to cast some.  They are readily, and cheaply available.  8o)

Probably needs shocks.  Oil filled OEMs are the be$t, but Gas-A-Justs on
the rear, and Gas Riders on the front will suffice, for quite a bit le$$.

Tie rod ends.  When's the last time you replaced 'em?  Maybe the
steering box, but let's just hope it's the tie rod ends.

The switch is not working, or is it the flasher relay/fuse/bulbs/wiring?

Replace the oil first.  If you don't have any, get some at the store while 
you're there.
Old dirty, nasty, water contaminated oil is just *not* what you want 
lubricating your
bearings.
