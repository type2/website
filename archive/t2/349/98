Had a clutch go out on my '72 Beetle while touring Italy with my sister and 
a friend. I dropped the engine in a parking lot to swap out the clutch and 
in the process bent the lower two studs.

When I went to reinstall it I could not get the engine to seat on the 
bellhousing because the input shaft was not lined up with the gland bearing 
(bent studs wrecking the alignment).

Spent several hours cussing the situation, was provided with lighting by a 
German tour bus driver and a HUGE tour bus. He generously parked it behind 
my car and idled his engine with all the lights on. Spoke not a word of 
English and I spoke not a word of German. He was not a mechanic.

Anyhow we figured it out, I used a large adjustable wrench to bent the 
studs back up 3/32" and the engine was back in in mere moments.

Hope this helps.
