Subject: Torque Wrench

I received a HarborFreight catalog last night that has the 1/2" drive torque 
wrench on sale (10-150 lbs, perfect for the lug nuts on ALL your cars) half 
price at $9.99 and FREE shipping (I think they still charge handling fees, 
appropriately).  So you can buy just this one item and you get free 
shipping.

I am happy with the torque wrench, particularly at the price.  I also use 
their 3/8" (0-80 lbs) drive torque wrench for the CV bolts, and other small 
places.  I bought both at half price, over a period of time.  I guess if you 
want, this is the time for the 1/2" drive


AND...  if you buy $39.99 worth of stuff, you get another $5 off

AND ... you get a free duffle bag
