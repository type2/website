Rob,

Seals are readily available to accept the chrome trim.

New is available.
West coast metric or wolfsburg west forthe seals and chrome.

I had mine done locally(i have done it myself), by an "old" glass 
installer who knew how to do it.....even he moaned about how hard it was 
to keep the chrome strip in while installing.

The local guys will want to use "their" brand of seals...the one my guy 
used looks great...we will see in a few years how it compares to the west 
coast metric seals that I used every place else.  It was labeled 
"Premier".

Seals with the slot for the chrome are about 3 times the price of no
slot seals.  Depends on what you want your bus to look like.

Cheers, dave
