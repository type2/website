Subject: 70 transmission, probably from a bug...

i have two questions... sort of...

1) can you use a bug transmission in a bus? are they the same? if so, i
may take it myself, just in case. 

2) local elderly couple have a 70 transmission they want to get rid of.
they have been trying to sell it through our tulsa club newsletter, but
no one here seems to want it. at this point, they would take $10 for it,
but they are old, so they cant lift it. i am willing to go get it, and
keep it for deliver to someone via a mutual campout or whatnot, or ship
it if anyone is interested. of coarse whoever wants it will pay shipping
cost. i dont know how much it costs to ship a transmission, but when you
consider it is practically FREE to begin with, it could be worth it so
someone.

please P-mail me if you want it, otherwise, thanks for your wealth of
knowledge, once again,
chris
