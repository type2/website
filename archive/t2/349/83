Not bad, he did fine...

Except for the clutch.  One the way down, I was able to shift from 1st
through 3rd okay (35 mph speed limit).  A little stiff, but it worked.  But
after about 6-7 minutes, I had a devil of a time shifting in and out of
gear.  Like the clutch would work.  I could shift into gear with the bus
off, and I could shift from 1st to 2nd to 4th while driving if I was very,
very careful.

The PO mentioned something about this, and that it's not the clutch itself
but something to do with the cable.  Now, I don't have a problem with buying
a new cable, but frankly, I'm currently low on cash.  I plan on getting
under there and seeing if there's any damage, etc., but was wondering if
maybe it just needs to be adjusted.

Other than that, it was an enjoyable outing. :O)

On the road again...
