If it is that far out that fast, there is no substitute for a new cable.
If you adjust the old one, you will just give yourself another couple of
days at most before it breaks.

Also, if you take it out now, you have the option of taping a piece of
string to the old cable to help pull the new cable through the tube.
Pulling is much easier than pushing!

Don't forget to liberally grease the new cable while putting it in.
Lotsa grease, have a good 'ol time!

Despite your cash woes, try to buy a second cable right now.  Having a
spare will turn a major roadtrip problem into a minor annoyance.  Get a
throttle cable too.  They aren't that expensive.
