>> Would it hurt to adjust the steering box? <<

eliminate all other sources of play in the steering
_before_ adjusting the steering box.

here are the ones i can think of. i'm sure someone else

-coupling
-tie rods
-steering damper

>>Are Gas ____'s available at WalMart or a FLAPS,
 or specialty shop?  I can
get the OEM's after a few big jobs start paying off.<<

you can get the OEM Boge replacements from Bus Depot for

good luck,
