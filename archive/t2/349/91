Guys,

What years are your buses....I picked up 4x8 plywood before I started 
working on my bus last year and it was *not* a tight fit at all...at least 
an inch or so on each side cause I measured it before i went.

Hmmm...maybe I need to go measure again(78 champagne edition).

George, have you got pics of the devices that slide into the jack
points?  THis sounds like the coolest thing yet....I can envision what
it would look like, but pics would be nice!


Cheers, dave
