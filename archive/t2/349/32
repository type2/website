Personally I think you'd be better off with an aftermarket bilge blower that
many bus owners have used to increase airflow from the stock heater.  Less
power draw, more air volume and speed, lighter weight.  But if you want to
use your stock blower, I'd definitely suggest using a relay rather than
wiring it directly to a switch.
