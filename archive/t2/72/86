Mike,

if you beltline trim is anything like mine, it has years of dirt & crud
underneath that leads to surface rust under the chrome.

i had to *forcefully* push up from the bottom side of the trim to get it off
the clip.  once the underside is off you can pop of the top side rather
easily.  if it feels like something is going to break, well, it probably is.
luckily just the clips break - the chrome should be undamaged if you are
careful.

as for finding parts, Joe at bustedbus.com sells used sets of chrome for
around 100 bucks or so i think.  he sold me some of the individual pieces i
needed (thanks Joe!)  i think i bought a few of the clips from him too, but
those seem rather hard to come by.  another listmember also suggested trying
to find the clips at a hot rod type shop locally. seemed like a good idea
but i havent tried yet.

good luck & HTH.

happy holidays to all!
