After I went back, I tried to get the bolt out of the hole but the thing
wouldn't spin out.  I tried drilling a slightly bigger hole so I could
screw the extractor (yes steve, it was an extractor, *not* a puller :)
in a little more but it still didn't want to budge.

So, seeing as I have two other transmissions sitting in my garage, and
I'll be eventually dropping this engine in the foreseeable future, I
drilled the hole a tad bigger, and screwed another bolt in.  The thing
is actually holding rock solid right now, and hopefully I won't have to
mess with it for a while.

It's not the best of fixes, but for the moment I think it will do.  I'm
guessing that the bolt hole was damaged before anyways, because the PO
had a stud screwed in there but it was the wrong size and it sheared
off, so I don't even know if it was screwed in at all.  If I ever get
back to this, I'll do it correctly by drilling and re-tapping the hole..

fun fun fun!!

later,
Mike
