You're pretty much right on.  There is a difference in that most of 
your data involves corrosion in the presence of a lot of water, not 
that at high temps.  Iron loves to corrode at high temps, and copper 
and brass less so.  Stainless seems to be best, but there are 
different varieties of stainless.

I find that the nuts used by Japanese cars on their manfolds work 
well, particularly when given a good dose of anti-sieze compound.  
Anti-sieze is good stuff when it comes time to disassemble!
