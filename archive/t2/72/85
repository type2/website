So what's the trick in getting the "beltline" aluminum
trim molding off 
a 
deluxe bus?

I foud out that when removing the trim you need to
first find the location of the clips. I just used a
regular screwdriver. You just pry the trim off the
clips. You have to be gentle so as not to break the
clips. I learned that one the hard way. After all was
said and done the trim was off with no damage but a
broken clip and I sold it all to a guy in Sweden.
Hope This Helps,
Tyler
