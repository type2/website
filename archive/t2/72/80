If these are the metal/fiber sandwich gaskets, fine.  Otherwise, get 
them!

There really is no limit, and hitting them for a week or two, with 
periodic driving will help to get the lube into the threads.  You want 
the oil to be there along with thermal cycling to help it into the 
tiny crevices.

A cool tool is a "nut cracker" that splits the nut in two.  It will 
work when nothing else does.

When reinstalling, do not fail to apply anti-sieze compound to the nut 
and stud.  If you do this, your life will be much easier the next time 
you have to remove the nut.  I've never had a stud break when treated 
with anti-sieze.
