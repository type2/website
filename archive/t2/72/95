No flames, Dave!  New techniques are highly valued and I thank you for the
idea.  I will try this next time I run into a problem that looks amenable!
BTW, tho, I will *really* have a fire extiguisher close at hand for this
as wax burns bright and hot!

On the nuts, I do know that stainless will rust eventually but it takes a
lot longer than plain steel.  As I said in the list of options there are
no perfect materials so we do the best we can :-)
