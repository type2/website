I wish I could go.....=(
Unfortunately I am stuck on the east coast, Ive done alot of that sort of
driving , when i lived in the NC mountians. Its amazing the types of
impassible ,"4wheel drive only " back roads a bus will handle.
Stay away from those shoulders..... its a scarry trip down the side, trust
me I know(thanks god for strong trees and large tow trucks)

Have fun!
