Subject: Merry Xmas to all and to all a great day!!

My wishes to you all for a better year next year, free of the heartache and
grief that we've felt as a world this year. To all my friends and yet to be
friends, all the best, hug your kids, your wife or husband, phone your
parents, and enjoy the holidays to the utmost!! My home is your home,
always.
Kindest regards
Courtney Hook
