Subject: front shift rod 76

hey y'all

purchased the new bushing for the front of the front shift rod, as I was told it would improve my difficult shifting.

shifter out okay, under the bus to see the rod, it's a tube, with a cup at the front end to receive the shifter assembly from above, then the tube continues, presumably to receive this bushing and attach to something at the front of the bus to brace it.

Well, mine was just free floating in there, connected to the rear shift rod at the coupling, at the shifter assembly only. I assume I am missing something at the front of my bus to receive this shift rod/bushing?

There is a piece of metal with a hole in it that the rod goes thru, but it doesn't touch anything.

Your thoughts?
