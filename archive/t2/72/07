     Slowly getting the web site up and going.  I just have to much stuff and 
now that I'm disabled, I really can't be moving engines and heavier parts 
around anymore, Doctor's orders.  So I need to clean house.
     It's a very nice rack, I don't need it, I have a cut down T-4 rack on my 
bay.  You can see it at <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/or3/ilovevws/Bay.html">http://www.angelfire.com/or3/ilovevws/Bay.html</A>   
                                                                        
Peace,
