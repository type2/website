Subject: any tricks to remove fan hub?


Man, is this thing on there good. Does anyone have any tricks to get the
hub off the crankshaft on a type 4 motor. I've been trying a puller, the
kind with the bolts that go in the hub's bolt holes and pushes in the
middle. No Luck. I tried heating it up with a torch, but I was afraid the
oil seal was gonna melt. I might just cut the seal  off and torch the hub 
to hell and use the puller again.Theres got to be an easier way. Any help
would be appreciated. 


PS - please reply to eddie(-at-)gacker.com
