Subject: Riviera ID Plates

Can someone send me a photo, digital or otherwise, of a Riviera ID plate?
Doesn't have to be perfect, just somewhat legible.  We should be able to fix
most defects in the computer.

I think I figured out how to reprint the Rivi ID plate.  Take a look at this
page from the Houston Metal Shop Club.  Down at the bottom.

If I can get a decent scan and the tests of the etching process work out,
I'll be happy to reprint anyone's plates.

Regards,

Grant
