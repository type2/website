I went out and looked at the box the fuel pump came in.  On the sticker with 
the english description and UPC code it said "pushrod 107.5mm."  

I measured the pushrod I took out -- 107.5mm.  The one I put in was 99mm.   

That was it.  I figured that with this new fuel pump with the slanted 
geometry (to accommodate the larger diameter alternator -- which I installed 
a few years back), I needed a different length pushrod.  Nope.
