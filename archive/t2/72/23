There ya go bro. Was there anything wrong with the old push rod ? I've been 
through a few pumps and never replaced the push rod and....The new one 
always work.  I've got a bocar and yeah the hoses were opposite from the 
Brazilian.

Un hook the output, place a container to catch the gas get someone to turn 
the engine over and check, if nothing reverse the hose from the tank and 
turn over again, still nothing put the old pushrod back in and repeat.

I'll bet on the push rod, it's my understanding that the shorter push rod is 
for fuel pumps that fit under alternators.
