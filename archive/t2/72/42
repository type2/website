Subject: excessive valve clearance

To the list,
Best wishes for the season...I hope I won't be spending my holidays on my
back under a bus...but here goes-
	- 73 1.7l, top end rebuilt 4,000 miles ago
	- running very well
	- recently drove a short distance to the store, all's well
	- came out, started bus, sounded horrible, ran very rough, backfired
	- drove slowly home - not much power
	- pulled valve covers - discovered #2 intake has excessive valve clearance
        (1/4 inch)
	- pulled out the pushrod - not bent

Why the sudden, excessive clearance? Have I dropped a valve seat? If so, why
has this happened?
I had the heads rebuilt 4,000 miles ago - new valves, guides, springs...

Thanks
Happy Holidays, I hope...
