Subject: Now..hot was method...was [T2] Exaust Leak

Steve,

A couple of the "old" timers on the vintagevw list apparently had this
discussion a couple of years before I got there.

Heat the nut/bolt gently with a torch(not necessary on exhaust as you just
warm up the engine) and then hold wax against the object to be removed.

Apparently the wax actually wicks in around the threads.  Leave it till it
has cooled and it is claimed that they will almost fall off!

One of they guys on the vintage list(NQ) didn't believe it till he tried
it....and then added it to his signature line cause he was so impressed.

I'll let you know in a week or so after I get a chance to try it.

BTW....I have used stainless nuts extensively in the past and liked them.

What I hear from a welder friend of mine though is that stainless will
*not* be stainless any more if it is in contact with any iron/steel....it
*will* eventually rust.  No flames please...your mileage may vary...


Merry Christmas to all!, dave
