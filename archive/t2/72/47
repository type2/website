Subject: generator light....


Hey,

I have put new generator brushes in the top part of my generator about 2 
weeks ago.  That stopped the generator light from going on.  Then it started 
to come back on three days ago.  I put in new bottom generator brushes.  the 
springs seem to be pretty tight. and the generator light went out again. so 
yesterday I was christmas shopping and the generator light went on again.  
High revs would not bring it off.

I checked the brushes and they are almost warn down already.

So, I have put in a new regulator about 1year ago and a generator is 5 years 
at least.
How do I tell if the generator is bad....should i suspect the regulator?

Anything else??  This is my daily driver....need to fix soon.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
