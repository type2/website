sure sounds like it.

did the person who did it know how to work on air cooled heads, they run
many degrees hotter than a water cooled head.   

I have had a head done by someone who really knew what they were doing go
bad in less than 5k.  seems the DPO had overheated the head and the seats
lost thier "Temper" and were soft.

I have had good luck with "Diesel" valve seats and have them mechanically
interferred with when seated.
