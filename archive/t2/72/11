Subject: Opinions, Please

Since it's still Friday here for a few hours, I'd like to take this chance
to send out some holiday greetings to all members: A belated Happy Hanukkah
to any Jewish folk on the list, a right-on-time Blessed Solstice to all you
Pagans (yo! over here!), Merry Christmas to the majority, and Happy Kwanzaa
to our friends of African heritage.

That being said, on to the bus content.............

I am planning out some electrical *improvements* to my 74; mainly an
alternator-controlled relay for my fuel pumps and tank flow valve which will
include a manual bypass switch on the dash "just in case". Where would be
the better location for the relays? Up front under the dash and run the
power leads back to the engine compartment? Or put the relays in a box in
the engine compartment and run the control leads up to the dash? I know what
I think, I'm just looking for other's ideas.

Also, how much juice does that little blue wire from the alternator put out?
Enough to power a couple of relays and maybe an indicator light (other than
the one on the instrument panel)?

Careful out there on the roads over the holidays!

Thanks,
Dave
