Subject: Propane Heater

So, Since one answered my call for help with the heat I decied to just
take it appart and see what was going on.

So I found that a spider build a web in the pilot tube and has clogged
the pilot jet.  Was is the recommended procedure for unclogging the jet,
or should I just get a new one.

BTW, I did get the main burner to work.
