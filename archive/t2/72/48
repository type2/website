In my youth, my father and I crossed the Smokies in our '63.
On the downhill side, we were passed by another bus really
smoking us.  We caught up a long way later at a truck stop
and had to ask how the hell he was staying on the road as
well as he was.  He smirked and showed us a half-ton of
firebrick on the floor of his bus.  Said it gave him the
handling of a go-cart, but only downhill.
