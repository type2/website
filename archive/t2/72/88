You can use an impact wrench to tighten the three jaw puller.  Be careful
you don't mash the end of the crank.

Sometimes just leaving the puller on real tight overnight will have it loose
in the morning.  Careful with torces around aluminum.  I guess propane's ok,
but I have sure destroyed some aluminum with acetylene.  Happens in an
instant.
