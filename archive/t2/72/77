Subject: Bentley Has Forsaken Me

Greetings All,

Before I get into my little tale of woe, I'd like to wish all out there a 
happy holiday season.  We all need a little time to be with family and 
rekindle those values we hold most dear.  The best to each and every one of 
you.

On to the problem at hand................  just a little while ago I asked 
the list for any tips gained from personal experience on removing chrome 
(getting the Duck ready to paint).  I also mentioned that I'd have my trusty 
Bentley to guide me through the process.  Imagine my surprise when I found 
that Bentley does not cover exterior trim.  Doesn't even mention it!  
HEEEEEEEEELP..........................!

So what's the trick in getting the "beltline" aluminum trim molding off a 
deluxe bus?  I assuming (hoping, praying) that this can be accomplished from 
the outside with the proper technique or tool.  I have to reuse the stuff 
(Man!  Have you seen the prices for a set of this trim?  Whooeee!)  Puleeeze! 
 Share your knowledge with me.  I will be forever in your debt.

Mike
