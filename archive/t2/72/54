Thanks for that info Martin, that Devon roof style is hard to tell apart from a
Dormobile unless it is seen in the up position,

Devon also had the version that only the flat top when up, and left a frame on
the roof, I saw one in Ottawa this year,, and it was the same as Pg 83 in the
book, VW Bus, the first 50 years. They call it a Eurovette

That is the style I was familiar with until I read the rest of that page, which
shows a Devon Moonraker with that same style top as Tony's Camper on Rob's page


One question I have while searching the net for pics to compare,, I found Dom
Coll's page and it shows a Devon version that looks like a Dormobile?

What do you think?
