Hi All, 

Hope your Christmas has been good.

I received a real nice gift, that I wasn't expecting, that I will use in
addition to my portable Buddy Heater.

It is a Coleman Powercat Catalytic heater.
Ths thing has a fan which runs on two D cell batteries, and is good for
18 hours of operation.

It states right on the front of the box---       " indoor Safe"----

Real nice looking unit, already hooked a bottle of propane to it, and it
throws heat real nice----especially when the fan is turned on.

Neat gift-----

Neat Heater---

Merry Christmas to All, and I hope Santa's been good to you too !!

Later,
