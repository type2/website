Subject: Need BN-2 Heater Tips

Happy Holidays Folks! I'm in the process of retrofitting a BN-2 heater into 
one of my busses. The heater powers up, but the fuel pump won't activate. If 
I supply ground to the pump itself, and then tap the pumps positive terminal 
with 12v, it will tick like it is supposed to. I've never played with the 
BN-2 before, only BN-4's and BA-6's. Does anybody know if the fuel pump 
contact points on the BN-2 are located on the fan shaft like the BN-4, or are 
they located externally? Any tips would be welcome.
