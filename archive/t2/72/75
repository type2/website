Subject: Re: [T2] any tricks to remove fan hub?

Eddie,

You were on the right track with the puller and the torch.  The hub is
tapered and then torqued on to a fare-thee-well, so they are generally a
bear to remove, but if you put the puller on, torque it tight as you dare,
then hit the hub with a torch, it ought to pop loose.  It really helps if
you are in the upper mid-west, where the temp of the crank is likely to be
near 0 tonight, but even so, if you tension it, then hit it with a bit of
heat to expand it, it will pop.  Whatever you do, don't hit the
end of the crank or the hub with hammer!  Neither end on nor side to
side.

In addition, I think you ought to put a new seal for the end of the crank
on your shopping list.  Imagine you finish up, put it back together, and
find that you have munged the seal and have to do the whole job *again*!
Right now, with the hub off, it is 5 minutes and 5 dollars.  Think about
it.
