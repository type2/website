Here is my VW at work story.

I work for a paid Fire Department in Abilene Texas.  If you look in the
parking lot of any of our 8 stations ther is primarily one kind of
vehicle, pick-up trucks.  When I showed up about 3 years ago in my 71
Superbeetle it definately generated quite a few comments.  Then about a
year and a half ago I showed up with my puke green-yellow 74 Westy and
got even more attention.  I getr all the hippy, dope smoker jokes but I
dont mind.  One thing about these guys from Texas, the are very proud of
the fact that they are from Texas!  The fact that I was born and raised
in Utica New York really seems to get under their skin.  Throw in a
couple of old VW's and it really gets them going!
Needless to say, there are no other VW's in our parking lots.
