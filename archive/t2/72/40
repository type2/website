Steve,

Whoops!!!  Al is absolutely correct on both points and I left them out of
mine.  I'd change the order...

First, SAFETY GLASSES!!!  first and foremost!  and goggles are better...
there is always a lot of rust down there and you don't want an
opthalmoligist flicking at your eye with a steel needle, do you? (BTDT)

Second, heat. Al is better at this than I am, he has a proper torch (and
lovely assistant :-), so this works better for him, but a propane torch
will definitely improve things.  Red heat, then hit it with the socket
while it is hot as he said.

I've never used sealer, but it may well help... I will look into this for
next time.  And the brackets come under "of course!"  If they are not
there, you are certain to be back down there in a couple months.

Lastly, I just remembered, John and I found metric stainless nuts when we
installed my engine 2 years ago, and I gotta tell ya'... they are the
cat's meow on subsequent removals!  They won't help this time, but are
definitely worth looking for if you plan on keeping the bus.
