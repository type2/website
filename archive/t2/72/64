Mike,

Sorry to say I don't think it was me :-( I did a write up of replacing
pilot bearing in the end of a T4 crank, but not the throwout bearing.
The T/O bearings are cheap enough, compared to the time-and-sweat cost of
engine removal, that replacement is SOP for me.  The bearings are sealed
and buried in the bell housing, so if it is going, replacement is the only
option.

As a general rule, tho.... if a bearing is just starting to make noise, it
usually has a while left.  You should be fine to the inspection station
and back, tho it should be added to the list for the next engine pull.
YMMV, of course.
