I've been known to do this in absence of a puller. It is a bit back-woods=

it works.

Get some flat stock steel - preferrably 1/8" or better, 2-3 inches long a=

least an inch wide - and place it between the hub and the case so that it=

support the bolts you're going to torque down against it.

Use at least two pieces under two of the bolt holes. Make sure the stock
contacts as much of the case as possible.

Thread the fan bolts down till they contact the stock and then alternate
bringing some pressure onto them.  Eventually, the hub should pop free...=

Careful- not too much pressure. If the stock bends, stop there and tap on=
 the
hub with a dead-blow hammer a few times.
Leave the pressure on and soak it with wd-40, try tapping a little more
later...
Don't have your face down there when it comes free...
