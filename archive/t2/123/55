Looks like you may have an early pop top model. I think they made them until 
73, maybee 74? not too sure, but what you are describing is the same top my 
71 had. The 79 hinge should be on the back with luggage compartment in front. 
I know my friends 76 was set up that way as well. If it is definitely a 
"Westfalia" top,  you will need to look at gaskets from an earlier model. If 
it is aftermarket, I dont have a clue. Hope this helps!
