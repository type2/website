Believe it or not it is actually in the pile of xtra parts I got from 
the PO (of couse I thought it was some kind of army surplus thing he was 
unloading on me ) Can  I convert this "cot" into an actual bed that a 
human could use? Have you ever seen this done? As it is it doesn't look 
very comfortable. From all the other posts it looks like I'll have to 
stick with what I have so I need to figure out how to accomodate one 
more person without the side tent option.
Thanks
