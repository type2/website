I had never seen a listee in the wild before and am in the US visiting =
Trudell of list so we went together. Such a nice time! We won nothing at =
the raffle, chattered to list people who look nothing like I imagined, =
ate at the American Legion, all the stuff. High points were long =
conversation with Uncle Jerry and Melissa , they very kindly showed us =
around with introductions and good ravings. We met rustybus. I felt =
myself to be in the presence of greatness, no question. PLF Dawn is =
back. She is selling her canvas gear etc. again and is out of the dark =
at last. Nice to see that. We ordered an annex/tent. The samples were V =
fine quality.
    Great buses all around and a common obsession in the air. Thanks to =
all there. See you at the next one.
    Barry Wright
