Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump dying?

Could your inlet from tank to the pump be restricted?  A year ago I had
fuel starvation - (ran ok, but lots of "hesitation" up the hills on the
way to the Maple Grove show; when I pulled the line to the filter, all
this brown silt came out, followed by clear.  New filter, all was fine. 
Couple of mo ago I noticed the pump was noisy, and changed the filter. 
Since I was low on gas, I drained the tank and then blew air up the line
when I changed the filter.  I used an airgun and upon the first "hit"
heard this tonking in the tank that soundede like something rolling
along the bottom.  Don't know what it was- maybe a strainer over the
outlet opening?  It's been running OK since.
