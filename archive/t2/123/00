Subject: Re: [T2] Type4 Aluminium Valve covers

Robert,

I think it's also been discussed that the painting of the stock steel (tin)
covers flat black assists in the heat dissipation (oil cooled).  I had a
problem with a leak that turned out to be a warped (just enough) steel
cover;  I can imagine that aluminium would distort quicker if your engine
got hot enough....

Maybe I've just listened to the "Stock is God" lectures too long, but except
for some technological advances (pointless ignition, etc...) I throw my lot
in with the "VW designed it that way for a reason" theories.  YMMV.

Good luck.
