Subject: fuel pump dying?

Hi guys
I have a '79 Westy with stock FI.

Lately (recently) the fuel pump has started making a constant
whining/buzzing noise.  I can hear it quite prominently in the cabin, can't
really hear it too much outside because the noise of the engine masks the
noise from the pump.

I don't drive the Bus much and I estimate that I've only put around 10,000
miles on it since I bought it.  Soon after I bought it in '99 I replaced the
fuel filter so the fuel filter has at most about 10K on it.

There were no rusty chunks in the old filter or anything to indicate that
such a problem may exist in the tank.

I am not experiencing any driveability issues.  The Bus starts and runs as
well as ever.  No loss of power on the highway or during other
high-fuel-demand situations.  Just the pump making noise.

I'm just wondering if I should be concerned or if it may go many many miles
before it dies.  I know that usually pump noise is a result of restricted
fuel flow into the pump but I don't have any other evidence to support that
theory.  The onset was very sudden, one day it wasn't making noise, the next
day it was.

I haven't been driving the Bus much lately as I've been doing a lot of
business travel, so for the past 3 weeks or so the Bus has sat for a week at
a time and then I would drive it on the weekends.  I'm wondering if sitting
for long periods of time might have something to do with it.

Just wondering if I should worry or not.  I am traveling some more starting
this week and I won't be around to do anything to the Bus between now and
EveryBus.

Thanks in advance for any help :-)
