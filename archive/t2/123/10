Subject: Re: Valve covers - removal and replacement

Hi Folks,

I agree with the "Stock is God" idea for the most part, especially when it 
comes to my engine (T4 GD 2.0 FI).  However, since I replaced my hydraulic 
lifters with solids, I've been dealing with issues of removing and replacing 
my valve covers when adjusting my valves.  The larger T4 heat exchangers and 
engine carrier make for a very tight spot, and prying the bail down and off 
with a screwdriver (a la Muir) is pretty tough.  I would think that a pair 
of bolt-on valve covers would be much easier, and the aluminum ones with 
fins would seem to improve on VW's flat-black crinkle-finish steel.

Do any solid-lifter T4 owners have any tricks for getting those stubborn 
bails off and on when adjusting valves?

Thanks and take care,
Jason Upper
