Concur with Steven's double-prong push-on suggestion...hell, cutting the
wire you're attaching to and splicing the additional wire in is better than
Scotchlok connectors. Any home warehouse or hardware store, Wal-Mart-style
store, FLAPS or electrical supply store has wire nuts. Use 'em and be happy.
