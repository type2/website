1) you are missing the regulator!

2) you need two pieces of angle iron. The angle iron gets bolted to the two
straps. You have to drill 4 holes in 2 of the outriggers. The outriggers look
like an upside U. The first outrigger is about 4" back from the front edge of
the sliding door opening. Two holes go in the front part of the U. The second
outrigger is a little over a foot back. Two holes go in the rear part of the
U. Have fun drilling!! The angle iron goes over the rolled edge of the U.

3) See the half-moon on each end of the guard? On my 77, the edge of the body,
below the sliding door, is in line with the front corner of the half-moon. The
one towards you as you have the tank laying in position.
If you don't understand what I mean, let me know and I can take pics of it.
