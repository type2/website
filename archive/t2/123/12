Subject: type1 motor in a 72-79 bay

Hello all,
          I know must people think it's a bad idea to put an upright type1
motor in 72-79 bus and I DO TOO!  But I'm looking for information for a
"friend".  I've searched the archives and didn't find much specific info and
what it entails.  I know you'll have to modify the engine tin to fill in the
gap but what about fabricating motor mounts?  If anyone on the list has
completed this retrofit I'd like to hear from you via pmail.  Thanks, Marcus
