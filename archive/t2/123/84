Before you try a new pump, consider this (if you have an early BN 4 with =
the diaphragm pump - this doesn't apply to the fuel metering later BN =
4):=20

Your problem may be an old, hardened fuel pump diaphragm.  I had very =
much the same problem.  I solved it by taking the pump apart and making =
a new fuel pump diaphragm.  When I removed the old, rigid (it's supposed =
to be flexible and soft) rubber part, I tested the fuel pump and found =
that it worked, the hardened diaphragm was preventing it from working =
properly.  I followed Ron Van Ness' procedure as described in the =
type2.com library.  Worked well.  The hardest part was finding the =
material to make the new diaphragm from.  I have some fuel resistant =
rubber sheeting you can have for nothing if you want to try it.  Let me =
know and I'll send it to you.
