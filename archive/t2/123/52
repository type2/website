In answer to you 2nd question...don't use any goop on your pushrod tubes, get 
new Viton seals (about$17/set (-at-) BusDepot.com), take very fine sandpaper and 
smooth out any burrs in the head holes (lightly), clean em out and light 
wd40.  True the tubes round (get rid of dents on the ends) and make sure the 
seal channels are even.  When you insert them, should be resistance...work em 
in slowly and use an appropriate size socket to tap them home...90% of the 
time this will work with no leaks.
