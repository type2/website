Subject: Tuneup report and timing difficulties

Drove the bus (74 dual sollies, manual, federal)
a little this weekend and things weren't right. 
It had decent pull off idle but crapped out
relatively quickly.  My last "tuneup" included
points, plugs, condensor, cap.  Timing was set
only by the static method.  My crapola 009 was
replaced with a dual vac off a 73.  Drove much
better.  I pledged to do it properly with my
analyzer and strobe later.  In the meantime, I
purchased a vacuum guage.  Now, I was ready.  

So, after I drove the bus this weekend, I thought
the point gap may have changed and it was a
little off at 40 dwell and a little more than
.016.  I reset it to get 54 dwell and .016.  Now
that I think about it, I'm going to recheck it
tonight to ensure I checked it at the right
rpm--1000, right?  

Then I hooked up the strobe.  Amazed to find that
I could remember how to do it (prolly 12 years
since I used it last, when I last owned an
aircooled bus).  With the vac hoses on, it was
set real close to 10 atdc at idle but would only
advance to about 25 btdc at rpm.  Not nearly
enough, right?  The idle retard definitely
worked.  With it off the idle was a few degrees
btdc.  Disconnecting the vacuum advance had no
apparent affect on the timing.  

So I began checking vacuum.  FWIW the two ports
on the left solex are as follows:  the right port
has vacuum at idle (and therefore should be
connected to the idle retard on the inner face of
the vac pot) and the left port has vacuum at open
throttle (and therefore should be connected to
the advance on the outer face of the vac pot). 
Am I right so far?  

I checked the vac advance on the outer face of
the vac pot by hooking up the guage and squeezing
to get vacuum.  It held it.  Same way with the
retard.  The advance appeared to shift the plate
when I sucked.  Maybe not enough?  

Anyway, I ran out of time.  I intend to double
check dwell at rpm; check the amount of vacuum
coming off the carb ports at idle and at rpm
(2500-3000 right?); try to double check that the
plate to see if it is still moving when the vac
advance is sucked; and replace vac line.  It is
new and seems to seal but I just got the right
stuff from Ron so I'll do it to ensure its not a
line problem.  

Anyway, I guess I have a dual vac that runs like
a 009 until I figure out how to make the advance
worked.

Any thougts from the listvolks?
