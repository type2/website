Subject:  Re: [T2] torsion arm install

Once both arms are on over the ends of the torsion
leaves (and the center lock point is retightened), lift the first arm with
a crow bar and whack it with a hammer to drive it home.  Then repeat on
the other side.

I am not happy with what I described, but it is the only way I know to do
the deed.  I would love to hear that there is a better way!  If I have a
helper, I prefer to have them hold a block of 2x4 over the end of the arm
as a softening block, but if I am alone, there is no way to do that and I
whack directly on the end of the arm... ouch!

Use gravity ... Install the lower ones first. Put on the upper ones as far =

as they will easily go. Install hub assembly and hook up to tie rods. Now =

use a hydraulic jack and lift the front wheel assembly and thereby raise =

the upper and lower torsion arms. You still need to wack the arms - but =

not as hard and it can be done without a helper. I have done it twice - I =

HATE rusted out frontbeams ...
