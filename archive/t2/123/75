Subject: San Francisco listees

Hi all,
Due to some business travel, I'm going to be in the San Francisco area for
about the next month and a half (yes, I'm still going to EveryBus).

If there are any listees in the area who want to meet up at some point,
please e-mail me off-list.  I'll be there through May 18 so there's plenty
of time :-)
