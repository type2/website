Subject: wiring terminals - adding a wire

Volks,

A private conversation I was having brought to mind a product I feel you
ought to know about.  Many times, for various reasons you may want to add
a wire to an existing push on terminal.  What follows is my advice... use
it or not as you see fit.

In most FLAPS you can buy what are commonly called "vampire" or Scotchlok
connectors.  Many radios, etc. come with them in the installation kit.
IMNSHO... THESE ARE A BAD IDEA!!!!  If you don't know what they look like
see:

By piercing the insulation, they allow moisture to enter what was, until
then, a solid and stable wire and will cause corrosion and electrical
gremlins in short order.

Instead, let me suggest that you go to radio shack's site
(www.radioshack.co,)  and search there for product # 64-3064.  These are
2->1 connectors that you can slip onto the existing male terminal
that allow the addition of a new wire.  They are *far* more reliable in
the long haul and allow for removal without damge to the existing wiring.
I keep a baggie with a couple of these in my electrical kit at all times
(how age changes us... the baggies now contain electrical connectors! :-)

I would not argue too hard with anyone who decided to solder the new wire
to the old, as long as they also insulated the connection with heat-shring
tubing.  This certainly provides a better connection, but is not easily
removable.  But the Scotchlok connectors are strictly for the birds!
