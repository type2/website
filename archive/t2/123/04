Get it moving!  Your holding it in one place to long.  I assume your running
the flux-core instead of gas.  If you can make the gas conversion you'll be
happier as well.  I'm assuming you have the power/feed speed cranked all the
way down?

Good luck,
Bill

Volks,

I am not the most experienced welder in the world, but when I worked on the
steel yard, only had to weld 1/4" and up not thin body metal, so bear with
me.

If anyone uses this sort of machine on their bus, can you give me a
baseline?  I am running .22ga wire..........on sheet metal.....I have fooled
with it on some scrap and either i burn thru or get popcorn.
