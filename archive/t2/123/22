Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Matt,
Just to shoot a temp related snake you should measure the resistance of Temp 
Sensor 1 ( You replaced Temp Sensor 2). Temp Sensor 1 is located at the 
input of the intake air sensor. What year is your Bus? From Feb 1976 on the 
connector air sensor has 7 pins. the resistance at room temp between pin# 6 
and pin# 27 should be around 2500 ohms. If yours is earlier model with 6 
pins measure between pin# 6 and Pin# 9.

Some recommend finding vacuum leaks by spraying WD9 or propane at a 
suspected leak and noting any increase in RPM or if they have a C0 detector 
looking for a jump in C0 in the exhaust.


Chuck

>>Chuck,
