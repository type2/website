Hi all

When I put Polly together again I will need to lay some new wires.  The
wires currently go under the bus, I am thinking of taking them through the
inside long the wall (without the sliding door).  I will still need to go
under the bus to get past the cab bit.

 I plan to bring them to a plug on the wall of the engine compartment on the
right (looking in from the back) to a plug on the bulkhead next to the gas
filler, I believe F.I. versions have a plug here.

1.  Does this make sense to anyone? or not

2. Any problems having the plug close to the gas filler?

Thanks
