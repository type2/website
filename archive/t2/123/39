The possible problem might be too little deck height which would give you
too high compression, which is a aircooled no-no. Other thing might be
unequal heights which for max power you'd like them all the same. That being
said, if your reassembling known stock parts you might be ok.

the Wilson book give a good discription, 1 your less likely to drop the two
shims on the dist drive and if you do you get easily get them out. 2 you can
check the orientation of all recipricating parts, ie the marks on the
crank/cam are in the right place,dist drive right place,mark on dist and
rotor all in the right place, and you can check your work.
