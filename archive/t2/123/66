Kev,

As others have said, the poptop you have was stock on '68-'73 buses.  In
'74, the cargo section moved to the front, the hinge and bed moved to the
back.  If you need new canvas, you should  order it for the '68-73 poptop
you have.

What your P.O did is probably the most practical way of making a westfakia
(a passenger bus converted to a camper, years away from the factory :-)
with a later body.  The problem with installing a '74-79 Westy poptop on a
non-westy body is that in addition to moving the hinges, the later
Westfalias had a major portion of the roof removed to accomodate the
larger flat bed in the rear. To compensate for the loss of integrity, lots
of extra bracing was welded in elsewhere..  The earlier Westies were based
on sunroof bodies, which I will bet yours was from the factory.

Unless you want to do a *lot* of cutting and welding, I would advise
staying with what you have.  I'm not saying it could not be done... money
can cure many problems, but If you truly lust for a '79 Westy, buy one...
it will be cheaper!
