Subject: Pop top

List,
I have a 79 with a poptop installed by PO. The poptop is hinged in the 
front and the luggage storage piece(w/the slats) is in the rear of the 
bus. This doesn't seem to match any of the 79 poptops. I have seen. I 
 need to replace both the seal and the canvas so I need to know what I 
have here??
 I would also love to know if I could find the correct top as this one 
has no provisions for an upper bed . Thanks all
