Try poking a rag under the middle of the bail, looping it through and pulling 
on it.  It works well on type 1's. Much easier and quicker than removing 
bolts with a socket wrench.

I saw_no_advantages to the "fins" on the aluminum covers my bus came with.  
They caught and held road crud and engine oil and made it tougher to keep the 
covers clean.  Oil leaked around the seals and through the bolt holes.
