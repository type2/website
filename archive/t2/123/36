Umm, I believe it should be all metal and has a small winder inside to open & close it.

Let's hope your's is too :-)

Well, that's a good sign.
Incidentally, have you checked out the entire cab floor & steps, the battery tray on the right hand side of the engine bay & the bottom of the windscreen?

These are prime places for rust as well as those skirts & the floor in the back where you've already found rust.

Mmmm, it's probably not a bad idea for you to do a short 6 or 8 week welding course at evening college........I did one myself, it was fairly cheap & even though I haven't done much work at home since it means I know what's involved.

Welding is practise more than anything else as anyone here would tell you so it's best if you can get some help to get started & then spend a little while just welding the sort of old thin steel you'll have to on the bus.......it's different to new mild steel & a little more difficult to do so you want to make your mistakes on scrap.

>How hard is my buss to fix? Can I do it? I don´t have much experiense.

Well, it all depends on how persistant you are.......also get you friend to look at the bus; what does he think of the rust? He'll be able to give you an idea as to what is going to be hard.

What you will need is at least 2 wheel stands so that when you get to welding the skirts & particularly the wheel guards you can get down on the ground without the fear of the bus collapsing on you.

Remember you'll also need an angle grinder with cutting & grinding wheels for any metal work you doing to clean & cut an area & needs be.

Also there are heaps of rust conversion products these days that are epoxy based & if the metal isn't too far gone in places you can spot weld small holes & paint it with converter, providing they aren't load bearing members.
>If you need more pictures of the bus I can get it(and smaller ones too),

Well an inside shot of the sun-roof would be good to get a better idea.

Just out of interest, what size engine is it running?

:-)
