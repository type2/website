Subject: BN4 Heater Testing

I just got my gas heater I bought recently fired up. It runs good but I think I don't have something with the temp regulating switch on the ducting setup correctly. The heater starts good and gets nice and warm but after just a few mins kicks off completely. Then after sitting for a few more mins it kicks back on.  The switch was set when I got it with very little play. Only maybe about an inch of travel. By the way, I am just bench testing in the back yard.  I unscrewed the set screw on the temp reg switch so that the heater would get hotter b/c at first it didn't get very hot at all until I unscrewed the set screw some so that it wouldn't cut the heater off until it reached a hotter temp. My understanding of the function of this switch is that it cuts juice to the fuel pump when the temp of the air exiting the heater execeeds a give temp, but that the blower fan should still run until the temp goes down and then the fuel pump would kick back on again and heat the air once more and so on... But my heater is just completely shuting down for two or three mins and then it kicks back on its self and goes at it again for another two or three mins and repeats the cycle.  

Has anyone had this problem and/or know how to fix it. Or is this how it should work. I didn't think it was by what I have read by I could be wrong. Thanks for the help.
