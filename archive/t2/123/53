That is definitely what my problem is. For some reason instead of the temp switch just shutting the fuel pump off it is shutting the fan off too. Maybe something is wired wrong. But tried to follow everything that is in the articles you pointed out. I just don't know why the switch would tell the fan to quit b/c thats what is happening.  Thanks for your input. It helps.
