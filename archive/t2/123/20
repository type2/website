Hey, i know this might be a little late, but there's a penetrating lube 
that Chrysler makes.  You'd have to go to a dealership and ask the parts 
guy to sell you a can.  It's the best rust freeing stuff i've ever used, 
and it made my studs come right out without any problems...  It's got a 
Mopar part number 4318039.  They call it Rust Penetrant, Heat Control 
Valve Solvent.  It's the best secret they've got.  Give it a try if you 
want.  I'd just be scared of torching my heads.  But that's me.
Oh yeah.  You've got to let the stuff soak for a while.  Spray it and 
let it sit, and repeat a couple times before you try to get them out. 
 This stuff turns rust into mud.
Hope it works for you as well as it did for me.
