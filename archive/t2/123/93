hello everyone,
           I have a 1969 bus. From what the vin code says, is that it was=
 made on Jan. 7,  1969. My color code is 4242 which is lotus white, on lo=
tus white. I checked the library, and archive, and it seems there are som=
e differences in opinion. What I see in one, is that lotus white was only=
 used until 68. Another says, it was used until 71. Does anyone know for =
sure?  I was wondering if my Bus could be a late 68, or still have some 6=
8 options on it (ie: paint color) being that it was made so early in 69. =
Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
