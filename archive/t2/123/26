We are now less than a month away from EB and everything is looking good.

Richard is still taking t-shirt orders and YOU MUST PREORDER NOW if 
you want a shirt. I had 50 people ask me last year for shirts after 
they saw how cool everybody else looked wearing theirs but there were 
not shirts left. Visit the web site for details.

We are going to have some very interesting buses at EB this year. 
There will be at least one if not two BINZ split screen crew cabs,a 
retired SWISS ARMY baywindow bus, a 1.9 turbo diesel Vanagon Synchro 
westy, in-line 4 Vanagon conversion, a bunch of hi-top campers and 
tons of other cool buses. If you want to see over a hundred buses 
gathered in one place than EB is the place to be!

Our team of young ladies has been working hard to develop kids 
activities. So for on the list are a sack race, two levels of 
scavenger hunts, three legged race, water balloon toss (Keen will 
love that) and perhaps someone's bus will get painted. In fact if the 
folks who painted their bus at EB last year would contact me I would 
appreciate it very much.

The carabus list is growing strong and long. So far from Maine to 
Florida, California to Canada and all points in between.

We look forward to seeing you all at EB!

Thanks
Chris
