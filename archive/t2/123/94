Subject: Re: [T2] Re:heater fuel pump

I am also having the same problem with my heater shutting off and not running for very long. I would like a way to fix this. My understanding is that just the fan should continue to run while the fuel pump stops until the air cools enough. Then the fuel pump kicks back in, but when the air on mine reaches a given temp the whole shuts down until it cools for another few mins and then starts back up. Does anyone know a solution for this?

Thanks,
Casey
