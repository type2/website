Jason,

Look at:

This  tool or its equivalent is really handy for removing/replacing the
bail on a T4 valve cover.  If you have a torch and can put a spot of weld
inside the crook, it improves function immeasurably, BTW.  You will see
when first you use it that its one weakness is that it slips up as you pry
down. A spot of weld prevents that.

I have not commented on the AL covers because I have never run them.  My
memory (from 70s/80s bugs being run by friends) was that they leaked like
seives.  I don't know if it was low initial quality, inability to
expand/contract, or warpage, but my meories are not happy ones.  Still,
that was then and it wasn't me running them.  YMM very definitely V.
