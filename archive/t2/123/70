The place is called "Crazy Rays, and it is right on route 1 in Jessup, MD. I stopped, and asked if it was available for parts, and was told no, it runs and was for sale whole. When I asked if I could take a closer look at it the said "I don't know" and disappeared into the back. I didn't have time to wait, so I went out and walked by it, has the usual cancer in the rockers and dog legs, but not the worst I've ever seen. The interior looked "OK" from what I could see, which wasn't much. If it really does run, and the front beam isn't bad, easily worth a grand-BUT, I have no idea what they want for it. Also, be forewarned these did mot appear to be the friendliest nor the brightest folks. It may be worth a look. I wish I had room for it!     Jeff

Crazy Ray doesn't keep stuff long, they are "Strange" but the prices are
right
