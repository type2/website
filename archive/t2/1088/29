Many many years ago the list started sending a "baton" around in the form 
of a hubcap that all the list members were signing.  Eventually it started 
collecting additional memorabilia along the way as well.

Someone on the VB list asked if anyone knew where it was...


I last saw it in ~~2000 when I passed it from Charlie Ford to Andy P. in 
Miami.

No good pictures from that era, but did come across these recently, with 
the box and some of the bits showing, on the hood of my brothers Scirocco:
