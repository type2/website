For those looking for where it goes though, it is not at all unheard of for
the tab to go missing totally or partially from the heat exchanger in the good
ole rust belt, usually ripped off attached/rusted to the pictured bracket, and
both discarded long before you bought your bus.  So although the location on
the fand shroud is actually pretty obvious, the one on the exchanger may be no
more.  Sometimes just a thin remain of where it was tacked on.

This bracket goes just where is says in the ad.  There should
be a threaded boss at the lower corner of the fan shroud on the
left (drivers) side and a tab on the heat exchanger just below it.
