I contacted Big Mike.  Here's what he had to say.

"I had the hubcap for a bit, gave it to Myron Hill from here, who did 
nothing with it, and he then gave it to Greg. Last I heard, Greg took it 
to a vw show in tulsa and handed it off. I will call him and ask him if 
he knows what the deal is."

I think we should wait to hear back from Mike.  I can then contact Greg 
if necessary.  I can also go pick it up, but not until the second 
weekend in October.
