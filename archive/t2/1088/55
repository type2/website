Hi  Volks,


I HAVE LOCATED THE HUBCAP!!!   There is no need  for a replacement.

It's in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I have the  email address of its
current custodian.  So... where does it go from  there???

I'd suggest we let Troy pick it up; bring it to EveryBus for  Mark to
drool on and then take it west again to give to Don.

But  that decision is not up to me; ultimately it is up to the Hubcap.
The guy  who has it now is Greg Mogle, he can be reached  at

coolest thing other than the Va. Tech sticker was the  old glode holder 
that Jamie Rivers made for it to be displayed on   later  mark d
