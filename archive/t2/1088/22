Subject: Re: [T2] Bracket Heat Exchanger Support ??

This bracket goes just where is says in the ad.  There should 
be a threaded boss at the lower corner of the fan shroud on the 
left (drivers) side and a tab on the heat exchanger just below it.
Like the ad says, it is VERY often missing and causes things like the 
bolt loops on the exhaust pipes to crack and the copper o'rings to 
fail prematurely. The right side is supported by the alternator bracket 
(the upper, adjusting bracket).  
Sorry I don't have a fan shroud at hand for a picture.
You can see the stud in fig 7-3 of the Bentley in the engine and clutch 
section under section 7.1 Removing and installing Fan Housing.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
