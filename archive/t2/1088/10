Subject: Re: [T2] NGK Spark Plugs

For NGK plugs I have been purchasing from www.NGKwholesale.com

I recently purchased enough BP6ET plugs to do my Bus and
two BMW E30's.  The price was a very reasonable $3.05 each.
I have pretty much given up on Bosch for spark plugs as I 
never know where they are going to be made and some of the 
really bad ones (made in India) are often so crude that I 
wouldn't put them in a lawn mower!

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
