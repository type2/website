Guys, a serious bummer.  :-((

He checked out my wife's Karman Ghia around the corner from
him before we had it shipped to us here in Arkansas.

I just happened to be on real time with my mail today instead of being 10,000
messages behind on the T2 list.  I am really glad I didn't miss this  
post today.

I am going to miss him a lot.  He was more than generous with both
help and parts.

Cheers ,dave
