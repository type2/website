I used Coppercoat gasket sealer  either spray-on or in a can with a lollipop brush. I coat them heavily and let dry to a very sticky tack and they stay put. -BaH

Hello, I am installing new exhaust
manifolds on a 2000cc engine in a 73 bus.
the Gaskets seem to set on top of the manifolds. I am
laying under my bus to
do this, the engine is still in the bus. Looking at this
picture its looks
like as I try to install the manifolds the gasket can get
easily of center of
the manifold and not give a good seal. Any one have some
advise on this
instillation on how to keep the gasket from moving as I
install?
Thanks!!Steven
