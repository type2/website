Yeah Troy, it was in New Mexico. I was willing to go down too. But I
seem to recall whoever had it didn't want that to happen, but my
memory could be faulty.

I have hubcaps I can use, but I think it would be cool to get it from
Ron. It'll take me a weekend or two to get the box done once I have
the hubcap.
