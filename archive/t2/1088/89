I think a key thing to find out here is whether he is just a forgetful
procrastinator, or whether he has decided this is his personal trophy.
If well intentioned, a lot can be done to help get it back. If
defiant, that's another story.

 Dammit, I want the original back on the road with my own personal "John
 Hancock" on it. And the crate-load of mementos to go with it. Reading the
 logbook was quite the fun evening. Hopefully the current custodian will have
 had enough of it by now and it can get moving. Let's give him a week or so
 at least to come up with a reasonable plan for hand-off, then get
 progressively more creative in our persuasion...
