Subject: 1974 dual carb adjustment

Hey guys, I need help adjusting my dual carbs.  The timing is set correctly
and I just rebuilt the carbs.  I cannot find a good literature review on this
matter.  It will start, but it backfires quite frequently, and the mixture is
way too rich because the smoke is horrendous.  It's not oily smoke, just too
much gas.  Any help would be appreciated. Also, If I cant get the carbs to
work out, is it possible to convert the engine to fuel injection?
 
Thanks, Monty
