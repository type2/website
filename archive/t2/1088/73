Karl sent me the cleanest I'd ever seen exhaust u-pipes for my 78 
camper, and a heater box connector as I recall.  Never forgot that after 
I got on this list, I mentioned to him I found Krusteaz pancake mix out 
west when touring in our 78 and liked it, but could not find it out 
East.  He sent me a case of it.  His last help was with the new Bosch 
Mexican distributor BusDepot sells for the late Bus, said it was not 
enough advance, so I timed it around 3 deg more advanced at idle and it 
is fine.
