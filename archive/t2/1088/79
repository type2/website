Be gentle dudes... a cornered (insert descriptive here) often fights back,
or just closes off.

That said, I'm all for a new cap just like I was years ago. - The Bus Depot
has offered one, and I have a raised center chrome cap I'd throw in honor of
Boston Bob (if honoring the recent losses is the route taken). I'm not much
for mystical- but new energy would power the new project and journey
forward.

(Steps off soapbox) Apologies if I offend anyone.
Mike
