And Boston Bob (within the past year.)  They will all be missed, and  
are a huge loss to the vw community.

I remember being broke and without options in NC when our AFM went  
out.  Two days later, FedEx showed up with one, courtesy of Karl.  He  
wouldn't accept even a bit of change in return. It's still installed  
in our bus.  Truly an amazing person.

RIP

Peace, Troy
