Subject: Inline Fuse Holders

Ok, now both of the inline fuse holders in my 78's engine compartment
are shot. The one on the left side popped open on me today on the way
to work and I spent the past 4 hours chasing why the bus wouldn't run
or start. It's my own fault for not checking that particular wire, but
I'd like to find something that cannot open on its own.

Any recommendations? I'm thinking the blade type fuse holders the
FLAPS sell, but I really don't want to have to carry two different
types of fuses.

I'm also considering casting one of the original ones in resin... With
the fuse cast inside. Of course, that would make replacement
difficult... ;-)
