Subject: sudden change in oil temp

I have 73 Westy. The previous owner added a Porsche oil cooler that sits 
midship and has a fan. There is an oil temp gauge mounted there to read 
temp exiting the cooler. In the past few days, and never before, the oil 
temp readings are dramatically higher. Any ideas about what may be going 
on. The oil pressure is good and the engine seems to be mechanically 
sound. I just changed the oil (15-50W Mobil 1) and dipstick says full.
