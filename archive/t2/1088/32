Subject: Trip Report: PGH->Colorado (and back) - sitings

As part of my trip report, I thought I'd mention the notable bus
sitings along the way:

1. White '67 camper in the Fraser/Tabernash, CO area, belonging to a friendly
guy named Dan.  We had seen his bus parked when we were driving around and he 
stopped by and said hi when he saw us hanging out in a parking lot.  Very
nice guy who has taken his bus to Alaska a couple of times and is now running
a 1600DP that used to power a rope tow ski-lift.  When we were talking about
carbs he said he was running 122.5 mains on his dual dellortos (I later found
out that I have a 120 main/125 AC in my H30/31 carb, which might be too small).

He told us about a family doctor up in Granby who is the local VW guru and has
some sweet buses.

2. Tan, stretch bay window bus headed west on I-70 near (and west of) Indianapolis.
This was on Sunday the 13th.

3. White bay window on CO-93 between Boulder and Golden, heading towards Golden.
Looked well loved. 

I was surprised that I didn't see more buses in Boulder...I seem to remember more.

Anyway, those are the notables that I remember.  Saw a Vanagon coming down
a pass that we were headed up and was happy when they waved. 

Woot.

Cheers,
   Avocado Tom
