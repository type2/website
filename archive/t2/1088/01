Subject: fire extinguishers ... 

This thread circulated a few weeks ago . I ignored it and deleted the msgs .
I kept meaning to post a msg regarding this system I saw in the UK . finally
I found the ad in VWCamper the ad .. and the bus I saw the system in shows
the system incorporated in the engine bay of a bay window bus .. the web
site doesn't appear to show it . but maybe if you  were to surf around you'd
find this pic .. anyway .. since I ignored most of the thread I do now know
whether or not this has been posted .. if so .. sorry to waste your time ..
if not . here it is .
