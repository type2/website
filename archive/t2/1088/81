Subject: Broken bolt in manifold: OT just a bit

I didn't break the bolt on my van, it was on my truck, but I am hoping no
one will mind if I ask the question.

I do all the work on my vehicles, and so when it comes to finding someone to
do what I cannot, I am never sure where to turn. The bolt is the one that
holds the exhaust pipe against the exhaust manifold. It snapped off inside
so there is no edge to grasp, and I don't own anything like an easy-out set.
A torch would get it so it would turn, but its too far down for me to be
able to turn it, so....

I have the manifold off the truck, is this something a decent machine shop
could do for me? The muffler shops probably break a lot of these, but around
here, they are mostly the national chain stores, not my idea of the right
place. I never have had to go to a machine shop, so I am naive about whether
they can do the job, or will just laugh at me :-)

Am I on the right track? Sometimes, being a lifetime do-it-yourselfer leaves
you without the right answers when something like this comes up. :-)

Any suggestions for who to see about extracting the remainder of the bolt?

Thank you for your time, and the space here. I would love to add something
vanagon/bus related, but my 81 air cooled is just sitting waiting for me to
get the truck out of the garage, so I can finish the engine rebuild and get
it back on the road.

Much obliged,

John
