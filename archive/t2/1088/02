After a rebuild you need to do the initial setup again. If you don't
have Bentley and need a quick fix, FLAPS should have the new Chilton
with the red bug on the cover which also does a good job covering the
settings.

 Hey guys, I need help adjusting my dual carbs.  The timing is set correctly
 and I just rebuilt the carbs.  I cannot find a good literature review on
this
 matter.  It will start, but it backfires quite frequently, and the mixture
is
 way too rich because the smoke is horrendous.  It's not oily smoke, just too
 much gas.  Any help would be appreciated. Also, If I cant get the carbs to
 work out, is it possible to convert the engine to fuel injection?
