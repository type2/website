Hi Volks,

I'd vote against a replacement hubcap. If we can't get this one unstuck 
we don't deserve to have another. Do something different if we have to, 
but not another hubcap.

Dammit, I want the original back on the road with my own personal "John 
Hancock" on it. And the crate-load of mementos to go with it. Reading 
the logbook was quite the fun evening. Hopefully the current custodian 
will have had enough of it by now and it can get moving. Let's give him 
a week or so at least to come up with a reasonable plan for hand-off, 
then get progressively more creative in our persuasion...

That's my $0.02


Happy Trails,
