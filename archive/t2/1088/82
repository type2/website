I think I have something similar to this:

You can just put it in your drill and then put it in reverse and it will 
drill into it and pull it out - kinda like a backwards drill bit.  You 
should be able to find it at your local Sears.

That, or bring it down to a machine shop.  They should definitely be 
able to do it in a few minutes.
