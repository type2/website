This came up a couple years ago on some list (might be one of the
Vanagon-specific ones since I think I had the 84 Westy at the time)...
didn't seem to be alot of support from folks - which made little sense to
me, since it would give those new to the community (and potentially more
actively bouncing around the US) a chance to get their name on and be part
of the travelling hubcap (Chapter II?) story...
