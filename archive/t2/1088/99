Subject: 78 Westy Bus for Sale - Rochester NY

All,
 
My neighbor down the street is forced to sell his cherry 78 Westy. I
have worked on this van and it is in great shape.
Below is the Samba Listing
as well as the link to some pictures on the Empire site.
   
1978 Volkswagen
Westfalia Camper Price: $8995.00 This a very nice nearly original Bay-Window
Westy. Updates include new Radio, Push-rod tube seals, Acellerator Cable, Gas
Shocks, Fuel injector fuel line replacement and new tires. Floors and sheet
metal are solid and it has been professionally re-painted to match it's
original color. 

Stored winters and cared for Impeccably - needs nearly
nothing ! 

This Westy is originally from California I was told and made its
way back east to Buffalo and finally to my home here in Rochester, New York.
It's ready for that cross country camping trip and a good home. 

Things to
consider doing in the future 

A. Replace rubber window mouldings 
B. Drips
oil (they All Do) 
C. Replace shifter bushings in the shift tube 
D. Fix the
refrigerator
