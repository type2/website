Hi Volks,


I HAVE LOCATED THE HUBCAP!!!   There is no need for a replacement.

It's in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I have the email address of its
current custodian.  So... where does it go from there???

I'd suggest we let Troy pick it up; bring it to EveryBus for Mark to
drool on and then take it west again to give to Don.

But that decision is not up to me; ultimately it is up to the Hubcap.
The guy who has it now is Greg Mogle, he can be reached at

Happy Trails,
