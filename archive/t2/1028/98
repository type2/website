Subject: Length of battery cables for manual 77  Baywindow

I'm about to replace the cables on my Westy and wondered if anyone knew the
length of them off the top of their head? Are they just standard cables, or is
there something I'm  missing? I figure Wallymart will have what I need, or Pep
boys etc.
Thanks,
Courtney
