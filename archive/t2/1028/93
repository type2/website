Subject: Parts 71 Westfalia

I found a 71 Westfalia to use for parts for my 68 Westy.  The motor was the
primary reason as it was rebuilt not too long ago,  is a DP, and runs great.
Questions are:  What's the best way to get the disk brakes swapped over to the
68?  It has what looks like a 12/110 volt refrigerator instead of ice box is
thi factory intalled and is it worth fixing?  With some of the rust issues on
the 71 I don't think the body is a viable restoration candidate but will make
it available to list members.  I'm in Central CA.
