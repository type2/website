Thanks for the information, I already know about this, but my bus is not yet
30 years old. It was produced in February 1978 (according to plate and other
hints, e.g. still has the round heat exchanger flanges on original engine) and
then obviously sat around at the Westfalia production plant till it hit the
road at the first of April 1979. The vehicle has to be "officially on the
road" for 30 years to get a historic tag, so I'll get this next year. This
still leaves me with the problem to cover the time till April next year and of
course my beetle is way too young to get the historic tag...
This law is really hitting hard the owners of early vanagons (especially the
diesel ones), since their buses are way too young for the historic tags. One
thing to consider is also the fact, that "youngtimers" (20-30 years old) will
be taken from the street and I wonder who will keep his car parked on a
private parking space for that long to be considered an oldtimer some day.

Cheers,

Timo
