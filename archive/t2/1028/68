Subject: RE: Brake Drum Defective?

Hi Andy,

Looks like some pretty scary stuff, I wouldn't use them.  What brand are
they and where did they come from?  Maybe they are part of a bad batch that
snuck thru quality control?  I would never mess around with anything suspect
in my braking system.  As I see it, "If my bus won't go, that sucks for me.
If my bus won't stop, that sucks for everyone in front of me."

Good luck.
