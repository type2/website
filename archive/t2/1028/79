Subject: NOS Late Bay Treasure Chest Door For Sale

Hello again, a friend here on the island has dug a NOS treasure chest
door out of his stash. It has the later bent rod type hinges and two
louvers. This may fit SC Vanagons as well. Also included is a NOS
latching mechanism, but no key. Both items have the original part
stickers on them. The door has some surface rust, but no pitting or
dents. He is asking $300 plus shipping. Email me for pictures. Thanks,
Timo ( check out my new website at:
