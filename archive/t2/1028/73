do you mean by removing the firewall? Ineed to replace my sender and it would
be nice to be able to do it withoutcutting any holes (and dropping the engine
is such a ball ache when yourgarage is the size of mine).-- Dave Horrigan,

Dave, on a USA version mid 74 and up bus, with the swing arm sending uni!, it
is possible to replace the sender with the engine in the bus. The space above
the tank is enough to get your arm in and the sender out.

I have done it before.

But if you have a type 1 engine in your UK bus...... sorry, I believe you have
to drop the engine or cut the hole.
