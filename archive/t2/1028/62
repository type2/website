that was how I felt, gotta take the air cleaner etc off  and remove
the firewall. then get the smallest hand you can beg borrow or steal
in there.  which ends up being mine.  I find if the engine is in that
it is easier to lay in thee bus and work thru the hatch but to each.
doesn't really take much in the way of tools. a long thin screwdriver
helps but isn't essential.

don't forget there are two (-at-)##(-at-)()& screws up from the bottom into the
firewall too. one way out on the end of each side.

reach in
. remove the two wires. note where they went'
. turn sender approx 1/8 turn anti clockwise
. it pops loose. pull it out to the front being carefull of the
gasket.
. when out of the hole slide it all the way to the side.  I find the
side with the battery, pass side in the US. seems to have bit more
room.
. while in there check the vent tubing esp the connectors.


reverse above..

the screw driver, well sometimes it is tight and the screwdriver will
fit into the little notches in the sender to give you some leverage to
twist it either on or off.  while the sender will look like it fits in
any one of the slots for it to work right the float has to go to the
side. don't think either side matters otherwise it hits the tank going
up and down.

don't forget the gasket, really not as hard to keep in right place as
I thought.  I can do it in about 2 hours.  take your time and take
breaks it can be frustrating at times but it will suddenly slip into
place if you fiddle with it enough. it is not the most awkward job on
a bus but it is way up there.  good luck

sometimes I've gotten lucky and it has only taken 15 minutes. but
give yourself 2-3 hours if you have never done it.  besides the sender
the firewall is a pain too. but you know that.
