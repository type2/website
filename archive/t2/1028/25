It may be fuel, but it also sounds like a lack of ignition advance. Have 
you checked your advance at high speed and not just at idle?
I forget what vehicle we are talking about in terms of specs but your 
mechanical advance (vac hoses disconnected) should be around 21 -24 
degrees at 3400 rpm.  Check your specs here:

If you are not getting close to that the weights inside the distributor 
may be sticking.

Secondly, check to be sure your vacuum advance is working.  At idle 
disconnect the vac hose from the source, leaving it on the can on the 
distributor. Now suck on it.  The engine will speed up a bit if it is 
working.  If it does not you may have a vac can with a hole in its 
diaphragm.

This will help determine if it is a distributor/advance issue or not.
