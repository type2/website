Subject: problem found.

ok guys, they found my problem... still have very small vacuum leak,  
but my right hand head i had the valve spring replaced on.. is  
backfeeding through the carb.. so basically the head needs the valve  
lapped. I thought he had done this, but he obviously didnt when he  
replaced my valve spring.. so out comes the engine again....
