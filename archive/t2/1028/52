our Bus fuel line kits are the best thing in the market. i think they are
better than any of the vanagon kits as well, the main reason being that
all of our kits have pre-cut hose and perfect OE parts throughout. we have
worked very hard on these kits to make them as good as they are and they
are by far our most popular item.
