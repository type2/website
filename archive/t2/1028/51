Subject: FI Fuel line replacement hints.

Hi guys,

I am about to embark on replacing the original fuel lines on a 75 fuel injected Westy sitting in my garage.

Are there any good references available?  Bentley leaves a few details out.

I have lots of experience on the Vanagon FI system so this should be similar.

Does anyone know if there is a Fuel Injection hose kit for the T2s like there is for the Vanagon from a couple of vendors?  Or is it up to me to piece meal this together.

All of my old bays have always been carbureted so this is new to me, but hopefully not too far from Vanagon systems.


Thanks for any help and assistance.

Cheers,
