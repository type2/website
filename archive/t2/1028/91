Subject: free bus

I have a 1978 that is headed for the scrapper. Anyone in western WA looking
for a parts bus? Two engines with low compression, one FI setup (one bad
injector). Body in decent shape pictures available on request. Headed to a
wrecking yard tomorrow. Bad ball joints, bad left rear wheel (bearing?), hinge
for slider missing. bad turn signal cancel switch, glass is all good except
for rear hatch glass. Sad to not be able to finish the project, but foolishly
bought a "rebuilt" motor that clearly had been cleaned/painted on the outside
with a new flywheel while the inside was trash. 80psi in all cylinders and I
am not going to spend 3k to rebuild it.-Gerry
