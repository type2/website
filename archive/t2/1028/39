Well thaaaaat's discouraging.  My '74 Westy that I've had for two (cold) months is having similar
problems.  Was running great but now I have to keep pumping the gas to keep her running, "pops and
farts", etc.  I've been following your progress, or lack there of with interest and was hoping you
would get it figured out so I could piggy back on your work, I'm a real novice.

It really feels like my Honda '80 CB750 felt before I cleaned the carbs, like a plugged jet ...
but you've tried that.

Now that it's warm enough out (for a few days) I'm going to follow the steps in the book and do a
complete tune up, do all the maintenance stuff and maybe I'll stumble across something.  I did
take out one of the plugs and compared it to the pictures in one of my books, it's black at the
end with carbon? build up ... the book thinks it's running lean. So first, I'll try to determine
if there's a vacuum leak, but I can't hardly keep her idling.  

Best of luck at the engine builder, please keep us informed as to what you find.  

Steve
'74 Westy
