That points to a fuel problem, lean running as if your main jet is way 
too small or venturi is too big for the jet.  When you pump the gas 
pedal, the accelerator pump is spraying extra fuel into the throat of 
the carb.  That makes up for the lack of fuel coming through the main 
jet and gives you the "more go".

Time to swap carbs, IMO.
