You never checked that? A $10 vacuum gauge doubles as a low pressure fuel
pressure gauge. When checking stuff like this, Get a "Tee" connector and put
it between your pump and your carbs. Check press at idle and at 2500rpms. 3
to 5 psi IIRC.

I went to an electric on my 73 because the good German pumps were getting
scarce.
