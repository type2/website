Hi Blake,

Thanks for sharing that... Spring got a little closer while watching 
that here in snow-bound Southern Ontario.

One of my best bus memories of 2007 was taking my westfakia out for 
three laps on the track at Watkins Glen.

I wasn't able to give it everything I had due to the fact that I was 
number one behind the pace car. But there were a few times when the pace 
car got away from me and I had to flog it to catch up. The video segment 
   linked above showcases one of these moments. I also have a pic of the 
bus cornering where the passenger side front tire is only barely 
touching the pavement. It was definitely a memorable experience.

Next time I will go with a camera mounted directly to the dashboard, as 
I did for the video I shot coming home from EveryBus 2006:

Happy Trails,
