Hi,

I just wanted to remind everyone that EveryBus 2008, the 10th annual  
gathering of VW Transporters, is just around the corner and will take  
place 10 miles south of Greensboro, NC. Last years event brought  
together over 170 VW Transporters together.

The event web site is located at http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/index.html

Also, event T-Shirts are on sale now and can be pre-ordered at
