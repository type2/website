Subject: Replace sender w/out cutting a hole.

""Bob, when you say 'space provided', do you mean by removing the firewall?? I
need to replace my sender and it would be nice to be able to do it without
cutting any holes (and dropping the engine is such a ball ache when your
garage is the size of mine).""

I changed my sender in my '78 years ago without cutting any holes.? I removed the firewall between the tank and the engine, and though it was tight, I was able to R & R the sending unit without too much trouble.? I couldn't make myself cut a hole.
So it can be done.
