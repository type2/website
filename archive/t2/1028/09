Subject: Re: [T2] New cylinder heads and german environmental issues

There is an easy alternative: get historic tags (H-Kennzeichen),  
these are exempt. Since your bus is 30 years old, it qualifies if it  
is in decent enough shape. Given the money you just spent heads, I  
presume it is ... This will also lower your insurance. The IG T2 has  
a good club insurance deal for buses on historic tags with almost no  
restrictions on usage.

Shop around for inspection stations that are not too strict on the  
inspections for historic status. They are out there ...
