Hi Don,

Nice video, it definitely explains what's going on.

There's definitely a vacuum leak someplace. My FI is running at 16" of 
vacuum at idle.

Start capping off hoses and see if you can improve things. If it's not a 
hose, check the plenum-runner boots and look for leaks between the heads 
and runners or at the injector seals.

I use a can of quickstart spray to find a vac leak; just squirt it at 
the vacuum connections and listen to hear the engine speed up. When it 
speeds up, it's sucking in the quickstart through the leak.
