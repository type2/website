3mm Baltic Birch plywood is the product to use. It comes in sheets  
1.5m square (approximately 5' X 5'). No splicing/joining involved if  
you use that stuff. Most decent lumber yards either carry it or can  
special order it. It can also be mail-ordered, but shipping would be  
quite high because it's so bulky.
