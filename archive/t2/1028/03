Thanks for the idea, but I already checked with the council. They do
only accept EURO cat norms, not US specs.
The conversion would be a big project here in Germany, since the buses
here never came with a cat nor fuel injection. So I'd have to get a
california exhaust system, fuel injection, fuel tank and nice guy at the
local emission test station to accept the conversion.

Thanks anyway,

Timo
