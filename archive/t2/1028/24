Subject: Re: [T2] FI Fuel Pressure

Don, I don't know what the barometric pressure is up
there, but the regulator is supposed to do 2bar with
the vacuum line hooked up to the regulator at idle and
then disconnect the vacuum line and plug it and the
fuel pressure should rise to 2.5 bar. Down here, that
is approx. 29 psi / 36 psi.

Furthermore, if you suspect it is too high, you can
remove the return line after the regulator and slip on
another chunk of line to run the fuel into a gas can -
if the pressure is lower this way, then there is
likely a blockage in the return to the tank. -BaH
