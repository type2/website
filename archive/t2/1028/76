I could not find anyone in western Canada so I ended up ordering 2 cases
of Brad Penn 20W-50 to be shipped 2000 miles to Calgary from German
Supply (thx Scott).
Well, today I got a follow-up email from the guys at Hill Petroleum in
Colorado that they have signed up a new distributor of Brad Penn oils in
Calgary. Hooray!
For anyone in this neck of the woods, they are:
Classic Performance, phone 403 216-6060  or http://www.classicperformance.ca

Do you think I can find Brad Penn 20W-50, Swepco 306, or even a bottle
of STP (red) oil treatment??
Noooooooo.
