Subject: Re: [T2] headliner

Hi Mark, I am replacing the headliner in my '73 and am thinking I'll just
cut a new piece (out of thin wood panelling) using my existing headliner as
a template. Maybe someone else has been down this road and may have some
advice. I usually err on the DIY side, which sometimes can spell trouble -
but then again the DIY part is most of the reason I bought my bus!

Cheers,
