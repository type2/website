Subject: Bentley is MIA and I need a measurement

Hey gangie,

For some reason, I cannot find my damn Bentley and I wanted to double check
the torque on my head and rockers.

Zoey has a 76 FI engine.

If someone can tell me the initial and final torques for the heads and
rockers I would greatly appreciate it. Foot Lbs. (or as it is stated in the
Bentley) would be wonderful.
