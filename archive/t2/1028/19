Ether? That's scary. Spray it at the wrong spot and I won't need to trim my
beard for a while. I did do the carb cleaner thing, but I've never had much
luck with that. And I'm out of propane. :)

I'm going to let the engine get nice and cold and check the torque on the
intake manifolds and inspect the S boot for cracks (again).
