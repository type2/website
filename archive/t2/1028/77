Zach,

There was a thread on this a while back (at least 4 or 5 years ago), and some of us had actually made template drawings in AutoCad of the various early bay westy headliner and sidewall plywood parts.

For the sliding door and rear hatch panels, I used 3 mm birch plywood (slightly less than 1/8 inch thick) from a local lumberyard (available in 4 X 8 foot sheets), which, when finished with water based polyurethane,?matches?the original look pretty well (and is actually more durable).? 

That's all I've done so far.

When it comes to the headliner (the ceiling panels) you will either need material in sheets that are larger than 4 X 8 ft., or you will need to come up with a method of splicing smaller pieces together.? I don't recall that anyone ever came up with a slam-dunk solution?to the splicing problem.

Hi Mark, I am replacing the headliner in my '73 and am thinking I'll just
cut a new piece (out of thin wood panelling) using my existing headliner as
a template. Maybe someone else has been down this road and may have some
advice. I usually err on the DIY side, which sometimes can spell trouble -
but then again the DIY part is most of the reason I bought my bus!

Cheers,
