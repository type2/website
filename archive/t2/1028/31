Subject: rocker arm / valve stem geometry

I get conflicting opinions from the archives. Do I want the tip of 
the rocker adjuster to trace a path through the center point of the 
top of the valve stem or do I want the trace to be offset from the 
center?
Here is my thinking.

An offset trace would be good because it would spin the valve about 
its axis but bad because it would impart a sideward force on the 
valve guides.

On the other hand, a trace through the center would not impart a 
sideward force but would exert no torque to spin the valve.
