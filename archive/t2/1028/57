Return 'em.  

There should *NOT* be anything like that going on.  Think about it.  You
install those, and eventually, when you stomp the brakes, the outer
cylinder of the brake drum (the braking surface) will separate from the
hub.  The vehicle won't fall, but the braking surface *will* stop
rotating, whereas the hub won't.   Loud gnashings of metal-on-metal, a
violent yank of the bus to one side or the other, and probably a crash
will ensue.  

If you doubt the integrity of the part, no matter what it is, don't
install it.  It ain't worth the ulcer worrying about it. 



Due to rising gas costs I can no longer put in my $.02, so this is a
freebie. ;)
