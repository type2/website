Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Drum Defective?

Can you return it? I would. A local shop tried to sell me some rear
drums for my splitty years ago. The strengthening webs on the inside
were only 1/2 there, and there were thumb sized voids on the braking
surface that had been sloppily filled with some kind of JB Weld. The
thumb prints were visible! I was pissed, and took my business elsewhere.
