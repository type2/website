Subject: camshaft

ok, im kind of on a budget.. and compression around 145 on all cyls..  
so all seems good there.. i guess i could re ring it but what a pain..  
I mainly just need a camshaft Stock for 2.0 would be fine, and i can  
buy the bearings ;) If anyone has a GOOD used Camshaft and maybe the  
lifters let me know.. Hydraulic or non.. but if i go hydraulic.. dont  
in need new pushrods and rockers?
