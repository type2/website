Hi Scott,

try the library at www.type2.com; it has plenty of transmission info.

http://www.type2.com/library/drivetra.htm#7

Basically, it boils down to this:

1968-1973 = 3-rib "002" transmission.

1974-1975 = 5-rib "002" transmission.

1976-1979 = 6-rib "091" transmission.

As far as I know there's really no way to know if your transmission is 
original to the bus, other than comparing the number of ribs and the 
model year. And that won't tell you if it's original, it just tells you 
that if it isn't original it was replaced with the same model.

Happy Trails,
