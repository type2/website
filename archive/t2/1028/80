Subject: Transmission Clunking in Forward Gears  (AIRS-ish - Fremont,

Volks,

I just got a call from a friend with a '71 bus who is having a weird 
problem.

He was driving down the highway when he started to hear a rhythmic 
"clunking" sound, so he pulled off the highway near Fremont/Milipitas, CA.

The problem, as he describes it, is that there's a pronounced 
CLUNK-CLUNK-CLUNK sound which he can hear when the car is IN GEAR and 
moving.   He hears the sound at low speeds as well as high speeds, but it 
only seems to occur in the forward gears (i.e. not in reverse).  He can 
feel the CLUNKing through the gear shift and it is does not change in 
rhythm ... i.e. it's a constant and regular sound.

I am not sure if the sound speeds up with RPMs or not, he said he believed 
it did not, although he wasn't sure.  Upon visual inspection, everything 
looks ok and there is no appreciable non-axial play in the CV joints.

Any thoughts on what this could be?  He took it to a non-VW shop who said 
"A tooth off one of your gears probably broke off", but I don't buy that. 
I haven't really heard of VW trannys failing in this particular way 
(although I'm sure someone on the list has! ;) ).

Again the weird thing to me is that it's only when it's in gear (I'm 
thinking maybe that it's only when there's a load on the engine?) which 
seems to rule out wheel or CV oriented issues.

I've given him the name of a shop in Hayward which I found on the Roadhaus 
site, and he's contacting them presently, but any insights would be 
appreciated.

Cheers,
     avocado tom
