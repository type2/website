Subject: ok.. now what?!

ok guys, got my head machined and lapped etc.. good seal.. valves done  
put the engine back in.. Still has an issue.. When i Rev i dont get  
pop so much anymore.. (out of the carb) and if i have the brake  
booster hooked up.. going downhill in 2nd.. doesnt feel right, in  
third.. feels like it should.. so i capped off the braking system to  
make sure that wasnt my issue..I am getting fuel runnin on all 4  
cyls.. but if i take off in first gear.. it wants to revv to a certain  
point.. like i should be going faster.. but it wont.. i have found  
that if i pump the gas pedal.. i can get some more go out of it.. I am  
not sure what to do.. i dont believe it to be a vacuum leak but when i  
took it to the shop they said the valves were backfeeding out the carb  
so they were not sealing. I know this problem is fixed now.. so.. here  
we go again.. maybe that carb on that side is just shot.. i may throw  
a stock type 2 carb on that side just to see what it does with it..  
see if the major hesitation goes away.. i have a dual vacuum dizzy and  
only using the advance portion, and if i try to put a 009 in there.. i  
cant get it to run right at all.. without moving plug wires around the  
cap and still running bad, i will experiment with this.. anyone near  
utah??
