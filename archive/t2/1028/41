It's the far side of the sixth little rib counted from the
spare tire well, 35" back from the rear lip the door latch sits it.
In our 78 I drilled a 3/8" hole about 3" from the downturn behind the 
rear seat, then sighted the sender (you'll see the sender wire spades) 
to find exact center, and yes, it is safe to cut with a jigsaw blade 2" 
long. As I wanted to see into the tank's baffle box, I cut the actual 
hole (about 5"round) towards the driver side; the baffle box is towards 
the passenger side.  For good visibility, Hang a light inside the tank 
(those blue 9 diode lights from Harbor Freight, about $2.99 are great).
This assumes you drained all the gas!
      For a cover I used 3 tubes of a moldable epoxy plastic called 
QuickPlastik (Home Depot, selected because its "steel" counterpart had 
only 6 minutes of work time, compared to 20 minutes for this.)  I first 
put down Press and Seal over an intact rib zone  by the hole.  Then 
after kneading the epoxy and flattening it on a polyethylene box cover 
to an oval shape 3/16" thick extending about an inch beyond the hole, I 
formed it over the ribs with the Press and Seal under it. Then it was 
formed to go over the downturn a bit. It did not stick to my hands as 
some suggested it would.  After hardening, it was trimmed to a more even 
shape and sanded to feather the edges round.  It was drilled through to 
the metal with self-tapping screws mostly where the ribs were not up, 
and formed a good looking cover.  Put a bead of silicone around the edge 
and screw it down.
