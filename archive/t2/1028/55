hints.Message-ID: <264687.89329.qm(-at-)web37311.mail.mud.yahoo.com>Hi guys,I am
about to embark on replacing the original fuel lines on a 75 fuel injected
Westy sitting in my garage.Are there any good references available? Bentley
leaves a few details out.I have lots of experience on the Vanagon FI system so
this should be similar.Does anyone know if there is a Fuel Injection hose kit
for the T2s like there is for the Vanagon from a couple of vendors? Or is it
up to me to piece meal this together.All of my old bays have always been
carbureted so this is new to me, but hopefully not too far from Vanagon
systems.Thanks for any help and assistance.Cheers,Joel CortRochester NY
