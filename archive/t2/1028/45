Subject: repairing stainless manifolds in menlo park, CA

I've read last years thread "Can we weld new exhaust manifold flanges?" and have concluded that I cannot. So can anybody recommend a welder to fix a flange that is not yet totally separated from the manifold? I'm assuming it'd be good to tack it in place before separating the manifold from the u tube a.k.a. elbow. 

Let me say that I have welded a few times but I'm unlikely to manage this myself. Any help, advice, or caveats are appreciated.
