Subject: Baywindow Middle Seat Fold Down

I was just wondering if any of you folks out there have ever modified the
middle seat of your baywindow so that it would fold down.  The back already
does and if you could get the middle to do it to, it seems like it would make
it even better for camping or hauling.

Suggestions?

Thanks,
