Subject: [T2] ECU swaps in a baywindow....

In my troubleshooting efforts, I am gonna try an ECY from a friends bus...
He has a 78 as well so I figure it should work...

The question however, is Im not sure if it is a California bus or not....
Ive read that you cannot use a CA ECU on a federal bus...
The # on the ECU is:

0 280 222 166

022 906 021 AG

If it doenst work I would like to know it the CA ECU and not some other
issue....

Thank everyone...
Aaron
