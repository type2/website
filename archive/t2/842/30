 OK.  I do have a thermostate.  The cable looks new and is on the pully
 wheel and heads upwards.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Having a thermostat and have a working thermostat are 2 different things.

In the morning, when the engine is cold, look at the crossbar where the cable attaches. It the 'arm' standing
up? Can you push the arm forward or is it all the way forward when cold?

All the way forward means the thermostat is pulling the flaps to the closed position or the flaps/thermostat
is mis-adjusted.

Standing up means the thermostat is open, warm, or blown.

After you drive the bus, look at the bar again if it was forward before you started the engine. Is the arm
still forward? or standing up?
