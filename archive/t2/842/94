Ole "dyslexic" me again.  I meant to say the reverse.  Sorry for the
"cornfusion".

Well, out of almost 300 sales of this boot, there was bound to be one (or
perhaps a few) where there's a "monkey wrench" in the works.  Using your
measurements in the pic, I'll have to see if VWG can make this one as well,
but can make no promises.  Had to pull teeth (several prototypes) to have
the "B" made.
