After what i believe is thorough research the only real option for us 
type4 folks is to use the type1 65-70C thermostat which seems to be 
available from a couple of sources.  The type1 80-85C one which closely 
matches the type4 85-90C one is NLA.  Opening the flaps at 65-70 is 
better than not at all i suppose.

Did I overlook anything?
