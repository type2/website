There ARE shrouds with different size openings. There are actually three
alternator boot part numbers, the early T4 one, middle (the one repro'd by
VWG) and the late 70A one. But I am still trying to figure on how the repro
cannot be fitting, because if Troy had a very early T4 shroud, the new repro
boot would be too tight, not too loose.
