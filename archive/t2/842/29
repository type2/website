Subject: Re: oil breather hose-"cream fouling"

Re the "cream" under your fill cap or in breather box- I will second the 
need for a thermostat closing the flaps in winter  driving with short 
trips.  After about 155K I finally fixed my non-working one- much better 
warmup in winter and less foam-you gotta do some 3500 rpm driving for at 
least 1/2 hr to drive off the water vapor.  If you have no thermostat, 
and do short trips,  wire the flaps shut.  If you have a pressure gauge, 
you can see when the oil cooler is opening up- when the pressure drops 
suddenly (by at least 20, like 60 to 40), the oil temp has reached 180, 
based on my observations.
    You can Get an oil temp gauge (real easy to straighten the bent 
digital oven one with the braided wire and drop it down the oil level 
tube) and measure it when you did your 1/2 hr of driving- did it get to 180?
