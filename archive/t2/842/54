Oxygen Sensors were not installed on California Type 2s until the 1979 model
year, ergo, there shouldn't be an O2 sensor input on this ECU.

As to why there were Calif & Federal ECUs from 75 to 78, the only
differences I can see that internally they may be "tweaked" for passing the
emission controls at the time of vehicle production, based on where they
were to be sold.  I honestly don't know which ones are swappable and they
were even different between manual and automactic trans models as well.
This makes 16 different ECU's from 75-78 alone.
