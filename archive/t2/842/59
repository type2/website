Ok, a little more investigation shows that the two groove in which the fan
shroud sits, is a smaller diameter than what I originally had.  You can see
the difference here:

Part# for old boot = 021-903-655D
Part# for new boot = 021-903-655B

Not sure what the differences are here.  Do I just have the wrong version of
the part I need?  This new one is definitely not going to work.
