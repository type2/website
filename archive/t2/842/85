Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Refer Compressor unit for a T2 westy

From: "jon"

 Yup, just bought a 77 Westy that is missing the compressor unit for the
refer (which, I guess would make it an ice box).

 Anyone have any leads on this gizmo?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Do you have a sink by itself? [P-21 and P-22 models]
b) Or do you have a 2 burner stove to the right of the sink, under a wood cover? [P-27 model]

If you have a, then you have a cooler.

If you have b, then you will never find a compressor. The fridge is a ammonia absorption unit. It has no
moving parts.
Simple explanation:
Under the left lid is the heating element.  With an ammonia system, you heat up one end and the other end gets
ice cold.
And yes, the Westy fridge WILL make ice cubes in the 2 small ice cube trays.
The aux battery is ONLY there to maintain the temp when you are driving. When parked, you plug into 110V.
