Hi David,

It is nice and shiny. But there's no seal on the engine, the  
alternator ajustment cover plate is missing, the fan guard is gone  
and they forgot to remove the coil when they rattlecanned the fan  
shroud. Details like that make me wonder what lurks under the wax and  
armour-all.

Happy trails,
