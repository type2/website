Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

To clarify, the B boot (New one in my pic,) is smaller by approx 5 mm when
referencing the grove that the shroud sits in.  The D boot (Old one in my
pic,) is the larger of the two in this comparison.

Surely I can't be the only person that has replaced the alternator boot on a
bay with the same shroud as mine...which is stock as far as I can tell.  I
suppose for now I will clean up my old one which is not horrible,
thankfully.

The "B" Boot is apparently the larger of the two.  No one I know makes the
"D" Boot. :-(
