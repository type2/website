From: "dan radom"

this goes back to a conversation troy and i were having on IRC the other day about always running the bus for
at least 20 minutes when possible i suppose.  aside from maybe causing me to change my oil a little more often
is this stuff harmful?  i do tend to make a fair number of short trips what with running the kids around and
so on.

Do you have a thermostat?

Your engine is not reaching and running at operating temp.

Your oil needs to be around 200-210 degrees to evaporate the condensation in the oil. Steel items in the case
tend to rust......
