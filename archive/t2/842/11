Subject: Re: [T2] '74 heater/exhaust

Syd asked:


 Can I "peel" the shrouds, aluminium(?) heat extractors, from my stock "74
exhaust system, to just expose the "J" manifolds, so I can run without the VW heat system?  Has anyone done
this?  Believe me, I do have a legitimate reason!

Or.... you can replace the bus heater boxes with 411/412 mini boxes that came on the cars with a BA-4 gas
heater.

Good 72-74 bus heater boxes are getting harder to find......

I can take pics of what they look like, if anyone has never seen them.
