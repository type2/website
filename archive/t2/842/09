Subject: Photos of my tach install

Here is my first attempt at using kodakgallery to share photos. Hope it works. In any case, here is the inexpensive tach I installed in my 77 Westy, which works flawlessly with the Crane XR700 ignition. Rock steady reading with no jumping around. According to my digital tach/tuneup scope, it is pretty accurate too.
