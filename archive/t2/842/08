Following up  ... The hubcaps arrived yesterday, and it turns out they are
not just OEM but actually Volkswagen brand.  Packed 4 to a box in genuine VW
boxes, with the Volkswagen part number and "Made in Germany" right on the
box.

At this point I believe I have 2 sets left. (Use the above link to order.)
