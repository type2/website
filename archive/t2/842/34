Subject: Flap Movement (Was: Cleaning the oil breather hose)

All this talk about thermostats has me wondering...

I have 2 shrouds and 2 sets of flaps at the moment. Both require a
considerable amount of effort to move. I do have an apparently functional
thermostat (collapsed when cold, expanded when warm) that I got when Raby
listed his box'o'stats for sale.

The set in the GWB at the moment was very well greased by moi when I put 'em
in. But they seem to just stay wherever I put them. Even if it is pulling
the thermostat open.
