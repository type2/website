Subject: Cleaning the oil breather hose

Over the weekend I removed the oil breather hose and box from the engine. I noticed a little under the oil filler cap and sure enough there was a ton of it inside the tube and box. Some of it had even snaked its way into the s-boot.

Pretty yucky stinky stuff. If you've been doing a lot of short trips in your FI bus it might be a good time to check on the goo that's built up there and clean it out.
