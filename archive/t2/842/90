If your converting from 73 carb to 79 Efi... you might want to use the 79 
upper trans cradle as well. it has the throttle tube welded in the correct 
location.
Did you get the efi fuel pump tooo?

I found my shifter in my 74 would only select 1st and 3rd,,, I corrected 
this with the straght shift stick out of the 79.. and drilling a new dimple 
in the trans nosecone hockey stick gear selector..... it is 12mm toward the 
trans from the old dimple

Not everyone has encountered this issue.. and I am not sure anyone has found 
out why... but I think it is ... some folks use the 091 trans and the 002 
belhousing.. which allows you to use the cheaper available starters and 
clutch pressure plate stuff instead of the SR87 and 228 mm clutch ,, which 
is usually more money and maybe not quite as available.

In my case.. yes
74 body, 091 trans, 002 bellhousing, 2.0 liter engine. Efi
