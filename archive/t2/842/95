Hi Jay- Nyssa's bus is a 75, and I had a mechanic do over her engine 
over a year ago, putting in a 77 trans I got as a parter from Bus Depot. 
  (the original had a locked gear).  That one turned out to have a bad 
reverse and LOUD 3rd gear, so when we painted it, I pulled the engine 
and tranny together to switch it.  He had switched the bell housing on 
the 77 so he could use the earlier starter and flywheel, but I decided 
to use the longer new starter and bell housing I had with the 
replacement (78?) tranny and had only to switch the engine mounting 
bolts on the tranny to longer ones, as I think the later bell h. is deeper.
The trans otherwise fit fine to the shift rod, which makes me wonder 
about what Jon did to make the shifting OK- he did not mention this, 
however.  I have trouble understanding, for instance that the trans 
shaft is longer on the later tranny, but that is due to the deeper 
housing?  So if you use a later tranny and an early bell housing, what 
does that do to the trans shaft end position where the clutch disk is?
Maybe this is related to the flywheel- I possibly used a later one but I 
don't recall.  Likely Karl would know this.

  I understand now that the 091
  tranny is about an inch longer than the 002 currently in the 73.  On the
  FAQ (which was the best info on this I found) it states that putting
  this longer tranny in the early bus will move the shift rod back (away
  from the parking brake) due to it setting further forward in the bus.
  It says you can use shift components from the late bus, such as the
  shift rod, to put the shifter back into the right position.  What's not
  clear in the FAQ is if the shifter being moved closer to you makes it
  in-operable, or less functional.  If this simply brings the shifter
  closer to the driver, but doesn't impede shifting into the gears, is it
  really a problem?
