Subject: Crashed my bus!

I'm ok.
My 71 Westfakia bus has a caved in front end but is still drive able as  long 
as I don't need lights.
Some kid started an un safe left turn right in front of me and then  stopped.
No one was hurt but my bus may never be the same again.
The bitter irony is I just got my 65' International Harvester truck running  
today after over a year and now this.
