Subject: 79 091 Tranny and 2 Litre into 73 swap

     I have a 73 camper.  I pulled the engine, tranny, FI parts, and fuel 
tank from a 79 FI transporter.  I'd like to put the entire drivetrain, 
including the tranny, from the 79 into the 73.  I read the FAQ on ratwell's 
site and searched around.  I understand now that the 091 tranny is about an 
inch longer than the 002 currently in the 73.  On the FAQ (which was the 
best info on this I found) it states that putting this longer tranny in the 
early bus will move the shift rod back (away from the parking brake) due to 
it setting further forward in the bus.  It says you can use shift components 
from the late bus, such as the shift rod, to put the shifter back into the 
right position.  What's not clear in the FAQ is if the shifter being moved 
closer to you makes it in-operable, or less functional.  If this simply 
brings the shifter closer to the driver, but doesn't impede shifting into 
the gears, is it really a problem?  Having the shifter a little closer 
sounds great!  Does this move put the shifter in a position too far back to 
catch 2nd, 4th, and reverse?

     I might be able to get ahold of the shift rod out of the 79 I took the 
engine and tranny from.  Is that the right way to do this?
