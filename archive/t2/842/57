Subject: '81 Adventurewagen for sale: advice/interest?

Volks,
After 2+ years' worth of enjoyable but only very occasional use of Bertha,
our '81 Adventurewagen, we've decided to upgrade to a 2001 Eurovan full
camper. Bertha, therefore, is in need of a new home. She has just over
108,000 miles on her, almost brand-new tires, revamped electrical system,
etc. Below are some photos we snapped when we first got her in August 2003;
she's pretty much unchanged (aside from a few easily-removed stickers on her
back-side). Suggestions on a sale price? Anyone interested in her? We're in
Sacramento, CA.
