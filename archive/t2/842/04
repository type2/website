Hi,

Bus Depot has a kit (-at-) 14.95 :

"Complete kit includes new pedal, spring, hinge, pin, and boot"

When I bought the kit it only included the spring, hinge and pin, so I
guess they've added the pedal and the boot in the past few months to
the kit. I'm kinda bummed I didn't get the pedal and the boot...
wonder if they'd comp me? :)

or just the spring (-at-) 2.95:

I had adjusted the cable previously as you described, however I
noticed that if I pulled the cable too tightly that the throttle would
not return to the fully closed position.

peace
jules
