Nope.  I do not have a thermostat.  I drive 35 minutes each way to work
5 times a week.  Most days that is the extent of my driving.  How could
 my oil not be getting hot enough?

How can it?!?
35 minutes with no thermostat and your engine will barely reach 150 degrees if you are lucky. The thermostat
controls the flaps that control
air flow over the heads and cylinders. No thermostat or no flaps [on a type 4 engine is a total mistake] means
the fan constantly cools off the heads and cylinders and it will never reach operating temp. Unless the
fins are totally plugged with crap......

Here is a link to 'How thermostats work'. It talks of water cooled engines but the theory is the same.
