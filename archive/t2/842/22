this goes back to a conversation troy and i were having on IRC the other 
day about always running the bus for at least 20 minutes when possible i 
suppose.  aside from maybe causing me to change my oil a little more 
often is this stuff harmful?  i do tend to make a fair number of short 
trips what with running the kids around and so on.
