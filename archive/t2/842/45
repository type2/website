 How warm is warm? Any highway drive for 15 minutes should open them  up fully. I'm not sure about sub-zero
temps.

This is true IF you have the lower tin installed. If that tin is missing, that thermostat may never fully open
on a cold day. You have to have 160 degrees [or whatever your thermostat is rated at] all the way AROUND it to
make it work correctly. Looks real funny when just the top edge is expanding because the bottom is cold and
retracted!
