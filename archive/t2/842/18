It depends on well balanced your engine is. I have fully balanced engines
on 2 of my cars that I can take up to 6 grand. But I wouldn't take a
typical engine over 5000.

 Nice look instalation congratulations, I noticed in the pictures that your
 high mark is around 5000 RPM I assume your engine is a 2.0 L, somebody in
 the list know about the higher RPM poit for a 1600 DP type 1 engine with a
 205T dizzy?
