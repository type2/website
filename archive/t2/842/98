<<My 71 Westfakia bus has a caved in front end but is still drive able
as long as I don't need lights.>>

Run Silent, Run Deep, in the Westfakia at night.
It'll be a secret mission.
 
<<Some kid started an un safe left turn right in front of me and then
stopped. No one was hurt but my bus may never be the same again.>>

Aww---
A little cavin' a pavin' on that nose and a couple of spray cans she'll
be as good as new.

running today>>
