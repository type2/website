      I was taught about the calk line gig in a class back in college and I 
found for us older folks trying to see the calk line can be hassle.  So I 
started to use masking tape and was quite happy with it.  
     But alas, I was unable to finish my front seat covers.  Due to the age 
of the equipment, I spent most of my time working on the damn sewing 
Machines.  
                                                                              
           Peace,
