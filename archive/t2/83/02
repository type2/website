I think the Soviets could help you out; you know you'll need a special
license to have that stuff, right?

Nuclear-powered bus...hmmm...how about a little steam turbine in place of
your VW engine with a ball valve attached to your throttle cable to control
the steam going into it? Non-polluting, fairly safe so long as you don't
have any meltdowns, and you can even get an Alternative Fuels tax credit on
your 1040!

And once you get used to people writing "no nukes" on the back of your bus
as they walk past, you'll be good to go!

It may cut down on your cargo space a bit, though.
