Hi Melissa 

My experience with carb icing tells me 2 things that might help you out,,,,
icing occurs at a certain DEW point, when there is enough moisture in the air,,
your carb air movement makes the air colder, thus freezing the moisture and
choking the carb 

It usually happens in the spring and the fall ,, but NOT when it is real cold
out, as there is not enough moisture in the air to freeze,,, BTW , even in the
the summer the intake will feel ice cold as the velocity of the air in the
intake makes the air cold. 


That said,, I used to Race off road Vw's into October here in Ontario Canada,
and this icing seemed to give us trouble,   ,, as we didn't run stock intakes or
stock heater boxes, etc.. what we did was use a copper tube that is normally
used for oil pressure gauges, it is a very small diameter copper tube, You might
be able to use copper wire, I have no idea if the tube makes a difference,, 

Basically, we wrapped as much copper around the nearest part of the exhaust to
the carb,, then wrapped the copper around the intake,, the heat transfer would
be enough to stop the carb icing,,hold it on with hose clamps..

I would think you could wrap the #1 exhaust and tuck the tube thru the foam
engine seal, then wrap it around the #1-2 intake runner,  and the same with the
#3 exhaust and wrap it around the #3-4 

Another way would be using a larger air movement tube from under the cylinders
to the carb breather,  you might have to trim a small hole in the engine tin to
run a heat riser tube, but all you need is a few feet of the tinfoil type heat
riser duct tube,, hose,, what ever you call it, and you can safety wire it to a
pushrod tube under the cylinders where the warm air is,, and then run the other
end to the airbreather, 
The warm air from under the cylinders should stop the carb icing.
This is the method that Vw used on the stock 74 dual carbs, the tin brought warm
air from the #1 cylinder up the front of the engine, and into a spout in the air
box, and there was a valve that was vac/temp operated to select recycled warm
air or fresh air 

Hope that helps
