Being happy with it is the most important thing.

Having said that, you are now the future DPO
of a bus that will require sandblasting to correct
the paint, which will  be defective soon enough,
due to poor adhesion and other problems. The
sanding scratches will appear soon as the paint
cures, if not there already. It's hard to explain to
somebody why a gallan of paint can cost hundreds
(when Krylon is only a buck a can :) is it rated 50mph?
