Subject: I've decided

hello List,
        First of all thank you for all the info and advice. After
considering all emails, and taking another look at the 3 buses, I decided
on (Drum Roll Please)............

The 70 Westy.  (And the crowd goes wild)

Thanks to the link Karl provided, I see that I have a Universal case. So
I can install my 18 month old motor in the bus with little trouble. Also,
since I have owned and worked on a couple of Bugs, I think my limited
motor experience would be best spent on something with which I'm
familiar. I hope to attend the Freeze you Toes off in Edisto SC in Feb,
so I think I can get the 70 on the road faster. Lastly, I guess I fall
into the category of "the older the better". 
        I intend to go pick up the bus this week, so y'all can look
forward to getting lots of questions from me. 
Thanks again,
Jim
Hampstead, NC
Soon to be the proud owner of a yet unnamed 70 Westy.
