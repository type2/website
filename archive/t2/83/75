Dear List,
I am planning to make an awning out of a tarp to attach to my 73 Westy =
with Poptop (original idea from the Type2 library).
The original plans were for a Vanagon, which I am unfamiliar with.=20
Any ideas/suggestions on how this type of home-made awning would best be =
attached to the bus, for a good seal?

Thanks,

Tom Adams
73 Westy--"Chris"
