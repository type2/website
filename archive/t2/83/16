Craig speaks the truth! While the POR is still tacky you can spray 
some primer over it to act as a tie coat. I painted a roof rack with 
POR and did none of the above. After a while UV got the better of the 
POR I used. Check the website but I think there are some POR colors 
that are UV resistant.
