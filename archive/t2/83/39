This is an example of a very good plan with the foresight to get information
before you drop time and money into the job. You have seen the unhappy
result of trying to cut corners with inferior technique and materials. It's really
a question of what will make you happy with your bus. Unfortunately, a proper
repaint can be labor intensive when done right. You may find that you have to
remove the glass, doors, etc. and that makes it unavailable as a daily driver.
If you lack the skills, i would suggest you investigate local resources, like
adult education, for welding and painting classes. These places often allow you
to bring your own vehicle for the class, and, using their tools and resources,
you develop your skills and get the van repainted at the same time.
If you are really inclined to go this route, perhaps it would be a good excuse to
get another daily driver ( a real good reason to get another bus:)
