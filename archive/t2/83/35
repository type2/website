Hi Markus,

I drove my 73 westy through the cold snowy winter of 99/00 using a catalytic
propane heater while driving. The condensation on the windshield was a
severe PITA. After a week or two there was a noticable coating of frost on
the seats, curtains, floor - it was iced up everywhere. On a dry day I'd
leave the doors open for a while; and a wet-dry vacuuming also helped clean
it up.

But it sure beat freezing to death. February in Toronto routinely sees
temperatures below zero farenheit, and I was working the midnight shift at
the time. Brrrrr! 

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
