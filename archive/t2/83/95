Tom,
 my bus has a long stainless steel piece along the gutterrail that is wide
enough to get a tarp started at beginning and then as you slide it down it
stays snug. Here is a pic:

but its hard to tell what it is I think.

This must have come from a camp store or something. It works great! If you
need more pics let me know.

Dear List,
I am planning to make an awning out of a tarp to attach to my 73 Westy with
Poptop (original idea from the Type2 library).
The original plans were for a Vanagon, which I am unfamiliar with.
Any ideas/suggestions on how this type of home-made awning would best be
attached to the bus, for a good seal?

Thanks,

Tom Adams
