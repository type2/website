Well, check the expansion tank after you fill it
up.  Obviously, the warmer the day the better. 
If it is the expansion tank, you should be able
to see the leak.  But you'll smell it before you
see it.  Busdepot has the tank.  

I'd still be real suspicious of the tank or the
Y's.  Open the spare tire compartment and look
over top to see the tank.  Look for the rusty
crust.  Smell the fumes....
