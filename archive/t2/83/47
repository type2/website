Three responses in one:

As what to do about a daily driver you want to paint:

Just keep driving it! This is bad I know. Don't really do what I did. The
pic is a camping trip 2 hours away we took while I was removing the old
paint.

A rattle can paint job was my only choice at the time because I removed
everything and then lost the money to get a real paint job..don't ask!
http://www.72camper.com/colors.htm the rattlecan paint looks pretty
good...from far away. I plan to really paint my bus as soon as I am happy
with the mechanicals (new engine). But I smile every time I look at my bus
even when I see the funky paint.

There is a guy named Jim that came to Everybus last year. His bus is the
green/purple paint that changes color as you move around it. It cost him a
lot, but I don't remember how much. It was pretty cool.
