To get the "Rainbow" effect, all one has to do is wet sand the Bus down,
lay a coat of clear with pearl in it, and the pearl comes in many
hue's-----green, blue, red, purple, etc. and then lay a coat of clear on
top of that-----time consuming but neat-----

Three responses in one: 
As what to do about a daily driver you want to paint:
http://www.72camper.com/chimrockholloween05.jpg Just keep driving it!
This is bad I know. Don't really do what I did. The pic is a camping
trip 2 hours away we took while I was removing the old paint. 
A rattle can paint job was my only choice at the time because I removed
everything and then lost the money to get a real paint job..don't ask!
http://www.72camper.com/colors.htm the rattlecan paint looks pretty
good...from far away. I plan to really paint my bus as soon as I am
happy with the mechanicals (new engine). But I smile every time I look
at my bus even when I see the funky paint. 
There is a guy named Jim that came to Everybus last year. His bus is the
green/purple paint that changes color as you move around it. It cost him
a lot, but I don't remember how much. It was pretty cool.

What did you do about the really pitted parts, or did you have any? I
can't see just grinding them all down because the sheet metal would get 
I wire brush the pits to clean them out, then fill them in with 
oxyacetylene 
and MIG wire. 
another great tool is the 3M trico wheels on a power tool I like the 6S
or 7S wheels... probably have to get these from a hardware wholesaler. I
got mine from L.A. Benson in Baltimore, they do mail order.
