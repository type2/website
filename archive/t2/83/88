Subject: Re: [T2] broken head stud on new rebuild

Matt,

I've never heard of a head stud breaking like that, just maybe never
happened to anyone I know...

Did the studs come with the engine or were they aftermarket?

Bottom line(if it was me), drop the engine back out and retorque...no way
around it.<sigh>

You should only need to disassemble enough to be able to get to that side
to do it though.  Some on the list might insist that you loosen up
everything on that side, but I probably would not.

Cheers, dave
