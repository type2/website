Subject: RE: [T2] On the subject of paint (sorta long)

Well, the upside is...  I have a few of these things.  I'd like to know
more, so here we go:

I have a pick hammer and a toe dolly.  They are cheapies...  but I got them
as a set at Pep Boys on a whim a few months ago.  I have a body file, and a
4" grinder.  So I'll only need that for weld patches or ???.  I have access
to a wire-welder...  though I weld a bit messy with it.  I can get it on
there solid, but lucky the grinder is close by.  I think I need a compressor
anyway.  What am I going to need to do to be able to blast the bus?  Can I
do it a section at a time?  I assume I'd need a closed in location to do it,
right?  Anyone recommend a good book to show me how to work dents and such
with the hammer and dolly?  I'm sure I could bang on parts all day and do
more harm than good.  I don't know a single thing about the stud gun.

Thanks for your feedback!

If you can score a class or two in auto body great.  I myself ended up with
a
college degree in it.  There is so much more to body work than just banging
fenders.  As for drive way body work, I honestly don't know, I've got more
money in tools than I care to think about.  If I had to recommend tools for
the new commer, it would be a pick hammer, toe dolly, body file, grinder 6
inch, and a stud gun.   If you buy good stuff your looking at about $450.
The good news is, you can use this stuff forever and with an extra tip for
the stud gun you can shrink metal.  You might also think of a small
compressor and a paint gun.
