.  I'm also seeing a lot of
wincing at rattle can primers.  I'm totally open to suggestion I just =
don't

       Depends on where you buy it. I use spray can primer I get at =
Mattos, an auto body supply store here in Va. The brand name is "Tempo", =
and it works very well. Now this is only for small touch ups,etc., as my =
primer of choice is Dupont Velvaseal, comes in quart cans ready to spray =
(from a gun). It is a primer/sealer. Now, you're right-the stuff in cans =
from Trak Auto, PepBoys, WalMart, etc. is crap-don't use it!       Jeff
