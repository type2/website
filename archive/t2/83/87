Subject: striping and priming inside

Hello List,

I haven't written in a while, so I thought I would let
everyone know what I have been up to. Well I was
finially able to get my twin brother to help me work
on my bus. I decided to work on the cab of my 74
automatic bus with front bench seat. My brother and I
first removed the bench seat from the front, we
cleaned and striped the floors, the tops of the wheel
wells, and the front side of the petition that goes
right behind the bench seat. I was surprised to find
no severe rust on the floor. I have already replaced
one step but the other needs replacing. We wire
brushed the entire striped area, cleaned it and primed
it. It is a nice feeling to see a clean, finished area
ready for painting. I am planning an getting a good
straight line sander soon so I will be able to finish
up several unfinished areas that have been bothering
me. One day soon, I will have my bus ready for paiting
and then a rebuild. A lot of work left to do. Any way,
good luck with everyone's VW! Have a great day!
