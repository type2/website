BTDT.

here's how I did mine.

I did it on a parking pad behind my house, was  my daily driver and stayed
on the road the whole time.

I did a single panel/front/back/roof at a time total 9 sections so at
least nine all day sessions, so longer.

so I picked a panel, sanded and ground and patched and etc.
   when it was smooth I masked, primed and within the hour I painted  all
high quality canned paint.    not perfect but it looks pretty decent.

it took a lot of paint to get it to look decent.   van is bright white
over metallic blue...about 15 cans of white, over 12 of blue. at about
4.95 a can.

now it wasn't as good as I hoped but it is 9 years later and there are
some rust spots, I work on em one at a time.  since I bought numbered
paint and can match the colors almost perfect it is easy to touch up and
work on spots.  

pays to work on a very still day, and no chance of rain.

relay
