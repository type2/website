It will return partial info: does the engine leak out the bottom?

Most of the leaks these engines have are from the pushrod tubes, the valve
covers, the oil cooler and the main seals. They don't leak from the main
seals until they're running--how else is the oil going to get into the No. 1
(front) or No. 4 (rear) main bearing area?

Do this: remove the flywheel and take out the main seal and the endplay
shims. Put the flywheel back on, measure the endplay (any VW maintenance
book will tell you how) without shims, remove flywheel and install the
proper shims. Reinstall the flywheel and check endplay again. If it's good,
take the flywheel back off.

Next, turn the engine up on end and remove the oil strainer.

Third, torque all of the bolts and nuts that hold your case together and the
nuts that hold your heads on to VW specs.

Fourth is replacing the pushrod tube seals, the oil cooler seals and the two
main seals, one in the front and one in the back. You can put your flywheel
on for good now. Now adjust your valves and put the valve covers on with
fresh gaskets.

Last, replace the oil strainer and torque all the nuts to 60 inch-lbs. Now
put the engine in and fill 'er up.

It's going to leak, that's the nature of the beast, but this will keep the
drips down to a minimum.
