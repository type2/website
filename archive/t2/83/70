I've at last put the 2L engine into my van that I bought last year. It =
came with a Weber progressive carb. I've now sorted out a sticking =
automatic choke. (Had to file off part of the carb body!) - but that's =
another story.

My problem is that it was running very rich on tickover. I traced (using =
a colourtune (Welsh spelling for the USA)) the problem was lack of air =
getting to the tickover circuit. I traced back & opened up a small =
drilling at the top of the carb that corrected the fault. Even though =
I've corrected the fault, I think that this was in fact the wrong thing =
to do. I've noticed that apart from the petrol feed and vacuum feed, =
there are 2 other pipes that are currently sealed off on the carb.

One of these pipes, I'm thinking, may be a feed to the engine breather =
(which is not connected anywhere yet). Would I be correct here?

Should I connect the engine breather to the larger pipe on the carb. & =
would it then provide the air for the slow running circuit?

Thanks for your help.
