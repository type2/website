I will contract on it!  DOT 5 fluid may not be compatible with your 
seals!  I tried switching to DOT5 on a BMW motorcycle and within a 
month I had to change all the seals in the master and caliper 
cylinders.  Learn from my mistake.

DOT3 and DOT4 are compatible, the only difference being that DOT4 has 
a higher boiling point.  You only need DOT3 for a bus, but you can put 
DOT4 in with the only effect being a smaller wallet.

DOT3 and DOT4 absorb water from the system, while DOT5 does not.  This 
keeps the water in suspension.  DOT5 will allow water to pool in the 
cylinders and corrode them.

DOT5 does resist higher temperatures and is the cat's meow in systems 
designed for it.  However, it is not better than the common stuff in a 
bus brake system.
