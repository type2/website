Subject: Bet you didnt know....(VW Bus in Men at work tune)

In the song, Down Under, by Men at Work. The first 2 lyrics are..

1) Traveling in a fried-out Kombie (A VW Bus)
2) On a hippie trail, head full of zombie (Zombie was a slang word for a
particularly potent strain of marijuana grown in Australia in the seventies
or could mean Opium)

At the beggining of their video they are driving a late 60's/early 70's VW
bus(Baywindow- Panelvan) through the desert.

Heres another tilt on it....

According to Greg Ham (Vocals, Saxaphone, & Keyboards), , the song is about
Australians who are abroad and have come back home. As Bob Baker points out
in email, It is actually about a bunch of guys from Australian on an Opium
binge. Think about it; A den in Bombay (An Opium den), Travelling in a fried
out Kombie (Kombie is an VW Bus)on a hippie trail, head full of zombie
(zombie is slang for Opium) Buying bread (another slang word for Opium or
Heroin) from a man in Brussels

(PS. I think its the 1st one ("Fried-Out" Kombi?) :-)

Down Under
( Men At Work )

Traveling in a fried-out Kombie
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said...

Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover!

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six-foot-four and full of muscles
I said, Do you speak-a my language?
He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich
And he said...

I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover!

[break]

Lyin' in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty?
And he said...

Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover!
Yeah!

Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover!

Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover!


Just found that out after 20 years !!

Cool if your a VW Bus freak like me!!
