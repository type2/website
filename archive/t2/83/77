Hey there Jim,

I think the most commonly used term is "belt-line" (but I knew what
you meant). My Mexico beige 79 was painted brown on the beltline by
one of the PO's (the bottom of my bus has been resprayed here and
there, so it's break up the match w/ the OG paint up top). I didn't
like the look at first, but it's grown on me.

Another example of a loaf paint scheme that I like can be found on
Rich's 72 bus (another New Englander). Pics of Rich's tri-color bus
can be found at:

(My bus is the last pic on the page, Thanks Dave G. !!)

Later..
