Subject: Re: [T2] Re: paint over por


In my painting experience, I have never heard of anything giving tooth
or biter's, better than good old time waving the arm and hand over the
surface of the vehicle, with sand paper in hand----

I have run into Semi tractor's that have been sealed / primed with
non-sanding sealer's, and what happens is the paint will peel in big
sheets -----

I ran into this several times, when truck's came into my shop for a
repaint--and as I was running over the paint with a orbital air sander (
DA ) with 180 , the paint would just keep running away from the sand
paper down to the primer---- So I would wind up stripping the whole
truck back down to the first finish, and then seal it with acid etch
primer, resand it, prime it again with a high fill primer, and then sand
and paint again----

This is why I get goose bumps, when I here of this "Miracle in a Can"
stuff-----

It doesn't work for the long haul----

Now what really cranked me all up last night, was when I heard this wild
man spending all this time sanding, doing the Slick 50 ( POR ) treatment
to his WHOLE bus, and then he blew it--he used spray can laquer primer,
which has just about zero filling properties, as it has to be like water
to get out of that spray can, it's 90% laquer thinner, which probably
contributed to the lifting of the paint-----and the the icing on the
cake was---"I painted the whole Bus with Rust-O-Leum" ---Wow--- "And now
it's got crow's feet"
  
I cringed at the thought of all the time it took him to get to this
point----

And he also has just layed a finish of fish oil paint on his
vehicle----think about the next guy to paint this bus----It's a total
strip agan---because hardly anything is going to stick to the Fish oil
wagon paint---

Book time to paint a truck ( no sleeper ) is 45 hours, plus repairs,
plus paint, and materials----

Why would I want to do this job twice. by using inferior materials?

Why would anybody want to use inferior materials, and do the job twice?

NUTS !!!!

Later,

Terry

i believe they also say you can spray a light coat of paint or primer
over the por15 WHEN SLIGHTLY WET to give it some tooth for the next
layer.
