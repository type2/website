If it is a vw engine, it leaks oil.
Do yourself a favor and replace the front /rear crank seals
as well as the push rod tube seals and the oil cooler seals
while the engine iis out. Maybe pull the lifters and fill as per
Bentley, then a proper adjustment. Whether it leaks or not
is not as important as having fresh seals and starting a history.
