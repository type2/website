Subject: heat, my 2 cents

No offense to ya'll who see this as a fascinating
problem to be solved. I understand the impulse. BUT...

Decades ago, in an appalachian winter, i had to make a
daily 50-mile commute before dawn. My rusty ‘66
splittie had lost its heater pipe long ago--and i was
a popsicle. I sabre-sawed a piece of paneling to fit
between the driver area and the rear. Foam on the
edges to seal it and a little plexiglas window to see
through with the rear veiw mirror. (The window was
hinged so that I could lift it to talk to the
passengers--just like a limo!)
I put a coleman white gas catalytic heater on the
floor on the passenger side. (Yes, an idiot move--but
i was desperate.)

I STILL froze my butt off every morning. (the afernoon
sun made the 50 miles back quite comfortable.)


With my ‘68 I have the stock heating system running. I
insulated the pipe to the front with that aluminized
bubble wrap stuff. got a thick rug on the floor.  It
gets pretty cold in northern Utah and the heat feels
like a mouse breathing on my right foot. So, I bundle
up, put on the Sorrel pac boots and imagine I’m flying
a C-47 Dakota over the Nepal's HUMP.

It works for me.

(OK, I might rig a bilge blower to help the
defrosting, but that looks like a lot of work.)
