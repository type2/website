What did you do about the really pitted parts, or did you have any?   I
can't see just grinding them all down because the sheet metal would get
flattened. So is this a smart use for Body Filler?  How about for the pits
left after a patch seam?   How do those folks that do "all steel" work deal
with this?  My guess is replace the panel, is it right?

so I picked a panel, sanded and ground and patched and etc.
   when it was smooth I masked, primed and within the hour I painted  all
high quality canned paint.    not perfect but it looks pretty decent.
