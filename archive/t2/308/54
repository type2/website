 Not correct. It is 1974 and older starting 1/1/03. 1975 and older starting 1/104 and so on.
The original SB42 was vetoed because of the 25 year drop-off. Kopp had to rewrite it to 30 years
with a 5 year moratorium on 1973 year model vehicles to get it passed.

calculate it, Karl?

That is a new one on me. Never heard of it!


> Mine ends in "0", and I did it in 2002 and they told me my next test would be in 2004. If it ended
in "1" would my next test be in 2003 then every two years after that?

Here is part of SB42:

 SB 42, Kopp.  Air pollution:  vehicles:  inspection and
maintenance.
   Existing law exempts any motor vehicle manufactured prior to the
1966 model-year from provisions requiring vehicles powered by
internal combustion engines in certain areas of the state to obtain a
smog check certificate of compliance or noncompliance biennially,
upon transfer of ownership, or upon registration of a vehicle
previously registered outside the state.
   This bill would, instead, exempt from those requirements any motor
vehicle manufactured prior to the 1974 model-year or, beginning
January 1, 2003, that is  30 or more model-years old.

Here is a pdf of the new rules for the Bay area. It also mentions the 30 year rolling cutoff on page
3.

This is straight from the Calif Air Resources Board.
