Subject: Calif. & Ariz. Emissions Laws - What's the latest?

I'm considering moving to southern California or
Arizona and I would like to know what the newest VW I
could own down there that would not have to go through
any kind of emissions testing or other kind of
inspection.

I believe there was a thread on this a few years ago
stating that it used to be a 1965 or earlier VW (or
any other brand of car), but that a change had been
made to make 1971 and earlier vehicles exempt from
testing or inspection.

I have a 1971 Westy. All of the emission control
components from the carb, the charcoal canister, the
oil bath air cleaner (and the stand) have been
removed.

Does anybody know what the newest VW you could own
would be in CA and AZ and be exempt from testing??

Thanks,
Mike
