Subject: Fw: [T2] Sugar 

I mean absolutely no disrespect to Mr. Beck, but this  cracked me up and
made me smile, after a long arduous day!!


>>>>>>>>>>>>Hi Guys,

Found out today that I have sugar in my urine. I am 41 years old and am
being tested for type II diabetes.

So, what is the general experience on the group with this?

Will it make my swings worse and prolong my time off work or explain them
and shorten it or completely declare me a basket case and put me on LTD for
life??
