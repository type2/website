I seem to remember in the BN4 article from Ron Van Ness that
he stated that a standard VW bus defroster switch, the green
one on the dash, would work for the heaters? Aren't they like
a 30amp switch or something like that? I very well may be
wrong, just thought I had read that somewhere.

On the exhaust thing, the exhaust pipe that came with it was
pretty much shot and the clamp was non-existant so I bought 
one of those flexible exhaust pipes from autozone. It fit 
nicely around the existing stub that the normal exhaust 
clamps onto. It of course had a standard U-bolt clamp to snug
it down tight. It's a little short though. I don't have access
to a welder, and I don't know how to weld so I thought that 
would get me by, but I suppose that is my culprit. I don't 
think it is leaking at the clamp (but can't rule it out
completely) but probably cause it is shorter and the fumes
are making their way back up into the engine compartment.
