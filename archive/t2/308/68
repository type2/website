Mike,

The Magical fuel flow / mpg meter's of the 70's were nothing more than
vacuum gauges---

Hammer down--vacuum drops so the does the needle and your fuel
economy---

This unmagical thing you could do to your Bus--No James Bond type thig
here-- very simple 

My 325 BMW has the same thing in the gauge cluster--and it is a
computerized to the max vehicle--but it still uses the  tried and true
vacuum gauge for the fuel economy / mpg read out.

Later,

Terry

Anyone ever worked out a way to measure fuel flow and convert it into
real-time MPG? Some of the luxury cars dating back into the late 70's
and early 80's had them built into their computers and you could watch
the MPG on the digital readout on the dash. Seems like you could put
some sort of flow monitor between the filter and the carb that you could
interperet (based on your road speed) into MPG. Any idea how one would
rig it on a fuel injection setup to take into account the rate of return
flow to the tank? Hey, if James Bond can have an invisible car, why
can't I have a MPG meter!
