This is correct.

It's every two years and if you we're identified as a gross polluter (great license plate idea GRSPLTR ;-) you have to smog every year but that was repealed or so I read.

I was told by the smog referee that the test will depend on your VIN but I'm not sure how they calculate it, Karl?

Mine ends in "0", and I did it in 2002 and they told me my next test would be in 2004. If it ended in "1" would my next test be in 2003 then every two years after that?
