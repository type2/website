  I saw Harry Belafonte at the Taos Solarfest (it was great!) and he said,
just before singing "Day-O" for the ten millionth time, "Don't ever sing a
song that you don't really, really love, because if you do, THAT song will
inevitably become the one that sells a million copies, and that you are
obliged to sing for the REST OF YOUR LIFE...  No, really, I love this
song..."
  The price of celebrity.  But I caught Arlo a couple years ago, and he
still sings it like he loves it, so I guess that's okay.  Wish I could get
to the show, but my mandatory aircooled bus content is too slow for a trip
to OK!  Happy friday all!

PS- sorry for the bad P/N a couple days ago.  Just sticking my foot in mouth
trying to be helpful.  That number was, indeed, the lens only.  I'll shut up
until I have something accurate to say...
