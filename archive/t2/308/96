Subject: Re: [T2] Plumbing & Fuel Pump for a late BN4 Gas Heater

I see exactly what you are saying about the fuel pump
Bob. I just have a basic on off switch right now. I just used
an old defroster pull/push switch.

I tried to go back and refresh my self with the Late Model BN4
Demystified article in the library by Ron Van Ness and it is 
telling my the page is no good. Anyone else have this problem?

Did the address change, or am I nuts? I also, when running,
seem to get a heater exhaust smell in the cab while sitting
still. Does anyone have this problem. I have the plastic 
recirculation duct but not the metal one that attaches to the 
top and then to side of the bus cabin. Guess I need to make 
one and then cut a hole and attach it. Thanks everyone for all the help with this! :)
