IANAEHE (i am not an ebaufauser heater expert) since my small
experience is with the stewart-warner brand of heaters. Hopefully some
of this will apply but not sure. When testing & running the first time
did the heater cycle on and off? If not perhaps the thermostat is set
so high that it is trying to raise the temperature to such a high
degree that it simply cannot without getting so hot it trips the
safety devices. hopefully it's a simple as that.

I hope this is ok, since I'll be doing the same thing when I finally
get around to installing mine.
