  We don't have smog checks where I live and I don't own any VW newer then
1964 (except my wifes 65, but that's in her name) which exempts me in most

jesses writ:

>-- AND you have Classic Car insurance -- You will NOT have to
>go through Emissions-


basically, if you have a DAILY DRIVER, this means you are screwed, afaict...
i mean, i have all my 70's smog stuff in a box, but it doesn't work.
and most classic insurance prohibits non-parade use.
ronnie, are you having trouble passing your cars - or do you >know< someone
