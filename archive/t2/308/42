Our rebuilt engines are from AVP in Sacramanto.  You can find tons of
positive comments about AVP in the archives. Basically they are well known
on the list as one of the best rebuilders of Bus and Vanagon engines.

I swear by AVP. They are a small family owned business with the kind of
craftsmanship and commitment to customer satisfaction that you rarely find
these days. Unlike most rebuilders, whose expertise is in Bug engines,
theirs is in Bus engines. They also one of only a few who use specially
designed valve seats that make their heads more reliable than even new
heads. (They've been building them that way for years.)  Their defect rate
throughout the years has been next to zero, and in the (very) rare instances
when they did have a warranty claim, they stood behind their work 150
percent.  Frankly I wish all of my suppliers were more like AVP.

Actually, besides selling their engines, I happen to be a customer, so you
might say I've put my money where my mouth is.  I put their engines in two
of my VW's, and both are still running strong years later.
