Greg's right. As I understand it the relay gets 12 volts when the key on. 
There may be a fuse there near the blower relay (mine has one anyhow). The 
lever up front grounds the relay and the relay closes. This allows the 12 
volts to go to the blower.

www.partsexpress.com has the relays for about $2 and Radio Shack has them 
for about $6. That is for a generic relay. Dunno if that will plug right in.
