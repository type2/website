Subject: T4 Black rear main seal

I'm having to replace my rear main seal and don't have time to wait for
another - my FLAPS sold me a black one. I've been warned about the black ones,
but seeing how I am replacing a blown red one - the black one can't be that
bad. Anyone else have pertinent experience? (1.7l '74)

I'll make sure the fine is tight before I reinstall the engine. If it's not
good, I'll go ahead and wait a couple extra days for the reinstall if it's not
solid.

-Eric
