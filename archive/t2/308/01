Hiya Paul,

Unfortunately, the BusDepot parts number forwarded to you will NOT do the 
trick for you.  211 953 141 P is the lens (only) for this application.  I 
have a 1970 Bus and have had to look for the same item.  I wound up in a 
boneyard.  I do not believe that this part is being manufactured by anybody 
in the aftermarket.  I hope somebody out there on The List can prove me 
wrong.  Folks?
