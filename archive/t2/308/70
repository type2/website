Ahhh--I see Ted---

The key phrase here is "used To"

And I'll bet this hot discontinued item from Tiawan probably gives you
an instant 20% impoved fuel economy just like the curb feeler, venetian
blinds for the back window, the blue dot tail lights, and the Wolf
whistles did--Oh--Boy

LOL !!---

You can have one.... JC Whipme used to sell a kit that was called a
"trip computer" (I think). One part was installed in the fuel line and
another was installed in the speedometer cable. I bought one a few years
ago and will get around to installing it, probably this decade. I don't
know if this item is still in their catalog. TBear
Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
