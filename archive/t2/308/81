Subject: Wheel Problems

The cotter pin to my rear right wheel broke and let the axel nut spin off,
allowing the wheel to fall off.  The drum came off, but the bus slid on the
shoes and shocks.  This happened once before on the same wheel!  Im wondering
if anybody has any advice, input, or experience with this problem?
