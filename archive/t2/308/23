I can't comment about your intake valve laping as being good enough or
not, but I can point something else out. If this car was rear-ended
then check the flywheel endplay! My wifes 70 beetle was rearended &
something is amiss in the case (I was fixing to split it then dropped
a valve on my bus). The endplay can easily be measured with a ruler :(
Make sure the accident didn't cause any major crank issues before
spending much time on this one.
