Subject: Fuel Flow/MPG Meter?

Anyone ever worked out a way to measure fuel flow and convert it into
real-time MPG?  Some of the luxury cars dating back into the late 70's and
early 80's had them built into their computers and you could watch the MPG
on the digital readout on the dash.  Seems like you could put some sort of
flow monitor between the filter and the carb that you could interperet
(based on your road speed) into MPG.  Any idea how one would rig it on a
fuel injection setup to take into account the rate of return flow to the
tank?  Hey, if James Bond can have an invisible car, why can't I have a MPG
meter!
