Subject: RE: [T2] Just bought a cheap Syncro

Ive seen a clean 86 Vanagon but no idea about mechanical, was for sale at 500 $ canadian here in Quebec... Vanagon with bad engine sells for cheap!!

But its a damn project switching all stuff from a synchro to a Vanagon... ive heard they are completely different (mechanical)!
