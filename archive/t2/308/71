Thinking I had a blown rear main seal, I dropped my engine this morning only
to find the seal looking decent but a slightly crumpled piece of metal at the
bottom of the engine case. The piece of metal, pictured here:

Appears to have belonged in this hole in the bottom right of this picture:

Problem is, I can't find this cap in any of my manuals (Bentley, Haynes, Muir,
German VW Shop Manual). I need to be able to CALL my local part dealer since I
have to arrange transportation to get the part (can't just take it down and
show it to them).

Any help would be appreciated. This is a '74 1.7l manual...
