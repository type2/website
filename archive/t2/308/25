At present it is required that all vehicles 1967 and newer pass

emissions--BUT ! There is a law being past that IF your car is 15 years of

age or Older -- AND you have Classic Car insurance -- You will NOT have to

go through Emissions--At present this bill has Passed through AridZona and

it is waiting to be signed by the EPA--

BUT! Can you actually drive it with Classic Car insurance...Depends on the
company of course, but you wouldn't want to try and make a claim and 
have the company deny it because of the small print...;-(
Here in NJ, it's getting evil, my friend was dropped by his insurance co.
because it was too old...And that was just for liability insurance...The co.
doesn't insure anything 20 years or older...
