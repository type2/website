Subject: (a long shot) Westfalia woodgrain stain?

Hello List,

I was wondering if anyone could tell me what is the
name of the stain used on the 74 westfalia woodgrain
interior? Has anyone found a stain that matched this
color? I was thinking of incorperating some woodgrain
in the interior of my bus (panels, cabinets,ect.) I
have collected enough green westy plaid and I am going
to have the rear cushions and the front Bench seat
redone in this material. I am going to have the front
bench seat upholstered similar to the way the front
westy bucket seat were except I think I am going to
use black vinyl and piping around the edges instead of
green. ANyway,I like how well the green plaid goes
with this woodgrain and I was just wondering if anyone
has had to match this stain in doing repairs or making
custom cabinets, panels, ect. Thanks and have a nice
day!
