Subject: Re: [T2] Gex Heads

I have a set of Gex heads that I took off a motor I got in a junk yard.
Motor
did not appear to have that many miles on it (less than 5k) as the Mahle
pistons and heads had little carbon and pistons were well within spec.
The
bottom end  must have been done as the case was bored oversized and I
found
that #2 rod bearing was shot. The heads though looked like they could be
used
for my present rebuild so I had them evaluated by Xtreme Cylinder, a
shop that
specializes in exotic car heads (read Jaguar, Triumph, Lotus, Porsche,
etc.).

The heads were stamped with GEX. Here is what they found. The valves
must have
been cleaned in a tumbler as they had score marks (dings/scratches)
along the
stems. The valve guides were new, but due to the marks on the valve
stems they
had started to prematurely wear the valve guides. One of the heads had
small
cracks between the two valves. Not enough to cause the head to fail yet,
but
sometime in the future. Who knows if these cracks were visible when the
heads
were rebuilt. The seats looked new and the valve seal surface was fine,
so
except for the cracks, bad valve stems and premature valve guides these
should
have lasted the warranty period fine. How much longer is anyone's guess.
