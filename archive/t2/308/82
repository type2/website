I sent this too soon.  Although the wording is misleading, to me at least, it is 1974 and older as of 1/1/03. My apologies to Karl.

I also found out some other facts about engine changes: if you have a 1974 bus and put in a newer engine you  are allowed but it has to have all of the emissions parts for that model year attached as required by law.  However, the DMV won't require a smog check for vehicles that old under current law. End of story.

If however, you have a newer vehicle say, 1976, and put in a 1978 model and obtain smog certification as required, according to the BAR this will turn it into a 1978 vehicle as far as smog testing is concerned and you will have to smog it for two more years than a 1976 vehicle.
