Subject: Friday Bug story and bought a 72 westy 

Hey everyone happy friday.  I recently sold my 70 bug with 393,000 miles all 
ocumented on Ebay to a gentleman in Memphis,.  Big deal right well I live in 
Seattle! Last friday he flew in and drove it home 3400 miles with no 
ploblems!  Now the westy very good body doesnt run at the moment prior owner 
took it the ignition wires and starter out.  Anyway I thought it was super 
cool that my old bug made it.  The big kicker was that the only thing the new 
owner really knows about cars is how to use his cell phone. ( he had aic 
cooled Vw's before. I glad to be back in this list,
Thanks for the time 
Ray Huff
