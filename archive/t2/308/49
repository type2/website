Ok, 

Do you have 4 large metal tubes that run from the base
of the carb to the heads of the engine? If so then you
probably have a 32/36dpsit weber progressive carb. If
you look on the side of the body of the carb, you
should find a name somewhere. You may have to do some
looking with a mirror. If you don't find WEBER then
you might find SOLEX somewhere on the carb. You may
have to take the air breather assembly off the carb to
see anything. 

If it is a Weber 32/36 dpsit carb then you have what
is known as a Weber progressive carb. 

Here is another question. How well does your bus run?
Does the engine puff out alot of black smoke? Do you
have decent or bad gas mileage? does your bus have the
origional 1700cc engine or has that been changed?

When you get a chance, take some pictures and I can
probably tell you alittle more about it. 

Have a great day!
