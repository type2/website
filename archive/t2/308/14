Subject: $100 Kombi??? sold. (venting frustratioin)

Hello List,

I guess this is a Friday post because of marginal
content but here it goes. I was looking aroung on EB(-at-)Y
last night and thought I would do a search using
"volkswagOn" like I frequently do. I cam across what
appeared to be a 67 combi for sale. There was 4
minuets left on the clock when I saw it. It appeared
to be almost complete with at least the front seat and
interior, all the windows, transmission reflectors and
lens, ect. The only thing that was listed as missing
was the engine. It appeared to have marginal to
average rust. The price stayed at $57.00 for the
longest time but the final bid only reached right at
$100.00! I almost cried! I was so temped to claim it
and make the trip to OK and tow it home. It took a lot
of will power not to bid. I had to listen to that
voice in my head reminding me of my unfinished bus
already at the house. Anyway, IF the high bidder is on
this list, Congrats on the great deal, and good luck!

Just my wast of the bandwidth for today. Have a great
day!
