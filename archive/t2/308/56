Subject: Re: [T2] Homebrew tow bar

I have towed a number of late busses with a Nissan Quest using a
home-made system that extends a beetle bar designed for the torsion
bars.- and it needed no welding.  I used 2" pipe with allthread running
down its length and bolted to floor flanges at each end.  1/2" threaded
rod was bent to bolt at one end to the tow loops of the front, and
through this pipe also.  The Beetle tow bar fastens to this.  For
insurance, I bolted signpost material (has all those holes along it) via
ubolts to the lower torsion bars, and the tow hook bolts go through the
other ends.  Pics sent upon request.  For a pre 68 bus I have a much
simpler 2" pipe that bolts right to the front bumper mounts via steel
plate at each end.
