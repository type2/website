Eric,


Look like a seal that is supposed to block an oil gallery hole to me.

They are *not* supposed to come out, which is why you won't find it in the 
book.....now some people take them out when they really want to do a 
serious job on the case or (in the t1 case) add full flow oiling.

Basically someone else is going to have to give a clue on this one as
I am not even sure where to get a replacement bung for it.

Cheers, dave
