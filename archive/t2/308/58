Yesterday:

'82 diesel, engine intact, but covered in oil - Baltimore yard (Also has 
excellent air-coolded front grill - Required [air-cooled] Bus Content]  
Wasn't someone recently loking for a deisel for parts??

'93 Eurovan, complete, running when brought into the yard, but no reverse.  
Automatic, 200k miles.  Title and keys - $500 - Oxen Hill Maryland yard.  
Wasn't someone [John A] looking for a Eurovan for parts.

Tomorrow:

Where can I get a VW bus rotor turned in the Washington DC area.  The buses 
have the 'drum' styled rotors that do not fit on the machines without some 
kind of adapter.  The machines are generally set up to cut flat rotors.
