I will second Ron's approval of AVP from my personal experience. Through a
twist of fantastical good fortune not usually seen in my life, when I bought
my 74 the PO included an AVP rebuilt long block. As my more usual luck would
have it I had to install it less than two weeks later. In 20 months and over
25,000 miles it has performed beautifully. I wouldn't hesitate to use an AVP
motor again.
