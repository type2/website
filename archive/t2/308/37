Subject: some bad AP3 cams out there

I had a engine built by a local shop. we installed a AP3 cam. it went flat 
and the grit distroyed all the bearings and the crank in 900 miles even with 
3 oil changes. the owner has had all three of the engines he built with his 
last shipment of 5 cams(he still has 2) come back. mine ground the crank so 
bad it started leaking around the pully. he has been using these cams since 
the early 80's with no bad results. he recieved the bad 5 early last year.he 
is waiting to hear from his supplier. he is gonna build me another one with 
a engle 100 or scat cam. hope this info helps someone else.
peace,
D&K
