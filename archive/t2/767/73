Ouch. Sounds like I need something fairly pricey. Maybe I'll just buy a new
body and transfer my engine/tranny instead. I've found a few in pretty good
shape for under $500, but then I got thinking that I could probably get the
tools to fix up mine for less, but it's looking like it might not only cost
just as much if not more, not to mention being a LOT harder.
