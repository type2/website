Subject: Re: [T2] Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

I made a jig to use feeler gauges- it bolts into one of the upper 
mounting holes of the case, and has a valve adjustor screw inserted into 
2 nuts welded to opposite sides of a washer edge. The washer is welded 
to an arm coming off the bolt through the case.  The adjustor can be 
turned with a screwdriver to just contact the flywheel when it is pulled 
towards you- then push it in and measure with feeler gauges the gap you 
just created.

  Flywheel endplay is getting done. How do you get feelers back there?
