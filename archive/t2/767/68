you may not want a Vanagon drivers seat. it does raise the height, only
works on the later bays anyway, you don't mention which year your bus is.

I had a 65 that I did not remove the entire bulkhead but I did convert it
from bench to bucket seats in the front by bolting a single seat on the
passenger side and cutting a slot in the bulkhead about 15-18 inches or so
to get a pass thru.  I'm not sure about removeing the whole bulkhead but I
was young foolish and this was a fairly newish and rust free 65 (heck I
did this in about 73 or so..)
