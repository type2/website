Subject: Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

1776 built by an unknown person.

What should I be checking for before putting everything together? I'm
not keen on disassembling the engine so am looking for things to check
from here...

The thing that made me want to check was on the stand I turned the
flywheel and the whole thing moved out from the case a bit. The bolt
at the pulley end is just set in there. Does the pulley help hold the
crankshaft in place?

(I know, I need a book on rebuilding. Will start looking for one
tomorrow, but in the meantime...)

Ok, I'm not really worried about the flash on the cylinders. But it
looks like when the heads were machined they just cut into the flash
on the fins without cleaning them up. I'll have to tackle those...
