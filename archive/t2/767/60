Ask Karl about the donor engine he recently looked into. Someone had 
problems running the throttle cable through the engine so they used some 
big ass screwdriver or drill or Hilti gun to obliterate a column through 
the shroud and oil cooler. Looked like a well placed 45 slug from back 
to front!
