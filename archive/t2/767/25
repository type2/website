Subject: Friday: 46 mm socket and advance timing light

Hi Folks,

I'm getting ready for some major work (for me) on the bus and I find 
I'm short a 46 mm socket for the rear axle nuts and an advance timing 
light.  Several months ago, I could swear I saw both of these in the HF 
online catalog, but they seem to have mysteriously disappeared.  So, a 
couple of questions.

Has anyone tried the 46 mm socket from CIP?  Will it hold up to home 
mechanic use?

Any suggestions as to a decent advance timing light for not much more 
than HF used to sell them (about $30)?  Extra points for Canadian 
sources.

Thanks, folks.
Jerry
