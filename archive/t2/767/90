Okay Ron, now you've touched on something I've been meaning to ask the
list for a long time!

Where can I get an accurate tire guage? My gauges around here vary by
5 psi. It's like the old saying that if you only have one clock, you
always know what time it is, but if you have more than one clock,
you're never quite sure!

When I was a teen into long distance cycling, there was a good gauge
that had an aluminum barrell, with pressure engraved into the barrell
in 2 psi increments, was good up to 120 psi and even had a valve core
tool that unscrewed off the end. I can't find anything like that or
anything that appears to be manufactured with precision.
