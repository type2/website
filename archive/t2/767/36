That one. The other is a dial test indicator.

Yes.

Personally I believe in good quality tools although the Chinese are getting closers all the time especially now that they are buying tool steel in the large quantities that they do.

I'd get a generic magnetic stand and Mitutoyo indicator on eBay but sometimes it can take a while to find the right one. The price will be the same but the quality of the indicator better. I sent you a pm with an auction number to give you an idea of what you need.

This a great site to learn about these tools:
