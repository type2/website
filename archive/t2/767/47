Subject: Mechanical Fuel Pump installation

Hi,



I am in the process of installing a replacement mechanical fuel pump.  In
the Bentley is says to fill the lower part with universal grease.  Can
someone please tell me if 'multipurpose wheelbearing & chassis lubricant' is
a suitable replacement for universal grease ?  Will this work in my fuel
pump?



Thanks,

Shawn
