Subject: Re: Friday: The busses are finally coming out to play!

There are a fair number of busses in Ann Arbor (pop 110,000 incl
35,000+ students). On my job, I drive a lot (small pickup) in the city
and see a lot of cars. On the streets, in driveways and parkling lots.
Last week I saw two on the streets that I hadn't seen before. A sage
green late bay, like mine, and a sand colored early bay. There's a guy
who's got a Westy deluxe as a daily driver. It's ratty but it runs.
He's got a canoe on top and I see him parked at the boat launch on the
Huron. I drive by 2 parked, rusty Westfailias a couple times a week.
There was one for sale a month or so ago. I looked at it, but it's
gone now. I know there are at least a couple of others.

Ann Arbor had a car show last weekend named the Rolling Sculpture
show. There is no theme and almost any car can enter. $15 entry fee.
Over 400 cars. Vehicles ranged from the latest Big 3 concept cars, The
first Ann Arbor fire engine, original and running, a Pinzgauer, '27
Rolls, hot rods, Detroit iron, Isetta's (6).  You name it. VW was
represented by a very nice Ghia, a perfect 57 Beetle and my Westy. I
got a prime parking spot at a main corner. I had the Westy opened up
and even though, parked next to me was a V12 E-type, various
Corvettes, a A/H 3000, hot rods, and muscle cars, the Westy attracted
tons of attention. Kids loved it. Everyone had their own story about
busses and campers. I had the pop top up, rear hatch up and sliding
door open and let people look around inside. Everyone had the biggest
grins on their faces.
