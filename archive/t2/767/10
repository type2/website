Subject: Re: [T2] Low vacuum readings when cold: SOLVED!!!

Hi Richard,

At various times I tried using ether, propane and "tool cleaner"  
spray ( a Canadian Tire blend of toluene and acetone, with propane as  
a propellant), but I was unable to locate this vacuum leak in that  
manner.


Happy trails,

YesterdaY I decided to pull the plenum and check it for cracks. I got
as far as the intake runners, and discovered that the bolts were not
fully tightened. Too tight to turn by hand, but no real resistance to
my quarter inch ratchet. So I figured it would be better to just
tighten down the runners properly and see if that would help.

Problem solved. Vacuum is immediately 14" and rises a bit as the bus
warms. Driveable immediately without balking.


I find those running and more often the intake manifold nuts for the  
dual
carbs require a drop of loctite on them to keep them in place.
