Subject: source for oil sump plate

 This story pertains to my 1800 1974 dual carb bonestock Bus motor:
 
OK, I need help. I thought I was gonna be cool and try to "machine" my oil sump cover (you know the one, the round one with the bump in the middle) to accept the VDO oil temp sender.
 
Unfortunately, a hand drill and a vise just isn't as accurate as a drill press (which I don't own), so my hole for the sender is kinda "wallowed out" and it doesn't quite make a good, "machine seal" , consequently dripping oil. I made a foolish effort at smearing some gasket sealer around the outside of the sender. You get the picture.
 
Anyway, I haven't pursued getting the fabled Porsch plate, because $70 or more is a bit pricey for me right now. But I can't find any of the OE sump plates, either. Some catalogs have them pictured, but say the are NLA. Where can I get one? Help!
