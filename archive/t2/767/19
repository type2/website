Don,

You *need* the dial indicator.  The use of feeler gauges requires a bolt 
on "arm" as a fixed point somewhere really close to the flywheel.

Dial indicator is the only way to fly....just be sure and "flex" the 
flywheel outward gently with two big screwdrivers before mounting the dial 
indicator....then tap it in gently with a rubber hammer to see your 
endplay....and don't set it too tight in the winter cold!!!!!!!!!

Depending on what kind of a sand seal you have, you could probably use a 
scat pulley....std size to use with a sand seal and with marks.  Probably 
not much weight difference over stock....

spray bbq paint is perfect, *but* once again, **mist** it ....you should 
still be able to almost see bare aluminum thu it.

Don, unless I missed something really big on the flash, it will be 
fine...more surface area to carry heat away....


If the pushrods *really* touch now, they will also touch later.
What kind of push rods?   chrome molly or HD aluminum?  Different valve 
adjustments to use for each kind.  Some "thicker" than others...look on 
aircooled.net and read about the differences.  aluminum at standard 
clearance, chrome molly at zero clearance.

Cheers, dave

 In the valve train everything looks ok except the pushrods appear to
 be rubbing on the tubes. Does that straighten out during running? Or
 is it normal?
 
 I still need the hoses and filter mount for the full flow.
 
 Haven't started fitting tin yet. Waiting for the other bits like a pulley.
 
 The flash is ok? I'll try the paint. I was actually considering VERY
 thinned out bbq paint from a spray bottle. I know it's good for
 watercooled engines and figured it would be worthwhile to color the
 heads and cyls on my ACVW engine too.
