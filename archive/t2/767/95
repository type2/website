It's so darn easy to adjust them that I went ahead and did full soft.
Drove around this morning before my fuel pump vapor locked (AGAIN!
ARRRGGHHH!!!) and I parked him.

Not much wind this morning, but it feels pretty much the same as
before handling wise but without the bone jarring effect every
expansion gap gave me. ;-)

After I get my (ugh) Facet installed I'll try some more. There's a bit
of wind now so by this evening should be typical Colorado plains wind.
