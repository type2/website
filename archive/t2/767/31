So, which dial indicator is going to be easiest to use? The price
difference is irrelevant:

http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=1717
or
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=33675

And something like this for the bracket?
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=5645

So... $46 for both including shipping if I go with the more expensive
indicator?
