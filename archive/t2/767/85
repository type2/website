Before I put my Konis on I had KYB gas adjust shocks front and rear and I 
never experienced that with the Hankooks at proper inflation. 
 
 The Konis do make all the difference, I really do enjoy them.  I set mine to 
full soft in the front and I did a turn in the rear to firm it up.  The ride 
is just fantastic, but I would like to get a larger sway bar up front to 
complete the package.
 
Hope you have a great trip and I know you will enjoy the ride!
