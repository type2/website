Why don't you pick one up from sears and if you break it, you'll get a 
replacement for free.

Speaking of which, my friends welded a craftsman socket to the end of a 
6 foot, 2" diameter pipe.  They bent the pipe getting the wheel bolt off 
but the socket was undamaged.  On the opposite side of the 46mm they 
welded the socket for the clutch nut.

I believe that sears also sells these as well.
