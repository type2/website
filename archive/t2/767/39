hey guys  I made my own holder many years ago and still use it   I took a 
piece of metal block and some all thread  drilled two holes in the metal block 
one the size so that the alltread would go thur and one hole the size of the 
shaft of the dial indicator  . at the dial indicator hole I drilled and tapped a 
hole perpendicular to it an installed a set screw to hold the indicator  used 
two nuts on the allthread to hold this in place  then used two nuts to mount 
it to the block   I'll try to take a pix  later  Mark Dearing
