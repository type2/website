Subject: Friday: The busses are finally coming out to play!

Over the past week the number of busses seen on the streets of the
Denver Metro Area have gone from zero to 6!

There's even a red and white early bay in my apartment complex (that I
have yet to meet the owner of).

Of course, they all came out just in time for the hail today! LoL!
