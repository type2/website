Hello Guys   Dang richard that is way too involved  LOL    mine is so much 
simpler and is adjustable to any porsche, vw motor   mind you it is basically 
only for end play.  I have a magnetic base one also for checking drums, rotors 
etc.   I have a flywheel grinder in my shop so there isnt a need for them  I 
just grind them all and I am amazed at how out of flatness they can be and 
highly recommend having it done when doing a clutch job  later and have fun  Mark
