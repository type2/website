Subject: '68 Bay for sale in Hawaii

Hello Y'all, there is a very clean 1968 bus for sale here on the Big
Island. Can anybody tell me what are the "one year only" items on this?
I have noticed the inside rear view mirror, all metal, design. The spare
tire under the front seat, and the early style seats. Are there any
parts that are pure "unobtainium" I should know about? Thanks, Timo
