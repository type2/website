I don't think so if you have the appropriate grommets in place.

Shutoff valve, good idea.  Steel braid, why add the hassle?  See below.

There you go.  There aren't any.  It's a plain nipple with the hose
clamped to it.
You'd have to fabricate your own transition for some kind of thread,
but you'd still have the same thing on the tank when you were done.

I have an article in the type2 library on this job, and Richard
Atwell's site has tons of data, tips, pictures and part numbers.
