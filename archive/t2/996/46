Subject: Re: Replacing heater control cables

When I had the same joyful experience I ended up cutting the conduit 
in a few places down the back to extract the cable remnants and to 
get the new cable in. I patched these bits back together with copper 
pipe sleeves and hose clamps. Looks like shyte buts it works. The 
problem appeared to be that the conduit had rusted internally where 
it had been spot welded to the body. The rust both snagged the 
original cable and blocked the new cable.

I coated the new cables with grease more as an aid to installation 
than anything else. Hopefully the new cables will last another 20+ 
years with minimal attention! :)
