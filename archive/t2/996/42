have i ever mentioned that i hate all you people on this list who can
just take a day trip up into the  mountains.  closest i have to a
mountain is pilot knob, taum sauk.  not really the same as the snow
capped peaks and craggy, beautiful desolation of the rockies.  oh,
well, glad you get to do that sort of thing.

rabidly jealous,

jeremiah

p.s. nice pics, nice family, nice bus.
