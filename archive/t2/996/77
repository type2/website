Subject: hypothesis

My intuition tells me that folks like us here that
own Type 2 VWs use them a lot more than folks that
own other brands of 30-45 year old cars.  More daily
drivers and fewer garage museums, in other words.
Like when do you ever see another 35 year old anything
that isn't pristine but is instead hauling a well pump
or a dozen beehives or 300# of onions or more weight
in tools than the driver weighs?  Farm pickups that
ain't registered but can still run fence rows, maybe.

And leave Havana out of this,
