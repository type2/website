Subject: 73 Bus - Paint Job Recommendations?

I am looking to get a new paint job for my 1973 High Top camper bus.

Having never gotten an after-market paint job before... I was wondering if
any of you had any recommendations for what to do and not to do etc...

Also, if you have recommendations for the best place to do this sort of
thing in Seattle... that would be helpful as well.

FYI: the bus has very little rust but, I would assume that some work on that
would need to be done before painting?

Thanks!
