Subject: Re: [T2] Easy power upgrade + wet petrol

Not JustKampers - I think this plug can from German & Swedish. I also 
suspect that the electrode has burned away, possibly caused by me running 
too rich. I've been doing a lot of work on the tank and then had to replace 
the carb 'cos the horrible rusty fuel bunged it up so there has been a lot 
of cack-handed tuning. Considering the damage it did I'm not suprised to 
find the odd problem.

Whatever - the nice new Bosh plugs from JK are working very nicely now. I 
think I have a sports car with a sink in it !

Finally, just to add insult to injury my last fill of petrol had water in 
it. Of course this sat at the bottom of the tank and when I started to drive 
away from the pub it wouldn't fire. Needless to say I though it was 
something I had done, like you do when you've been tinkering and the van 
doesn't work. I checked everything but it took the nice man from the RAC to 
drian some fuel off and say the magic words, "That's not petrol !". With 
this drained the engine fires up and normal service is resumed.

To add insult to injury, Sainsbury's, where I bought the fuel from, are 
using a Bay windown in thier current adverts for petrol. Pic here:

Still, I've just been for a drive around the back lanes here, up hills, 
round sharp bends and generally had a nice time. Apart from a squeaky brake 
I'm a happy man with a happy van.

Phil

How did the center electrode get past the little side arm without major
banging noises in the engine cylinder?  Likely was defective from the
start! JustKampers owes you a plug!
