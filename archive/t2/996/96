Subject: Re: [T2] VW CAMPER CONCEPT - a better site

Verdier's FLASH-heavy site was rough on my laptop.  My CORE DUO desktop 
with the 21" screen I have here at work handled it well.  I must agree 
that limiting viewing a site to those with large systems costs someone 
vital marketing exposure.  I'm glad they dumped the music too.
