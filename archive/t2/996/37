Subject: Rusty seatbelt anchor-Warning

I began doing a little bodywork the van, when I noticed the seatbelt felt a
little loose.  After a quick examination I found a rust hole all around the
the anchor for the passenger seatbelt.  I had no idea it was like that or
for how long.  I am encouraging you take a look at your seatbelts to make
sure they are still safe.

I posted some pictures of the hole and my repair work.
