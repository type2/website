Subject: bleeding brakes off the ground

Forgive me, but I've never jacked my car off the ground

  http://www.stoptech.com/tech_info/wp_howto_bleedbrakes.shtml

and so neither have I ever removed all four wheels or
put the lug nuts in backwards (whatever that means).
What am I missing?

[ I got to the link by looking for what was in brake
fluid that made it so corrosive. ]
