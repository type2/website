Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Bus - Paint Job Recommendations?

Cory asked for advice:

>I am looking to get a new paint job for my 1973 High Top camper bus.

	May I piggy-back on his request?  My '73 is also coming up 
for painting, so I'd be glad of advice.
	My planning is tending to  -  brace yourself  -  brushing.  I 
would be particularly interested in any news of the rumoured acrylic 
(water-miscible, water cleanup) car paint.
