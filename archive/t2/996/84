for sure, your more likely to find me and my bus loading lumber at he
local Home Depot than any show, it is daily driver year round rain, snow,
sun etc,  right now it is really bugging me that it isn't back on the road
yet.  have some stuff piling up here that needs to get to the dump.
finally got a nice new wiring harness from Kyle Automotive, pricy but
nice.  now the engine is making a noise I can't find...one dang thing
after another...

time to start saving nickels for Boston Bob.
