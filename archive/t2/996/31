Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an 009 distributor - have '80 distributor

Mike,
I found my 009! I don't feel any play in it, but that's my opinion. If you 
want to trade, I'll send it to you so you can check it out. If it's good, 
send me the 80 distributor, if you find it has play in it, just send it 
back. Is your dizzy a points or hall sensor type? I would like either one.
Thanks
Tom
