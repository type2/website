Subject: Post Mortem: (was "No Fire on #2 and #4?")

Just a quick follow-up to my problem where I wasn't getting full power 
from #2 or #4 on my 1600SP in my '67.

Looks like the problem was indeed a vacuum leak where the intake manifold 
meets with the cylinder head.  I pulled the manifold off, replaced the 
gaskets and everything seems to be A-OK now.

Thanks for all the tips!

Cheers,
    Tom
