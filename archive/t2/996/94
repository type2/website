That's a _terrible_ site, obviously created by someone with no 
knowledge of the web, or web standards.

It removes scroll bars, traps most keystrokes, inappropriately assumes 
a large screen size, and basically takes over your web browser. It 
offers nothing to indicate what, if any, controls are available.

Probably the worst use of Flash I've ever seen.
