If you look through pictures of cars of the early 20th century you'll find
a few that used finned tubing for a radiator, so the idea isn't brand new.

The design goal of a radiator is to get the maximum heat exchange ability
in the smallest and least vulnerable package.  My feeling is that any
advantage to using finned tubing will be offset by the added size and
vulnerability of the system.
