Since most radiators are now crossflow the thermosyphon effect is not very
great.

I don't think that the pump will be overstressed as long as the lines are
large enough.  Remember that the pump normally works in a partially
restricted environment when the thermostat is closed.  Most of the problem
with conservatively-sized radiator system is overcooling, not overheating.
