I'm adding a couple idiot lights. One for when the fan
is running, the other for when the coolant temp
reaches whatever temp I preset on my Nordskog gauge. I
want these lights to be something I won't just "not
see." I've been experimenting with putting the LEDs in
the top of the dashboard, way at the back edge,
pointed toward the windshield. This places the
reflection just slightly off my centered vision while
driving and well into the annoying range. It looks
like it's going to work really well. I was testing in
"normal" daylight today and even against the bright
sky it was plenty visable. I will have to run a
seperate circuit for when the headlights are on,
though. I just tried it tonight and had to add a bunch
of resistance to the circuit to get the LEDs dim
enough - especially with a little windshield fogging!
It is workable though, so I'll likely go ahead with
it. -BaH
