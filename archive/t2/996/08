The biggest difference is that its illegal to burn kerosene in a
vehicle operated on the roads in the US.  Theoretically, the over the
road tax is not applied to kerosene.  The price at the pump doesn't
jive with that, though.  However, the fines are very steep.  BTW, #2
heating oil is nearly identical to both Kero and Diesel also.
