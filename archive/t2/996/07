	That could assuage the guilt of a T2er who decided to flag 
away the pleasures of keeping the old VW motor going, and had plenty 
spondulicks to invest in high reliability & high fuel economy.

	This is not novel but a brilliant old idea which lapsed for 
no apparent reason.  I'm glad to see it revived.  Veterans of the 
British Empah will know the old Commer, and badge-engineered Karrier, 
lorries which had the same type of diesel motor.  No cyl head, and 
therefore no cyl head gasket, is a good start ...
We do not have goof-thru!

	This 'uniflo' arrangement is also old  -  esp in steam engines.

	Those aviation overhaul intervals are of course chosen to 
make it v v unlikely that a plane will run out of motive force.  A 
road vehicle can surely put up with the slight increase in failure 
risk at 2000h, or for all I know 4000h.
