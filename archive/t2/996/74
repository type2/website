Subject: Re: [T2] Continuing Saga of Blocked fuel pump

So, vaporized gas would rather reduce what makes it to the 
injectors/unit time and it'll run lean and cause all that hesitation? 
I assume that since the pump cools by the gas going through, it would 
overheat the pump- would this cause the very high current draw observed?

  overdesigned the likely result of a blockage is vaporization of the gas
  upstream of the pump if the blockage is itself upstream of the pump.
