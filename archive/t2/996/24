Or am I just imagining it and it's designed that way. I have been struggling with this for a while, and ANY help y'all can provide would be an act of heroism.


yes there are different starters the auto starter is obvious since it has
no nose bearing support.

also there is the possibilty that your engine and transmission are not
mated properly, I had asimlar problem and discovered that there was
something keeping the engine from seating solidly on the tranny, didn't
take much either 1/4 inch or so was enough to throw things out of whack

I would check that out too before throwing out the starter

good luck
