Subject: Re: [T2] free 72 bus in CA

Free 72 bus is located in Northfork, about 40 minutes into the foothills
outside of Fresno, CA.  See link:
http://fresno.craigslist.org/car/396552183.html  or email:
sale-396552183(-at-)craigslist.org

It's not my bus, I just found it on the craigslist this morning.  Also, I'm
looking for a fuel injection wiring harness for my 81 Westy.  Are these next
to impossible to find?
