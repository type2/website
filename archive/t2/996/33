The machine gun description makes me think you have a dead battery,, or bad 
connections on the ground ,, or the positive to the starter... 

a low battery condition, or poor current path causes the solenoid to 
chatter,, and not fully engage the gears,, and won't turn the starter motor 
either.. 

put a voltmeter on the starter when you have it back in,, and have someone 
turn the key,, there is 2 spots to test... or 2 tests as such,,
put the voltmeter neg to the trans body,, and the voltmeter pos to the 
starter B+ terminal... you should have battery voltage,, about 12v or more.. 
when the key is turned,, it should not drop below 10 or 11 v 

also test at the term 50,, the spade that comes from the key,, it should 
have about 11 volts or more when the key is turned to start. 

here is a comparision picture,,

starters have 9 teeth on the gears..
