VW built more than 2 body styles:

265 Pick-up, Double cabin, passenger door right, LHD (curbside)
267 Pick-up, Double cabin, passenger door left, LHD (roadside)
268 Pick-up, Double cabin, passenger door left, RHD (curbside)

And there was probably an m-code to add the opposite door because  
I've seen a photo of a bus like this and it was only a matter of  
welding LHD/RHD panels they had already stamped.
