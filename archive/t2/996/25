Subject: Re: [T2] Spare Tire for Front of 73' bus

Hi Cory,

The spare tire is the same as the other 4. You can get yourself a  
spare rim and tire just about anywhere.... If you tell us where you  
are located there is probably a listmember in your area that can  
suggest a good source.


Happy Trails,
