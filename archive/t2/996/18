Subject: Looking for an 009 distributor - have '80 distributor for trade

Hey Everyone,
I need an 009 distributor in good condition (no play) so that I can open 
it up and lock out the advance mechanism.  I have a 1980 distributor out 
of a running bus if that's worth anything to anyone that I'd be willing 
to trade.

Anyone have one they'd be willing to part with?

Thanks!
Mike
