Richard nailed it.

The most important question that you need to get an answer to is,
"What's causing the low compression?"

If you can pull the engine yourself, a pair of AMC heads would go
nicely. If it's rings, a P&C set isn't too expensive either. You could
probably manage rebuilt heads AND pistons and cylinders for about a
grand, give or take.

Talk to the shop and find out what the real problem is, and what it
would take to just fix that. Then you'll be better able to decide what
you want to do from there. If they don't wanna help you, and you have
an air compressor, leakdown kits are at horrible freight for $30 right
now. (Or were on Sunday when I was there last.)
