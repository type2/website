Subject: The ideal VW motor replacement

	For those who can't get a free Soobaroo motor from their 
neighbour, and have considerable money,
<http://www.dair.co.uk>www.dair.co.uk
	 appears to offer a luxurious replacement for our old airhowlers.
	The site is a little odd in some ways  -  they're in no hurry 
to tell how this engine is cooled, and I hadn't heard that Avtur (i.e 
kerosene) will substitute for dieselene.
