How low?

A head is cheap but paying them to remove the engine and put it back in is expensive so I guess they are recommending that you spend even more to help prevent the possibility of having to pay to drop the engine again in the short term?

What's the rest of the engine like? Mileage? How did it run before?

2L Type4 parts are more expensive than Type 1 parts. The 1.7L and 1.8L parts are getting harder to find...

Varies. It can be economical to buy two non working engines and make a good used one from both and sell what's left.

>A rebuilt engine?

About $1500 +/- $200 for a budget rebuild.

$2500 and up if you want new parts other than P&C from a reputable builder.
