Not a long shot, but probably a bad idea. The new heads still use the
same valve seat design as VW did twenty years ago - a design which
resulted in a tendancy to drop a valve seat if the head gets too hot.
The AVP rebuilt heads (which we sell) use an improved valve seat design
and tend to be more robust than new heads. We do sell both, but in my
opinion the AVP rebuilts are both better and cheaper than new - a
winning combination.
