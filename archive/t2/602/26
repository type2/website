Subject: Was Safe not sound

Well folks the diagnosis and repairs are said to be made to the HapyBus.  I
will pick it up later this evening and see what happens, and with a little bus
Karma, I will make it to Buses of the Corn in Whitby Ontario, Canada.
You will remember that the fan came off the crank, and all hell broke loose,
with smoke and idiot lights.
It seems that the slot for the woodruff key on the crank got stretched.  Well
that in itself is an understatement.  I am told that the key fit in about
2/3's, but the final third was severely widened or warped.  The shop used some
JB weld to hold the key in its slot.  They put it all back together, adjusted
the valves, put it in time, did another compression check, because they
obviously know of my mechanical skills and didn't want to take anything to
chance, drove it, and feel as if it may be 90% good.  Not perfect, but he said
he would drive it, and I guess that's ok by me.
Soooo, I will pick up the bus, maybe wash it, take him for a fresh tank of
gas, and cruise around for a day or so, getting used to the feel before
setting sail for Canada.
I figure one of two things will happen, I will either make a sound round trip,
or be towed home.  Certainly wont be the first time.
Thanks for reading folks.
Oh Canada, Oh Canada.......
