Subject: Re: [T2] Did Westfalia do Hightops?

Hi Rob,

I read on somebody's Bus website that they had modified the Z-bed to 
accommodate the table leg with it still attached to the sink cabinet.  They 
pulled off the upholstery and foam, and cut a notch in the wood base of the 
front Z-bed section.  The notch was just wide and deep enough to clear the 
table leg with it still on the sink cabinet.  Once the notch was cut, they 
reinstalled the foam and upholstery, leaving the front edge of the seat 
intact.  When the bed was out, the foam and upholstery compressed against 
the table leg, and the notch in the wood didn't hit anything.  I'm not sure 
if he modified the table attachment hardware, but I'm sure some creative 
re-engineering could be used as a solution.

If you're trying to keep your Bus stock (oops, too late!), this may not be 
the best option.   But, if you want to keep your table leg in place and keep 
your bed working well, this may be just the thing.

Good Luck!
