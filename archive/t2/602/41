"This page of the 77 sales brochure shows the color combos:

I just wanted to let everyone know that sometime soon 72camper will be gone
and the link will redirect you to www.baywindowbus.com  The content should
be the same at the time of the switch. I am not sure if each individual page
will redirect you to the new site though.

Richard Atwell...I know you still have a link on your page for my brochures
(THANKS!) and if you have a minute could you update the link? The new link
is:
http://www.baywindowbus.com/brochures.htm

These pages have all the brochures 72camper has and MORE!!

Thanks everyone,
