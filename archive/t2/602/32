Subject: Re: [T2] Getting to know my HOLLEY

I reguards to Holley you should check those numbers again and see if you can
find some more to help isolate the actual model. L6503 I can't find but
Model 2870 is listed with a Kit # 3-358. For tech info look here.

I can't seem to find Kit #3-358 on the Holley site or web.

I'm sorry to report I looked all over 3 sides of the carb and couldn't
find any other numbers, except for two seperate numbers in circular
molding stamps on the passenger side.
Learned a bit at that site, but couldn't find 

I took the four brass bolts out of the accelerator
pump/skirt/bladder/?? cover with the intent to remove it and whatever
spring was underneath for inspection and replacement.
After I got the bolts out it wouldn't budge. (I didn't pry it)  Hey
look...there's a metal lever coming from it ( that pushable, producing
priming sound tab!) which goes around and under the carb looked in
good place and probably the main thing securing it in place.
Darn. Was hoping for an easy off and part replacement.

Is the book "Holley Carbs, Manifolds, & FI 4th Ed." that I've found on
ebay one you'd recommend for digging in deeper?

When buying some other stuff from a guy parting a bus I got a similar
Weber. (strangely similar by looks, and non-working electric choke)  
I can't find any part number on that one either (26/27 on side of this
one), and that was a sort of backup plan while rebuilding or screwing
up the Holley. But the fuel line brass hookup line broke in transit or
unpacking, so will need to dig into this one before moving forward
there. Think I have to install the accompanying manifold or will I be
able to use my existing?

It's raining out. Guess that's my excuse for rambling rather than tinkering.
