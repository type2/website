"This gives me plenty of clearance, ask Rob Henley. He was amazed at the
room I had to get the engine in and out".

Yes I was amazed....so I conducted my own "test" and it worked well. I too
removed the engine myself, utilizing the jackstands underneath the torsion
tubes, just ahead of the rear wheels. I didn't have to lift the rear end
very high, although in the reinstall, removing the rear bumper gave me much
more clearance. I had the carb removed, but not the intakes. I have never
used anything but a floor jack, however mine is rather large and though the
engine will wobble I have never had one fall off. I did the reinstall after
dark, on my driveway. It isn't easy thought to see all the things going on
in the dark. I would definately recommend doing it early in the morning
rather than late at night, if possible.
Here are the pics from a couple of weeks ago, removing the engine for paint
and oil seals:
