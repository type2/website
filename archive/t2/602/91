Hmmm let me see, over a period of 20 years, I've owned 5 Type2's of which no
less than 3 dropped a valve seat, the last one from a factory rebuilt
Canadian Longblock which lasted a total of 30K before it croaked. Their
solution was to hand me a new head and say sorry bout that. I'd agree with
Ron, buy the AVP head and be happy.

Not a long shot, but probably a bad idea. The new heads still use the

same valve seat design as VW did twenty years ago - a design which

resulted in a tendancy to drop a valve seat if the head gets too hot.

The AVP rebuilt heads (which we sell) use an improved valve seat design

and tend to be more robust than new heads. We do sell both, but in my

opinion the AVP rebuilts are both better and cheaper than new - a

winning combination.
