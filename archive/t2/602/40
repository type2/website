Subject: Re: [T2] Did Westfalia do Hightops?

From Erik Meltzer

 never seen one of them either.  
 
 BUT: Hardtop Westies weren't in the official sales brochures
either.  So if they built those to order, chances are that they
*might* have built Westies based on the factory hightop Kombi
as well, if someone was crazy enough to order one (as opposed
to getting a hightop Kombi and doing the camper conversion 
themselves, or getting a Westy and grafting on the hightop 
 themselves).  But again, I've never seen nor heard of a factory
hightop Bay Westy, so I doubt that there were any.

In the USA, 3 Westy models were offered. 
In the 76 to 79 model years, these were called P-21, P-22, and P-27.
If you go here: http://www.type2.com/bartnik/csmanual.htm  and click on page
4, it explains what you get in the P-21 [hardtop] Westy. 
Page 5 section 2. is the P-22, section 3. is the P-27 [deluxe].
Here, hardtop Westies are common.

This page of the 77 sales brochure shows the color combos:
