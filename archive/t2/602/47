Subject: Shift rod removal

With all this talk of engine removal methods, I have another kinda 
related question:

I need to remove my shift rod to R&R the shift rod bushings.  Can I 
drop the engine and tranny down far enough together to get the shift 
rod out without disconnecting the CV joints?

Thanks

Tim
