Ewwwwww! Oil SNOT!!

Actually, that's caused more from NOT running the engine long enough to get
it up to temp. Oil snot is created when water sloshes around in your oil.
The water gets in there in the form of condensation as the engine cools in a
damp environment. To help keep it clear one should never start the engine
unless one intends to run it long enough to bring it fully to proper
operating temp so that the water will be heated near (or above) boiling and
evaporate out of the case.

If you make mostly short trips around town then increase your warmup time
before heading out in the morning. When I was driving the bug and worked a
bit under 10 miles from home I used to go out just after my morning shower
and start the car. I'd let it idle long enough to unset the choke then go
in and finish dressing (only about 10 minutes for me) then have a cup of
coffee (another 15 minutes or so) before leaving.

To see the creation of oil snot just get a glass jar (with a good tight
lid) and fill it half up with motor oil. Now add about 1/4 cup of water,
cap it, and shake vigorously. You probably can't shake hard enough to get
the foamy consistency that you see under your oil cap but you'll get the
idea.
