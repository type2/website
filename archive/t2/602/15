Subject: Re: [T2] Engine/tranny install advice

Hi Folks,

When I've had my engine out before, I used the ramps, and found it to be a 
major PITA.  I think it's because the Bus sits at an angle and you have to 
compensate for that when installing the engine.  Also, my floor jack could 
not get the engine high enough, so I had to put blocks under it, making a 
hairy situation even worse.

This time when I removed my engine, I didn't put the Bus on anything except 
the ground.  However, I wrapped a rope around a pipe, put the pipe on some 
weight-distributing blocks, and ran the rope down thru the engine hatch to a 
strap around the engine.  (I think I got the idea for this from Bob of 
Access Systems.  Thanks, Bob!)  Using the rope and the jack together, I was 
able to lower the engine all the way down and still keep all 4 Bus wheels on 
the ground.  Once the engine was out, the rear end sat higher because the 
engine's weight was off the rear springs.  So, I jacked up the rear end 
about 3-5" and slid the engine out.  It was probably the easiest engine pull 
I've ever done!

The nice thing about the later Bays is the fact that the transmission is 
bolted to the frame independent of the engine.  No extra braces, jacks, or 
tilting required!  I guess that's VW's "payback" for making the rear valance 
non-removable...

Whichever way you go, good luck!  I hate dropping 350 pounds of metal on my 
hand...
