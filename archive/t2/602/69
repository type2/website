Subject: Re: [T2] Alternate Engine Removal Procedure

Here is where the 2" x 10" comes in handy, even if the HEs are not 
installed. Get it in there on the board. Raise one side, add a brick under 
the board, lift the other side add a brick. Go back to the first side and 
repeat until you have enough clearence to get it above the jack.

When I did my last one this is what we used to get it of the creeper that 
the 2" x 10" was centered in.
