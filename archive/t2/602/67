Subject: Re: [T2] Alternate Engine Removal Procedure

Had a skinny buddy once carry my Type IV from the bench and to my Beetle and install it all by himself. He got there 15 minutes or so before I did and was in a rush... This was a long block - not with exhaust and cooling. 

This was the same guy that was just an average guy but when we had to qual for PT every 6 months - one morning he showed up, forgot his gear, and ran it in camos and boots! Ran it and then jogged back to where I was trudging along and talked me through the run. Essentially running the route 1/2 again. I HAVE ALWAYS hated running... <grin!> Always more of a mental thing. In the right frame of mind I was ready for a run, when not, then not. 

We ran around Napoli in his yellow '81 1200cc Beetle we described as possessed. That thing just WENT. My 1200cc Super was more leisurely about getting around town.  We shared a spare motor and would swap them out quickly anytime one of us needed some engine work that might keep us off the road for a day or two. 

LOTS more stories but better in private.
