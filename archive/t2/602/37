Subject: Strange water leak in bus

This is in a '71 3-seat bus. If you follow the floor back toward the rear, it
meets a wall that angles up at about 45 degrees - I think the other side of
this wall is the gas tank compartment (correct me if I am wrong). When it
rains, quite a bit of water appears on the floor where this 45 degree wall
meets the wheel well on the passenger side - around where the rear seat mounts
to the floor. Just after a recent hard rain, I pulled the vinyl panel away
from the side wall and it was dry as a bone in there. I also crawled under the
bus and looked at the bottom under where the water is puddling and it is dry
there also. The bus is not being driven recently. I removed the rear side
window yesterday ( I am replacing all my window rubber anyway). The area
around the window is actually in pretty good shape rust wise. I don't see
evidence of water entering there. I'm wondering if it can be coming in the gas
filler door and through the gas tank compartment.

Does anyone have any idea where this water can be coming from?

Sincere thanks,
