Subject: Caharging problems

Hello guys

I have a charging problem with my alternator (BOSCH # 043 903 023 D) on a
type1 engine, I got no warning from the alternator ligth in the dash (just a
little glow at idle that dissapear when rev's up) but I do not have enough
charging power since after a few driving days the battery is gone
I will apreciate any input on the subject.
Thanks in advance


Roberto
