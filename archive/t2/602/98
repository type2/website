Absolutely correct.  You get in you car, you start it up, and you gently
drive away.  A mile or so of "in the neighborhod" driving will be sufficient
warm up so, when you hit the freeway, everything's fine.

To avoid getting a lot of condensation and pollutants in your oil just be
sure to get the engine completely warmed up every few startups; take a
little 20 - 30 minute trip at freeway speeds or something similar.
