Subject: Re: [T2] Re: getting engine onto the jack

We do the same thing but using two people to lift one side of the engine and build up blocks. Nobody breaks a sweat this way. Eventually it is high enough to pick up with a floor jack (trolley jack) and we stab the engine onto the tranny this way. 

I used scissors jacks for the longest time and they work well - slowly and require alot of balancing. I have had a couple engines fall off of those jakcs though (a couple inches onto wood blocks) but the hydraulic jack is easier.
