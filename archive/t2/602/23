I bought one of those egg-carton foam mattress pads - put that over the 
z-bed foam, then a fitted double-bed sheet over that (works great).  
Veeerrrry comfy (I've overslept many a camping trip) - though admittedly I 
do favor a firm mattress.

Here's one example, though I don't think mine was as expensive:

Rolls right up and stashes under the seat.
