Subject: Re: [T2] Strange water leak in bus

My bus was leaking behind the passenger seat as well
as beside the sink.  It was coming from the canvas in
the pop top.  Apparently my cargo bay had some gunk in
it, water would collect and then when I drove the
water would move into the canvas.  I didn't roll it
all the way up so it started dripping.  It took 3 rain
storms to figure that one out since it evaporated as
quickly as it collected.
