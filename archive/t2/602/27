Subject: Re: [T2] Engine/tranny install advice

Hi Gerald,

OMG, but that sounds WAY too complicated and not very safe.

Last week I dropped the engine in the westfakia to replace the clutch. 
It took only 70 minutes for two of us to get the engine on the 
driveway. My 13-year old son helped me reinstall it the night after and 
it took about 95 minutes to re-install.

1. I drove the bus onto secure ramps, and set the e-brake.
2. Remove the 3 pieces of rear tin and move the coil to the top of the 
engine.
3. Remove the top two transmission hanger bolts. Allowing the tranny to 
drop will make it a LOT easier to slide the engine off of the tranny.
4. Disconnect all the other stuff, as usual. Leave the intake and 
exhaust attached. Support the engine with a dolly jack in the 
meanwhile.
5. Use a dolly jack to lower the engine, and pull it back and off the 
tranny. Then wheel it out from under the bus.

I have removed the engine and tranny together singlehandedly, but it is 
not something I would do again except in an emergency. The combined 
weight is too dangerous; if something went wrong I would not be able to 
do anything about it and would have no-one to get help. Putting them 
back in the bus as a combined unit just wouldn't be feasible to do 
alone unless you have a very well equipped shop -- I wouldn't even try.

Happy trails,
