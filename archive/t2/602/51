Subject: Re: [T2] Strange water leak in bus

Hiya Bill,

Had the same situation in my 70 Bus.  It turned out that the vent wing (above 
that area on the driver's side) was leaking every time it rained.  Water was 
puddling on the outside of the bottom of the vent wing seal (the seal was an 
oldie moldie and the vent wing itself did not make contact with the outer lip 
of the seal when closed) and leaking through the bottom.  I only found this 
leak with the aid of a helper and a hose.
