Subject: Re: [OVT] Tranny swap 

Attention all OVTer's, we are now having an official tech session to be held
at Dixie Bus Gathering., led by the Honorable JB and Sixer.  The topic will
taking out two engines from 2- 66 bus, and swapping the appropriate
transmissions.
All are welcome to assist.
This will greatly benefit your future knowledge of this maneuver.

Sixer, provide a listing of the necessary tools.

The action will take place east of the shelter house, in the yard.  To
closely resemble the backyard, shade tree mechanics we all aspire to be!!

Maybe if we are lucky, Mr. Mark Dearing will provide the harassment and
jokes!, and maybe bail us out of any unexpected issues.

Dixie Bus Gathering, August 13-14, located in Central Ohio.
