Subject: Re: [T2] Alternate Engine Removal Procedure

I've done it many ways, this one included, but always had a helper. My
biggest problems are:

1.) I'm working away from a garage where I could reach over and grab
"stuff" that I might need (you know, "STUFF", the little things that always
accumulate on the shelves and floor of your garage. Nuts, bolts, various
lengths of wood, wire, chain, whatever.)

2.) If I set that engine on the ground to slide it under the bus I have
serious doubts of my ability to get it lifted high enough to get it back on
the jack without help. I've managed to get seriously out of shape working a
job where I sit on my butt 17 hours/day. I've started rectifying that with
excersize but it will be a long slow process.

For pics of a variation on Jason's lift method see:

Starting at photo # 99.  We used the chain more to help provide balance
than actual lift. It allowed us to tilt the engine at will without danger
of dropping it off the jack.
