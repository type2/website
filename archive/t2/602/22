025 133 073 can be substituted for the original seal if it
is still available at the dealer. The late model Vanagon's
used this seal.

Has anyone ordered the Vanagon style seal (025 133 073)
from the dealer or list vendor recently?

I ordered one a month ago through BD and my other items
arrived but the seal is still back ordered from the
invoice note.
