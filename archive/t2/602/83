Subject: RE: [T2] Has anyone purchased these solex carbs

I have a set coming in tomorrow for a bus. I will let you know what I think of
them. This set is not new, but it is complete and they were on an engine only
a month before the engine died. I am not sure when I will actually get them
installed, but I will take pics of the kit when it comes in. The previous
owner said they ran great for him right out of the box.
