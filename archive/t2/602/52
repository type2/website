I haven't done a complete R&R but -- drop the engine/tranny??

Remove your shifter
Unhook everything under the pedal pan
Loosen the grub screws on the rear coupler

You should now be able to shove the rod far enough forward to get ther rear
coupler out.

Once it's out you should be able to shove the rod BACK far enough to get
the front coupler out.

We are talking about a later bay, right? '68 - '71 may be somewhat
different.
