Subject: Re[2]: [T2] Shift rod removal

Like I said, I haven't done the "whole thing" yet. <grin> There are 3
bushings aren't there? I forgot about the middle one which I believe is the
one you are talking about.

1) Front -- little nylon circle
2) Middle -- ??
3) Rear -- square cage coupler bushing attached from rod to hockey stick
with grub screws.

If you DO have to drop the engine/tranny then you should be able to do it
with no problem as a unit. Unbolt the moustache bar, the two bolts above
the tranny where the tranny and engine meet, and the front tranny mount
bolts. 

DON'T FORGET TO UNHOOK #3 ABOVE. Start dropping the tranny with that
coupler cage still attached and you're gonna tweak the shift rod, or worse
-- the hockey stick, all out of whack.

You should be able to get about 6 or 8 inches of straight down drop
without pulling the CV's. You may be able to get more room up front by
raising the engine a little and lowering the front of the tranny. The axles
are far enough back that you should be able to keep the CV's almost level
and have the front of the tranny almost on the ground.

Moving this back to the list for the archives.
