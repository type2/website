Subject: Exhaust Questions

Since I have my engine out, I was thinkin now might be as good a time as any
to replace my holey (not holy) heat exchangers and exhaust setup. I have a
stock size aftermarket exhaust now. My questin to the list is, at what point
is it worth going to the larger size exhaust tubes. Right now I've got a 1776

Would going bigger be worth the dough, or is it just hype.
Thanks
