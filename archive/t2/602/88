Today I do use a rolling hydraulic jack!
Quoth Chris: "I used scissors jacks for the longest time and they work
well - slowly and
require alot of balancing. I have had a couple engines fall off of those
jakcs though (a couple inches onto wood blocks) but the hydraulic jack
is
easier. "
Scissor jacks being less safe?  Slow yes, but safer (better balanced) if
they are on each side of the centerline and are on a rolling board.  I
could jack both at once, the handles in each hand, a good excercise for
the arms and wrists!  Remember, this was with a dual port engine.  I
forgot to mention I stapled slats of wood around the base of the jacks
so they could NOT move on the board as it was rolled or tapped.
