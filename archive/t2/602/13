We are "elderly" types (over 50) who use extra padding that hides the
gaps in the z-bed -around 2" foam pads with our own sewn covers using
flannel on one side and cotton sheeting on the other.  One also is used
on the thinner (hard to the hips) upper bed.  These can be stored flat
on the upper (78) bed that is left unfolded always in our camper.  I
believe these are visible in the web site made for our Westy:

site if excessive- if so, I can p-mail pics).
