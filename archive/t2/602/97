What a waste of gas and what an environmental nuissance! Just think about
all the gas you burned without getting any use out of it.

On top of that I doubt that it really helped either your oil or your engine.
You put additional (and unnecessary) wear on your engine that does not show
up on your odometer but is there nevertheless. Also, warm-up at idle is
slower than under load in traffic increasing the time during which your
engine is below operating temperature resulting in additional wear during
the prolonged warm-up.

I don't argue for full throttle on a cold engine, but rather for warm-up in
traffic without being unnecessarily hard on the engine before it has reached
operating temperature.

If you make mostly short trips around town then increase your warmup time
before heading out in the morning. When I was driving the bug and worked a
bit under 10 miles from home I used to go out just after my morning shower
and start the car. I'd let it idle long enough to unset the choke then go in
and finish dressing (only about 10 minutes for me) then have a cup of coffee
(another 15 minutes or so) before leaving.
