At least on my 74, if you have wipers, you have power to the top of
fuses #8/#9, and your #10 fuse is intact.
Headlights go from top of fuse #8 through the ignition switch, through
the dimmer relay, and through fuses #3/#4/#5/#6 to the lights.
Turn signals go from top of fuse #8 through the ignition switch,
through fuse #11, through the flasher relay, and on to the turn-signal
switch and the signal lights.

and headlights)
