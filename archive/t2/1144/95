This is especially true for the wiring harness.  Before you install it take a
couple hours to clean it up and make sure that all of the pins in the
connectors have continuity to the ECU connector.  This will take a couple
hours but will definitely familiarize you with the components and harness.
And once you get it back in you won't suspect the harness (much) if you have
trouble.

Good luck, sounds like a fun conversion.
