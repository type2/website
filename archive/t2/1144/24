If its popping and stalling unless you give it a little gas, it could
be a vacuum leak. Happened to me a few weeks ago on my 74 bus when the
dumb EGR rubber hose slipped off the intake manifold when I went over
a big bump. This would indicate an overly lean condition, so don't
drive it, or it could damage the engine.
