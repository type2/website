I've checked the idle solenoid and it does "click".

I've used my hands to check the terminals on the coil, distributor, and plugs. 
 They are all there, although the connections on the plugs are not "solid". 
 i.e. there's a wee bit of play, but they won't come off unless I really pull 
them.  I have not messed with the idle adjustment screw or points as I don't 
have any tools handy.

I'll have to re-assess the at-speed power characteristics on my way home today.

Josh,

My instinct says check your ignition wiring carefully --  connections to the 
plugs, coil and distributer.  What you are describing sounds like what happens 
when you have a miss.  If one of the battery shims had enough force put a hole 
in the heater hose, it would have had enough force if it it a wire to knock it 
loose.

If the wires check out OK, check your points.  They may have been set at the 
shop and not properly tightened.  But my suspicion is you will find one of the 
spark plug wires is not seated tightly.

If it were a fuel problem you would likely notice it more at driving speeds and 
less at idle.

Cheers,

John R
