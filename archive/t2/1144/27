	The same symptoms on my 1600DP (but with Brazilian Weber 
carb) baffled an old-hand VW mechanic.  He resorted to the old trick 
of:


warm up engine

rev to c.3000 rpm using one hand on throttle lever

hold other hand over carb intake till engine almost stalls

remove hand, rejoicing in spectacular backfire and even more in the 
ensuing smooth running at all rpm


  Presumably some bit of much got jolted free from a jet  ...


It's easy to do, and little if any danger is created.
