The connections seem fine.

My next course of action is to check idle solenoid function.
If I have this right, then it's: disconnect idle solenoid lead.  Turn on 
ignition.  Then touch lead and listen for solenoid operation.

Another source has also suggested turning the idle adjustment screw to see if it 
will hold an idle.  Not sure what that will show, but I'll report results from 
both.

I didn't mention before, but it's a 34 PICT-3 carb.  009 distributor so no 
vacuum connection.

The garage did a full engine service so they may have touched the points and/or 
timing.  I'm going to call them in a bit to see what they suggest.

Thanks,

Josh

Check the idle circuit solenoids on the carbs. Mine once worked loose
on both side and produced the same symptoms. Just had to tighten them
up again.

In a similar vein, look for loose vacuum hoses or problems with the
carburetor linkages.

If we knew what work the garage did, it would help. Could be something
worked loose in the points or timing.
