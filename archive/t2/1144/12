Even if you hear the "click" on the idle jet when you touch the wire to it,
that is not dispositive that it is working correctly.  I've experienced one
that would "click" all day when I've tried this yet it had a piece of trash
stuck in it so no fuel would flow regardless of whether or not electricity was
applied.  Backing the electric idle jet out just a tad, which allowed it to
run fine at idle, was what led me to discover the piece of trash,... remove
the trash, retighten the idle jet and all was well.

My next course of action is to check idle solenoid function.
If I have this right, then it's: disconnect idle solenoid lead.  Turn on
ignition.  Then touch lead and listen for solenoid operation.
