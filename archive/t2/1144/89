Subject: Converting to fuel injection.

I feel you on fiddling with carbs.  I don't have an FI bus (1600 twin-port 34 
PICT-3), but after reading up on the Mega Squirt pages I found FI pretty 
straight forward.  Maybe my computer engineering background makes it easier to 
understand that the black art of carb tuning.  To be honest, I just haven't read 
up on carb tuning so that's no excuse.  However, given the time and money I 
would convert to FI using a DIY system like Mega Squirt. 

Are you looking to go with an original VW FI system or rolling your own?  In the 
UK more people are starting to go the DIY route.  I'm guessing that because 
originally FI models weren't as big here as in the U.S.  They also kept the 1600 
engine around here longer as well.  They even made some early-year Vanagons with 
1600s!  I hear they are good if you like a leisurely drive.

Anyone else used MegaSquit or DIY FI?  It looks like an awesome project.

Subject: [T2] Converting a 1974 westy from carburetion to fuel injection.

Hey guys, I am done fiddling with the original dual carbs on the bus.  I am
going to attempt to convert it to fuel injection if my friend Richard is
willing to help.  Does anyone have any suggestions or instructions for this
process.  I simply have had it with the carbs.
