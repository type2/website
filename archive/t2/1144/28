I have a friend that's having a problem with her lean-running carb.  It 
will run find while in warmup (presumably because of the electric 
choke), and then start running really lean after about 3 - 5 minutes.

I'm gonna give your trick a try to see if it's a clogged jet on the 
carb.  Now, if you lower the throttle before taking your hand off the 
carb, will it backfire as spectacularly?  I like to avoid loud bangs :)
