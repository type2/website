this type of stuff is easier if we knew what your stereo was hooked to, and 
if you messed with anything near the emergency flasher switch, the switches 
tend to explode, and create a no pos+ voltage at the lights on the back of 
the dash, or did the dash come out, as those grounds back there tend to fall 
off when someone decide to take the dash out, or were you cruising, like you 
do everyday, and then bam some thing just shorted out on the accessory 
circuit, did you spill some thing on it, or does it act up when it rained. 
If your having ignition switch problems,  the replacements are like $10 new, 
crap part.....  could be,  does it start?

really the best help you can get is written in the bentley schematics for 
your year bus, they sell them online and paper is best to follow wiring in 
my opinion.  It tells you which color wire goes to which spot, what circuits 
should do what, and when.  id check for power at the flasher switch after I 
double checked the fuses were seated right and not blown, then I'd jack with 
the ignition switch to see if I could get it to work, if it was near me, 
then check under dash wiring and grounds, and figure out where the disconnet 
was.
