Josh,

My instinct says check your ignition wiring carefully --  connections to the 
plugs, coil and distributer.  What you are describing sounds like what 
happens when you have a miss.  If one of the battery shims had enough force 
put a hole in the heater hose, it would have had enough force if it it a 
wire to knock it loose.

If the wires check out OK, check your points.  They may have been set at the 
shop and not properly tightened.  But my suspicion is you will find one of 
the spark plug wires is not seated tightly.

If it were a fuel problem you would likely notice it more at driving speeds 
and less at idle.

Cheers,

John R
