Wonder why it is so bloomin' expensive? Shouldn't it cost something more 
in line with a Honda Odyssey? And then add the camper stuff? Again - 
should the camper stuff really add more than $10K?

Am thinking VW ought to be able to supply a Sprinter style van for about 
the same price. At least consider moving production out of Germany to 
the USA where they could afford to build it for a price normal people 
can pay.

Saw lots of Sprinters today on the interstate while we were going to 
Vanderbilt for the 20th time. (Wife has had some serious eye problems).

At some point in the distant future if I'm rich enough and if VW can't 
get it together, I'll be buying a Sprinter long wheel base turbo diesel 
and converting it to a camper myself - - if, if, if I don't like driving 
my well aged aircooled VW for some reason (safety, value, reliability?)
