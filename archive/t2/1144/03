	I'd not heard of this arrangement.
	It may be better than nothing, but the usual form has been to 
face both scoops fwd, so as to pack in more air per s. at cruise. 
The air is thus pushed 'thru' the compartment, but not merely 
wandering across the top of the motor  -  far more beneficially, 
pushed by the fan down past the motor, esp the cooling fins on the 
cyls & heads.
