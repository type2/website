  You can get a Sprinter through Pleasureways in Canada and US, not cheap-

They do make a poptop with upper bed that is a lot like the Eurovan or 
California, a more reasonable $60k, Ford E-150 chassis.

Am thinking VW ought to be able to supply a Sprinter style van for about 
the same price. At least consider moving production out of Germany to 
the USA where they could afford to build it for a price normal people 
can pay.

  I rented one of the Mecedes/Westfalia Marco Polos for 5 weeks in Europe a
  few years ago. What an awesome van. Very comfortable, sipped diesel, and
  with a 6 speed, let me cruise at 100mph. My wife and I took it all over
  Switzerland, France and Italy, with a little Germany thrown in. Wish I 
could
  get one here...
