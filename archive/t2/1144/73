Subject: Converting a 1974 westy from carburetion to fuel injection.

Hey guys, I am done fiddling with the original dual carbs on the bus.  I am
going to attempt to convert it to fuel injection if my friend Richard is
willing to help.  Does anyone have any suggestions or instructions for this
process.  I simply have had it with the carbs.
