Subject: Re: [T2] Converting a 1974 westy from carburetion to fuel 

It is true,, you need a return in the fuel rail......... you don't have to
change the tank... a T on the outlet of a single outlet tank will work
fine.. as does changing the return to one of the vents on the top of the
tank...  my 74 has been return to vent for 100k km.
I  started to build a siamese tube that fit in the outlet nut of the 74
tank...  then I found the  T idea worked fine...
then,, when I was having an issue.. I was convinced by some others that the
T was trouble, so I changed the return to the vent..  and later found that a
feed hose to the pump was collapsing... and cutting off fuel supply,,
nothing to do with the T!

so.. there is something I learned...  between the outlet of the filter...
and the inlet of the pump,, make sure you don't use any extra hose.. only
use about 2" so it can't collapse and pinch off the fuel supply.
