Subject: Re: [T2] Loss Power and Stalling at Idle

Here's my recommendation:

  Open your gas cap immediately after the next stall. If you hear a 
whoosh of air rushing in, you need to unplug the vents to the gas tank.

Another advisable action would be the "poor man's compression test". 
Pull the plug wires one at a time to see which one has the least affect 
on the idle. If there is ONE that affects idle less than the other 
three, the problem is there. Check the wire and the plug for issues, and 
if none are found follow up with a valve adjustment and a real 
compression test.
