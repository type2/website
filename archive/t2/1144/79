Subject: Re: [T2] Converting a 1974 westy from carburetion to fuel

OMG.. i think this is the first !!  ,, almost everyone tears off the EFI and
sticks on that single center mount carb!

Good on you Monty!

It isn't hard at all.. you can easily notch the body for the computer,, just
like the factory did..  I drilled the corner holes, and then used a sharp
edge to cut an x in the tin.. then just fold in the 4 flaps to make a nice
round edge hole that holds the computer very well...

I cut the air box holder from a donor .. then used self tapping screws to
hold it in place.

all the other components fasten on easily..   I would recommend having the
injectors cleaned and balanced ...
make sure the grounds are connected..  and of course all the rest of the
wiring.. which btw, can't be messed up as the connectors are color coded

get Richard going asap!
