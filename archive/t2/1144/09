Check the idle circuit solenoids on the carbs. Mine once worked loose
on both side and produced the same symptoms. Just had to tighten them
up again.

In a similar vein, look for loose vacuum hoses or problems with the
carburetor linkages.

If we knew what work the garage did, it would help. Could be something
worked loose in the points or timing.
