Subject: "WHY NOT A NEW GOOD LOOKING VAN"?

Well, the "new Beetle', caught 'fancy', because, prolly, there was a ratio of
30 to 1!  In which I mean, the number of VW beetles, VS the number of Busses
sold, would ..'long term' create, a ...'cult'..such as 'we' are, yet, the
number of beetles,versus number of 'busses', would to .."German main office',
say,  we don't need them,  let's build what 'we' see as ...'profitable, and we
will present 'them',..with a..."facsimile"!
Cheers
