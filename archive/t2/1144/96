What's sad is that they say "The next-generation car is seen as an 
update of the classic van associated with the hippie movement of the '60s."

HUH?!?!  How is it an update?  It doesn't look anything like the bus. 
If someone said the Eurovan was an update of the classic bus, it would 
be a little bit more believable because it's essentially an update of 
the Vanagon, which is an update of the loaf.  But to just create a 
minivan and call it an update of the bus is just stupid.

Now, when VW released the new bug, I'll give them some credit because it 
shares some of the common curves of the classic bug.  But this new Bulli 
minivan is just that, another minivan.  Apples and oranges...
