Syd,

That I understand completely and would normally charge at least annually. 
 However, the bus was just serviced (including renewing the fuel filter) a few 
days before the problem showed up.
I just got the bus at the end of January so my thinking was getting a full 
service last month to re-baseline my maintenance schedule.  The previous owner 
provided me with a service history, but I wanted to start fresh and he hadn't 
had it serviced since before he put it away for autumn/winter storage last year.

Possibly some grime had accumulated in the fuel system while stored over the 
winter and was let loose with the service?

Josh

Which is why you should have an 'inline' filter from your tank to fuel pump, 
which you change ..'religiously'..two times per year...cheap..'out of sight out 
of mind'..insurance!
Cheers
