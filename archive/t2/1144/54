Hi Mike,

The question is, would you swear that oath on a briefcase full of 
Franklins? $60k worth?

Price a California lately? Dealers in the UK list it for over US$ 
60,000. Before taxes. If you add the price of shipping it'll be WAY more 
than anyone on this side of the pond would be comfortable with.

And since they have proven they can sell every single unit they produce 
at that price, there's just no point in bringing it to the US to have 
them sit on a lot and lose $$$ on.

Happy Trails,
