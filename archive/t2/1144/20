Subject: Re: [T2] Loss Power and Stalling at Idle

Based on what you describe, you may try turning the adjust screw at the end 
of the accelerator linkage that sits on a series of descending steps when 
the choke is on clockwise and extending its length.  It sounds like your 
engine is OK when this screw is holding the carburetor partially open, but 
doesn't hold idle after you step on the accelerator  allowing the screw to 
come off a higher step.

This is not the proper way to adjust an idle but should work until you get a 
chance to do a proper adjust of the fuel and air mixtures or have someone do 
it for you.

Cheers,

and idle fine.
However, as soon I exercise the gas pedal it loses idle and stalls. .
