Subject: Re: [T2] Another VW Bus Concept Vehicle

  I want to sit down with the head managers of VW and say:  "look guys, 
this isn't complicated.  Get yourself a hotshot, young, hip designer.  
Tell him or her to design a modern Splittie keeping the SPIRIT and 
personality of the original.  Like they did with the BMW mini.  Modern, 
hip, retro 50's surfer microbus.    With a two piece windshield."

And.....it should not end up looking like some hideous, futuristic troop 
transporter.

Just my .02 cents
