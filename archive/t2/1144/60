It's already here, called the Caddy.  Available in Europe in
two wheelbases, and both as a panel van, Kombi, or "Life", which
is more like a passenger car.  The Caddy Kombi is a real Kombi
in the old-VW-Bus sense: bare metal inside, rubber floor and all.

All versions are available with zero, one, or two sliding doors,
and either a tailgate hinged at the top or double cargo doors
on the rear end.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Ermel.
