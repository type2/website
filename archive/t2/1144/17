Subject: Re: [T2] Loss Power and Stalling at Idle

One more thing I noticed when I was out checking the idle solenoid 
and ignition connections:  when the bus has been sitting for a bit, it may start 
and idle fine.
However, as soon I exercise the gas pedal it loses idle and stalls.  If start it 
back up I may be able to get it to hold idle on it's own after I coddle the 
throttle.  However, I don't really have time for that nor can I hear well enough 
under normal driving conditions.
