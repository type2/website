I accidentally shorted power from the switched accessory line from the fusebox.
 Now, when the ignition is on I have no radio, turn signals, oil pressure
warning light, alternator light.   

Here's the odd thing--all the fuses are intact although a test lamp shows power
going through the red fuses only.

Probably a simple explanation but I'm stumped!
