Subject: Re: [T2] Loss Power and Stalling at Idle

I have a fague recolection that someone may have mentioned this, so forgive me
if you already addressed this.  I had very similar issues with a beetle,
turned out it was debris clogging the screen on the fuel tank outlet - let
just enough gas thru to start it and would run after I let it sit, but would
cause the engine to stall/lose power after running for a bit.  Even let gas
flow when I pulled the tank hose, but I noticed after a bit the flow would
slow and then stopped when the tank was almost empty and the grime became
concentrated.
