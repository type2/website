Subject: Great Time at Bus BRR Last Weekend

Hey, Volks:

We had 16 buses at Pokagon State Park and raised some money for the Phoenix
Society for Burn Survivors!  Had some snow on Saturday afternoon, but all
clear after that.  Great Jambalaya, good people and lots of fun!  See some
pictures here: https://picasaweb.google.com/pnoceanwesty/BusBRRR2011#

You can also check out Buses by the Beach Facebook.

Can't wait to see everyone at Bus Benefit over Memorial Day Weekend!
