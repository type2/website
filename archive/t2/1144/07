Subject: Bus for Sale - Tucson, AZ

Hey everyone,
I've been off list for a couple years now (too busy) but I have returned now
for the sad task of selling my bus.  I love my '79 but I've never driven it as
much as it deserves to be driven and, what with the other cars in the stable,
there's little likelihood that that will change any time soon.  It is time for
someone else to have this one.

I've watched my daughter grow in this vehicle.  She was 4 when we got it and
is 10 now.  Some of our finest camping trips were in "The Bus" and she's
learned all sorts of interesting mechanic tricks (as well as some interesting
expletives, I imagine) helping me work on it over the years.  I am truly sad
to see it go.

The bus is located in Tucson, Arizona.  If you're interested, please feel free
to email me directly.

You can read all at the following craigslist post.

Thank you very much.
