Subject: Re: [T2] Another VW Bus Concept Vehicle

Actually, that "ugly long nose" in a FWD van means that the floor is LOW and
FLAT all the way to the back.  IMHO a great idea.  In Europe and Australasia,
panel vans of this type fill many of the delivery/utility van roles. They also
fill the "go to the beach and surf with sleeping in the back" role, not so
much of that in Europe ;). Drive like cars, get the fuel economy of cars, have
the comfort of cars, take up the space of cars, instead of clumsy, V8 powered
( dare I say it flat 4 under-powered?), box vans.  What's not to like about
that.  For larger volumes the Sprinter/Transit etc vans with turbo diesels are
available.  I have never understood why panel vans never returned to the
market here in the US as the price of gas rose. Even the "gasp" PT Cruiser was
a natural panel van but Chrysler never took that route.  As much as anything,
I think that tribe of vehicles pushed out the air-cooled Type 2 in Europe;
more comfortable, easier to drive,
 faster for less fuel, more economical maintenance, better heat, and enough
volume with a utility floor.  Since VW already brings in the base vehicle, it
should not be to hard to get the vehicle to meet DOT specs.  I for one, having
just finished a 9000 mile round trip( AK-Canada-CA) commute this winter, would
love a TDI 4Motion Caddy (even if I lost some of the flat floor space with
4Motion).
