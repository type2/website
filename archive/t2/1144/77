I rented one of the Mecedes/Westfalia Marco Polos for 5 weeks in Europe a
few years ago. What an awesome van. Very comfortable, sipped diesel, and
with a 6 speed, let me cruise at 100mph. My wife and I took it all over
Switzerland, France and Italy, with a little Germany thrown in. Wish I could
get one here...
