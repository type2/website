Subject: Re: [T2] Loss Power and Stalling at Idle

For the most part, the drive home went as expected. While heading out of the 
village I had to play with the throttle at stops to keep the engine running. 
Under way, it seemed to run OK although a bit lumpy at low RPM. Out of the 
village I got to some open road and was going to get cruising at about 60mph. 
However, I never got there. Somewhere a bit north of 50mph the engine began to 
stumble link had happened in the morning. The engine began to fade and I could 
not keep power up even after down shifting to keep the revs up. 

I had to pull over and stop. I waited a few minutes, then started it back up. It 
still wouldn't hold an idle as before, but I decided to press on and try to get 
home. So got back on the road and made it to queue at the next intersection and 
I coddled the throttle to keep it running through that. I joined the main road 
nd started getting up to speed and just as before, I lose power after running up 
and over 50mph.

So here's the current symptoms:
	* The engine might hold an idle when started from cold
	* The engine will not hold an idle when warm or after the accelerator pedal had 
ben exercised.
	* Power drops off after reaching 50+ mph and will decrease until stall.
	* After sitting for few minutes after dying at speed, it will start up and be 
drivable (but still not holding idle) until I hit 50+ mph again.

I called the garage that had just serviced the bus on Friday. They were 
scratching their heads. However, I have to give them credit as they sent a 
trailer to come collect my bus and bring it back to their shop after hours. 
Hopefully, they'll have an answer sometime tomorrow.
