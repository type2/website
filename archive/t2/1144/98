Subject: Re: [T2] CNN feature on VW Micro bus

Well said, Mike 

HUH?!?!  How is it an update?  It doesn't look anything like the bus. 
If someone said the Eurovan was an update of the classic bus, it would 
be a little bit more believable because it's essentially an update of 
the Vanagon, which is an update of the loaf.  But to just create a 
minivan and call it an update of the bus is just stupid.
