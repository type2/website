Subject: Re: [T2] Loss Power and Stalling at Idle

my first thought is... dropped valve seat.....  check the compression or a
vacuum gauge
,, then i would check dwell...and timing,, but I doubt that.

The vac might show a hose that came loose ,, and that would cause stall at
idle..

your comments sooooo describe a dropped valve seat....
