A bit off topic, but we moved here from Baltimore.  My wife and went to 
universities in Baltimore, then met as neighbors, married and moved over to Ol' 
Blighty!

Whereabouts are you in Baltimore?
I never really paid attention to older VW's much before we moved over here, so 
it would be interesting to go back and see what the scene is like in the 
mid-Atlantic area.
