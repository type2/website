Subject: Door needs shoulder to open! 71 t2

Why do I start these things? Well it is a lovely sunny fresh day here  
and warming up :-) and the speedo work is done.

Drivers side door is hard to open from inside. I have the panel off,  
everything seems lined up.  Keys work, everything from outside works  
fine.

It is the inside trigger that does not release quite enough, so to  
open I need to shove with my shoulder - fed up with that!

There is a loose black plastic piece around all the stuff  just  
inside the door lock.

Is there a diagram (sorry, no bentley) , that shows what should be  
where?

appreciate someone helping with diagram so I can fix and drive away asap
