Take all of the fuses out and test them individually using a continuity 
tester to make sure they're actually working.  Testing if there is 
voltage on one side or another when they're in the fusebox isn't that 
good of a test because voltage could be coming from other places.  I had 
a fuse that looked intact, but it was actually cracked and was not 
passing current.
