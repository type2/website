Subject: Loss Power and Stalling at Idle

For reference, I have a '79 Bay window with a 1600 DP engine. 009 distributor 
with stock Solex carb.

I was coming into work today cruising nicely at 60 mph.
Suddenly the engine began to stumble a bit and there was (and remains) a slight 
loss of power. It also stalls at idle which means I have to play with the 
accelerator pedal when coming to stops to keep it running.

Is this a fuelling problem?

Also, I just picked the bus up from a service on Friday. Halfway down the road I 
get a call from the garage telling they forgot to finish securing the leisure 
battery! There were some wood shims securing the battery. One of the shims 
escaped and probably bounced around the engine bay. Not sure if this could have 
knocked something important or not. It did put a small hole in the left pipe 
from the fan shroud to the left heat exchanger, but I notice anything else.

I would take it back to the garage, but I won't be able to get there until 
Wednesday at the earliest.

Any help is appreciated.



Thanks,

Josh
