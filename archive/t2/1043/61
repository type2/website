Subject: Sliding door track cover

I took the sliding door track cover off my '72 and am now having trouble
re-installing it.

I have the tightening bar loose. I have a new
weatherstrip/gasket/seal/plastic bead thingy that goes between the cover and
the bus. I cant seem to get every thing to fit.  What is the order of these
3 Items -The seal, the tightener, and the cover.  From outside in I am
guessing it is tightener, cover, then seal seal.  But i just can't seem to
get it to go on.  Any tips or do I have something mixed up.

Thanks
