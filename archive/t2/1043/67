Subject: Gauge placement in headliner near rear view mirror?

Hi all,

I have a 78 Bus, but I have a wood headliner from an older bus. I'm thinking
about where to mount a couple of guages and was thinking about cutting a hole
in the middle of the headliner above the rearview mirror and mounting them
there.

Has anyone done this? Any suggestions, or better, pics :-)  ?

Thanks!
