Subject: Vintage Meet Almost here!

The Vintage VW Weekend is fast approaching!  July 18th,
19th, and 20th (Seattle, WA).

As usual, friday night we will kick things off with the Burger Meat.
University Village Burgermaster.

Saturday is the NW Vintage VW Show - this is just about the best
Vintage VW show around.  This year we will raffle off a very nice '69
beetle (and tons of other great VW items).  Also, The Tall Boys will
be playing - they are a great old time string band (check them out:
http://thetallboys.com/ ).  Otis will be back again with his amazing
BBQ!  If you need parts you will surely find them in our huge swap
area.

This year we have a new sunday event - the Old Snohomish VW Event for
all Air-cooled VWs. Hosted by Autopia. 9am to 3pm. 215 Cedar St
Snohomish, WA 98290.  It will be a show with a swap area, and a german
sausage BBQ.

Also, saturday night there will be another new addition to the weekend
- Vinnie's Bus campout.  Same Snohomish location as the sunday event.

It is going to be one heck of a vintage vw extravaganza - don't miss out!
