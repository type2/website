Subject: towing a bus

I know it's been covered in the archives and library, but I still wanted to
run this by the collective wisdom of the list and and also ask for some help
from someone with a late bay and a tape measure handy.
I haven't had an aircooled bus for a few years now (I've got an '00 Eurovan),
but I just bought a '79 last week off ebay. I have to go pick it up and tow it
home. The engine has a problem with cylinder #2, so the bus likes to stall
out. Other that that, it's a daily driver and all the running gear is in good
shape. It's a manual. I purchased this:

Basically a bumper mount adustable tow bar. I found a posting where a guy used
a similar setup to tow a bus from WA to OR. I will be towing it around 100
miles.
So I don't think that the holes in the tow bar flat stock match up to the
holes in my bumper and I was thinking that I could:
Remove front bumper.
Purchase length (?) of steel and drill holes in it to mount it where the
bumper would go,
Drill four more holes in it to attach the tow bar mounting screws.
 
I don't have a late model loaf anywhere near me to measure where I would drill
the holes in the steel to mount it where the bumper would go, so I was
wondering if someone could measure this for me and send me an email with the
measurements.
 
I will, of course, secure the bus with safety chains and dive very slowly and
carefully,
 
Thoughts, comments, or suggestions are welcome.
Thanks,
Joel in Philly
