Hi Steve

seeing as you already suspect a valve problem,,, you might want to do a
compression test on that cyl .... if you find the compression low.. then you
will want to find out some more data before you pull the engine to do
repairs. If the other cyl have low compression,, you might be in for new P&C
as well as head work...

once you have determined that the engine is healthy in the valve seat area,,
you can look at the cam / valve train ,, and you might find a worn cam lobe.

I suspect that with the SAE SL oil problem,, that camshafts will be a
problem area now.

hope that helps
