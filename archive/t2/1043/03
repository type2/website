Subject: Securing Fuel Pump, 77 Bus

I'm installing a new fuel pump in my 77 bus, fuel injection.
The old pump is
the factory original, from what I can tell.
The new pump is an exact copy, BUT
Not an exact fit, it appears the old pump had some type of asbestos ring under
the clamp that hold it to the body, this stuff is white, and falling apart,

The clamp when tightened all the way up, leaves the fuel pump loose, you can
slide it back forth !
I temporarily solved this by loosening the clamp, taking
a peice of fuel line, splitting it lengthwise and putting it under the clamp
and retighting it.  But something tells me this may not be a good thing, if
the old stuff was asbestos, does it get hot ?  Will a peice of fuel line melt
?  What should i use ?
Anybody have any suggestions who has done this, or is
my problem unique ?

thanks
