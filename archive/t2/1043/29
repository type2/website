Howdy,

Finally got the heads thursday afternoon. Spent thursday evening and
friday morning installing the new p/c's and heads, then reassembling
the intake, exhaust, tinware, etc.

All in all everything went quite smoothly except engine
re-installation which was difficult because my floor-jack keep sinking
into the soil.

The engine is running strong now, and I've been keeping it to strictly
50 and under for this section of my trip across the continental
divide. In Casper WY tonight, making the final leg of the journey west
tomorrow. Then a few weeks in the Bridger-Teton national forest before
turning back around and heading east.

I expect the trip home to go much easier on the engine, at least
between here and the Missouri, which is mostly downhill, and perhaps a
tailwind the whole way down.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my cries for help, your responses
were invaluable for helping me keep my sanity while stranded alone and
far away from home.

peace
