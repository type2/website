As I recall, the bolt holding the pump to the body is rubber mounted to 
prevent chassis vibration?

The fuel pump gets hot, but not hot enough to need asbestos.  I suspect 
the asbestos (or whatever it is) was used as a vibration damper, maybe 
to prevent fuel pump noise from being transmitted through the chassis 
into the interior.  Maybe they used asbestos because it was cheap?
