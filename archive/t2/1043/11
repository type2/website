Subject: 72 wire harness

As I mentioned to Paul, I'm cutting up a 72. I like to keep original wiring
bits because of the ability to use correct color coded wire for replacements.
To this end I havent cut any wires yet instead cutting the metal around them.
So my question is, is someone interested in buying a factory wire harness for
a 72. Cant tell you how much or when at this point, just want to know if
theres any interest. If there is I'll continue to make sure all the wires
remain uncut.
