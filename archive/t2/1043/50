While I've thought about using the remote starter method, I think it has 
some inherent dangers and would take longer.  First, I'd be freaked out 
that I'd hit the wrong post when clipping the thing on and run the 
starter while I'm under the car.  I'd have to do like 3 paranoia runs to 
the front of the car to make sure it's out of gear.  In that time I'd 
have both valve covers off and already have the rotor at #1.  Checking 
the valves is probably faster with the 1/3 method as you can do 4 valves 
at one time instead of 1 at a time.  Then rotating to #3 position is 
pretty trivial and then it's the next four and your done.  I'd say it's 
safer and faster to do it this way than a remote starter method.. but I 
haven't timed it, so I wouldn't really know for sure..
