Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Situation Resolved

I'm facing the same break-in situation as Jules. If one has done only 
a top-end rebuild, then seating the rings is the goal. I'm still 
looking for a web site that addresses this explicitly. Going up a 
hill in third and fourth gear to raise the temperature seems to be 
the recommendation, although the various web sites don't always agree.
But to me this sounds a lot like lugging the engine, which is never good.
