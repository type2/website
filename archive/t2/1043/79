Subject: Backfiring ... I've done more harm than good

Hi Everybody:

I've been lurking and reading and learning a lot but now I have a question.

Coming back from camping over the weekend my '74 dual carb Westy was really struggling going up
those long gradual hills.  It also seemed to be running a little louder than usual.  So I figured
I'd check & adjust the valves. #3 was terrrrribly loose, and tightening it almost took all of the
adjusting screw.  Something seems wrong but I don't know enough to really say what.  

I also changed the spark plugs, which were very black and sooty looking.

The bus now backfires when I let off the gas, just a bunch of little pops nothing too loud.  It
also idles very slow and almost seems like its going to die, but doesn't.  I'm afraid I've done
more harm than good.  The backfiring is the most noticeable thing.  

Might I have knocked something loose?  What might be causing the backfiring?

Thanks,
Steve
