Subject: EGR Valve Diaphragm Replacement?

It's smog time again... and the rubber (?) diaphragm inside the mechanical EGR valve on my '78 Westy is full of holes and leaking. I understand new valves are NLA, and I've bought "reconditioned" ones before, but the diaphragm looked like a piece of old inner tubing, and didn't last very long.

My question is - has anyone found a creative way to re-manufacture a replacement for this diaphragm? I need a flexible material that is already molded into a similar shape (something flat, but with a small "dome" molded in it), and it needs to withstand the heat of the  exhaust gases. Anyone found "just the right thing" for sale somewhere (finger cut from a rubber glove, perhaps?? ;-)

Alternatively, if someone is hoarding a stash of new EGR valves, I'd be interested in negotiating a purchase...

Cheers
