Subject: Re: 9-pin replacement relay wiring

Jon asked: I had to re-install my WolfsBurg West 9-pin flasher relay and lost
mydirections (and didn't write down the schematic when I removed it).   I'm
pretty good with VW electrical systems, but I can't get the darn thingto work.
I am getting all four turn signals blinking at once.   I think Jim Thompson
wrote a tutorial on AirheadParts.com, but all I see isone for a Type 3.   Does
anyone have the directions or a tutorial on how to wire it for a '68
T2harness? Jim perhaps?
