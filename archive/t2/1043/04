Subject: [Q] Maintenance Schedule for '71 Westie

Group-

When my '71 Westie is restored, I'll want/need a maintenance schedule.  I'm
aware of the "Official Service Manual", but haven't looked at it.  Is it
the best guide for maintaining a bus?

I'll be very interested in preventative maintenance, and my experience has
been that sometimes a home-brew solution is best.
