Hey Jules,I have two 1971's....The valves will need to be re-adjusted(Cold) in
300 miles or before and a oil changed by 500 miles...glad to know you are "On
The Road Again"...have a blast on that Road Trip...Tony

Jules,

Great advice from Anthony Hopkins about the valve adjustments and oil changes.
As your rings, pistons and cylinders break in there will be lots of fine metal
floating areound in your oil, and after 300 miles you need to get it out and
get fresh oil in.  Also your new valves are gonna settle in and the adjustment
will change, so re-adjust them at 500 as Anthony said.  Stay on top of that
stuff... and have a great time on your journey.  You are now a lot more
intimate with your bus, you take care of her, she'll take care of you.
