	This is a good opportunity to run it in.
	During running-in, what matters much more than simple rpm is 
refraining from labouring (lugging).   Keeping a close eye on any 
temp indicators that you may have, but anyhow keeping a close feel on 
friction in the motor, let it spin up as it becomes willing to do. 
This way the rings etc bed in fully.  You run it in fast, you get a 
fast motor (provided that you don't seize it).
	Congrats Jules.

Peace bro
