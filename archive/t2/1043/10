After I'd posted my note on EP gear oils, a moneyed truculent asserted:

>  Don't know why sump oil can't be used in transmissions.

	Since this has been posted to all, I suppose I'd better send 
to the list most of my response:

		I just told you why.  It can be used, but wear will be faster.
		The handful of transmissions you've experienced has 
very little significance compared with the very large numbers of 
actual failures, of measured wear rates (atomic arc spectra in oil 
sampled over time), etc. in EP development over many decades.
		Some mfrs (Honda, Isuzu) are reported to say sump oil 
is OK for their gearboxes.   I can't account for that.  Ask them!
		I failed to credit properly, in that version I sent, 
a former student of mine who works for a major oil co.  I also happen 
to have a real live tribologist buddy.
		It is not reasonable for an evidently authoritative 
article to be challenged on the basis of a handful of cars.  Even if 
it is Friday!

		The longevity of a given gearbox may be an indication 
that EP additives can, in some conditions, last fairly well over a 
few decades.  Certainly, all the gearoils at the factory, and I trust 
all the 1000 km dealers' first & only change, will have been EP 
gearoils.

	So my punchline is: use EP (probably 90), and change every, 
oh, say, half-decade?
