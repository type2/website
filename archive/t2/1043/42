Subject: Re: [T2] Towing a bus info? Someone please help

I have one of those tow bar setups I used to tow my Cabrio.

The arms likely won't reach far enough apart to grab the bolt holes for 
the bumper.  I'm not sure how you would be able to bolt it up even if 
you drill.  You would need some long bolts to go all the way though the 
bumper mount.

I would rent a tow dolly.
