they won't fill without the engine running - they need oil pumped into 
them.  So back them off and then run the engine and then test them again 
- this is if you find soft ones, of course.  If there are no soft ones, 
then just adjust your valves and then adjust everything else per a 
normal tuneup.  Out of tune valves, especially when they're too tight, 
will definitely cause problems.  I have solid valves and I can tell when 
they need adjustment because usually the exhaust valves are tight and 
after readjustment, the bus runs great again.
