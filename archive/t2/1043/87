Subject: 9-pin replacement relay wiring

I had to re-install my WolfsBurg West 9-pin flasher relay and lost my
directions (and didn't write down the schematic when I removed it).

 

I'm pretty good with VW electrical systems, but I can't get the darn thing
to work. I am getting all four turn signals blinking at once.

 

I think Jim Thompson wrote a tutorial on AirheadParts.com, but all I see is
one for a Type 3.

 

Does anyone have the directions or a tutorial on how to wire it for a '68 T2
harness? Jim perhaps?
