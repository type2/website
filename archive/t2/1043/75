James.. I hope your email addy doesn't bounce this...

If you haven't replaced your wheel bearings in the last 50,000 kms... go out
and buy both sides.. and install them. you can get the wheel bearings and
grease seals at your local bearing store.. probably right off the shelf.. or
,, try your flaps.. and ask them if they buy from Altrom... as I bet they
have them on the shelf... if you go to the dealer.. my experience was 2
weeks delivery in the maritimes... and 4x the price.

Then.. if you still have this issue...  then rotate your tires.... don't
count out having more than 1 bad tire... even if they look good.

check the date code and mfg of your tires..  if they are over their specs...
then get new ones..

Hope that helps !
