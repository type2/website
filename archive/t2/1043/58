When I put the new seals on my '75 I also put the flap on the  
inside.  It seemed to fit better that way, and it looked like the  
seals were put on that way in the Brazilian Bay pics I had around ..  
though with as grainy as the pictures were when I zoomed in that much  
it's hard to say.  I *did* initially try putting them on the other  
way (flap on outside), but that was before I looked at pictures ..  
and they didn't fit worth a damn either.

They seal just fine the way they are, whether or not it's technically  
correct.
