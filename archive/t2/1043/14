Subject: RE: [T2] Rewiring '72 main harness

Chuck:
	Thanks for the insight, you are correct, the only way to get the
harness out of the engine compartment is with cutters.  A few questions
about replacing this harness (to whoever has the answers):

Is there any reason to keep the diagnostic plug?  Mine has been heavily
modified anyway.

The harness leaves the engine compartment and goes into an open void
behind the wheel, hard to get to, need the tire off and good jackstands
because you have to wrestle with it.  Something in there may be
connected?

My next step is too remove/replace the harness through the void under
the cargo area.  Apparently on the sunroof vans, they put an extra plate
under the cargo area for strength (Thanks Paul Manning for that info)and
this creates a void the harness runs all the way through from back to
front.  I am hoping this is not going to be a nightmare to get through.

Does anyone feel I need factory grommets to line the frame holes or will
off the shelf be OK?

Thanks. This group is really helpful to us beginners and you are all
greatly appreciated.  Joe and Airic have been a lot of help also.
