Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Maintenance Schedule for '71 Westie

My original 1970 transmission was rebuilt in the early 80's about 60,000 
miles ago. Not proud of it nor do I recommend it but I have not changed oil 
since the rebuild 25 years ago.

Don't know why sump oil can't be used in transmissions. I believe my 94 
Isuzu Trooper specifies regular sump oil in the transmission and rear axle 
and GL5 in the transfer case (or vice-versa). I recall my son's Honda 
motocross bikes used 30w in the transmissions. Think 30 wt sump oil equates 
to 90 w gear oil in viscosity.

I have a 356 Porsche vintage race car and have had the transmission apart 
for repairs several times in the past 8 years. Some of  the old Porsche guys 
will use only GL4 or very expensve Swepco gear lube. I use off-the-shelf GL5 
80-90 even though gear sets for this transmission are unbelievably 
expensive.

When my '71 Westie is restored, I'll want/need a maintenance schedule.  I'm
aware of the "Official Service Manual", but haven't looked at it.  Is it
the best guide for maintaining a bus?

I'll be very interested in preventative maintenance, and my experience has
been that sometimes a home-brew solution is best.

 One odd aspect of the official VW instructions, at least in
 the 1972 owners' Instruction Manual booklet, is the advice (p. 36)
 that the 3.5 litre of gearbox/final drive oil needs to be changed
 'only at 1000 km', implying that it need be changed never again
 (except at transmission overhaul).
 I can't attach as a M$W .doc file, and therefore slap below
 as txt, an article on gearbox oils, originally pubd in a 
classic-motorcycles magazine but making the main points for T2
 gearboxes.  If any indulgence is needed for this non-VW material, I
 claim Fridayitis.
 The main point of my article is that sump oils are  *NOT  OK*
 in transmissions.  Not everyone realises this!
 The next point is: the idea that the extreme-pressure
 additives in the gearbox will last quite OK for several decades is
 not to be trusted.  Water can condense into that oil, in some
 circumstances, and most if not all BigOilKorp EP oils will then
 emulsify, which degrades their performance.  Prudent preventative
 maintenance, which David is rightly keen on, will include changing
 the transmission oil every so often.  The factory's confident
 assertion that you need change it only at 1000 km and never again is,
 I believe, not to be trusted.  The expense of changing every (say)
 20,000 km is minor, and the savings could be large in delaying
 transmission rebuilds.

 That leaves us with the question HOW  OFTEN.  All I'm
 asserting for the moment is: more often than every 3 decades.
