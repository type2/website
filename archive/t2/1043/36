Subject: RE: [T2] Towing a bus info? Someone please help

78 loaf

about 52" from outer bolt to outer bolt, little less than 5 inches between
bolts. those are small bolts, can you really use them to pull a bus?

About measurement due to bumper guard in place, as one piece would not cover
them both.

100 miles is drivable on 2 cylinders.  :)



I don't have a late model loaf anywhere near me to measure where I would
drill
the holes in the steel to mount it where the bumper would go, so I was
wondering if someone could measure this for me and send me an email with the
measurements.
