Subject: oxygen sensor testing?

Hi, could someone please explain how some of you test your fuel mixture 
with an oxygen sensor?  What do I all need to buy?
I'm driving a '77 WESTY 2.0L F.I.  all stock. But I keep having trouble 
with the fuel mixture going very rich. I have replaced the head temp. 
sensor twice. I keep bring it in to a shop and he opens up the AFM and 
makes the appropriate adjustments and it's good  for a while but it's 
starting to get expensive to keep bringing it in to a shop. I can't 
afford to buy a new AFM and would like to know how I can check the fuel 
mixture myself without an expensive gas analyzer.
Thanks in advance,
Bernie
