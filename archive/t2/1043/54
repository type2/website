Subject: Exhaust noise found, new problems ensue

When we last left the old 75 it was running but with signs of massive
exhaust leaks.  Nothing seemed to move or be loose or damaged when I
inspected it.  I decided to just take everything off starting with the rear
muffler because it looked easiest and see what I could find.  
 
Once I removed the mullfer to exchanger bolts and the bracket bolts, it
became clear why it was loud.  The muffler to exchanger joint on the
passenger side was broken off flush, as was the exchanger to rear U pipe
joint on the drivers side.  It was all held rigid by the brackets and
tension on the pipes as installed but it was totally open in two places,
probably separated when the engine was on.  
 
So now I know why it's loud but I have some new things to deal with.  I'm
assuming I can't "repipe" the exchangers which is a shame because otherwise
they are solid.  On my upright engined bugs,i remember when the heat
exchangers were toast people straight piped instead, I think someone made
pipes for this purpose because it was so common.  Can I do this with the FI
bus?  I realize I give up heat but this is a toy and it won't be out in the
snow.  Plus, I think eliminating the funky pipe in the exchanger in favor of
a typical round pipe might be better from a mpg and performance perspective.

 
Comments and/or directions on where to find what I need?  I didn't see these
pipes in the Parts Place catalog and they usually have quite a bit.  I can't
be the first guy in the world this has happened to. 
 
As always, thanks in advance.
 
Joe
