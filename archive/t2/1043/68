Subject: Re: [T2] Where to mount a Full Flow oil Filter on 1971 Bus?

My case is drilled and tapped for Full Flow oil filtering...Now before I build the bracket to hold the filter mount....Where have others put the filter?..In the engine compartment?..or down stairs where the road debris can get to it?....I have dual Kad's I must dodge...and no extra battery on left bank on engine compartment...I will have AN fittings and S/S Hydraulic hoses pressed at local Rubber hose shop...Thanks for the people who have been there...Tony
