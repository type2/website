Even if you drill the holes in advance, they might not line up properly. 
  I think that is the point Bob was trying to make.

I assume you will be using *at least* 3/16" thick 2" angle (not flat) 
for the bracket.  Preferably 1/4".  Do yourself a favor regardless of 
where you drill the holes in the bracket - go back to Harbor Freight and 
get a set of these step drill-bits:

They will cut through the thick mild steel like a hot knife through 
butter.  Well worth the $10 (that's only $2 per kid, times minutes 
saved!).  You will need a good (minimum 18V) cordless drill or a 120V 
drill for this job.

So I was hoping to do as much of the work as possible before I get there, so as not to keep my kids waiting for over an hour for me to fabricate a tow bar and hook it all up...
