When they make noise, it usually means they aren't pumped up.  Take off 
your valve cover and with a screwdriver, press on the knurled bottom of 
the rocker arm and feel which lifters are soft and which are hard - make 
note of that.  Then let the car cool overnight and then adjust those out 
to 0.006 - this will allow the lifters to fully open and let oil in and 
pump up.  Run the car for a little bit and then pull the covers off and 
feel the lifters again.  If they're hard, adjust them to 1.5 turns (3 * 
180 degrees) past contact.  If they're still soft, they may be worn or 
not bleeding out and may need some further tweaking/priming.

consensus is 1.5 turns past contact.  When you loosen it doesn't make a 
difference.  Also, I'm assuming your turning the crank counterclockwise 
which makes the rotor turn counterclockwise as you move from cylinder to 
cylinder?

a turn is 360, half is 180
