Subject: Brake Light Wiring

A different question.

 

I have a '79 booster and master cylinder on my '68. Anyone know how to wire
in a '68 harness?

 

Should I replace the brake switches with two-prong units or can I still use
the three prong units?

 

And yes, it was working until I unplugged it and didn't write down how I did
it (he said sheepishly).
