Subject: Taking Interstate 12 from Pasco to Missoula

In order to get off the slab I-90, we thought we'd take the I-12 between Pasco
Wa, and Missoula Montana for a change. I've never taken it, so was wondering
if anyone could enlighten me as to what to see, if it's worthwhile, etc. etc.
Good stops along the way for food or sights? Any negatives?
Thanks,
Courtney
