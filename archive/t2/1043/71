Subject: Can some one send me a pic of where their visor clips mount on

My single cab has been more or less restored now, and the new headliner is
in...however i have no idea where to mound the visor clips.  If anyone can
email me a pic of theirs, and possible measure the distance from the outside
edge of the rear view mirror to where the screw hole is, that would be great.
