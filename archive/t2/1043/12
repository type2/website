Just do what I did and hot-wire it :D
I snapped my key off in a loading zone, so I had two options: Get across the
city, grab the spare and come back or hotwire it and get the heck out of
there before I got a ticket. Luckily I had my Bentley in the bus, so I
figured out which wires to cut and away I went. Of course, with no key, the
steering wheel lock engaged as I was driving. I guess I learned my lesson!
