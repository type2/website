Subject: High Country Bus Festival July 24-27

Hi folks,
Things have worked out for the better after last years fiasco at High Country Bus Festival. HCBF has found a new home and our hosts
Angie and Peyton Colvard of Twin Rivers Family Campground are excited to have us. I have updated the website
<http://www.highcountrybusfestival.com/> http://www.highcountrybusfestival.com and can't wait until the last weekend of July! 


The Campground is on the NEW RIVER (they say it's one of the oldest rivers in the world(?)), and pretty much all the campsites are
on the NEW RIVER!! Again, Recreation opportunities galore!!! Fishing, tubing, paddling, hiking, biking, sun tanning, Frisbee,
snorkel, bocce ball, to name a few. This section of the New River is probably 75 to 100 ft. wide, yet it is very friendly and
refreshing. 

There is no need for reservations.  HCBF has the whole campground reserved. The majority of the sites are in an open field (less
privacy) section, in the sun (bring shade!), along the river, and closer to the bathhouse. There are primitive sites that are closer
to a shoaly section of the river and under a cool canopy of trees. The campground sells and will deliver both ice and firewood to
your site and has inner tubes for rent.


The campground is very close to the NC/VA. border. Just north of the campground is where the North Fork of the New River and the
South Fork of the New River confluence. At that point, the river gets bigger, deeper, and slower. Then there is a dam, then some FUN
sections of shoals to paddle, swim, snorkel, and fish. Here is a link to the maps of the New River in VA.

out! The campground isn't to far off the beaten path from society, only 15 mins. to Jefferson/West Jefferson and all your modern day
conveniences. 

The band on Saturday Night is going to be some energizing bluegrass, UPRIGHT and BREATH IN!
