Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic valve adjustment help

I went out to give the valves another look this morning.  The engine was
nice and cool from sitting overnight.  I popped of the valve covers and made
sure the adjusters were loosened up.  All the lifters were hard as a rock.
As I reset the valves I discovered what my problem had been this whole
time.... there were a couple of pushrods not completely seated in the rocker
arms.  I made sure that each pushrod was properly seated before I did the
adjustment.  I followed everyone's advice on adjustments from there
on (minus the remote starter - sorry Karl, I'm not man enough for that
yet!) and got them all set properly.  When I started it up it clattered for
about 5 seconds then quieted right down.  Music to the ears!  The timing was
a little off so I adjusted that, took it out around the block a few times,
checked the timing again - it was spot on, set the idle to about 950rpm and
cleaned up.

I feel pretty foolish about not catching the seating of the pushrods, rookie
move - but now I know for the future.  I just hope I didn't bend any
pushrods in the process!  I figure I would hear it if I did.  At least I
think now with this experience I could confidently pull the rockers off and
change the pushrods if I had to.

Thanks to the list for the advice!
