Subject: Pictures and video from June Jitterbug - Niagara Falls Ontario

Hey Guys,
I have uploaded a few pictures from the June Jittergbug last weekend
in Niagara Falls Ontario.
As always it was a perfect day.  Lots more vans are
showing up.
Please add any shots to this collection at the LiMBO site:

Also I took a video of
the Bus trying to do the clutch eater.
It is public on YouTube at the
