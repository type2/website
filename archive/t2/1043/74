Usually bad bearings sound like a dull hum that gets louder as you go 
faster - not sure why it's getting worse when you brake,.  You might 
want to check your brakes to see what's up.  What year is your bus?  Do 
you have disk or drums?

I've done the bearing change on the my 78 and it's not that bad.  You 
just need a set of drifts (or screwdrivers) and some kinda mandrel and a 
vice to press the bearings back in.  I actually used the old bearings 
that I pressed out, ground down the O.D. and used those to press in the 
new ones in the vice - worked great.
