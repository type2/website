Subject: New bus! Was: towing a bus

Volks,
yesterday as I was piling all the towing stuff in the back of my Eurovan to
pick up our new '79 9passenger in Baltimore, I noticed that part of the tow
bar that Harbor Freight sent me was missing! Son of a gun. Last thing, on a
whim, I took the liscense plate off my Toyota Corolla and brought it with us.
Good thing, too.
When I got to the bus, it had a bit more rust on it than the ebay pictures
showed (doesn't that always happen), but it was still in great shape,
especially the interior. The front bumper did NOT look like it was going to be
possible to attach the towbar to, especially with the missing pieces. So I
figured I would drive it home. But WAIT- there were NO TAGS! Seems that in
Maryland, you have to return the tags you don't use (?). At least that's what
the seller told me. Good thing I brought the tag from my Toyota (yes, I know
it's illegal, I was just worried about appearance of legality). The bus made
the two hour drive back to Philly without incident. A little underpowered
because of the "bad valve" in cylinder #2 (or so the seller told me), but
still cruised between 50 and 60 on the highway.
The kids love it and had fun riding back with me in it.
My plan is to convert this bus to a full electric vehicle, so that means
getting rid of the engine entirely. Anyone interested in buying a COMPLETE 2
liter FI engine with 111k miles on it? Leaks a little oil and will probably
need some work done to the top end, but it comes with ALL the FI stuff. Heck,
I don't even know what it is supposed to have, but I'm getting rid of it ALL.
Let me know if you are interested.
Joel in Philly
