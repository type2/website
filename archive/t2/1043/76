Subject: Bus Tripping--more trouble2

Thanks for the replies, sorry I was a bit vague in my previous posting.

My bus is a 75 Westy with 100,000 miles.

I'm from Ontario Canada.  I just drove to NFLD and am now back on Nova
Scotia on my way back to Ontario in about 2 weeks.

I'm going to have a look at the brakes...they took a real beating in NFLD
and on the Cabot Trail... long big hills!

Thanks again!
James
