A turn is 360 degrees. If your valves had been too tight, it may take a 
little bit of running before they pump up properly and quiet down. It 
happens faster at speed (more oil pressure).

Did you by chance notice how they were originally adjusted? When 
backing off on the adjuster, how many turns until it came free?
