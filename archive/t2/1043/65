Subject: [VB] Trip Report and Gas MPG

Just had a relatively uneventful trip to the Dayton, OH area this weekend in
Lily, my '67 Freedom camper.  The weather was WET which made it awfully nice
to be sleeping in the bus as opposed to camping in a tent.

Oil temps stayed around 220-230 F while cruising at 50-55 mph: higher than
I'd like, but something that I've come to be ok with.  Hopefully a shift to
15" rims will help this by bringing down the RPMS ... go go gadget Rubber
Gearing!

Averaged 23 mpg at these speeds - mostly highway but some country roads -
and over the course of 600 miles RT.

The good: 
1. Ran like a champ and no major issues.
2. Got the farthest I've ever gotten on a tank of gas: 250 miles (early bay
gas tank, but I don't ever top it off...fill to a max of ~11 gallons)

On road maintenance: adjusted timing for return trip - had gone from 7.5
BTDC to
~4-5 BTDC - and topped off oil and tire pressure (one tire has a slow leak).

The Bad: 
1. New front windshield seals aren't seated right, so I am still getting
some water leakage in heavy rains.

2. Brake pedal return spring seems to have broken again (last 10 miles of
trip), I need to pull the belly pan and take a look.  Maybe it's just a
matter of lubing the shaft (which I had to do for the clutch pedal.

3. Bus wouldn't start at supermarket after arriving back in town.  Suspect
battery is finally dead (it's lived a good long life).  Will pull battery,
check water levels, clean terminals, charge, and verify.  Symptoms: She was
a little slow to start after two days of camping (no radio use and minimal
interior light use).  This was after driving 4 hours at night to get to
camping area.  Ran without radio or anything for first two hours of return
trip but rain forced usage of headlights and wipers.  Battery was charged
before leaving on trip.

Historic Notables and Sights:

1. S-bridge on old National Highway over Fox Creek in OH.  This was the last
bridge of the National HWY to be bricked (1919).

2. Cumberland, OH looks to have been a thriving town.

3. The Wilds (are very far from the highway, but a beautiful drive - all the
GREEN!)

4. VW bone-yard near I-77/I-70 - would have stopped to investigate but the
next exit was too far away and we were already pointed home.

The Engine:

- 1600SP, SVA dizzy, Solex H30/31 carb, kool tin, type-iv oil cooler, DH fan
shroud

The Drivetrain: 185r14 tires, stock gearing

Keep on Bussing!
