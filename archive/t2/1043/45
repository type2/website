Subject: Towing a bus- resolved- thanks!

Well, after many emails this morning, I have come to the conclusion that I may
have to just drive the bus home behind my wife who's driving our Eurovan.
First, the magnetic tow lights that I ordered from Harbor Freight three weeks
ago still haven't arrived, so unless I wanted to wire the bus tail lights into
our Eurovan tail lights, towing it would be unsafe to drivers behind us.
Wiring the Eurovan lights into the bus tail lights is still a possibility, but
not my first choice. Secondly, the front of the '79 bus doesn't seem to lend
itself to being towed by the towbar I purchased, and I just don't have the
time (or a welder) to fabricate something.
Third, I don't want to rent something because, again, I don't have the time to
shop around for the best price and I can't stand spending money on it after I
already bought something that is supposed to work (the tow bar from Harbor
Freight). Fourth, the bus is in running condition and is/was a daily driver,
even with the engine problem. The owner swears I can drive it home and don't
need to tow it.
So what it looks like I'm going to do is bring all my tow stuff, a drill, some
bits and only use it if the bus doesn't make the drive from Baltimore to
Philly.
Someone north of me offered to lend me his bus tow bar, but that still doesn't
resolve the lights issue and the added time and gas to drive up to get the bus
tow bar would negate the gas savings from towing vs driving two cars back.
So thanks to ALL who responded and say a prayer for us tomorrow arond 6pm as
we begin again on the adventure of owning a bay window bus (this will be my
3rd, but I sold the other two a few years ago to buy our Eurovan).
Joel in Philly
