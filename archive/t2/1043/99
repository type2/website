Subject: What to do with it...

Hi All, 

In cleaning my garage I found an item I thought I'd lost.  

It's a "Pull To Eject Seat" handle from an F4 Phantom.  My dad brought
it back from Vietnam with him. (thankfully he never had to eject, but
there were times he thought it was probably a better idea than staying
in the plane while the pilot tried to land it...)

It needs cleaning, but is still in decent shape.  

I'm trying to find a home for it in the bus.  I'd thought about using it
to replace the grab-bar on the passenger side of the dash, but that
probably wouldn't look right.  So... I'm still trying to think of where
to install it.  

Passenger side door above the arm rest?  Dashboard just above the E
brake handle?  

Ideas appreciated!  (since I can't use it on the motorcycle now....
*sniff*)
