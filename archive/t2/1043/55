Subject: What is the correct position of the driver's door weatherstrip

I am dry fitting (before gluing permanently)a weatherstrip for the driver's
side door of my daughter's 1975 bay. I am not sure how it should be positioned
in the door channel. The weatherstrip has a small flap that looks like it
should fit over the outer edge of the channel. However, it also can easily be
stuffed inside the channel.

The following two pictures show the top forward corner of the door.

Flap on inside:    http://tinyurl.com/6gdsm7

The following picture is of the top center portion of the door right above the
window.
On the left side I have the flap over the edge of the channel and on the right
I have everything stuffed in the channel.

The weather strip is P/N 211831721D from the "Bus Depot".

I hope this post makes sense to someone!
