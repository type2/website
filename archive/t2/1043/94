Subject: RE: 9-pin replacement relay wiring

Karl,

 

I indeed reviewed the article. However, it doesn't take into account the
changes for the Wolfsburg West's unit.

 

But, Ron Bengry from WW sent me the instructions which cleared up a bunch of
questions.

 

It is somewhat solved, but I still have some chasing to do. Now the blinkers
don't work at all, but the emergency lights now work correctly.

Jon asked:
 
I had to re-install my WolfsBurg West 9-pin flasher relay and lost my
directions (and didn't write down the schematic when I removed it).



I'm pretty good with VW electrical systems, but I can't get the darn thing
to work. I am getting all four turn signals blinking at once.



I think Jim Thompson wrote a tutorial on AirheadParts.com, but all I see is
one for a Type 3.



Does anyone have the directions or a tutorial on how to wire it for a '68 T2
harness? Jim perhaps?
