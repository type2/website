The fuel pump gets hot, but not hot enough to need asbestos.  I suspect the asbestos (or whatever it is) was used as a vibration damper, maybe to prevent fuel pump noise from being transmitted through the chassis into the interior.  Maybe they used asbestos because it was cheap?

<SNIP>
I temporarily solved this by loosening the clamp, taking
a peice of fuel line, splitting it lengthwise and putting it under the clamp
and retighting it.  But something tells me this may not be a good thing, if
the old stuff was asbestos, does it get hot ?  Will a peice of fuel line melt
