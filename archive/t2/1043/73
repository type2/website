Subject: Bus Tripping--more trouble

We're now back in Nova Scotia and I think a front wheel bearing is going.
I know about these things on Golfs but not Type2s.  It sounds like the
left front to me and the sound is worst when I turn slightly left.  Goes
away when turning right or more left (at 70 km/hr).  It gets really bad
when I brake.

How does my diagnoses sound?

Thanks,
