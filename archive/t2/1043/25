Yeah, they may be hard already... double check and let us know the 
results.  When it's soft, you can pretty much push on them by hand.

Just so you know, you can only use the timing mark on the crank for 1 
and 3, not for 2 and 4.  A little trick - when you have the rotor 
pointing at the #1 firing position, you can adjust valves 1e, 1i, 2i, 4e 
(the front-most three on the passenger side and the rear-most one on the 
driver's) and when you have the rotor pointing at the #3 firing 
position, you can adjust valves 3e, 3i, 4i, 2e (the front-most three on 
the driver's side and the rear-most one on the passenger side)
