I remember seeing the bulb holders on chirco or cip1 (checks)....cip1 has
it.

VDO-600-802 is a pack of 4 bulbs
VDO-600-816 is a bulb socket
VDO-600-819 is a two post bulb socket (tach maybe?)

Not sure about the twist lock but I could use a 3 1/8 post lock for my
tach...twist lock is too thick for the spot.

CHT - Dakota Digital's tach??
