People's opinions may vary on this one, but I have had good luck with 
this process.  When you're breaking in you cylinders, make sure you do 
not drive the bus conservatively or at the same speed for a long period 
of time.  If you do, oil will glaze over the cylinders and then the 
rings won't seat properly.

When I rebuilt my engine, I did the initial 20minute breakin for the cam 
and bearings (which you don't have to do) and then drove it HARD.  Up 
and down hills, getting it really hot, constantly varying speed the 
whole time.  During that breakin period, I could feel the power increase 
as the rings seated in.  For the first 500 miles I always tried to keep 
the speed changing - constant speeds are your enemy.  I also did this 
for my friends bus with great results.  If you want more info, read this

I had to pull the engine apart at 40k because I had a bad valve (had 
reused an old head) and the pistons and cylinders looked great.  Many 
people will disagree with this process because, well, they just do... 
but when Ferrari is taking their new cars straight out to the track 
after it's built, kinda makes you think why...
