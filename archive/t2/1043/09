Subject: Re: Securing Fuel Pump, 77 Bus

Bob said:
 I'm installing a new fuel pump in my 77 bus, fuel injection.The old pump
isthe factory original, from what I can tell.The new pump is an exact copy,
BUTNot an exact fit, it appears the old pump had some type of asbestos ring
underthe clamp that hold it to the body, this stuff is white, and falling
apart,pictures here:http://www.lifeasbob.com/2008/06/22/VWHeartTransplant.aspx
The clamp when tightened all the way up, leaves the fuel pump loose, you
canslide it back forth !I temporarily solved this by loosening the clamp,
takinga peice of fuel line, splitting it lengthwise and putting it under the
clampand retighting it. But something tells me this may not be a good thing,
ifthe old stuff was asbestos, does it get hot ? Will a peice of fuel line
melt? What should i use ?Anybody have any suggestions who has done this, or
ismy problem unique ?

Strange..... all the ones I have seen have nothing between the clamp and pump.
Even VW shows nothing between 8, 9, and 18:

I usually wrap electrical tape once around the pump to stop electrolysis.
