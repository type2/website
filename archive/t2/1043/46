Mark: Thanks for the tip. Please comment on this situation. I have 
the engine on a test stand in the garage. I'll start it there and 
tune the dual carbs there. I'd like to run it at idle for a while on 
the stand to look for oil leaks.

Do you think that a couple of hours of idling before mounting it in 
the vehicle for the 55 mph run will be ok?
