David, I don't think I can use angle. Look at the "bumper" behind the bumper you can take off. It seems to be molded to fit tight under the outer bumper. For this reason, I think you need something that will flex some to fit the contour of the body.
I think I will need to just wait until I get there and see what i can come up with.
Thanks,
Joel

Even if you drill the holes in advance, they might not line up properly. 
  I think that is the point Bob was trying to make.

I assume you will be using *at least* 3/16" thick 2" angle (not flat)

for the bracket.  Preferably 1/4".  Do yourself a favor regardless of 
where you drill the holes in the bracket - go back to Harbor Freight and 
get a set of these step drill-bits:

They will cut through the thick mild steel like a hot knife through 
butter.  Well worth the $10 (that's only $2 per kid, times minutes 
saved!).  You will need a good (minimum 18V) cordless drill or a 120V 
drill for this job.

I've got 5 kids (8months, 2, 4, 6, and 8 years old) and they are coming,
too. So I was hoping to do as much of the work as possible before I get there,
so as not to keep my kids waiting for over an hour for me to fabricate a tow
bar and hook it all up...
