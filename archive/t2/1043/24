I didn't count how many turns it took to get the adjusters free (that would
have been a good idea though!), but I did notice that I have a bit more
thread showing on the adjuster screws now - I think they were adjusted too
tight before.  I will back them off tonight to allow them to fill and reset
them in the AM.  I'll let you know what happens.
