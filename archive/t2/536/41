Subject: Need warm air duct (AKA: under cylinder) tin for 78 2000CC

     I have looked into getting this tin from a couple of salvage yards.  
This tin is usually missing from falling off or rusting off since it's 
underneath the engine.  If you are not sure what I am talking about, here 
are some links to pictures on the bus boys website:

I need:
O. 021-119-361DU Warm Air Duct, Front Left, Used 1975 to 1978
R. 021-119-355EU Warm Air Duct, Lower Left, Used 1975 to 1978
U. 021-119-362EU Warm Air Duct, Front Right, Used 1975 to 1978
W. 021-119-356EU Warm Air Duct, Lower Right, Used 1975 to 1978

I'm trying to get the bus ready for the EB camping trip (my first VW camping 
trip) and I'd really like to have all the right tin in place before I make 
that long trip.  Let me know if you can offer this tin to me and ship it out 
in the next couple of days.  My bus is a 74 but it has a 2000CC engine from 
a 78 bus.
