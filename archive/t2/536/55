The bulb should be getting 12volts+ at the light and then the long wire to the back grounds through the switch when there is no pressure. 

So it looks like there is a break in the wire or the switch out back is bad or your engine makes pressure even when the engine is off (in which case would you build me an engine too? <grin!>)
