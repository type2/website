Subject: Everybus Items: Late Bay doors

Hey Folks,
   I recently got 2 cab doors to go on my '72, and they came from a late bay.
The hinge pins are fatter on the '72 than on the late Bays, so I can't use
them. The drivers side door is in pretty good shape, the passenger side has
quite a bit of rust. Both doors have the glass, but no handles or interior
panels. I'll bring them to Everybus if someone wants 'em for $20.00. Heck, the
glass alone is worth that! Can email pics if you want.  Jeff S.
