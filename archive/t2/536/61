Subject: Mixed Interior

Hi All,
 Has anyone tried mixing the components of a westy interior?
Say the X-Bed from a 75-76 with the Table & Jumpseat from a 71?
I am looking for something like that. A little bit more seating room, View
thru the right rear window, but still a bit of storage. I am not sure that
I want a Sink/Stove/Fridge yet...

Thanks,
Matt
