Subject: Engine code interpretation and overhaul

Hey all

Event update. My overhaul will commence late next week/following week.
(yahh oooh ahhh.. whatever)

anyway my mechanic wanted to know the size of my motor and he said
that (like you guys said) a 1700 with fuel injection is rare, unless its a 
914
(or something) and that didnt seem right. Since I was in my little car I was
to report to him tomorrow.

Here's what I have : GD044303
according to http://www.type2.com/bartnik/enginecodes.htm
'GD              1976-1979      2000 ('79 has Vanagon heads)'
I have a 2 liter !
I guess that explains the power in the wind and hills. Go figure.
He says its a type 4 motor so it seems I have a nice little setup.

He's a nice guy, the time Im in there helping and saving them time
he said he will take off their labor charge.  I get to learn AND save a 
little
money.

I think this weekend I am going to do some measuring.. make a new z-bed
box for the frame, move it over and redesign the furniture inside.  Im 
gettin
pretty excited if you can't already tell.

James
