Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Karl Von Salzen

I'll second and third all the kind words for Karl. As his proud local buddy I might convince him to down a pint at our local brewpub and accept your good wishes, but he'll probably be busy installing an engine in his hardtop deluxe so he can tear down his '76 which has finally worn out crankshaft bearings. 

If you're only on the VintageBus list like me, see the many kind messages at www.type2.com, Type2 mail. 

April 6 is a better day to congratulate Karl than his birthday, 9/11!

btw, If you've asked Karl for parts and delayed contacting him for ANY reason, let him know and get your parts. He's pretty forgiving most of the time and is probably in a good mood now. A lot of good parts are being crushed by the salvage yards if Karl doesn't think you need 'em!
