Subject: Re: [T2] Re: towing capacity

I  have a manual for a 78,which I assume is pretty much the same for my
76.It
lists the tow capacities in pounds and kg.If anyone wants to know,for a 78
tpe 2 bus the tow ratings are without brakes(lbs/kgs)1322/600.With
brakes(lbs/kgs) manual trans:2645/1200 auto tran:1322/600.  perm.trailer
tongue load lbs/kgs max:110/50.  What id like to see is someone pulling a
2600 lb trailer with only a 110lb tongue weight.Can you say sway?The general
rule of thumb is to try to get your tongue weight 10 be 10-15% of the total
trailer weight.I have personally experienced the sway that results from to
light a tongue weight.Its scarry.Later
