Subject: RE: [T2] brake booster hose

I don't know about the real stuff, but I was able to make my own by
purchasing a regular hose at the auto parts store and a long spring (at
the home improvement store) that would just barely fit inside the hose.
I stretched the spring to the length I needed, inserted it into the
hose, and presto, a non collapsible brake house.

I later found out that I could get vacuum house at a commercial truck
supplier, but never bothered since my solution works just fine.

I now need to replace the brake booster vacuum
hose on two buses and would like to do it with the real stuff.
