Subject: door jam triangle?

Hi all..could you please look at this pic. real quick and tell me if you've ever seen this "triangle shaped thingy" in the bottom corner of the front door jam?  It's kind of a hard cardboard/plastic and I had one on each side and were torn off by my painter.  They were contact-cemented in.
 I'm just wondering if they are STOCK or if someone stuck them on for some reason?  I will put them back on if they are stock.  Please let me know!
thanks for the help!  ALL responses welcome, seen it or not!
