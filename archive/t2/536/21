Subject: Mammoth Cave trip

Well as a 1st camping trip for our 4 year old I am collecting info for a long weekend of camping at Mammoth Cave National Park. 

Unfortunately our Westy isn't ready yet so it will be a tent next to the Honda trip... 

Anybody got recommendations on things to see or do while we are there... I've heard there is a cave there someplace... <grin!>

I'm assuming we'll stay in the NPS camp ground as these have always been reliable and safe and quiet in our experience. 

I saw ads for a boat tour and I'm expecting we'll pass by a tourist area like Pigeon Forge, TN. 

Looking for simple, and cheap - we want to be outdoors and cook out with the exception of a breakfast. 

Any suggestions or warnings?

Thanks! 

Chris
