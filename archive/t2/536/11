Subject: In Support of Matt Ramsey (was Beware of Matthew J. Ramsey)

I'll make this short and simple.  Matt is a really good guy with as much of
a passion for buses as I've seen.  He's friendly, laid back, and is always
ready to buy a round at the pub.  He purchased Zorm (58 single cab) from me
a few years ago and the transaction was as solid and smooth as you could
hope for.  He flew out here to Colorado Springs with a check in hand for a
44-year old truck that he had never seen, trusting the honesty of a fellow
bus-lover to not screw him over.  

Whatever miscommunication occurred between he and Terry that inspired Terry
to post a public bashing of Matt (not to mention calling him an a**hole)
was, I suspect, way out of proportion and could/should/would have been
cleared up with a couple of PRIVATE emails between the two of them.  

If Matt has one shortcoming, it's that he's so dang busy with working on
several buses (I think he's got 3 now?), hanging out with the Buskateers,
working, spending time with his wife, and enjoying his baby that he may not
have gotten behind on a $20 piece of business.  If any of you have cause to
do business with Matt in the future you can rest assured that he exists,
he's honest, and he loves buses.
