Mammouth cave is awsome. The cave is huge. The tours are a little pricey but
worth it. My wife and I were childless last time we were there and took the
all day tour. We were underground for about 9 hours. It was Killer...Oh yeah
that cave will blow your mind as the size of it is huge. Its thought to
stretch all the way to mid NC.
We have always done the back country camping as I do not like RV type
campgrounds. The last time we went we camped in the bus at a trail head to
avoid the RVs.The backpacking is really nice for such a small park were the
main attraction is underground. There is plenty of tourist type stuff there
from putt-putt to alpine slides. To put it shortly Mammouth is a great place
thats often overlooked.
