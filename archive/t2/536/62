Subject: RE: [T2] brake booster hose

I found the old message from David that I could not find. Here is the brake
booster hose source for everyone else and the archives ...

I will order some asap. If anyone coming to Everybus needs some, I can order
more and bring it down to NC. Please let me know how much you need by
Wednesday.

So, now I only need to know the p/n and availability for the plastic hose
clamps and rubber sleeves for this hose - can anyone with ETKA help me out?

Marcus

Hello Marcus,

Since my reply regarding the vacuum hose, I have found a source that sells
the same hose for less than half the price Bus-boys sells it for. Bus-Boys
sells it for $10.75 a foot! Bob sells it for $5.00 a foot. Measure your old
hose and email Bob and talk to him about it.
His address is: rgreenup3(-at-)cox.net
He seems to be a good guy. He has helped me out alot.

Any way, good luck and if you have any more questions, feel free to email
me!

Have a nice weekend!
