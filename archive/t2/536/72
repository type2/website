Austin,
Welcome aboard I like this list for it's sheer entertainment value and the 
fine information found here.
You are correct the fuel pump is just to the right of the Distributor.

I reccomend stock or the brazillian unrebuildable equivelent, I have run a 
stock fuel pump for over 100K miles before replacing it with a unit I rebuilt 
using the diaphram kit which is still available.
The old unit will be in the tool box for emergency use.
You will need to get the spacer pushrod and gaskets which go between the pump 
and the engine.
My 2c worth.
