Jay,

This is what I am looking for but there is another supplier who is
considerably cheaper than Bus Boys. If I remember correctly, the supplier I
am looking for is not a VW parts dealer but rather a specialist for these
kind of parts.

Thanks,
Marcus

Not sure about the cheapest source for this, but bus boys carries this hose:

N 20390.12  Hose - High Pressure Rated For Servo Vacuum, Bus/Pickup/Vanagon
71-91 $10.75 per foot

I could be wrong but I believe that is what you are looking for.
