Subject: Re: [T2] Side Tent

ok as far as a side tent i myself have looked into the SUV tents which will fit the side and you can also zip it up and pull your bus away from it and leave all your stuff inside zipped up and then pull  back up and zip it back to the side of the bus again... they arent that much either... cant remember the link but will search for it... 
it is for like hooking up to jeeps and such....
they are a whole lot less than 300 bucks thats for sure..... seems like they started out at like 150 bucks and up...?
just my 2 cents.. do a search on SUV tents ....
funny how i see the SUV's trying to take the place of what the VW bus has done all along all these years... shows people folding seats down and sleeping in them and now tents and such.. why in the world dont they just buy a bus LOL.. ohh thats right its not practical anymore ............
personally i wouldnt have it any other way... gotta love being able to pull up and stretch down the bed and take a nap... 
peace
Chris

Hi All.



Bus Depot use to sell a side tent for around $200.00. I no longer see
that model in their on-line catalog, only the higher priced $300.00
model. I have sent them a mail asking if they still sell the old one.
Does anyone know where the lower priced tent may still be sold? Anyone
out there have one and can comment on whether you like it or not?



Thanks
