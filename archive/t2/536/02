 I have been the benefactor of Karl's skills/know-how/generous
nature/ and access to hard to find parts.  I think this is a great
idea.  Karl is one of the individuals on this list that really makes
it a great place to be.

p.s. My bus says thankyou for the locking engine compartment latch
that you found.  It continues to keep small curious hands of local
kids away from my distributor.
