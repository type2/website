Subject: The Canadian Carabus to EveryBus 

Hi Volks,

This is a plug for the Carabus I am heading up Leaving from Toronto 
next Wednesday heading to EveryBus. I guess that also makes it a plug 
for EveryBus. Cool.

The current plan has us meeting in Scarborough, Ontario at 6AM 
Wednesday April 14th. We'll pick up additional buses in Burlington ON 
at 7AM and again at the duty free in Fort Erie at 8:20 AM. We'll be 
making a grocery/lunch stop at Erie PA near the Walmart between 11 and 
12:00, then head South from Erie through PA to Beckley West Virginia.

We'll be camping overnight at Camp Creek State Park, leaving there by 
10AM  on Thursday to make our way to EveryBus early Thursday afternoon.

If you're interested in falling in along the way, please drop me a 
line. If there's a recent traffic hazard or a detour you think I should 
know about, please tell me about that, too. I am pretty familiar with 
the route between Toronto and Morgantown WV, but not so much after 
that.

At this point I would like to share an EveryBus04 Haiku written 
yesterday by Adam Narraway. Adam will be attending his first EveryBus 
with his family in their 68 westy.

   Frosted bare knuckles
   Heart races beyond my hands
   Nine more sleeps to go.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
