i am going to say a definite maybe. i think that your part number is an
obsolete number, but that doesn't mean it won't work. if it is an in-dash
VDO tach for 4 cylinder and it is 3.125" diameter, it should work perfectly.

the current part number that works is 333-051. i have an old one in my bus,
and i think it might be the -032, hard to say with the thing installed in
the bus, though. if your number is for 4-cyl only, then the part # will be
different, as the newer number works for 4-6-8 cyl.
