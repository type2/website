N 20390.12  Hose - High Pressure Rated For Servo Vacuum, Bus/Pickup/Vanagon 
71-91 $10.75 per foot

Wouldn't the point be to buy a hose that has rigid enough walls not to collapse since it is handling vacuum rather than pressure??? 

Mc-Master Carr, Grainger, etc. 

My bus has a semi-rigid plastic or nylon hose. Lowe's or Home Depot might even have a good substitute. Heck even rigid copper lines would work since if they crack they don't cause a fire in this usage. Of course you might burn a valve from the vacuum leak. 

The high pressure line I have seen that is most like the booster line on my bus is the high pressure line on my pressure washer between the pump and the spray gun. Rigid enough no to collapse and rigid enough not to kink. 

Underground spinkler hose? 

Good luck!
