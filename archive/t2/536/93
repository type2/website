The answer is YES!  They had both.  There is a stiff pressed-board panel
that the curtain was stapled to.  The panel is held in place by a few (4
maybe?) screws.  It's been nigh a decade since I replaced my original
curtains, but I seem to remember removing a screw or screws from inside the
clothes closet and 1 or 2 more from inside the rear cabinet.  Then the panel
with curtain attached can be slipped out (I think it came out toward the
front.  Staple your new replacement curtain in a similar fashion and
re-install.
