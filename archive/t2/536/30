Subject: Fuel Pump on 71 Type II

Hi all,

I am new to the list and a new owner of a 71 transporter. The bus had been sitting in a neighbors driveway for the past 3 years, and I am in the process of getting it back on the road. Please bear with me if I ask a newbie question along the way. 

Now for some questions about the fuel pump...

My 71 is equipped with a NOISY electronic fuel pump, located on the left hand side of the engine compartment. Is an electronic fuel pump in that location stock? 
Since the fuel pump is so loud, I want to replace it. If it is not
stock, any opinion if I should go back to a stock set up or replace it
with a queiter electonic fuel pump? Where is a stock fuel pump located on a 1600 dp - to the right of the distributor? If so it looks like mine has been bypsased. 

Thanks
