Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump on 71 Type II

*****The old unit will be in the tool box for emergency use.******

Definately a good idea.

*****You will need to get the spacer "pushrod" and gaskets which go between 
the pump
and the engine.*****

Make sure that you have the correct length on the pushrod or you can really 
screw up your new pump. Then you might be visiting the place where you 
bought it to get another one. These rods can be grinded down to spec. So if 
there is doubt at the store or you can't get the correct length, buy the 
longer one but do not install it until you have corrected the length. Ask me 
how I know.

Hope this helps.
