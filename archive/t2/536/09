Subject: Re: [T2] Side Tent

I guess it depends on what you need but I think
one of those screen tents works best on the side
of the bus.  Frank Biffath has a nice one.  I've
seen some with fabricated attachments that bridge
the gap between the tent and the bus.  Some have
rainflys on the sides too that can be zipped down
if you need more privacy or shelter.  

I don't know that I could ever convince myself to
pay the premium for a bus only side tent, at
least one that isn't a true westy tent.  Strange
coming from a guy that doesn't have a true westy,
huh?
