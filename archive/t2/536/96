Subject: Pop top conversion, 73 to 74/79

Good day again, here is my small story;

I hate my 73 interior and pop top configuration.

But I love my 73, because I rebuilt everything on it.

Its a rare strong eastern bus, I was ready to sell this one for my 
dream bus (76-79)

But I was looking at it and.hey, why not partially or fully convert 
this one ti a 76-79 configuration.

With the help of some nice fellow here I already found a complete 76-79 
interior, I should say a few. Ok, good.

I also have access to a complete 78 pop top (upper section) for free.

But here is my question, as I never really seen up close the rear 
portion of the roof, can someone explain to me what is the major 
difference in the roof structure between a pre 73 and 76/79, of what I 
know its flat metal????

Anyone with a picture that shows the roof without the pop-top fibreglass 
on it?

Is it feasible (well everything is but) without structurally weakening 
the bus?

Thanks for any answer.

Regards, Ben
