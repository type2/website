Subject: Re: [T2] Vibration/noise in front around 55 mph?

Miles-
Starting with the simplest solution, could it be that you had picked up a
rock in the treads of one of your front tires, throwing it out of balance?
This might explain why the sound was speed dependant, and why it went away
on it's own (the rock came free).
Glad to hear that you also survived yesterday's windstorm.
Cheers,
Matthew
