Mostly laboratory tests although if what they say about zinc and ash content
is true it can help you avoid really cheap brands.

I've only run a few oils in my bus and all without a temperature gauge so I
can't really compare them under load. There is other work published on the
web that is more interesting that tests oil viscosity after being run in an
engine for 3k miles.

I do have more oil experience with motorcycles although their wet clutches
tend to chew up the oil a bit faster. About 10 years ago MCN published a
report that compared synthetics to petroleum oils. The most interesting
results showed viscosity breakdown at 800 and 1500 miles.

Mobil 1 in their tests retained 87% viscosity after 800 miles and 83% after
1500 miles. The petroleum oils were 68% at 800 miles and dropped more after
that. It's clear synthetics breakdown less and help to keep the oil pressure
and temperatures normal.

From all the empirical evidence, especially the list feedback, the VW
air-cooled engine can withstand temperatures over 250F. The fact that the
engine doesn't blow up running at 260F is less important that the fact the
the oil is being subjected to excessive heat.

Oils have a viscosity rated at 210F and it's said their base-stocks begin to
break down at 250F. Occasionally hitting this temperature seems fine but
doing it for 3,000 miles wouldn't be prudent. Oil breaks down even if you
keep it within the operating temperature range.

It's important to remember that at 250F they are talking about petroleum
based oils only. Synthetics are designed to run up to 300F which make them
ideal for any VW and why every air-cooled Porsche uses that oil especially
any car running on the racetrack.

One interesting article I've read explained how NY taxi fleets use synthetic
oil. They change it at 60k miles but change the filters every 6k miles.
Petroleum oil in the same cabs require 3k miles oil change intervals. I
don't know the source but it seems like a great testing environment.

Synthetic oil can apparently run for 25k miles in your engine but no
manufacturer wants you to know that because they'll sell less oil. They only
real way to know if the oil is your engine is up to snuff at 250F plus is to
have it tested, like they do for small airplane engines. If you are really
concerned, it can cost as little as $20 to find out.
