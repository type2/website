That was exactly the problem with my fast/slow blinker situation.  I don't
know why this blinker problem showed up "all of a sudden" after the blinkers
worked properly, but, because I'm always very careful to put wires back in
their origininal position I just carried the problem over from bulb to bulb.

Doh!!!  (Palm of hand slaps forehead.  I'm going to have a bruise there.)

I hadn't even thought about looking a fuses since my (faulty) reasoning was
that if the blinkers would blink (albeit, one fast, one slow) then surely
the emergency flashers would blink.  Looked at the fuse box and, lo and
behold, no fuse in the number 9 hole!

The lists came through for me again!!!

Thanks to all who responded!
