Subject: Condensation on spark plug wires after storage

My van was jacked up on all fours during the cold canadian winter.  After
returning for the first time in months I discovered some water gathering on
the spark plug wires near the distributor.  The funny thing is, only 2 out
of the 4 plugs had condensation.  What causes this?  Any idea of a keyword
I could use to search the archives?

Thank you!
