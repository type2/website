Hi Daniel,

    Silly question, but did you align the clutch disk? If so try
this................ put the bus in any gear.............lock the
E-brake...........as you try to push the engine in the last little
bit.........rock the (rotate) the crankshaft back and forth and push.
    If you have a helper or two, you can put the transmission in
gear...........hold one rear tire.......and rotate the other as you push the
engine in. Doing this will turn the input shaft while you push, aligning the
shaft.
    If everything is lined up, it should slip in without any trouble. Let me
caution you, don't try to force it in by using the mounting bolts. "If it
don't fit, don't force it"! You could bend the clutch disk, or break an
"ear" off the engine case, etc.
    Good luck!

Howard
