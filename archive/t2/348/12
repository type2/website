Subject: Re: [T2] Low compression in rebuilt engine

Truely, this is something you must take up with your supplier. Be prepared 
to discuss in detail your procedures. A leak down test of the weak 
cylinders will tell if the problem is valves or rings. Know that you should 
put at least 1000 miles on the motor and retest before drawing any 
conclusions.

As regards compression testing generally, all plugs removed, throttle plate 
held wide open, fully charged battery, ground the coil HT wire, disconnect 
the double relay to prevent fuel spray. I generally listen for 10 
compression events on each cylinder test. Motor should be at or near 
operation temp.
