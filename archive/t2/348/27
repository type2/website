Subject: Front Beam Rust

Hi all,
I just picked up a complete front beam from a '75 bus I will use as a spare
for my '77 bus (for free!!!!).
I have heard mentioned they can be prone to rusting out from the inside.
Where do they rust? I have tapped along the tubes to look for weak spots but
found none.
As my front end is beginning to sag, is there anyway to check if the free
beam is any better? Other than the obvious fit it and hope for the best!
Also any tips on how to disassemble and re-build a front end that is not
attached to a bus??? Not sure how to pull the arms with all that tension on
them.
