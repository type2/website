Subject: fuel pump isn't

Hey y'all
The Tinkertoy has the SPDH installed, timing set, oil primed, but no fuel 
from the pump.  This is the same pump, base and rod that came out of the 
other engine so theoretically it should work.  Of course, theory sometimes 
takes exceptions to reality.

I removed the pump, and by hand it works fine as long as I don't give it a 
high stroke.  The pump rod runs from just above the gasket and gives about 
6-8mm of stroke (uncalibrated eyeball measurement).  The actuating lever of 
the pump projects about 8mm below the bottom of the pump, flat takes it even 
then the rod at the top of the stroke takes another 8mm +-.  I'm thinking 
that the taking up slack (lever going even with the bottom of the pump) is 
taking all the useable stroke and the stroke itself is not doing anything. 

I've not taken a fuel pump apart before except when I used the wrong rod with 
my first pump and the shattered pump casing was the disassembly.

I'm not out to lunch, because it's after dinner, just asking what y'all think?

thanks in advance

Dave
