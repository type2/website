as mine doesn't (78) however I just had a strange experience any ideas

I just drove 1200 miles in a week and when I stopped one evening I let the
van sit level all night and the next morning I checked and the oil was
low, so I put a quart in, when I got home I checked the oil the next day
after letting it sit overnight and it was a quart high???? now where was
that quart of oil hiding??????

anyway time for oil/filter change before heading off to Everybus
