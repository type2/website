Well--I give.

The super glue wins.

This unbelievable substance will not come out of rayon, nylon or
whatever the seat cushion is made out of--no way--no how.
And I believe any further attempts in the removal process will be
futile.

All I can see that may happen in reality is I that the seat may go into
a post napalm mode--like the fibers of the material will or are fused
together from some sort of chemical reaction to the glue--and it got no
better--no worse than when I started.

 This morning I did go to a hobby shop and purchase some release
agent--the best--
and nothing happened.

I think the glue sucked down into the fibers way too far--and this is no
mans land--so I'm done.

Time to find a new cover for the back seat-----

I surrender---:>)
