Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant

 If you've got a stock type4 eng. and live in a hot/humid climate, you're 
gonna see temps well in excess of 210 on a regular basis. running 250+ 
(measured at the sump) on long hiway speed trips is common. VW itself said 
that "...Flickering of the oil pressure light when returning to idle is 
common after long hi speed trips, and should not be a cause for concern if 
the oil pressure light goes out when the engine rpm is increased..." Remember 
that the stock oil pressure switch tripped the warning light at 3PSI!!!!! In 
the real world, that is as good as none! Also on that note, the oil BYPASSES 
the oil cooler until pressure is under 37psi. Yep, that's right. And if you 
do the math (and yea, I'm an ME, I do the math, I'm also a bit of an A$$hole, 
but hey, can't win 'em all...) that tells you that your oil pressure at 
3500rpm is gonna be around 17psi max (-at-) temps above 240deg. Keep in mind kids, 
that oil temp and oil pressure are inversely related. VW didn't put an oil 
pressure gauge in the type2 for a reason. Same reason that the pressure 
sender was set so freaking low. They run at temps that some people think is 
too hot. The Engineers at VW thought otherwise. You didn't see people babying 
the type2 when it was new, did you? NO massive Factory Recalls, No warnings 
from the dealer or statements in the owners manual saying: "CONGRATULATIONS 
ON THE PURCHASE OF YOUR NEW VOLKSWAGEN TYPE 2. NEVER NEVER NEVER DRIVE THIS 
VEHICLE OVER 50MPH, OR WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMP RISES ABOVE 60 DEG. OR YOU WILL 
VOID THE WARRANTY, BURN A VALVE, DROP A SEAT, HOLE A PISTON, BURST INTO 
FLAMES, AND DIE A FLAMING DEATH, ALL WHILST HUMMING THE HORST WESSEL SONG 
THAT HAS BEEN SUBLIMINALLY IMPRINTED INTO YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS BY OUR SUPERIOR 
SINGLE SPEAKER SAHPIRE AM RADIO. HAVE A NICE DAY.!!!" Come on people! My 
Father bought a '79 Westy brand new off the showroom floor. First thing he 
did was install a mechanical oil pressure gauge, oil temp gauge and head temp 
gauge, all of which were pirated out of one of the many old aircraft he had 
lying around (don't ask...I had a strange upbringing...)and you know what? 
Brand spanking new that beast ran at 250+ on long hiway speed trips on hot 
days. Pressure around 15-22psi at those temps. Dad never took his foot out of 
it, ran as close to 75mph as road conditions allowed. Not a single problem in 
over 120k miles. When he sold it, it had 130-135psi in every hole, and a max 
leak down of 6%. He was a fiend for maintenance, however. If we took the 
advise of some on the List, we would never drive our Busses. Just sit around 
arguing inane specs, and treating them like Rare, Fragile, Unreliable Relics. 
Oh, sorry, guess some of us already do that. Me, I prefer to DRIVE!!!!!
