A bit of a vision of what my plans are this year for EB Campout Weekend.....

won't be attending EB all weekend as in the past., no shop tour this year,
I'll attend Friday only.

 Also that weekend  North Vs South Shootout Darligton Dragway, Sunday the
6th , I'll be leaving Saturday spending the nite in Florence, SC at the KOA
, Showing Sunday.

I hope to have the pages updated before the first of the monthor at least by
the thursday of EB, later
