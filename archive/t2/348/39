Thanks Karl and Bob,

I was alittle mixed up when I wrote the question.
Being up side down and backwards while working on my
bus confused me when I was thinking about it. I just
went out and looked at it and I did hook it up  the
way you said. Sorry for the blonde moment.

Thanks for the correction!

Have a great day!

Regards,
David Kelly
