Depends on the tent, but the driveaway/add-a-room model does indeed clip
to the gutter via flexible molding.  The boot between tent and bus is just
under a foot wide, then you have the tent frame sticking up about a foot
higher than the gutter at the peak.  Dunno if that helps figure out if
your awning will work or not, but as long as it's clear of the gutter you
can sure mount that style tent to it.
