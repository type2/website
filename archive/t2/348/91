Subject: Re: [T2] using the blower fan for something else...

Just wire it to the fuse panel up front
ground it, and put a switch on or under the dash to the ground wire
I wired a bilge blower fan in my main heater channel that way.
the switch was purchased at the marine store where i got the fan.
good luck

Can I use the stock blower fan for something else if I needed to?
How do I power it on and off? Any suggestions?
