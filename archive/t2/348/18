hi all, i got my boneyard awning installed on my 75 westy. as i think about
it i wonder if i'll be able to use my riviera tent unless i yank off the
awning. i think it stupid to have to decide which one to bring on a trip:
tent? awning? awning? tent? i know what your thinking - why an opened
awning above a tent set up - its about choice, and if the tent doesn't get
set up, i still have the awning attached, being used, and not lying on the
ground somewhere.

i have never seen a westy tent set up live and in person. do listees have
westy tent and an awning set up together on the same side? the riveria uses
a magnetic strip above the rain gutter, actually on the roof area, and
think i heard on the list that the westy tent clips to the gutter (?) -
which would be preferable and help me out much... the brackets of my awning
give me space for that.

i've looked at joe's tent page, but i can't fig if there's clearence for
this hootnanny.
