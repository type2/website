Add my vote for busdepot.  I've dealt with them for years and always been
happy, and most times I tend to order from Ron.  A couple more that I've
had good experiences with (no connection, etc.): 

wolfsburgwest.com - does a lot of their own repros (e.g. shiftrod boots
that were NLA a couple of years ago) and has always been competitive and
responsive.  Oriented towards earlier vehicles but has plenty of 2nd
generation bus stuff.  Their online catalog is my favorite in terms of
navigation, parts photos, details.

type2parts.com - Just ordered my splitty's trans and redux box bearings
from him and it's been a good experience.  Ronnie has an excellent rep on
the vintagebus list.  Splitty-oriented but you early bay owners know how
that goes.  Catalog has plentiful comments on quality, fit, etc.

aircooled.net - bought an SVDC and Tiger CDI from John and he has been
very willing to answer questions.  Nice online catalog.

Don't forget to think about your FLAPS if they're trustworthy and (IMO)
not part of a megachain.  Tallahassee is not a big town but our guys
(Eastern Imports) can get a lot of stuff and they actually have a lot of
ACVW stuff hanging on their walls (bugpack, mostly).
