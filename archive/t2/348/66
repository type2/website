Subject: Vibration/noise in front around 55 mph?

Volks -

While driving back to Seattle from Vancouver BC last night, I observed a
new noise.  Upon reaching a speed of around 55-60 mph, the Bus would start
making an irregular whirring/vibrating noise.  It was noticeably loud but
not frighteningly loud -- about as loud as a speaking voice, same volume
I'd set the radio to if I were listening to NPR -- and the pitch was in
the tenor/alto range, something like an engine running at about 3700 rpm.
The noise was definitely coming from the FRONT of the vehicle -- nothing
at all to do with the engine or transmission.  Accelerating would make the
noise louder, and slowing down to 50ish would make it go away completely.

My reaction was to hunt around the speed where the noise would start and
drive slightly slower than that.  Finally, about an hour later, the
problem disappeared on its own -- for now.

I'm thankful for whatever warning I've just received.  My only problem is
that I'm really not sure what I need to repair.  My hope is that it will
be ridiculously obvious to someone more experienced.  Could it be a front
wheel bearing?  Speedometer cable?  Electric razor in the glove box?  I
can't think of many constantly moving parts up front...

Thanks for any advice,

- Miles ('71 Bus)
