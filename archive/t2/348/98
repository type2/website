Sure sounds like an clogged fuel filter to me.  Don't worry about
anything else until you've tried replacing that.

Incidentally: If you're not yet intimately familiar with the route your
fuel follows from your Bus's tank to its engine -- and of course you are,
because you've personally replaced all of your fuel lines -- you should
check to make absolutely sure that there's only one filter along the way.
My Subie (which is very much like a Bus in that it has fuel lines that run
from a fuel tank to a fuel pump!) has TWO fuel filters, one close to the
tank and one close to the engine.  Once upon a time, I had the exact
symptoms that you now describe -- although they were resolved earlier --
and replaced only the filter in the engine compartment, not knowing that
there was another one underneath.  Needless to say, the problem did not go
away until the second filter was discovered and replaced as well.  I can't
imagine why a Bus would want a second fuel filter anywhere but in its
spare parts box, but I've heard of Buses having two filters as well.
