Subject: Canadian Breakfast at EveryBus

This just in! Below is a note from Greg about plans for an EB 
breakfast hosted \ by the Canadians. Those guys are really too cool.

Thanks Greg et al!

Can someone please fwd to the vanagon and vintagebus lists?


Hi Chris,

For 2K3 the Canadians have decided to cook breakfast early. We're 
going to feed the flock on Friday morning instead of Sunday this 
time. This will mean that maybe not all the Canadians will be there 
by then, but the ones who will be there are wanting to make it 
happen. Cooking on Sunday was fun last year but it made pack-down 
afterwards just  a little too frantic.

Pancakes, Bacon, Sausage, Coffee, OJ and real Canadian Maple Syrup. 
Campers who want to contribute can bring any of the above. People who 
want to help cook may be able to do that too, if they can pass a 
stringent spatula proficiency exam. People who want to pay their way 
can contribute their $$$ to a collection to be forwarded to 
type2.com, last year i think we raised about $60.

If this is cool with you then please pass this along to the lists.

Happy trails,

P.S., we're at 8 Canadians and holding. 2 have dropped out, one to 
financial stress and another to anxiety about the current war in Iraq.
