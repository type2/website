Subject: Fuel Line Replaccement for 73 Bus

Is there a good step-by-step guide available online for a '73 bus?  I see
Billy did a good one for later model buses, but at first glance it seems
the setup will not be the same for a '73 model.  A point in the right
direction would be appreciated!

Thank you :)

P.S. I never changed these or inspected them..... it's important, I know.
