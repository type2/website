I use a lot of CA adhesives with my students (I buy the stuff by the
quart!) and would be very cautious trying to get it out of upholstery with
acetone.  With my luck, I'd put a big hole in the upholstery before I got
the CA out!

I have Levi's that have CA on them and know that the CA survived many
machine washings.  That stuff is tough!
