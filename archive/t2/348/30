Subject: 80 Vanagon in Ohio

Any one need anything?  Door, glass, seats?
The engine has no compression, the transmission, clutch and starter are out.
And the elec fuel pump.
Will go to the scrap yard in a couple of days.
I am in Columbus Ohio
No pictures, but they can be had in a day or so, if needed any thing
specific.
Beep Beep,
