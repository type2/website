Nay--Nay--Stosh--no naplam--

I'm going to VW and see if I can get a new cover for cost---
It would make me feel better about this Mambo juice on my back seat--

There was a ultra hostile enviroment in the back of my Van today--

If it ain't right--Buy New--:>)

Just take a lit cigarette and lay it on the spot with the super glue
............... then your back seat will look like mine and you can just
ignore it for 8 years like I do.

Well--I give.

The super glue wins.

This unbelievable substance will not come out of rayon, nylon or
whatever the seat cushion is made out of--no way--no how. And I believe
any further attempts in the removal process will be futile.

All I can see that may happen in reality is I that the seat may go into
a post napalm mode--like the fibers of the material will or are fused
together from some sort of chemical reaction to the glue--and it got no
better--no worse than when I started.

  This morning I did go to a hobby shop and purchase some release
agent--the best--

and nothing happened.

I think the glue sucked down into the fibers way too far--and this is no
mans land--so I'm done.

Time to find a new cover for the back
seat-----

I surrender---:>)
