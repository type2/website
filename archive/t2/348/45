Subject: Exhaust noise- from where in head?

Driving with my daughter at the wheel, the 75 she had recently rebuilt
developed a loud "banging" that got louder on accelletation or hill
climbing- did not get worse, power did not seem to change, so we drove
it home, 5 mi.
The banging came from the right head, and the builder (1.5 hr drive) on
the phone figured exhaust problem or broken rocker stud.  Pulled the
valve cover and checked out the rockers/valves and they seemed normal. 
Ran the engine with each right plug pulled, and the noise goes away with
# 2 pulled.  Hmm, sounds like pulled manifold stud/bad gasket position,
so I checked the torque, and one was a little low but cam up to spec (18
ft lbs) without appearing to pull- noise is still there.  Revving the
engine lets one hear a bit of noise. With a flashlight I thought I saw
some black around the gasket.  Now this is a very lound noise, like
there has to be a good size gap to account for...any ideas what this is
before I yank all that heater box stuff to bring down the manifold? 
This is the onepiece manifold/heaterbox.
