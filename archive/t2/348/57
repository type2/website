Same here - 1600SP in a 71 westy and other than the clutch components I can't think of anything else different.  I have the same experience as Dan 
- sometimes it's a bear getting the tranny lined up with engine at the same point where engine will clear mustache bar mounts and get everything 
parallel.  I just try to make sure the engine's not binding on anything going in -- make sure you can turn it, check to make sure input shaft is centered, 
etc.   A couple of times it has just played hard to get and then would finally slide in the last inch or half-inch like "What?  Me difficult?"  I think maybe 
it just likes to hear my vocabulary....
