Oy vey, I have been following this thread. How unfortunate for you to have
so many hassles with a new motor.

Was it still difficult to turn? With the tightened belt, did you HAVE to
have your helper push on the belt in order to turn the motor? You should
never have this much trouble turning a motor, even a brand new one with
tight bearings and rings.

I think you have some internal problems with this engine and it would be
best to stop all work on it and return it to the supplier. Before pulling
the motor, it may be prudent to have it inspected by an impartial mechanic
so he can report his findings to the supplier, presumably his findings will
support yours. This will cost some extra money, but could save more trouble
with the supplier. This kind of issue with a self-installed engine can get
sticky if the supplier has any doubts about the installers' mechanical
abilities.

I purchased a bad motor once and it was such a complete hassle to deal with
pulling it back out, crating and shipping it back, etc. But at least this
extra work resulted in getting a better running van in the end.

Compression should be done hot, but your motor probably barely runs with
those numbers. Don9t let the supplier tell you that your compression should
be done on a hot motor and it will improve to specs.  First of all, 110-120
is a bit low for a new motor, and 70 is an indication of something gone/done
wrong, my guess would be two broken rings, with the low compression and
tight engine, but that's just a hunch.

Your problems don't sound valve-related anyhow, at least it doesn't add up
that way.

Good luck,
