Hey All---

Before I say one more word, I would like to thank everyone that came to
my call for chemical assitance last evening and this morning--I was
totaly inspired by all of your goodness, and helpful hints /
suggestions--

Now to reality--

If anyone EVER want to be sticking something together--I highly
recommend Loctite, Quicktite.

The reason?

This stuff will not come out of my rear seat cushion--not yet anyway.
BUT--I am bound and determined.

Here is the removal result line up.

Freezing it out and having it chip off using a $7.00 can of circuit
board freeze spray.
It laughed at that-- it didn't even think about moving one iota.

So it's off to the store and load up with finger nail polish---first I
massaged it with Q-tips--gently--and after 20 Q-tips and a half a bottle
of nail polish and 1 hour--I needed to get more aggressive I figured.
So into the house I go and get  a old tooth brush--more nail
polish---NUPE--no movement yet.--another hour of mini scrubbing.

Oops--it's 5:45 pm--Ace is the place closes in 15 minutes--and off I
go--

Now I have a squeeze bottle of Duro super glue remover--this must be
it---
" squeeze on and let sit for 2 minutes and reapply if needed"--the
reapplication process took me 2 hours--
I used the tooth brush--then I used the remover--then hitting it with a
wash of nail polish remover with the brush---then hitting it with Zep
formula 50 to try and break the bond somehow. 

The results----???

Nothing--Zip, Nada, Kaput, Finito, Arriva Derchi, No Go Joe.

Tomorrow---back to Ace is the place and I did see a quart of "extra
strength Acetone"
"Thins fiberglass resin"---

This may be the answer--I'll see.

No damage so far to the seat--yet---

In closing, allow me to recommend this Loctite Quicktite super glue
product---the stuff so far is bullet proof--and Terrence proof--:>)

More tomorrow--


Later,

            ______________
