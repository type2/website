Subject: Friday: Oil Thermal Breakdown

Oil pressure is a good indicator. If your oil pressure starts to drop  when
the oil is old, that shows it's breaking down. Just make sure you monitor at
fixed state, same engine RPM, same oil temp etc, and assuming other problems
aren't causing the pressure loss.
