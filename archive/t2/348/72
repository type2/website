Subject: Re: re: dreaming of double slider westies

It's longer than the door.  It runs from just in front of the leading edge of the door opening back to a point past the back edge of the door when it is 
slid open -- the tent opening allows the door to slide open inside it, and the gutter clip is wider than that.  If you look at the first drawing on 
http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/vw/loaves.html, just imagine the gutter clip piece as nearly that long (shy of the end of the tent by about a foot fore 
and aft).

If you have the awning up you don't really have to attach the clip full length, though, I guess.  You'd just have to try it to see -- other than rain 
protection, the clip holds up the top side of a wide, thin box or tube to seal the bus to the tent & keep out bugs & weather.

Also, some later versions of this tent have a split rear flap -- see the pic under "Variations on a theme" on the same page.  That might allow for some 
creative solutions, depending on which tent you use.

>can anybody testify to the length of that one piece? for me it would need to fit right between the width of the cargo door, no more.
