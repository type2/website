Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant-hear, hear!

Enjoyed your rant, Robb.  Indeed, who had these concerns when these
busses were new? Glad for some of the data points for a new vehicle.  If
you were at Everybus last year or before you may remember the beige
Westy with the hunter green accents- top pod, wheels, bumpers, and
tent.  ...I'm the guy with the 240,000 mi engine, no rebuild.  Plan to
bring the daughter down to this Everybus; she has a 75 with a current
exhaust problem.  For over 150K, the Westyhad no gauges, drove it at
65-75mph no problem.  Treated it to a new clutch disk at 150K and took
it on a 10K around the country trip in Aug.   On long hills I sensibly
drove it in 3rd at an easier throttle than constantly floored in 4th-
one reason possibly why my valves are still good.  Gave it proper
maintenance using 30 wt in summer and included TUFOIL, a ptfe/moly
compound that at the time I first added did yield 2-3 mpg better.  Then
I made a temp sender from a $12 digital meat theremometer, which was
somewhere around 180K or later.   Temps of 240 were common at highway
speeds of 65 on an 80 degree day. As the digital is on all the time,
it's interesting to see how long it takes the engine to cool down- one
reason it can be hot sleeping in the back on a summer night if you
pulled in at midnight!
    Then I added a pressure gauge.....at 200,000, when I still had
135psi compression and tended to blow oil at faster speeds; it still
goes to 65 at startup, and exactly 190 deg it plummets to 45, gradually
dropping as temp climbs.  The drop I assume is when the relief valve
lets the oil to the cooler. In summer, I get 22 psi on the hot days with
240 deg oil temp, have spiked it to 265 on a pull.  The VDO flickers at
7 psi, my idle pressure when hot.  This winter I looked at it; oil may
go only to 220 and pressure is 25-30. I presume looser bearings yields
lower pressure.
   The old bus I now baby more - rattles those loose bearings until it's
pumped up, (warm it up until it's at 190 or it can blow oil more) try
not to exceed 240 deg, use 40 wt in midsummer.  I am amazed how at 55mph
all the way you can get 25 mpg!  It goes about one gear slower up those
hills.  Champing at the bit on the flats. It abbhors some, but I'd like
to see what finally kills it, so the spare bottom end is in the garage
and my Good Sam ERS is paid up (love that they will tow it any milage to
get to PROPER service, which arguably, is my garage (-8
