Subject: oil and mucky exhaust at startup

This has been like this for some time, but it seems a little worse
lately, or I just happened to park in a cleaner part of the driveway
these past few days. When I first start up the bus, I get this nasty
oily/mucky stuff shooting out of the exhaust. 

Here you can see the marks on the driveway as a result of this...

Any thoughts on why, or is this the norm?

Best,
Christopher
