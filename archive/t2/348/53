Subject: rain gutter repair

has anyone had experience with replacing a section of rain gutter?  I could
probably patch it in some places with epoxy, but one section above the
driver's door is missing a 2 inch chunk due to rust and corrosion.  What
would be the proper gauge metal? (I would want it to look like the rest)
Just grind the old stuff flat and weld in a new piece?
