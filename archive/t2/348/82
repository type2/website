Subject: Fuel Line Replaccement for 73 Bus

Hi Shawn, Nice to hear from you again, Do this soon!

Maybe you should write this up for 72-74 buses when you're done!

Matt Robards will help you get it in the library. Format it like mine and we'll be the dynamic fuel line duo!

I think you carb guys have 5MM fuel line instead of 7.5MM, you must double check me, but it's got to be easier with carb(s) than with all the micro-sections of the FI system.

Drain tank, replace as you go, make nice square cuts, and trust me, use those 1$ per piece (2$ canadian?) clamps, you'll thank me.

Billy
