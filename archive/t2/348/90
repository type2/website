Subject: using the blower fan for something else...

Can I use the stock blower fan for something else if I needed to?
How do I power it on and off? Any suggestions?

I have a BA6 heater that is missing the recirculation blower to it, and I 
figured I could use this stock one instead (I Have an extra) - If I can 
figure a way to wire it up where I can switch it on and off as needed. I 
figured I would mount it under the rear bench seat, then route the air from 
under the bench seat back to the BA6 through the stock hole under the rear 
bench on a westy.
