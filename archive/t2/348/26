Subject: Front Door Window Rubber Replacement Problems

I have a 73 Westy. I ordered all new front door window rubber for it, which
comes with no directions on how to put it together.

My bus is now in pieces in the carport. We cannot get it back together again,
after trying mightily for six hours on Saturday. I've checked the archives and
can't find anything that give a step by step procedure on this.

We were able to get the vent wing reassembled, but can't seem to get it to
seat in the door with the window lifter mechanism in place. And we can't get
the window lifter mechanism in place if the vent window is installed.

Any suggestions? TIA for your help.

Thanks!

Nancy
