Subject: vdo pressure sender

 The VDO catalog says that unless noted, all pressure senders output 10-180 ohms. I was wondering if it was possible to use an 80 psi oil sender with a 100 psi gauge? The reason I want to do this is that there is a 100 psi gauge has finer graduations and it's easier to read the exact pressure reported by the sender.
