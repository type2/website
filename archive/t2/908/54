Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank Removal

Katherine,

Upper vent hoses off, lower hose connections with nothing on them.

Gas fill hose(the one that's really big onthe right hand side of the tank
must be off.(about 2 1/4" diameter.

Lower hoses off with nothing but the steel barbs sticking out(there are 
two of them.

Two retaining straps loose.

Fuel sender wire disconnected.

I don't remember worrying about anything except the inlet and outlet barbs 
on the bottom(very delicate!).  Lift straight up as far as possible and 
pull it back toward the back of the bus.  IIRC, you should be able to lift 
it up and actually see underneath it enough to see if anything is 
dragging.  It's been in ther a long time......there is sealer around the 
edges....You can Lift it straight up, right?

Cheers, dave

 Is there any special trick or way of turning or tilting the gas tank on a '79
 in order to remove it?  The connections have be severed, tank is drained,
 engine is out. I am taking a break before I end up damaging something.  (I
 have enough work ahead of me.)

 future work etc more manageable, comfortable etc.
