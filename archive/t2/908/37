It doesn't have to be, though.  There are several technologies
available change that model.

On a similar topic - anyone try running ethanol in a late model bay?
Anyone out there running a diesel in there bus?  I've considered both
and been delicately close to try to fit a rabbit/jetta turbo diesel in
my Westy.  I was talked out of it though.  Now that I've decided to
sell my A6 wagon, I will likely revisit the topic again.
