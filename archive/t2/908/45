Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Clearance

     Volkswagen changed the head design of the 40 horse engine in 1963, to a
fixed rocker arm stud I believe. With this change the valve gap was
tightened from .008 inch to .004 inch. Although the same maintenance
interval of 3000 miles was kept.
     With this tighter valve gap Volkswagen found that the incidence of the
valves tightening up was much more prevalent. They decided this was due to a
lack of maintenance at the 3000 mile point,..........hence the .006 valve
spec!
     You can run the .004 inch gap with no problem, it's less noisy, just
keep your eye on the mileage.
     "We love to clean and adjust our points, valves, and change our oil
every 3000 miles." (as per ad in the popular magazines) Don't forget your
air filter, brake and clutch adjustment, lube the door hinges, front end,
transmission oil, etc, etc, etc,...........................! YOU DID SAY
EVERY 3000 MILES, RIGHT?

Sure makes my old junk Chevy PU easy to live with. It does a "self oil
change", I just change the filter every so often, and keep it toped off with
40 wt oil in between!
