Subject: Re: Bus Front Beam...to lower or not

People with lowered front ends on other vehicles have reported difficulty 
getting up on ramps to perform inspections and maintenance. This is a 
universal problem with modern cars that are already built with front 
fairings low to the ground, such as a Mercedes E Class, etc.   Owners use 
adaptations like long low slope heavy boards to get up onto portable 
commercial ramps in their driveways.  One guy uses 2 x 4's.   Consider 
being able to get your lowered vehicle up onto a portable ramp as  a factor 
in "how low can I go..."

or so?....if I
buy the lowered front end how far can I go using stock parts?  is there any
advantage to the lowered front end? ....snip....... Mike Quackenbush
