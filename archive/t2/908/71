Hi Mike,

I have a complete front beam out of a 75.  I pulled the arms so that I could 
replace the ball joints and then swap them for the worn ones that were on 
the van but I have the entire beam as a unit.  Beam is common to 72-79. 
There is a difference between 73 and 75 though.  They made the brake booster 
larger in 75 and moved the support a little offset so accomodate.  I was 
trying to mount a 75 brake booster on a 73 beam and it didn't clear.  Let me 
know if your interested.
