Subject: Oil dipstick blocking rear plate removal on '78 bus

Hi,

I'm trying to remove the fan casing on the engine of my 1978 bus, and 
I'm running into trouble with the oil dipstick -- I've gotten all the 
screws loose and it's still hanging by the oil stick. How can I remove 
the dipstick to get the back plate off? Anyone have any tips?

Thanks,
Greg
