Funny you should say that...I was motivatin' over the road the other day
and was passed by a Honda with the Full-Tilt Boy Racer package...Lowered,
wiiide wheels with rubberband tires, enough scoops, dams, and wings to em-
barrass an F-16, and the obligatory 3 lb. coffee can exhaust...He was doin'
alright 'til he hit a dip in the road, bottomed out and proceeded to drive
over his own front air dam... ;-(
