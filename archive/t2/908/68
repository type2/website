Subject: Quality of AA Piston and Cylinders

I'm looking for some new pistons and cylinders for my overhaul I'm  
doing for my 77 westy. I was mining my way through eBay and keep  
seeing these "AA" piston and cylinder sets that sell for about $169.  
Anyone used them or know of their quality level?

Thanks
-Chris
