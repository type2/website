Just  wondering if the mounting studs are the same size for the 30pict  and
28pict? I am about to start looking for another carb to put on my 1200,  and
want to know what will fit or not fit on the stock intake  manifold.
Thanks,



hey Courney  yes they are the same,  only ones different are the  ones that 
had a governor and the studs are long in that case  later   mark dearing
