I would definitely fix this problem ASAP and not drive the bus until so.

I had a 1970 Beetle that caught fire because of this. I was fortunate
enough to be able to extinguish the fire with water that a friend had
with him.  I was lucky and only had to replace all the engine compartment
wiring. Blistered the paint too.
