Subject: transaxle compatibility

quick question, i did search through the archives for a while but was
not getting an answer directly.

I have a 74 bus with a T4 engine (1800), I have access to a transaxle
that is in a 68, a 3-rib I believe. Can I use this transaxle in my 74?

I need to move on this tomorrow so a speedy response from anyone with
the information would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance,'


Matthew
