Until or unless he converted the rear to later Bay or Vanagon brakes, 
yeah.  Or
possibly 5x205->5x112 adapter -- not the best, but if it's only for the 
spare he
could probably get away with it.

OTOH, a frequent objection in regards to putting discs on the front of 
a pre-'71
is the lack of a brake booster.  To me, it would make sense to keep the 
booster
flange on the beam (if possible) for use in converting to the late Bay 
disc/drum
brakes if there's a decent chance it would at least be considered.  
Much easier
to leave something on than to cut it off and possibly re-install it 
later. :-)
