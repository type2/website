The AA cylinders have recently gotten better, though how long it'll 
take for
the redesigned ones to get throughout the supply chain is anyone's 
guess.
You can read a bit about it at

The biggest other issue I'm aware of with the AA sets is that they're 
shipped
with Grant rings, which (IMO) suck.

I did some searches on the AA p/c sets on Samba and Shoptalkforums.com,
and while I didn't find anyone raving about them being *good*, I didn't 
find
anyone ranting about them being *bad* either.  Still, people must be 
buying
'em .. or else they wouldn't still be on teh market.
