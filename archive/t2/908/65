Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank Removal

you guys sure are funny!  All the lines, hoses and wires had been removed 
and clear of the working area.  But still wouldn't clear the metal fuel 
lines at the bottom.  My guess is that a PO had changed the angle or 
modified them slightly, because I was nearly 1\4" short of space.  All I 
could think of was when the GWB fell off the axle stands........

The bad news, it broke off.  The good news, it was probably ready to go.

So can this be repaired?  A new one braised on (probably do both for good 
measure)  This work would not be done by me.  I would guess that this would 
need to be done before I do the POR treatment/ sealing.
