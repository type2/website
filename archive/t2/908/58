Hi Volks,

Well, Elvis has left the building once again, and Buses Of the Corn  
2006 has been put to bed. We had 63 buses on-site at one time or  
another, and about 150 people in total.

The weather was great. My keg of Red Cup Ale tasted greatl. All the  
scheduled events went well, except for the Bocce Tournament which  
never materialized. We wound up tweaking Franklin's timing instead.

The Tie-Dye shirts were the best yet... people really seem to be  
getting the technique down perfect.

Here's a few pics to hold you over until I have time to write up a  
complete trip report:

Thanks to all who attended, to my helpful staff and Family, and to  
our Sponsors: GermanSupply.com and Suburban Design Core.

A good time was had by all.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
