Got it...But another Google down welding lane
tells me that the Henrob torch may/may not
be all it's cracked up to be...The welding for-
ums I read were pretty much in agreement that
the skill of the welder (in real use or at trade
shows), was the deciding factor...In any event,
I'm just passing the info on to a welder who had
heard of the torch and asked about it...
Thanks anyway... ;-)
