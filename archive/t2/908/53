Subject: Wiper adjustment and horn help

Hey, this is my first time posting on this list, and I have little (succesful) experience in vw maintenance, so bear with me. For the record, I have a '78 transporter, don't know the engine type, but it's recently rebuilt.  : D

So now for the problems: 

Problem 1.) One of the wipers don't move at all, and the other one goes too far, below the window.  I know it's not the motor, because I replaced it and it still does it.  What I need to figure out is how to get the one wiper moving, and once I do that, how to adjust them.  I have the bentley and how to keep your vw alive, but neither are much help.

Problem 2.) The horn doesn't work at all.  It used to work, sort of, but one day I was honking it (just for fun) and it started to sound like a dying moose till it just stopped all together.  I was wondering if anyone knew how to tell if I need to replace the horn itself or if it's just the wiring.  

Thanks for your help!
