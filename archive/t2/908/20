Not a difficult fix.

Clean the carb and tube with carb cleaner.  Get it clean clean!

Roll the tube between a coarse file and a rough surface to put a bit of
"knurl" in the metal where the tube goes into the carb.

Mix up a bit of JB-Weld (or other gasoline-proof epoxy).

Apply a thin film of JB-Weld to the knurled area of the tube.

Tap the tube into the carburator.

Let cure for a day or so.

Put things back together.


This also works for pressed-in fittings on fuel pumps.  If you have these,
give them a firm tug to see if they are loose as well.  Might as well fix
them all at the same time!
