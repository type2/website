Subject: CV Joints, should best one go inside (trans) or outside (wheel)

I am servicing my CV joints.  I discovered that I had two pretty old  
ones, and two pretty new ones.  One of the old ones had gouges, so I  
purchased a replacement new one.

My question is should I put my one old CV joint on the inside (bolted  
to the wheel) or the inside (bolted to the trans)?

Thanks,

Bob H.
