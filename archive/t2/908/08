We would need to know exactly which lowered front end you're talking about.

The ideal solution to lowering is with drop spindles and that wouldn't
require a new front beam (though you said you need one anyway). Adjustable
beams lower by changing the geometry of your suspension. Drop spindles just
relocate the wheel to a different location while maintaining the original
geometry.

Is there a benefit to lowering? Aside from appearances, probably not. You do
lower your center of gravity a bit. Is it enough to do any good? Probably
not.
