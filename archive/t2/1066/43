Subject: Buses Of The Corn Pre-Registration T-shirt Offer

Hi Volks,

The conservation authority who own and operate the park where we hold 
BOTC wants all the $$$ upfront and paid by visa. And of course the web 
hosting company that supports busesofthecorn.com is also looking for 
cash; so the website is down at the moment.

What does this mean to you?

Well, as a means to resolve the funding shortage I am offering an 
incentive to pre-register and save some $$$ on a great weekend of VW 
camping this August.

Here's the deal: $25 ($Cdn) gets you an all-inclusive weekend pass AND a 
T-shirt!  Unfortunately I don't have the T-shirt designed yet, and even 
if I did I still don't have a website to host it. But you can rest 
assured that this limited edition item will be both functional and 
fashionable and the envy of all your VW -fanatic friends. The 
limited-edition BOTC T-shirt has sold out every year since it was 
introduced in 2003.

BOTC 2009 will be held at Heber Down Conservation Area in Brooklin 
Ontario Canada on August 7th-9th, 2009. If you're considering attending 
this offer can save you $$$. This offer will only remain until end of 
the week, or until the funds required for the webserver and campsite 
fees have been recieved, which ever is later. Please act swiftly to 
ensure your registration is accepted.

To preregister, send $25CDN via paypal to greg-potts AT rogers.com

Thanks!

P.S. If your T-shirt drawer is stuffed to overflowing and you can't 
stand the idea of one more shirt in your underwear inventory I can also 
accept a shirtless weekend pre-registration for a mere $15 $CDN.
