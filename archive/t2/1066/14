Subject: Shots of Eagles on Vancouver Island and - - -

I have a very well travelled friend who lives on the Island here. He ALWAYS
comes up with amazing pics, and here are some of eagles, and another small
video that is really neat. I just had to share.

This video is supposed to be the Canadian Prairies, but I'm not sure of it's
authenticity. It could be prairies in many places, but it's still neat.
