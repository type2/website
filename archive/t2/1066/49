Subject: Tinwork Screws

Hey guys,

     Sorry to post three messages all at once, but I just discovered that JC Whitney also sells brand new sheet metal screws for the tin work. Just thought I'd mention it. 

I'm pretty sure I ordered those sheet metal screws from The Bus Depot a year or so back... but for some dumb reason, I lost the entire bag... (no idea how because I keep my garage spotless).

Anyway, I went back to order them again, and couldn't find them on the site. I did find them on JC Whitney.

They're $5.99 for a pack.


Todd
