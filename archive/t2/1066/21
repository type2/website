Subject: Looking for someone in the Spencer OK area

If anyone out there lives around Spencer I'd like to be able to get some 
info regarding VW repair in and around Spencer .DURING THE  early 
1990s.  I've trace my bus back to that city and that time frame.  I'm 
just trying to find the name of the previous owner.  White, 
Westfalia,1971 with pop-top.

If you don't mind sending a phone number I'll give you a call.

Thanks,
Pat
