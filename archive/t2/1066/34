  78 2.0L F.I. it was warm on sunday, so i broke out the timing light and
compression tester to what the deal is with my bus and cold starts, ( she'll
run for a bout 8 seconds at high throttle when it first starts then winds down
to what sounds like a 3 cylinder sputter. if i feather the gas til shes warm
shes fine..) so i believe my bus is supposed to be set to 7.5 btdc, and the
bentley just sux on this subject.. so at idle its at 28 btdc ?! i tried to
spin it forward til it read 7.5 but the bus just wanted to die. so i put it
back to 28 btdc. it was advancing well by about 10 -15 degrees when pulled on
the throttle cable.. so does this mean someone put the dist in 180 to where
its supposed to be

NO..... it means your centrifugal advance is frozen fully advanced.  The
advance you get when you open the throttle is vacuum advance.

Get some rust penetrent and carb scleaner spray.  NOT WD 40.  Get PB Blaster
or Kroil or Wurth Rust Off. Even liquid Liquid Wrench in a bottle.

Remove the dist cap. Grab the rotor and try to rotate either way. Probably
no.
Remove the rotor. Look in the center. See that light brown felt pad? You were
supposed to put a few drops of oil there like during each oil change [but
don't feel bad, no one else does either!].
Take an ice pick and lift out that pad. Fill the opening with penetrent. Let
it sit for a few minutes. Refill when it runs down.
Get a rag and wrap it around the base of the distributor. The bottom has drain
holes to let the liquids out.
Put the rotor back on and try twisting again back and forth.
Remove rotor, refill with penetrent. Let sit.

When you finally get the rotor to move, use the carb spray down the hole to do
the final clean up.

Then put the pad back and wet it with engine oil.
