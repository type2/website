Subject: [Q] Engine Installation

Group-

I'm starting to think about my engine installation.  The advice I recall
usually sounds like "don't worry, it's easy".

Without my shop manual in front of me, I'm trying to think through the
connections that are not self-contained (i.e. not isolated to the engine
compartment).  I'm probably missing some obvious items, but here's my list:

accelerator linkage
optional sensor wires
   - engine compartment temperature
   - oil temperature
   - oil pressure
   - rpm

O.K., what have I left out?  From my list is looks like all that is
required outside of the "self-contained" area is the accelerator linkage.
(I consider the fuel line to be part of the engine compartment since the
tank is mounted in such close proximity.)

P.S.  Maybe I should include the clutch linkage in my list.
