Also, it's worth mentioning that while you could have a frozen advance 
like Karl mentioned (which you should definitely check), you could also 
have the wrong distributor in there.  I believe that the 009 is off by 
90 degrees.

Does your distributor have a vacuum can on it.  You might want to pull 
it out and send the list the part number on the distributor so we can 
verify that you have the correct part.  You can also verify you 
distributor here:

Make sure you have the correct distributor first as that can make a 
world of difference!
