The fuse should be right sized to protect the wire.B 



So if the fuse blows, just get one of the spares you carry, and replace, and
remove one of the items.



-or take resistance values or obtain current draw for each, and calculate
theB current draw of all items,B also be sure to figure the rated load of the
wire by determining what gauge it is.B 









Todds Question:

The only question I have is this... how much can the ignition wire handle?
