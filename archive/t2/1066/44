Add one tiny step to Mike's procedure just to remove all doubt.

Remove the spark plug from cylinder  #1. Take a wooden or plastic 
dowel, say 1/4" in diameter and > 7cm long. Push it into the hole 
vacated by the spark plug and let it slide in your hand as you or a 
helper turn the engine and watch the rockers. As the piston 
approaches  TDC on the compression stroke, the rockers won't move. 
When the dowel is at its high point, this is TDC.
