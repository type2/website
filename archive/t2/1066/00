Subject: Re: [T2] Pressure in the fuel tank

hmm,, I was under the impression that the caps are NOT vented.. could be
wrong,, someone will chime in .

I have a fuel rail connected to my 74 carb [single outlet] tank... the
return is via a vent line on the top..

when I did that.. the tank didn't vent properly,,  so.. I drilled a small
hole in the inside lip of the gas cap,, to make it a vented cap!

I think your tank vents might be plugged,, capped off.. routed wrong,,,  a
stock 74 tank shouldn't have negative pressure
