Subject: Selling stuff, what is it worth?

Hey guys,

     I'm going through some major life changes now that my first child is born. NO, I am NOT getting rid of the Bus. But I am getting rid of a lot of stuff I do not need.

I've got a 73 Transporter with an 1800cc hydraulic lifter motor in it. Currently, it's got a Webber progressive carb on it, and it runs pretty well (truth be told). 

However, when I first bought the Bus, it came with a set of brand new, never used, dual single carburetors (one goes on each side). It came with the manifolds, the carburetors, the air filters, and some other odds and ends (along with new gaskets).

Now, I'm not sure exactly what carbs they are, but I'm thinking of putting them up for sale on eBay.

I'm wondering what these are worth new (depending on brand, obviously) and what a reasonable price I should sell them for on eBay.

I thought about keeping them, and eventually using them, but the Bus runs so well with the Webber, that I just don't see the point really of upgrading.


Thanks guys..

Todd
