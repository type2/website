Subject: Cleaning Valves

Hi,

Wondering how to clean the valves on my 81 Air Cooled Engine.

I pulled the heads and intend to simply lap the valves and reinstall them.
Yes, I should have a pro do it, but I'm not gonna do that.

I have the valves out, and of course they are carbon covered, and I want to
clean them up. Any suggestions as to how to go about doing that? What kind
of solvent might clean them up. I cannot even get the face of valve clean in
order to put the lapping tool on it, so I seek wisdom and experience.

Thanks for any help or suggestions.

John
