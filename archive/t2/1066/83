I figured I should fix my post.  I have a 41 as the aux and a 42 for 
starting.  Any Group 42 or 41 battery fits. Group 41 is the larger capacity.

That said, I should really have a deep cycle for the aux battery, but I 
*thought* that my 41 battery went bad and bought the 42, moving the 41 
to the other side.  When I was still getting poor starts, I changed out 
all my wires and that fixed that problem.

It doesn't hurt to get a descent charger that will maintain charge, 
desulfate, and equalize the battery.  Do this every 6 months to keep 
your battery top-notch.  Also, make sure you keep everything clean - 
take the batteries out and clean them with baking soda and make sure 
they are full with water.  Doesn't hurt to check each cell with a 
hydrometer to verify all cells are operating well.  Even though they say 
maintenance free, you still need to maintain them.  Add distilled water 
so it's level with the bottom of the tube.  ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!

Might have been more info than you needed, but I figured it couldn't 
hurt to mention it :)
