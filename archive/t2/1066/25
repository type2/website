Subject: bay z-bed in a splitty

Anyone put a z-bed from a bay into a splitty .. I know they fit but I want
it to fit perfectly .. I did it before and it isn't an exact fit .. like the
z-bed is a little higher or lower or something .. and I made it work with
different thicknesses of foam .. I do not want to do that .. I want to use
the hinges the bay z-bed and I want the plywood to be exactly level with the
over-the-engine bay metal so I can use identical foam on each ..  anyone do
such a thing? Anyone have place for such a thing?

 

 

TIA
