Subject: Re: [T2] Champagne edition westies

No real answer but I've owned two so not that uncommon 8-)
 
I miss them both though, does anyone (not that there is anyone here) know what
happened to the one I raffled off years ago to support Charlie Ford's big
adventure back in the day?  I took it down to a then listmember around
Lexington Park MD, probably 10 years ago now, has anyone seen one down there? 
It was tired, beginning to rust (at old professional body work locations) but
by east coast standards was still a very solid restoreable camper.  I hope it
got some use before it got junked at least.  This one has some outrageous gold
striping on the sides, a wildlife federation panda sticker in the rear window,
and had a DPD underdash A/C (which I wish I had kept as it was much superior
to the VW Cool system while it worked.)  Anyone own or see one like it around
southern MD?
