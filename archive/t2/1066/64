Subject: Bus restoration

Hi list,

  I currently have a 1974 VW Bus Sportsmobile.  It is 100% original and used
to be my daily drive until a few years ago.  I regretfully have let it sit
for the last couple of years and now.  The bus is currently residing in
northern indiana.  I am trying to find a good quality and ok priced
restoration shop to bring it to.  I would like as complete of a restoration
as possible without spending over 10k dollars.  if anyone has any
suggestions for a good shop that is fair in price please let me know. I am
willing to trailer the bus a pretty far distance to make this happen.

Thanks,

jason
