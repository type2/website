I appreciate all the input on cleaning the valves. Lots of good ideas.

At the moment, I have discovered that the 'usual' valve spring compressor
doesn't really do the job, and I am unable to get the keepers out as it
cannot compress the spring quite enough, so I will have to order one of the
more complex ones, that holds the valve face, and compresses the spring
completely. Its frustrating in that the loaner compressor I got from
Autozone, -almost' does the job, but I need a bit more compression to get
the keepers out. Got one done with it, but it takes forever to do, so I will
wait for the better tool to arrive and do it easier.

Much obliged as always, for the time and sharing of information.

John
