Subject: timing

78 2.0L F.I.
it was warm on sunday, so i broke out the timing light and compression
tester to what the deal is with my bus and cold starts, ( she'll run for a
bout
8 seconds at high throttle when it first starts then winds down to what
sounds like a 3 cylinder sputter. if i feather the gas til shes warm shes
fine..)
so i believe my bus is supposed to be set to 7.5 btdc, and the bentley just
sux on this subject..
so at idle its at 28 btdc ?!  i tried to spin it forward til it read 7.5 but
the bus just wanted to die. so i put it back to 28 btdc.
it was advancing well by about 10 -15 degrees when pulled on the throttle
cable..
so does this mean someone put the dist in 180 to where its supposed to be
..my plug config on the dist is
4 3
1 2   if memory isnt too hazed from cold medicine....Joe  ( 78kombi)
