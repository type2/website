Subject: anyone have engine tin you want to get rid of?

Hey,

I have a 1979 CA bus and I'm looking for the engine tin that covers the
pushrods and thermostat on the bottom of the passenger side of the
motor.  The 79 CA tin peice is different than the 75-78 and 79 federal part,
but it looks to be the same as the 72-74 tin.  Does anyone have one they'd
be willing to part with and sell to me?  I've checked ebay, the samba, my
local VW parts yard guy and a couple of VW parts web sites, all to no avail
- I realized I should ask here!

Let me know,
Nick
