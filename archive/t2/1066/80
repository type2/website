Subject: Champagne buses and Westies.

You need to specify CE I  and CE II.

Champagne Edition I were available in 1977.  Very hard to define except by the
M code plate.

Supposedly built between vin 118500
and 300000  build code S723 only in
4803 Agate Brown.

I have 3 vins lower than 118500.....  lowest so far is
104794.  That is why I wrote 'supposedly'.



Champagne Edition II were available in mid 78, earliest I show is 1/78.  Easy
to spot because of the brown dash.  One farce going around is that there are
only 5000 made, 2500 bus and 2500 Westy. Not sure where that urban legend
started.

Supposed to start at vin 070001 and is
build code S765.

Lowest vin I have so far is 079444 and the highest
is 116262


I have been trying to keep track of them so if anyone has the last six of the
vin and the build date, email me at aufever(-at-)hotmail.com
