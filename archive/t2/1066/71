Subject: Looking for a 76-79 bus

Hey all,

I'm in the process of redoing my 78 Westy, and I'm wondering if anyone has
or knows of a relatively rust free donor bus. Primarily I'm looking for
straight doors and hatches, but if I found a clean enough bus, I would use
the chassis as well. Mine is pretty clean, but does have some pretty rotten
doglegs. Or if anyone has doors and hatches available that are clean, that
would be another path. So far I've gone through the Samba, Craigslist (using
craigshelper.com), eb(-at-)y and auto trader. I'm looking to get something for
under 1k, or if it is drivable, under 2k. I'm in New Hampshire, but willing
to travel.

Anyone have a neighbor who has a bus out back that hasn't moved in years?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Ned
