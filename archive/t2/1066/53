If you have the stock black coil, yes.  It has an internal ballast 
resistor.  Some of the aftermarket "Bosch Blue" coils out there are 
reputed to not have the internal resistor.   Put your ohmmeter on the 
primary and secondary terminals of the coil...you'll see right away if 
the resistor is present.

That said, if you didn't have the resistor in your coil, you'd have 
probably fried your points anyway... ;)
