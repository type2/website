Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning Valves

No need for the oven cleaner. Stiff wire brush in a standing drill  
press will do the job. I find that the hard deposits come off easier  
with the wire brush than softened goo.

Check you valves first - wear marks on the stems, pitting where they  
hit the valve seats, wear on the valve (discard if they have a sharp  
edge or getting close to). There should be a noticeable vertical edge  
around the perimeter of the valve. Check whether the surface where  
they meet the valve seat is straight by holding the stem of another  
valve perpendicular to it. If light shows, you need to grind them,  
too. Check your guides for play.  It is a good idea to drop the  
valves on a hard (concrete) floor. If they break, you want them to  
break there and not in #3.
