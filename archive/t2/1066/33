Subject: Memorial Service For Michele Moriarty

Friends,

Some of you already know that my wife Michele died recently after a nine
year struggle with cancer.

She loved VW buses of all types, especially our Syncro Westfalia in which we
enjoyed many, many adventures together.  Until she became ill she enjoyed
hosting our annual holiday parties when dozens of buses would descend on our
neighborhood, and she invented the splittie cookie just for the event.  Just
a few months ago she was talking avidly about finally getting going on the
restoration of our 1964 Standard.

We will hold a memorial service for Michele this Sunday, February 15 at 3PM
at the Universalist National Memorial Church, 1810 16th St. NW, Washington
DC. Parking is tight in this very urban spot, but I still intend to take my
syncro.

Take care,

Tom Forhan
