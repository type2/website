Subject: Re: anyone have engine tin you want to get rid of?

Nick asked:  I have a 1979 CA bus and I'm looking for the engine tin that
covers the pushrods and thermostat on the bottom of the passenger side of the
motor. The 79 CA tin peice is different than the 75-78 and 79 federal part,
but it looks to be the same as the 72-74 tin. Does anyone have one they'd be
willing to part with and sell to me? I've checked ebay, the samba, my local VW
parts yard guy and a couple of VW parts web sites, all to no avail - I
realized I should ask here!  Let me know,Nick  ------------------------------

How many do you want?

The only difference between the 72-74 and the 79 right lower tin is the 72-74
has a hole in it for the 3rd line off the fuel pump.

You could have put up a want ad on the Samba, I constantly look at them.
