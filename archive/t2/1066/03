Exactly.
 
I'll chime in that either way is possible although the vacuum is far more
likely.  You can probably tell though, with pressure, the cap will actually
pop off a bit when you open it, you should/will know.  As conjectured it is
often temp related.  It can be a real problem with carbs, scenario is full new
tank of gas, filled in the AM cool morning on a short drive, not long enough
to use much fuel.  Vents no longer functioning, heat of day progresses, parked
in the sun, gas expands, easily overcomes needle pressure on carbs, floods
(possibly out of carb depending on design.)  Can burn your engine down, can
spill gas into cylinders causing lack of lubrication and damage, can even fill
the crankcase (engine "makes" oil) on some vehicles.  But this is an FI
retrofit so anyway.

the cap itself may not be vented, but the tank is vented
