Subject: Looking for PO of my 71 Westy - was in Spencer OK now

I'm trying to locate a PO (and likely the original owner) of my 71 
Westy.  In the 1990s that PO, prior to moving to California,  sold the 
vehicle to Larry's VW in Spenser OK; in 2008 they called Larry (from 
California) to find out if he still had the camper so it's obvious they 
would be happy to know that it's still alive and well in South 
Carolina.  I hope someone can help me make contact with this 
person/family.  

Thanks,
Pat
