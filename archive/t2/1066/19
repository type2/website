John if you want a factory Matra one for the T4, I have 2 and I can spare one
(I think I've seen them around since the AK move.)  Do not have the bar for it
(which is just a $5 1/2" steel rod from Lowes.)  I gave $50 10+ years ago,
would want near the same.  But FWIW the best multi purpose ones I've found are
this one.

sold as snap-on, K-D, Lisle over the years but probably all made by the same
US company.  In fact I might be picking this one up as I have only one set of
tips/fingers for mine of this style.  This does a wonderfull job, any head,
any style with head off car.  I've used it on VW T1, T4, A1 (rabbit), my
Triumph TR4, and chevy heads since I've got it.  Fast, slick, works great,
MUCH better than any stupid on the car sort.  The Matra one works fast and
slick as well, but only does VW T4 heads of course, but will do them on the
car (not that there is any reason to on a T4 as there aren't really stem seals
to speak of to replace.)

cannot compress the spring quite enough, so I will have to order one of the
more complex ones, that holds the valve face, and compresses the spring
