Don't know anything about them but thanks for the link... Might want to use 
them in the future... We have a general purpose resto shop here in town 
called:

http://www.midsr.com/

Once upon a time I used to sweep floors there for the previous owner. Would 
occasionally get to turn wrenches. Mostly just going to college back then.
