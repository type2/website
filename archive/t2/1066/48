Subject: Ignition Power Feed???

Hey guys,

     Another quick question. I have a whole new wiring harness in my 73 VW Bus. It's actually a 71 harness since I was unable to get a 73 harness. In any case, The bus runs and drives fine, and everything appears to be wired as it should.

The only question I have is this... how much can the ignition wire handle? Specifically, I'm talking about the wire from the main harness that powers the ignition coil when the key is turned on.

I've got a couple of things hooked up to it right now, and I want to make sure I'm not overloading it.

I've got (pulling from memory here), my Purolator 4-PSI electric fuel pump wired to it and the ignition coil.

I WOULD like (if you guys think it's not going to overload that harness) the electric choke that's currently on my Webber Progressive. 

Would that be ok, or is it going to be drawing too much through that wire? If that's the case, I'm just going to wire up a relay directly to the battery, but using the power on from the ignition wire (just to be on the safe side).


Thanks!!!

Todd
