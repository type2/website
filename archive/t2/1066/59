Jeff-

Sorry about your troubles.  It makes me think I dodged a bullet -- I'm
getting the folks who painted my bus to install the windows.  It was the
window installation that closed the deal.  My rationale was that if any
paint gets scratched during the installation, it was the paint guy(s) who
did it, and who better to fix the paint?  Also, I'm learning to pick my
battles.  It'll be nice having it done for me.  (I will have to do the
driver & passenger roll-up windows, though.  I hope those aren't too hard.)

Now I've got to start thinking about installing the motor.  Yes, I'll be
doing that myself -- never performed such a task before -- there has to be
a first time...

-David

P.S.  I have to remember that confidence is what you feel before you
understand the problem!

I got mine here:

http://www.mtmfg.com

They carry the West Coast Metric seals but, unlike WCM, they had the vent
wing seals too for my 74 transporter. They also did not charge tax. I've
had a terrible time finding a reasonable installer. I can't do it myself
because my right arm is injured and I won't be able to do anything for
awhile. So far, I've taken it to three auto glass people and they know
nothing about it. Best estimate is $900.00 labor from a "restoration" shop.
People like to screw you when you own a bus. I've gotten no help at all
from any shop. I would never do this again so good luck to you.
