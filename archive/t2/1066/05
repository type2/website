You know I agree with you Mike, but my only personal experience has been the
other way.  And with a volatile liquid like gas, certainly you would think
that to be the case.  Certainly a less full can of laquer thinner,
acetone, etc always puffs up more than a full can with temp change.  But the
buses and cars I've had it happen on it has been on a full tank of gas.

I know this is being nit-picky, but wouldn't a full tank's contents
expand much less than if it were nearly empty (i.e. filled with vapor)?  From
what I remember, fluids don't expand/compress nearly as well as gases do...
