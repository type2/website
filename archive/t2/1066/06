I'll have to pay special attention next time as to whether it is  
vacuum or pressure.  I am still leaning toward pressure, but have  
nothing to back that up at this point.  I'll follow up on that. I  
don't believe the gas cap I am using has any type of venting on it, to  
clarify.

In other news, a quick glance in the engine bay shows I have no  
charcoal canister setup at all.  Something I'll need to take care of.

Peace, Troy
