For what it's worth, with very few exceptions OEVeedub and I carry the
identical seals from the same suppliers in Europe. The only difference is
price. For example, my $37.95 German windshield seal is their $49.95 one; my
$56.95 German front door seal is their $68.95 one.  (Both prices include
your 5% list member discount; email me if you aren't aware of it.)
