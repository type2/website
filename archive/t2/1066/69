is that seals tend to be very random in their quality and usefullness.
I bought two seals from bus depot at the same time from the same OEM
vendor. one went on perfectly and fit like a champ, the other 4 people
tried every trick in the book and never could get it to go, we finally
ended up using the old seal.

can't blame Ron or the other dealers they can only sell what they can
get, but quality and fit is really all over the place.

the Better dealers and this includes Ron try to take the feedback they
get from us the users to decide what to buy and to put presure where
they can on the providers.. but we are a very small market and getting
smaller.

YMMV
