Perfect scenario for using the archives at http://type2.html/archive.html

A search for 'battery' gives the following:
http://type2.com/ezmlm-archives/index.cgi?cmd=search&list=type2&terms=battery&submit=Search+type2

of which I believe you are referring to the following thread:
http://type2.com/ezmlm-archives/index.cgi?list=type2&cmd=threadindex&month=200902&threadid=mpanhpgmamkigmnnocig

In general the archives are not what they were before we moved to the  
new server.  Understand though, that we do want to make them more  
searchable than they are now :) As they stand, you can only search the  
subject line.  There are also the occasional quirks (you'll notice a  
stray email here and there that have dates belonging to another time  
frame.)  They are still useful though ;)

Peace, Troy
