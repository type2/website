Subject: 1970 camper help

Im a new list member... Hello.

I am about to receive a 1970 type 2 camper.  This will be my first aircooled
VW in a long time.  About 12 years ago I sold my 1967 panel transporter that
I drove through college - since then Ive been water cooled VW free.  Guess I
couldn't stay away.  I miss project time.  This 70 comes as a deal I can't
refuse.  Cosmetically it is pretty solid shape.  I will later have some
questions about it that I hope list members might be able to assist me
with.  There are some interesting features and accessories.

The bus doesn't run right now.  Sat for 2 years, with gas removed from
tank.

I travel nationally with a music group and met the owner through that
association.  We are separated by about 1000 miles.  So Im not able to be
with this VW.  I considered going to her and towing her back to my home
where I would tinker with her but am now leaning towards having a local VW
service shop inspect her, rebuild the engine and I'll fly down and drive her
home.  I have been told a diagnosis of what someone believes the problem to
be, but without being there I can only assume.

With that said first I wondered if any list members had experience with this
particular service shop in Pensacola Florida.  I know this is a loaded
opinion question so please feel free to reply privately.  It is just that Im
going to spend a good chunk of money with a given service shop and am
placing a great deal of trust in a service person based primarily on
location.  So some anecdotal advice would be appreciated.  The shop is
Phetteplace VW.  Anyone familiar?  Thanks.  Feel free to reply to
