Subject: Petronix installation?

I just installed a petronix (almost). It was a slight PITA since I had to remove the dizzy to get the new wire grommet in the hole.

The last step is to hook up the positive (red) wire. It gives two different instructions...one for if I have a ballast resistor, another without a resistor.

So...do I have a ballast resistor?

Thanks
