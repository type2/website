42.  :P

I remember trying to find out that number some time back.  The closest I
  ever got was finding a thread on TS that roughly determined the
production dates as being between January and April 1978.  As to how the
actual production numbers...well...guess away!

On a sad note, just last weekend I came across a champagne westie
sitting in a juniper grove.  It had been rolled, and was pretty well
stripped.  A shame, too, because there wasn't a lick of rust on the chassis.

PS - Chris (-at-) bustedbus has a beautiful champagne westie.  Maybe he'll
see this and post a link to some pics.
