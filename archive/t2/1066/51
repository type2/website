Subject: Need some Vw/Msd installation help

I have the MSD 6A ignition module, and a Petronix  unit in an 009 dizzy, and a
Flame thrower coil.  If anyone else on the list has used this set up, prmarily
the "box", and Petronix unit, I need to know....if they still have the
instructions for installation...if the diagram on last page showing dizzy with
Petronix is the one I need to use?  Diagram states Red "box" to red on dizzy,
white from box to black on dizzy, orange from "box" to Positive on coil, black
from box to negative on coil, Heavy red to Battery pos. and Heavy black to Bat
Neg.  Thanks.
Syd
