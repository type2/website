I have not done the verification of TDC with the dizzy thats in there, since
i do have a svda (according to #s and the old volks home, bosch # 231 170
093 is for 1800 L jetronic) but i can use this for the 78 FI,
so opinions please,
Q-keep the mechanical advance, with pertronix (part numbers not known yet)
OR put the svda in with points or svda with pertronix?
i figure if im gonna take it out i should put in the one thats best
suited..and no its not frozen advance!
and yes the plenum is good.
thanks Joe ( 78kombi)
