Subject: RE: [T2] [Q] Window Seals

I am making progress on my bus project!  It is now painted, and I am almost
ready to install glass!  Almost, that is, except that I need to locate a
good source for seals.

The websites I have are:
www.busdepot.com
www.jbugs.com
www.wolfsburgwest.com
shop.westcoastmetric.com

> I just replaced some door seals with the German ones from BD, they fit
better than the others in my opinion. Use whatever German seals you can
find.
