Jeff-

I guess I've been lucky, although not all farmed-out jobs have gone
perfectly.  My only issue thus far has been the need for patience.  I've
found guys who will do the work, some more reasonably priced than others,
but all in all that hasn't been my issue.  My issue has been that I have to
wait a *loooong* time for work to get done.

The refreshing exception to this rule has been the paint shop.  They got
done ahead of schedule!  Hang in there.

Right. The paint and body shop window guy could not do the job. He was, in
a word, incompetent. I had to drive it 35 miles with no windows and 35
degree temps to another shop. Of course, the heater doesn't work and that
is on the endless list. I went and or called to 8 restoration shops and no
one wanted the job. Where's the bad economy? Not in body shops. They were
all "too busy' and way arrogant. It has sucked and like I said, it just
isn't worth it and I really love this bus. This only scrapes the surface of
what I have had happen in the year I have been doing this. The type2 folks
were the only ones that helped me at all especially Richard Atwell. All the
other VW places just wanted my money and cared little for the bus. Sad.
