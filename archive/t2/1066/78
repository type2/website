Subject: Wheel stud length?

Saw a Vw "custom" the other day, and the wheel studs looked...well...extra
long...so I am wondering...how much wheel stud should "show"...beyond the
tighttened rim nut?  Why were those ones so long? "Native engineering" sugests
that if there are enough threads to fill the wheel nut...then why use more?
Cheers.
