Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Power Feed???

I'd go the route of the relays just so you have the full 12 volts going to the 
ignition system for hotter spark. Dunno if you have fuel injection but 
doesn't it also draw it's operating power off of the + side of the coil? 

Bentley's schematics will show that. That was a painful to learn skill way, 
way back when. That'll come up in EE too. VBG! The Navy taught me. Was an 
Electrician's Mate way back when. Started out in EE at college. The heavy 
math scared me off to a manufacturing degree instead. 

Anyhow if you don't got the relays route - Airic is completely right. And heat 
is a good measure of wire capability. Could just grab a wire and if it 
doesn't burn you... Just kidding.
