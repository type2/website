Subject: Re: [T2] Pressure in the fuel tank

I was trying to say,,,, the tank may NOT be vented as it should be...

ah... I found mud wasps like nesting in the open ends of those vent tubes
.... as some folks do not run a complete tank vent system out to the
charcoal filter canister..

also,,, I have found some folks cap off unknow tubes and hoses in the engine
bay... which are the tank vents that should go the charcoal canister....
which is missing....

When I hear the hiss...  I take the vent system apart at the point it exits
from the tank side of the firewall... and take the cap off.. and I blow air
in that line.. and have someone listen to the filler hole to hear the air
going into the tank....

this may not be a goood thing if it is full of mud,, as that mud may blow
into the tank....   whoooops...
