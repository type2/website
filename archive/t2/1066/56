Subject: [Q] Window Seals

Group-

I am making progress on my bus project!  It is now painted, and I am almost
ready to install glass!  Almost, that is, except that I need to locate a
good source for seals.

The websites I have are:
www.busdepot.com
www.jbugs.com
www.wolfsburgwest.com
shop.westcoastmetric.com

I'm sure most, if not all, of these sources will have what I need.
However, I wanted to hear from the group about experiences (e.g. quality,
price, etc.).  I will, at some point, need all new seals for the bus, but
thought I'd order just seals for the windows to get started.

Thoughts?
