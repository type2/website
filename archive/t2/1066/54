You scare me Airic... especially because all this mumbo jumbo you speak of is
something I'm going to need to learn in order to finish my EE degree!!!

Thanks for the info. I know it's a heavier gauge wire than everything else,
and I've seen in other cases that people piggy back off the ignition coil
hot... I'll check it out...

  The fuse should be right sized to protect the wire.



  So if the fuse blows, just get one of the spares you carry, and replace, and
remove one of the items.



  -or take resistance values or obtain current draw for each, and calculate
the current draw of all items, also be sure to figure the rated load of the
wire by determining what gauge it is.









  Todds Question:

  The only question I have is this... how much can the ignition wire handle?
