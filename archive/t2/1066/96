Subject: Weber 34 ICT Kit for sale, $195 

Hey guys,

     Hope you don't mind me posting an eBay auction on here. I'm selling my
Weber 34 ICT dual carb kit on eBay.
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=270345237332

I would really like to use it, but I'm trying to get rid of things I don't
absolutely need and my Bus runs really well with my Weber 2-bbl progressive
right now.


Thanks,

Todd
