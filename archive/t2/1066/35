You have your plugs off by 90 degrees.  It's supposed to be:

3 2
4 1

1 and 2 cables cross each other as they go to their cylinders, 3 and 4 
cables go straight to their cylinders.  You can verify the cylinder 
numbers as the their stamped in the sheet metal near the holes for the 
spark plugs.  The cylinders are numbered:

3 1
4 2

First thing is take off the little distributor cap and look at the rim 
of the distributor.  There should be a line.. that should be pointing 
towards about 4:30 (towards back of bus).  If it's not pointing in that 
direction, spin the distributor so it's roughly pointing in that 
direction.  This is the mark for the #1 plug cord.  Put the cap back on 
and put the #1 plug in where that mark would be.  Then counting around 
the distributor (clockwise rotation), add on the rest of the cables 
using the firing order stamped on the sheet metal just to left of the 
distributor (1-4-3-2) as your guide.
