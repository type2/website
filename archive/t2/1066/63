Subject: looking for a front grill trim for a Deluxe bus

Hello to you all.

I'm looking for a front grill trim in good condition.
If anyone in this list has one, please let me know.
I will need you to shipp it to Europe.
To avoid it from being damage, it's better to shipp it with the grill
itself...
Thank you.
Cheers,

Joao
