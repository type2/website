Doh! Of course! Forgot that one - got it from the '79
motor, too.

I'd also recommend 4 new copper exhaust-port gaskets,
and make sure the tops of the exhaust manifolds all
line up by putting them on a flat surface (probably
will be OK if new, but worth checking). 

I also ground off some material on the tops of the
stud-hole lugs that are attached to the manifolds, so
they wouldn't bottom out on the stud mounts before the
port sealed tightly.

Now, did I forget anything else?? :-)
