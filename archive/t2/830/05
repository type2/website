I think I want to disagree with that statement for the '71.

Unlike the '76-'78 the '71 bus stock distributor, retard range is
11-13 degrees, while advance range is only 2-5 degrees (i measured 2
degrees on mine). Hence if the retard breaks, the benefits of a stock
vacuum dizzy is mostly gone. At idle, retard is typically ~10 degrees.

The 76-78 does not seem to be a push-pull advance-retard, but advance
only vacuum.

Of course, refer to this for more info

1971 Bluet - with something grinding really loud in the clutch. Will
the engine come out in 2005 or 2006 ?
