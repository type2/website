Subject: Re: [T2] Sludge in gas tank

Ratwell discusses the process on his site, but here's the abbreviated 
version;

1. Take the tank out.

2. Put a length of chain into an otherwise dry tank and shake it

3. Hose out with water. Repeat until no more gunk and varnish come out.

4. Treat the inside with dilute acid (muriatic). Neutralize, then rinse 
out.

5. Treat with POR 15 tank sealer.
