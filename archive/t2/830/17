Subject: Re: [T2] Which SVDA Distributor????

Everyone screws up those connections, that's the thing I hate the most about 
double whammy distributors.  The SVDA is so nice and simple, I love them...

The hose from the left side of the carb near the idle mixture screws goes to 
the outside fitting on the biscuit. The hose from the inside fitting(nearest 
to the dist body) on the dist biscuit goes to a spigot on the middle rear of 
the carb- you're looking straight into it when you stand behind the bus and 
stare straight ahead at the carb.
Definitely not connected to the manifold. The manifold spigot is for the 
power brake booster hose.
The bus originally had some other gizmos that are commonly not hooked up- 
that little cylinder on the left side of the engine compartment and the 
pulloff(?) diaphragm that mounts on a plate that goes under the carb. My bus 
had a diagram in the engine compartment that showed how to hook them all up 
correctly.

 Well, that explains a lot!  Now if I can only figure out where to
connect the vacuum retard (I'm assuming the advance connects to the
carb, but last year there was a major debate on where the second
vacuum supply was).  Does the vacuum retard connect to the carb, or
to the intake manifold?

Armed with this new knowledge maybe I can get it running a little better.
