Well, that explains a lot!  Now if I can only figure out where to 
connect the vacuum retard (I'm assuming the advance connects to the 
carb, but last year there was a major debate on where the second 
vacuum supply was).  Does the vacuum retard connect to the carb, or 
to the intake manifold?

Armed with this new knowledge maybe I can get it running a little better.
