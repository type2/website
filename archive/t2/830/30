Subject: Re: [T2] Engine rebuild

Gary,

It depends on a lot of variables. One big variable is which engine you 
have: a 1600 engine will be about a third cheaper than a larger 1700, 
1800, or 2000 engine.

As a rule of thumb, however, you might want to treat a quote of more 
than $2000 for a 1600 engine or more than $3000 for a larger engine 
with a little skepticism. Quotes of $3000 or $4000, respectively, are 
beginning to get out of range.

A lot depends on whether you will be doing some of the work -- such as 
dropping the engine and tearing it down -- yourself. There are also a 
series of variables in the rebuild itself.

Also, it does not make sense to do a rebuild without also refreshing 
the ancillaries. Your tin, for instance, should be cleaned up and 
painted or powdercoated. And with the engine out, making sure that the 
gas tank is clean and sealed is a sensible thing to do.
