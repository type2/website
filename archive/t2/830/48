<<What is the best low cost solvent for dissolving this sludge?>>


Lacquer Thinner.
About $28.00 for a five gallon can of virgin brand X thinner.

It'll dissolve the garbage in the tank.

If not,yank the tank, and take it to a radiator shop and have it cleaned
out.

It would be well worth the effort, knowing that you got all the garbage
outa the tank in one move.

The bonus plan here is no petrolis neglectis surprises down the road.
