Subject: Need:Vent windows for 1976 Westie

Hi all,
I just purchased a 1976 Hardtop Westie that has only the sink and icebox. I'm
not sure what model this is, but I'd like to know. Anyhow, the two vent
windows along the drivers side needs replacing as I am going to replace the
window rubbers afer having it primed and painted. Ik any of you have a set of
good (chromed) set, I would be interested. Also, is there a better set of
window rubbers to buy? I want to do this chore just once, even though it may
be more up front.

Thanks, and again if any of you know what model I have, I would appreciate
hearing from you.

Mark
