And here is the key issue with this Bus, as with any older vehicle.

It'll wind up being more of a restoraton process in getting the Bus back
to it's orginal , pre crashed condition, than just R&Ring a couple of
body panel's and refinishing.

Once that nose panel comes ff, and the A pillar is removed / tweaked on
an rack you'll more than likely run into a rats nest of other problems
that have to be addressed, just because of it's age / condition.

What a guy should be looking for is a bodyman that does side work at
home.

Then you could work out the infinate details of what you want and at
what price.

It's this or locate a shop that is dedicated to just resto work---and an
insurance co will never stand for a monetary figure out of one of those
emporuiums of correctness.


This the biggest problem with owning and driving old stuff.
