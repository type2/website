Subject: Re: [T2] Info on 1976 Hardtop Weekender

Mark asked:


> Just purchased a 1976 Weekender and have a few questions. It had the camping supplement but no owners
manual. Any idea where one can be located?

Ebay or the Samba for a used one. Bentley still offers new ones but only for 75 or 77, not 76. 77 would be the
closest to yours:

>Also how can I get info on my Vin#. I was told in my first post that it was infact a Weekender (no poptop). I
realize that the string of numbers gives a good bit of info.

Not much info in your vin number that tells you it is a Weekender:
the first 2 tells you it is a type2 bus,
the second number tells you the body style: 2 is a microbus, 3 is a kombi.
Most Westfalias were built using kombi buses.
the third number is the year
the fourth number will be a 2 starting 1970 to tell you that it is a 1970 to 1979 bus.
the last six numbers is the sequential serial number

ALL the real info is on the M code plate:
www.type2,com/m-codes/
This is the plate you need to find and decipher.

>In looking for body parts, what year busses were compatable with my 76.

Depends on the body parts you need. Noses and rear ends are the same 73-79. Sliding doors changed around 74.
Front doors are different in 76! depending on your vin, up to 2x6 2126 631 and from 2x6 2126 632. The hinges
are the opposite.

>And lastly, I have searched GoWesty, Busdepot and others looking for the plumbing vent cover that is somewhat
oval and has the Westy horse embossed on it to replace the broken one.

Good used is about all I have seen.
