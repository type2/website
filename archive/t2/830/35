..........................Hi Mark.....browse to http://www.type2.com/   and 
click on LIBRARY under technical articles at the far left of the 
screen.  When the new page opens, click on "V" in the A through Z 
line.  Under the "V" list, click on VIN. This opens a page on VIN numbers. 
There are 4 categories of VIN information, and you should read them 
all.  This should also answer some of your questions about compatible parts.
