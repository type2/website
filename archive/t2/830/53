Don,

 

I'm shooting for the stock looking 15" wheels from GoWesty with the flatter
VW stock hub caps.  The wheels will be color matched to the van.

 

Then im adding the Diamondback Supreme 205/65R15 in the front and 215/65R15
in the back with the wide white walls.

Here is a drawing of the end result.
