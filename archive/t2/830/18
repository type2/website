Mark,
 
I have just done all the rubber on the bus.....some of it a second time in
the course of a year.
 
As the funding for rubber became available I started one or two pieces at a
time.
After I got done with all of it, the first pieces had split again. I won't
say were I got them from
because it was several places...who every was cheapest....bad decision.
 
For my money Wolfsburg West quality and fit is the better product.
It is more expensive but if they have it, I would get it there.
Check out there web site.
