> Wow - 375,000 miles?  That sounds like a lot. 

The PO said that it was in the 3's when I bought it and he was only the 2nd
owner, so the 75k that it reads and his word is really all I have to go on.


> my mechanic wants to pull the motor and re-seal it and check the heads 

I'd recommend that as well as this.... when Peek got my engine apart, they
said that the seize because of something about the oil filter falling and
its bolt flailing around in the crank case until it jammed something up. Had
this item not fallen, the engine was running like a champ, no oil burn, and
great milage.

> What kind of oil have you been using?

I always run Castrol synth in everything.  I change it every 3 months and
every second change I re add the slick 50 for High mileage vehicles.  I also
keep the Lucas fuel additive in there every second tank of gas. 

> Have you had the motor out and what have you done to it?

Ive never had the motor out, and Peek did the valves last year as well as
new push rod tubes.  That's all.

Dave.
