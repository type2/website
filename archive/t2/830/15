Subject: POR-15 gas tank sealing

ok guys, her it goes....
 
1) bought the kit.....all made by the POR-15 people
2) read the directions....that one is a biggie
3) removed the crap with the "marine-clean"
4) used the "metal-ready"...most of the rust turned black
5) dried out the tank, by this time it's midnight, so my thoughts are "I
will coat the inside of the tank tomorrow" and the tank will be good and
dry.
 
I look in the tank in the morning and the rust is there and red again and
now some new surface rust has appeared......CRAP!
 
So I am panicking now...do I go ahead and coat the inside of the tank or
not?
 
The POR-15 guy said the "metal-ready" coated the rust with zinc and
everything is ok, coat it - the rust will stop.
 
I am just looking for some more opinions from others that have used this
stuff before.
I have used stuff like POR-15 on motorcycle gas tanks.....if you mess up it
is ok 1 bolt and you can start over but not this beast!
 
Any thoughts?
