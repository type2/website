From Shaggy:

how many gallons does my 1977 hold? I dont have an owners manual

----------------------------------------------------------------------

77 and 78 are the same. Here is the 78 owners manual:

Page 77: 
http://www.conservatory.com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/Owner-sManual/78Type2/pg77.jpg
says 14.6 US gallons.

Here is a handy 1977 info card you can print and laminate. It does not show gas tank size though:
