Hi Mark,

Gary never did say what kind of engine he has, but Paul's price is for
1600 engines. Paul won't work on Type 4. He helped me build my 1776,
which came out pretty well. My only regret was not using a
counterweighted crank.

 Unless he has a really good parts discount, or you're talking a 1600
 engine, or both, this is much too good to be true. The pistons and
 cylinders for later engines are at least half of this price alone.
