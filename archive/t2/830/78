Subject: i saw another commerical with a beetle /  and i have a bus

Also right after that commerical there was another one
with a aircooled beetle whats the deal with older vws
all of a sudden popping up on commericals espically
during the holidays is it because of vw symbolizing
peace or something 

on another note my bus sat outside for 3 days and i
went to start it today and the batter was dead the
battery is brand new i live in Connecticut can the
cold weather drain the battery faster what can i do to
make sure my battery doesn't keep draining and that i
don't have to keep going outside with a jumper pack
