Subject: Info on 1976 Hardtop Weekender

Just purchased a 1976 Weekender and have a few questions. It had the camping
supplement but no owners manual. Any idea where one can be located? Also how
can I get info on my Vin#. I was told in my first post that it was infact a
Weekender (no poptop). I realize that the string of numbers gives a good bit
of info.  In looking for body parts, what year busses were compatable with my
76. And lastly, I have searched GoWesty, Busdepot and others looking for the
plumbing vent cover that is somewhat oval and has the Westy horse embossed on
it to replace the broken one.

Thanks guys,
