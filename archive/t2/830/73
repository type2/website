Phil,

Have you taken the turn signal switch out lately? Recently I removed
mine (also a '71) to work on a problem with the ignition switch and
one of the wires that connects to the momentary switch had become
disconnected. It broke at the solder joint. The bright light switch is
two peices of copper which touch momentarily when you pull the lever,
the relay does the rest to keep the bright lights activated. On my '71
it didnt take a lot of stress on the wire to break the connection. The
resoldering job was pretty strightforward. Apply a dab of flux to the
copper surface, heat and reconnect the disconnected wire. Just a
possibility worth looking into, especially if you've removed the
switch and possibly stressed all those old solder connections.

peace
