sounds like you may have lucked out (relatively speaking) it is very
possible that you just blew a seal..tranny fluid leaked out, you get no go
without tranny blood.

you don't even want to think about how much work that is, fortunately the
late 010 tranny you have is still avaliable to get parts for, not to
mention a used tranny is not that hard to find, while they are basically
the same tranny a vanagon and bay auto tranny are not interchangable.

I wouldn't do that, (if you do talk to me about that engine)

get the Bentley, it is almost mandatory for the tranny. if you can find
one get the auto tranny trouble shooting manual.

one quick test, fill the tranny with fluid, to the full mark, start it up
and see if you can move it in all gears (before the fluid leaks out) put
something under the tranny to collect the fluid

if it goes then it is probably just a seal....

good luck
Bob
