Subject: Bus for sale in Denver Area

Found this bus on Broadway at the Cat Hospital. The new paint drew me to
take a close look.

No price or year info, but I'm betting 74. Campmobile interior complete,
vinyl mustard upholstery is sliced up (cat claws?) The marker light hole
gave me some access to the battery tray and it seems to not yet be rusted
through. Couldn't tell much more. The bus was backed against a short wall
and I couldn't open the engine compartment.

Looks decent. The paint job is adequate. Not super shiny, but appears to be
ok. No bubbles or runs that I could see in the snow.

I'd dig into it myself but I'm too broke. It would make a good soul-swap for
the GWB I think. =)
