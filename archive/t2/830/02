Subject: Re: [T2] Audi Wheels on CL in CO

FWIW...

I just tried a set of 16s off my wife's A6 the other day. The bolt pattern
is correct on these wheels (5x112 iirc), as is the back spacing, but the
center bore is too small and would have to be enlarged for them to fit over
the hubs. Anyway, if you've got the means to modify these a bitt, it might
be a cool project...
