I wrecked my 1970 Karmann Ghia convertible several years ago and found 
a shop:

Paint and Body Perfectors
4509 Nolensville Road
834-2645

They did good work, but this was in 1983.  I don't know if they're 
still there.  They replaced the left fender and nose panel and did 
other touch-up work on other panels, then painted the whole thing for 
$2800.  Granted, labor was $16/hr then.

Unfortunately, the rockers developed cancer a few years later and the 
whole car started to become limber, so I sold it for $2400 in 1992.
