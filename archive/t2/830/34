Subject: RE: [T2] Engine rebuild

I just got my 78 back from Peek Performance in Lanham Maryland, and I am so
happy with the engine work and such.  I had 375,000 on the engine when it
died, and I expect to get more than that out of this one.

So, I feel that I have two cents worth of info on this topic.

They did a complete rebuild on the 2000 engine.  They completely redid all
of the tin, all of the paint, and all of the engine bay wires.  They also
repainted the engine bay black (I chose the color).  Included in this price
was some minor front suspension work.

The job was $4500 total, which I did think a bit high, until I saw and drove
the results.

>A lot depends on whether you will be doing some of the work ... yourself.

For me, it's not an option to do the engine work myself, and I wanted it
done by a place that I could "call home" or at least "find" if something
goes awry.

> Your tin, for instance, should be cleaned up and painted or powder coated.

To top it all off, they not only did the engine, paint and all, they did all
the tin in powder coat, and the engine bay in flat black.  They re did most
of the wiring in the engine compartment too.

Check out the link below for pics of the new engine and such.

So the final result is:

	1) They did everything that I asked them too, and more
	2) They did it very well
	3) I'm very satisfied with the results
	4) It's has a warranty and I know where to find them

I agree that $4500 is a great deal of money, but for me it was well worth
it.  The guys at Peek Performance did an outstanding job.
