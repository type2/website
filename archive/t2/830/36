Subject: '79 side window sizes

Hi, All. Hope you're getting your last minute shopping done, as am I.
Anybody know off the top of their heads if the side windows on a '79 are interchangeable (can you, for instance, take the sliders out of the door and install them in the rear window position, assuming, of course, that you use the correct rubber)?
Thanks,
