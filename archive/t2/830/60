Subject: wont idle when cold, broke down

stumbled a little bit this evening when I was leaving
work before I let it warm up, drove one block died,
gas gauge said 1/2 tank, but that means empty on this
one, but this morning it said full. anyways put 1.5
gallons in it, drove 30 feet died, pushed and coasted
down the street to gas station, put 5 gallons in it,
tank in full, still wont start, had it towed. any
ideas?
this is a 1977 westy 2.0 fuel injected from CA and I'm
in NY, and was planiing, and still am going to garage
it for the winter this week, but would rather drive it
to my storage garage than tow it.

thanks shaggy
