Subject: loaf to diesel conversions?

While reading about this in the archives, I  realized that most of the posts were five years old.. any new news on  this topic? I know that Brazilian busses are sold as diesels for the  mexican market, anyone come up with the idea of importing a kit to do  the conversion?
