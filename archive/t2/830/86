Subject: problem with my battery draining

well my interstate battery was only 2 weeks old or so
it was brand new so i pulled the drained battery and
brought it by my local firestone and they told me to
come back in a couple hours when they charge it and
retest it i don't have any thing draining the battery
when the bus is off except the vdo clock in the
dashboard. My radio is off i have a toggle switch to
turn it on and off when i gho to car shows if anybody
has any suggestions i would be grateful
