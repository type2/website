Yeah, but, did anyone else notice this:  When they
show the interior view of this bus, you see sky-lite
windows, so its a 21 window deluxe...BUT... when they
show the external side view, there are no skylight
windows AND there are no side\rear windows AND no
trim, which says basic Kombi to me?!?!?!  Anyone else
notice this???
