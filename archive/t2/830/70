Subject: Re: [T2] 210mm vs 215mm clutch

From Eddie:

 Can a 215mm clutch fit on a flywheel that it setup for a 210mm clutch?

 A friend told me it works, but I'm highly skeptical. I know there are
 different part numbers for each flywheel. Does anyone have any experience doing (or trying) this?

 I have clutches and flywheels of all sizes that ever came in a bus. I
 pulled a 210mm clutch off the 2.0L engine I'm working on. It would be nice to just bolt on a  215mm clutch
and would save me having to get a 215mm flywheel resurfaced.

 This engine is a 2.0L. I have no driving experience with a 210mm on a
 2.0. Seems kinda wimpy for a 2.0. Would it be worth it to go to the 215mm clutch? I'd love to go to 228mm but
I don't have any
starters or bellhousings bellhousing around (everyone keeps taking them
 from me :P ). I remember switching the flywheel and clutch from 210mm to 215mm on my 1.7 and it was a
pleasant upgrade.

No, a 215 clutch will not fit a 210 flywheel.

But.... do you have a 215 flywheel on that engine?

I have 2 215 flywheels. One of them will use either a 210 or a 215 clutch assembly. It has 2 sets of 6 holes:
1 set of 8mm 210 pressure plate bolt holes and 1 set of 7mm 215 bolt holes.

A 215 pressure plate and flywheel requires 7mm bolts because the bolt holes are right on the edge. The 2nd 215
flywheel I have is 215 only.
