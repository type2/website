Mel...
Unless you just love projects...of which I understand...sounds like you have 
a good thing going with your 1800...yessir,a mighty fine engine! I say, don't 
be a fixin somthin thats not broke!     :o)   I also have a 81 Vanagon with a 
good engine but needs a head (which I also have), but my 76 is running great. 
  Maybe tear the top end down and check out the interior of the engine, then 
make it right and then you have a good spare...I also don't know what tin 
screw holes line up to a 70's van tin (although I've heard different 
opinions)...maybe someone on the list can help here?   Anyway, hope it works 
out  the way you want it...
Aloha
Jeff Raven
