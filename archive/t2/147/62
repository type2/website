Here is a picture of the compressor:

I don't have pictures of the rest online at the moment and the above 
picture is also a couple of years old.  The drive assembly in the picture 
has since broken, been repaired, broken again, been repaired again, and 
finally replaced with an all-steel version from a Porsche 912 courtesy of a 
friend on this list.  It will likely be months before my online presence 
improves.  :(
