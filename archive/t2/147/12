Subject: Re: [T2] Timing question (again)

Whenever a timing/distributor question comes up, does everyone hit delete
without reading it???

This question is why the answer ''always time your engine to the distributor
you have and not your engine" has to be said over and over again until
everyone understands it!

Timing your engine 'by the book' at 10 after is only true IF you are using
distributor # 021 905 205J or 021 905 205N  AND you have vacuum at idle
connected to the retard side AND you are timing it with a light at idle.

Timing a mechanical only dist at 10 after severely retards the engine. Get the
correct dist, the correct book [Bentley], and the correct information. The
Muir book is fun to read when you get your 1st type1 engine but it is nothing
more than comic book for a typeIV engine.

All Bosch distributors have the numbers around the outside of the body. Some
are easier to see than others. You don't need the Bentley to get the specs for
it. Go here if you know the application:

Go here if you have the dist number and you want to know the application:
