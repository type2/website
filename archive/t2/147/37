=====================>
Let's presume that Brian did not call his creations "official" VW clocks, 
'cuz, to my mind, we all know to not do same.
(Maybe illogical logic here)

but,
Boy, I'll tell 'ya Dave........
You and I sure agree on this one right down to the crossed t and legalese 
comma spliced sentence structure.

This lawyer is just after an easy fast buck being made off of another 
person's insecurities.

BTW,
I've got a VW hubcap that was made into a clock. It hangs on the wall out 
by the pool.
VW hubcap ..... I dunno; maybe.
It has a logo on it. It was mounted on a VW's tire once upon a time.
Clock ..... Yes
Is it a VW clock ...... No
