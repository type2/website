Before we got our busses, we bought a jetta, thinking that until we found=
 the aircooled vehicles we wanted, we could at least drive a VW.

That was before I learned much about the current state of affairs at the =
company.

I'll be letting VW know that once I unload their jetta, I won't be purcha=
sing another new one.

My main point is that list griping feels good, but doesn't get our voices=
 heard.

How about a formal letter/petition we could all sign (multiple vw lists) =
and forward on expressing our thoughts about all these issues that cause =
us to hate the current vw ag?
