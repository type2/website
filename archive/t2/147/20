> The other day it started and sounded like it was gonna cut off right after I started it.  I gave it a little gas and flooded the engine.  I waited a little while for it to drain and it started up no problem.  I hadn't had a problem since.  Took it camping and even drove it all over.  Then yesterday I went to start it and it wouldn't start.

> At Muirs suggestion I tapped the solenoid with a small hammer.  Tried to start it again.  The engine would start, but die as soon as i let the key relax.
> Tapped the solenoid again.  Same thing.  Tried giving it gas while starting it.  Nearly flooded the engine again, but it  began running.  I let it idle for a little while.  Running smooth!
