OTOH, Mexico has been building the aircooled VW for decades, while no
aircooled VW has been made in Der Fatherland for 20 years.  The
millions of VW bugs and busses running around Mexico consist of mostly
Mexican parts and they seem to do fine.  "German quality" isn't all that
it used to be either.

The big difference seems to be between factory and aftermarket parts.
Anyone who has installed an aftermarket mexican muffler knows what I mean
here!  The mufflers made by VW de Mexico are a different story, but not
many of them find their way to the US since the price is undercut by the
Mexican aftermarket manufacturers.  Cheap pushes out good unless you are
very careful who you buy from.
