Subject: air conditioning

I've been looking into adding a/c to my bus which came without it.  I've
read through through the archives which say 1) you may never get a good seal
with the engine tin again 2) the hoses required cost a fortune 3) the under
the dash kind never worked that good in the first place 4) goodbye
horsepower.

After all this reading, what I saw at the boneyard didn't impress me either,
however, someone had a VW page on the web with a good, as yet unexplored,
idea: put a quality rooftop unit on the luggage rack of a westy.

This seems to have some obvious advantages:

- electrically driven.  It would be easy to get the heavy wiring to the
engine compartment but maybe this extra load is too much for a 70A
alternator.  What is the nominal current draw while driving?

- Large amounts of cool air right in the cab and rearward.

- Mostly non-invasive except for a hole in the roof.

The disadvantages:

- possible vibration right over head.

- cost?

Has anyone contemplated doing this or attempted it?
