David,

Worked at VPC in Ft. Worth(vwoa subsidiary) for a couple of 
years....didn't design the bus unit.

I suspect that if you get a rotary compressor, and one of the list 
suppliers has them, you should do just fine.  I intend to use one on my 78 
when i get ready to bring the a/c back from the dead.....and I bet I don't 
have to cut the shiny new sheet metal/body work that I am just getting 
ready to cover up my old a/c compressor hole spot with.


Electric roof unit is out...more amperage required at 12v than is 
available in the universe(jut kidding, but it is bad)....and you would
have three energy conversions going on there.

mechanical-->electrical-->mechanical
engine    -->alternator-->a/c compressor

Any engineer worth his/her salt will tell you that you are going to loose 
about 20% of your energy on each conversion....

Godd luck, dave
