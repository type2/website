I have the same pop top on my bus (except it has one window).  I believe
they were made by Motorhomes International (mine has the MI plate on the
rear).  All 3 of my kids sleep up there with room to spare - the beds are
very comfortable.  People are always asking me, "Why don't they make those
any more?"  Only downside is that the roof is a little high, though not as
high as a high roof (if you know what I mean).  When I get a scanner - soon
- you will be able to see pictures.
