NO NO NO, they are NOT EGR ports!  They are AIR INJECTION ports for the smog
pump.
EGR is 'exhaust gas recirculation'. Inert exhaust gas ALWAYS enters the air
INTAKE via an EGR valve, to lower NOX emissions.
Air injection is air that is either pumped or pulsed into the EXHAUST to
complete the burn and lower CO and HC.
