=======================>
I think that is damned good advice !!!

I would ignore the Hell out of that Indy attorney.

They defined the damage fee amount ($ 3K) in order to do a fast cheap trick.

Now then, how much they gonna spend to try and get that $3K ?? - Not much 
in the way of time or out of pocket expenses.

I would stop with the hub cap thing, tell them I have done so via certified 
mail, if it has to come to some kind of communication from me to them, and 
ignore all else.
