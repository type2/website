Not so sure about that.  Tried FRS on the way to
Everybus and the darn thing didn't have much
range.  If you couldn't see the other guys
antenna it didn't work.  And somebody's radio was
dead at all times it seems.  (Ever tried changing
those batteries while driving.)  Besides you can
get directions and traffic info off CB if you
don't mind putting up with the crap on there.  

Besides, nothing says 70's like a CB.  

Hard to beat the FRS around the camp sites, but I
didn't hear anyone using them at EB.  Would have
been nice for paging folks or making
announcements.
