>>When I got into the FMBC campsite I met Bear who had in my opinion the
coolest bus there a1980 Swiss Vanagon Westy. It had a factory 1600FI engine
in it with sort of a Doormobile top but better and even a instahot water
heater for a shower in the rear of the bus, way cool!<<

if anyone wants to see pics of the Vanagon that Britt mentions above,
please visit the Members Rides section of our website. it is the 5th
vehicle listed. there is also a link to the owners site.
