* you need fixed width font for this message to make sense *

I haul a canoe regularly on the racks I attempt to describe
below.  My requirements included unassisted on-and-off for
a 16-footer and no abrasion to my dear old '78 bus.  In words
and ASCII art, I built a little tripod of 2x4s (mortise
jointed for strength), like this:

       ||
       ||
       ||         <- make 4 of these
      /||\
     / || \
    /  ||  \
    ========   <- about a foot long left-to-right

and milled the lower base to just fit in the rain gutter
lengthwise.

Each pair of tripods was joined together with 1/2" threaded
rod the width of the bus with nuts & washers on each side of
the upright at each end, but additionally with a length of
3/4" ID water pipe around the threaded rod, i.e, it's a
roller bearing of a sort


       ||                         ||
      -||-(=====================(-||-
       ||     ^ pipe around rod   || 
      /||\                       /||\
     / || \       assemble      / || \
    /  ||  \      in pairs     /  ||  \
    ========                   ========

The above is sort of misleading as I can't do perspective
drawings in ASCII, but it should look like this from the
end of the bus:


       ||                         ||
      -||-(=====================(-||-
       ||                         ||
       ||                         || 
       ||                         ||  
       ||/-----------------------\||   
       //            ^ roof line  \\ <- rain gutter


With one of these near the rear and one about the driver's
seat back, I can walk up to the rear of the bus with the
canoe thwart on my shoulders, tip up the front end, and
put the nose of the canoe on the rear roller and set the 
other end of the canoe on the ground.  I walk around to
the end, pick it up and then just roll the whole thing
on the rear roller until the front of the canoe is over
the front roller onto which I let the front end drop and
roll it the last couple of feet on both rollers.

I installed heavy eyes in both front and rear bumpers, so
tie-down is easy and, yes, it is the tie down that completes
the picture and the structural integrity as it were.

Hope my ASCII is good enough 'cuz I don't have a camera...
