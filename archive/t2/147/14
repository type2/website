Subject: It finally started

Listess,
After a weekend full of work, and as the sun was
setting on Sunday, I was able to jump start my newly
installed (swapped) engine.  I have a '72 Westy that
needed new cylinders, pistons and heads.  Instead of a
full blown re-build, I purchased a 1979 bay with a '72
engine and placed the motor in my Westy.  The engine
was checked out and it met the criteria as suggested
by several of you on the list.  Thanks for the input. 
I drove the '79 bay for a couple of days and it ran
great, but the obmoxious multicolored hand painted
body and gutted interior made the swap necessary.
There still are a couple of issues I need to resolve,
especally the throttle cable, the throttle seemed to
stick as it was running in the driveway (I didn't take
it for a drive because of this).  In the daylight of
tomorrow I will check the cable and the return spring.
 The second issue, and frankly the most troubling, is
a small and regular (20-30 seconds apart) backfire. 
It is not the loud ringing backfire that my old engine
was prone to emit, but a small pop.
Hopefully daylight, rest and a charged battery will
allow me to get it on the road.  I doubt that I will
be fully focussed at work tomorrow, but I can at least
sleep peacefully tonight knowing that the engine is in
and that it runs.  I will sort out the details soon. 
Thanks for all of the support,
Billy Ray
