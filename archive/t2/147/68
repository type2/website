Yes!  you are mixing old and new style parts and they won't work together.
If you have the old style throwout bearing without the sleeve around the
transmission input shaft you need the plate with the ring.  If you have
the sleeve around the input shaft you need the plate without the ring.
many times these parts have been juggled between years, so it's the parts
thay your bus has that are important, not the year of the bus.
