Subject: Re: [T2] wanted - 75 FI cyl. head

You need to specify left or right. Big difference in the left head on a 75
1800 FI. The EFI temp sensor is not next to the #3 intake. It sits above the
#3 intake port at a 45 degree angle below the spark plug. A major PITA to
replace.
You can use a left head on the right but no way no how can you use a right
head on the left.
On a 2.0L head you could drill and tap a right head to go on the left. But on
a 1.8, the head is cast with a boss for the hole.
