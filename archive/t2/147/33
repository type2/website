There is some mis-information in there about A/C.

Untrue - depends on your installation and even with the install where the 
compressor sticks through the tin, it wouldn't be hard to fabricate a 
decent seal.

How much is it worth to stay cool and dry?  It's true that the hoses are 
expensive, but I think "a fortune" is an exaggeration.  I replaced every 
single hose in my system for under $250 and that was by far the largest 
expense in the install.  Total system cost was under $400 including gauges 
and refrigerant.

No experience with those so I won't comment.

Yup, kiss 1.5hp goodbye with a modern rotary compressor.  That's maybe 3% 
of your power.  Probably on par with carrying a 150lb passenger although I 
haven't run the numbers.  If you use the factory compressor, probably 
triple that power consumption but it would still be worth it to me to be cool.

Electrically driven A/C is a disadvantage.  The current draw would be 
enormous if it were even possible (AFAIK the rooftop units are all 110V 
a/c), on the order of 70 amps.  So no, your alternator could not even think 
about sustaining it.  You could only use it while parked and plugged in, 
which is just fine for those 40-ft land-yacht monstrosities because they 
spend 90% of their time parked in a KOA anyway.

>- Mostly non-invasive except for a hole in the roof.

That's a pretty big invasion if you ask me, not to mention that it would 
look tacky IMO.

If you want A/C in your bus, I recommend piecing it together from the 
dealer-installed systems that can be found in junkyard busses.  If you 
don't mind doing some research and minor re-engineering, you can retrofit 
the newer rotary compressors to reduce drag on your engine and have a very 
nice, efficient system.

My basic formula for success was:

Overhead (inside) T-shaped evaporator
"Stock" condensor underneath the bus with better fans
Sanden SD-508 rotary compressor
New hoses
Freeze-12 refrigerant
