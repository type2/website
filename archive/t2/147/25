I drove an hour and a half to mansfield, CT and was greeted by a lowered =
jetta and a black honda?
what's up with that.
The guy running it saud rain or shine busses and people would be there.
I waited around for a while and finally a '71 white westy with a sportsmo=
bile top showed up, it was raining but not that hard.
I saw a few busses on the road, but didn't see them there, except for a y=
ellow non-pop westy who pulled up and left without a word.
Oh well, I hope people show up next weekend at Duxbury Beach, MA.
Get your bus together and go to the show man!
