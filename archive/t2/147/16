A couple days ago someone posted saying that their engine would hiccup wh=
en idling.
I believe my '79 Westy may be experiencing the same thing.  =20
I remember they said they had an auto tranny and I do also.  Not sure if =
that is relevent =20
When I start the bus after it has been sitting for a couple hours it will=
 have a rough time starting.
then the engine will idle and then kinda jump every couple seconds.
Then I'll get on the highway and cruise all the way to work.
When I get off the highway it is usually idling real smooth and the engin=
e has stopped jumping.
In fact it seems to run pretty well.  Then it will sit for eight hours wh=
ile I'm in work and when I start it it will start hiccuping again.
The other day it started and sounded like it was gonna cut off right afte=
r I started it.  I gave it a little gas and flooded the engine.  I waited=
 a little while for it to drain and it started up no problem.  I hadn't h=
ad a problem since.  Took it camping and even drove it all over.  Then ye=
sterday I went to start it and it wouldn't start.
I whipped out my manuals and tore into it.  The battery was ok.  I climbe=
d down there and connected the terminals on the solenoid w/ a screwdriver=
.  The motor whirled into action.  Checked all the connections.  Still wo=
uldn't start.
At Muirs suggestion I tapped the solenoid with a small hammer.  Tried to =
start it again.  The engine would start, but die as soon as i let the key=
 relax.
Tapped the solenoid again.  Same thing.  Tried giving it gas while starti=
ng it.  Nearly flooded the engine again, but it  began running.  I let it=
 idle for a little while.  Running smooth!
Does it have something to do with the fuel, or is my solenoid shot?
(Sorry to whomever asked me to turn word wrap on.  I don't know how.)
Thanks,
Kyle
