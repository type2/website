Well sort of!  if you read in the archives the long, long discussion I and
Steve Dolan and a few others had about a year ago it turns out that it is
much more complicated than just "tune to dist" especially on the FI
engines with the ECUs and a few other "complications" that add to
things.  probably Tune to dist would get you started but the best bet is
Always use the stock dist if at all possibl/e
