Rotors can crack allowing the spark to jump to the top of the shaft. In the 
cases I have seen of rotors or caps cracked, over 90% of the time it's an 
aftermarket part. I don't specifically recall any Bosch cap/rotor problems 
except when installed improperly or mishandled. I have seen new caps 
supplied with reman/newman Bosch dizzies broken to pieces in the box, lots 
of times, like 2 out of 3. Their packaging engineers On the later models 
with electronic ignition, sometimes you will see the carbon contact in the 
cap get burned. This is evidence typical of an ignition module and/or hall 
sensor and/or electronic coil problem. I have seen this as well on 
Kettering systems, but in every case it was corrosion of the HT coil wire 
at one end or the other.

Eventually, the tip of the rotor will erode to a point that voltage 
transfer drops, they overheat, and the copper strip will start to separate 
from the fiber matrix. That's not a defect, it's lack of reasonable 
replacement interval, or excessive resistance in the plugs and/or HT wires.

Rule of thumb, when a rotor has eroded to 0.2mm, time to replace it or 
accept a mile or two per gallon less efficiency. Same for spark plugs, 
replace when the gap has worn 0.2mm to maintain good function at all times.
