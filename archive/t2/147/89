Hello List,
 Well , I am all out of Pushrod tube seals. I ended up
selling 3 sets! The exhaust gaskets have been spoken
for as well as the 2 engine seals. I do have a few
other things left here to sell if any one is
interested. I tried to make each item either cheeper
than the price I bought them for or cheeper than the
lowest price I could find for each item so keep that
in mind. Thanks to everyone that has replied so far.
Every penny helps toward buying another engine!
