Hi,

Two quick things. First, I have been having lots of trouble with my 
ISP so I have not really been responding to mail regarding EB. I will 
be getting around to that later this week. Sorry.

Secondly and more importantly, a 50/50 raffle was held at EB02 and 
$125 will be sent to type2.com as a donation to help with the ongoing 
costs of keeping the mail and web server up and running.

If Ted will kindly p-mail me his address I will get a check in the mail.

Thanks
