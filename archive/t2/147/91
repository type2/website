Subject: what to do

Hi from the uk, I have been given a Vanagon as most of you listees know them 
a UK spec 2 litre electronic ignition, hydraulic lifters etc, etc.
 Do I (a) put the engine in my 76 bay 1.8 litre 914 engined auto.  
        (b) put the engine and gearbox in my 76 bay
        (c) just put the electronic ignition on my bay
        (d) just take the engine out and save it for a rainy day  
your opinions please.
the 1.8 runs well 85hp. the 2 litre has bad oil leaks I am told from the push 
rod tubes and the heat exchangers need replacement and a slipping clutch. 
thanks Mel
