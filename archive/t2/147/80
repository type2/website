Volks!  This just occurred to me:

Years ago, when I was a single college student, I got a call from a 
young (attractive sounding) lady who, well, claimed to work for FICA 
(Sounds official, doesn't it?  Remember, she's shooting for 
party-type college students here) sounding pleasent & even a little 
embarassed because:

A motel in Florida was going to sue me for a bounced check, $50.

But!  I could just pay the $50 & they'd drop it!  Otherwise it would 
get into court costs, I didn't want that, right?

If I had been in FL (like so many other college students), loosing 
receipts & being muddled, I might have just paid these ppl $50; I'm 
sure others did.  Luckily I was keeping receipts while driving with 
my friends to California!  So I told her to have them go ahead & sue. 
(what a wonderful feeling!)

My point is, read that letter closely: is VWoA really suing?  Or is 
it somebody fishing for checks?  Bob jarred my memory.  It really 
might just be someone who's good at sounding official, but represents 
nobody but himself.

This suit sounds so plausible, & many ppl's knee-jerk response has 
been "What asses at VWoA!  Let's tell 'em off!!"  But!  What does a 
multinational want with such small potatoes as junk art??  This 
multinational which would kinda like to forget about its aircooled 
past, anyway.  When questioned, it turned out that my lady worked for 
"Fica & Associates," that "Fica" was just the lawyer's name 
(tee-hee!) not some government agency!  Just maybe, VWoA is Verner 
Wimble of Acron, Attorney at Law.  I hope so!
