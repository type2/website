A google search for "hubcap clock" yielded 125 hits.  Making a hubcap into
a clock isn't a crime, and since you came across the hubcap itself legally
they have nothing on you.  Did Cambell's soup sue Andy Warhol?

Yes, get a lawyer.  An aggressive one with a gleam in his eye.  Countersue
them for filing a frivelous lawsuit to harrass you.
