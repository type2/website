Piece it together is my preference. Call one of the dealers that frequents
this list (aircooled.net, Bus Depot, BustedBus, BusBoys--there are others),
tell 'em you're building a 1776, which is a good reliable mild performance
engine, and they'll fix you right up.

Step 1 is to find a machinist. The stock cylinder spigots are for 85.5mm
P&Cs; a 1776 uses 90.5mm P&Cs and the case & heads need to be machined to
take the larger parts.
