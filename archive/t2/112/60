More or less correct.  But if you're not a professional engine builder what 
you really should do is put in the type of pistons that were in your bus 
originally.  On my 2-liter engine, that means dished pistons.  On your '70, 
I'm not sure.

Baloney.  The lower compression may or may not be a drawback depending on 
what you want from your engine, but it will not "wear quicker".
