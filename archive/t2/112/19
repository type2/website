Rob,

Looks great in linux/pine.  The fuel pump tester I got from sears ended up
with the end cut off....it was just easier.

fuel pump to  fuel ring entrance next to #3.  ring goes around by the cold
start valve over toward the 1/2 side and then hits the pressure regulator
going thru the firewall and then on to the return line in the tank.

No pressure, no go.  Minimum on my engine that was runnable(at idle) was
about 20-25psi.

With a bad(stopped up) pressure regulator, you can get 125psi *very*
quickly.  Pressure regulator is there to keep from getting too much
pressure.

My pressure after fixing everything stayed at around 30psi over night.

No pressure at the fuel ring means bad pump, bad filter, maybe completely
open return line to the tank.....although such a thing seem improbable.

Do the fuel pump delivery test as shown in the manual...very carefully!

Maybe stick a piece of hose on the pump and run it into a clean opaque
milk jug so you can see how fast it flows.

Cheers, dave
