The only way to really know is to put it on a dyno.  You can get an 
estimate with several online calculators if you know the vehicle weight and 
1/4 mile ET or mph (do a search on google for "hp calculator").  But, I 
will stick my neck out and venture a guess at horsepower based on your 
stated top speed - somewhere around 75 hp at the rear wheels on a dynojet 
if you can do 145kph on level ground with no wind.  Can't guess peak torque 
at all - too many variables.
