This is a repost of an earlier email, hopefully the word-wrap
problem is taken care of this time.   -Rob

I finally got ahold of a fuel pressure tester today, but of course since
nothing is ever simple in my life, the gauge has a threaded fitting at =
the
end thus it wouldn't hook up to to the terminal on the ring main.  Not
deterred and after seriously considering cutting off the end of the =
gauge
hose, I found an air-hose fitting in my toolbox that would thread on to =
the
gauge fitting and the other end is made for a hose, that and a piece of =
fuel
line later I had adapted the gauge to fit the ring main terminal.  So I =
run
the starter and the gauge reads zero.  When I remove the gauge and run =
the
starter, the fuel squirts out (easily plugged with a finger though), but =
I
read nothing on the gauge when it's hooked up.  I have fire, and the =
engine
actually fired a couple of times, but apparently my fuel pressure is =
zilch.=20

Shouldn't the fuel pressure gauge (brand new) read at least something =
since
fuel is being pumped?  This fuel pump is an FI pump but had been pumping =
to
a carb for the last couple of years, could this have over-worked it and
caused it to drop it's pressure output?

My Bentley says the hose from the fuel pump connects to the pressure
regulator, but mine goes to the ring main on the left side of the engine
before eventually reaching the regulator on the other side.  Do I have
something backwards?   Looks right to me.

Last question (for now): Fuel flows from the tank out of the return hose
when unplugged from the regulator,  that's supposed to happen right?
