Phil,

If I had a dollar for every time I've answered this question I wouldn't be 
rich, but I'd be able to buy a few tanks of gas for my bus.

It should be a simple matter to find the answer to this question in the 
archives at www.type2.com.

Your hoses are hooked up wrong.  There shouldn't be a port at the base of 
the right carb.  The port at the base of the left carb should go to the 
lower (inner) inlet on the distributor.  The port on the body of the left 
or right carb should go to the upper (outer) inlet on the 
distributor.  There, that's one more gallon.  :-)
