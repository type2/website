Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Exhaust Removal to swap to new Engine

Hi Mark,
It's possible to remove the exhaust system intact as a unit.
I've done this myself.  Removing it was not so bad but putting it back on
was a major pain.  I don't want to go into details how I forced it back on
but it involved a long 2X4 and a chain  ; )  The reason I did this was
because the parts were rusted together extremely well.

Since then I realized this all was not a wise decision, the
exhaust studs are angled which I didn't know when I started.
The exhaust system simply wont slide off easily as a -unit-, although it
is possible I don't think it was meant to be done this way.
I'm sure doing this puts a great deal of stress on the exhaust studs.
Since then I've always removed the system one piece at a time,
same with installation.

If I had to do this again I'd be tempted to remove it as a unit and separate
everything while its on the garage floor and then reinstall the system in
pieces.
By the way remember to use anti-seize when you put everything back
together.
