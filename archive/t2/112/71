I get the same way. When I saw the street racing scene in Delta Force, when 
Chuck Norris and his friend are fleeing from some terrorists in a white 
loaf, and they put a nasty series of bullet holes through the poor thing, I 
started yelling at the screen. This entertained my roommates far more than 
the decidedly mediocre movie itself did.

I mean, it hurts when they ruin a perfectly nice bus for a good movie. It's 
just torture when they do it for a bad movie.
