Subject: Thanks and an offer

Hey ya'll,
I just got in from my bus which now has windshield wipers again.  I had a 
stripped out drive shaft cog in the motor assemble.  I couldn't find a 
replacement cog anywhere but I did stumble across a donor 72 with a prime 
motor and cog.  I installed it today and all is well.  I want to thank the 
list for your assistance with this and previous projects.  
    The motor I removed works great it is just in need of the cog inside.  I 
could stuff the motor in the garage just in case; but, I thought I would 
offer it to the list just in case someone is in need of it.  I would like 
twenty dollars for it and for that price I will send it to you as well (in 
the 48 states).  You can email me off the list if you need it.
Again, thanks for the help!
