don't know what you did, but works fine, thanks

pumps are very different because of the presure, look at the price
difference too.

nope that is the correct arrangement

yeah, but I put a valve on mine so I could shut it off when I take the
engine out.

something is screwy here, I would 

. check to be sure guage works
. check to make sure you have a FI pump, sort of looks like a coil in size
on the frame rail on the left side above the axle (sort of)  Carb electric
pump is usually a square thing about 3 inches or so on a side.
. check the actual presure able to be pumped by plugging the line by the
regulator.  don't let it get too high, but at least 30-40psi should be
able to be pumped pretty quickly
