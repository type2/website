Subject: what kind of battery (for auxillary)

hello,

i am looking to buy a new auxillery battery for my 76
Westy. over the years someone has put a car battery in
the auxillery battery tray. i'm told the the aux batt
is supposed to be deep cycle marine type battery so i
can only assume that the car battery is wrong. 

at my work (im a forklift operator) there is a lift
known as the "scissors" lift. suffice it to say, its
BIG and HEAVY, and it runs on four "Workaholic" deep
cycle batteries, made by Interstate. one battery is a
little bigger than a car battery, and you need to
check the water in them every shift. i'm thinking this
is what i need (just one of course). any insights.
thanks in advance, as always.

Matty
