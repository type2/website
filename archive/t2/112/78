Subject: Re: Why can't people fix things right

This may sound, errr, abrasive. But I'm broke. Seriously, I love my bus, but
I love my wife and kids more so I have to prioritize my cash flow.
I fix things so that I (not you, not the next owner, not my relatives, me)
can drive it. If I was better off, than so would my bus. The point (for me
at least) is to get out and drive my bus. Enjoy it. Sleep in it. I'm sorry
that if I ever sell my bus that yeah, there's bondo, yeah there's freaky
wiring that I don't understand (from my p.o.), and yeah maybe I didn't have
the money to dump all new parts into the motor. But honestly, if I ever sell
my bus, I'll be as straight up with the potential buyer, as my p.o. was with
me. This is supposed to be fun. And if I have to weld a metal plate over the
driver's floor, I'm not gonna feel guilty because the next owner may not
like it...too bad. My bus is the one place where I get to be selfish, and
make it how it suits me.

Now if you will all excuse me, I have to figure out some wiring:-)
