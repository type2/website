Nathan,
Before you're pummeled by the list about the 009, check the archives
for your distributor choice.  The 009 is not the best for T4's.  T1's
with stock carb is just as bad.  Lack of advance is the culprit, as I
recall.

The Kads have to be ported for vacuum signal, I would strongly suggest
the pro's do it.  John at aircooled.net offers a choice SVDA distributor
that might work for you.

Good luck,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
