The fact that it is a type 1 is important.  Type 1 engines do not have a
seal behind the pulley, as this is the fresh air inlet for the crankcase.
Air is drawn in here and then pulled out through the filler neck and into
the air cleaner by the intake vacuum.

Oil from behind the pulley is an indication of either a problem in the
vent system or of excessive blowby.  If an engine is very tired, blowby
will overload the sucking capability of the air cleaner vent and blow out
from the pulley.

A sand seal will not fix a blow-by problem.  It might be a good idea from
a longevity standpoint but your problem lies in rings or venting.
