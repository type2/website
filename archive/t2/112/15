Subject: Oil sprinkles, drips

List,
I think Speedy's leaking oil from behind the pulley.  Finding sprinkles
on the fan shroud, and a little puddle on the tin to the left of the
distributor, I replaced the oil pressure switch, the distributor o-ring,
and added a breather box (vented at valve covers, plummed back to the
oil spout.  Now, I'm still getting sprinkled oil, even high up on the
shroud.  How's this fixed, if it's the seal behind the pulley?  Would
cutting the case for a sand seal help keep oil in?

Speedy's a type 1 1600dp, blah blah blah.

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
