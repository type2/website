Hello,
My latest purchase (74 Westy)has more rigging than any
car I have ever seen. There are four or five extra
nobs in the dash that I don't even know what do. They
rigged in some little lights on the iside of the bus
kinda like the ones they use in limos, They rigged one
of those vangon heaters under the rear seat but didn'y
run any water to it so it melted and they left it in
there. There are extra gauges that don't work, Extra
sockets rigged into the 110 westy wiring(actually work
and are super convienient), 1600 beetle engine rigged
in with no tin to fill gaps usually taken up by T4
motor, Universal side marker lenses, rigged
taillights( only one taillight and both turn signals
work, no reverse or passenger tail light, all heater
ducting removed, home duct pipes(like the kind used
for the fans above your stove in your house) welded to
heater boxes and go through holes under the back seats
in the interior( through the metal and theough the
wood on the bench seat). Wires hacked up left and
right in the engine bay, front spare tire carrier
holding the tire by two 8mm nuts and bolts, and
finding more every day. The only reason I bought this
bus because there is only about a nickels worth of
rust on the whole thing, and I found the original
plaid in perfect shap under all of there home made
seat cover's, Table and sink cabinet are pristine, as
is the icebox cabinet. And I got it pretty cheap.
Thanks,
Tyler
