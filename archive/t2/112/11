Torry,
That sounds like a stout combination!  I like it!  I've started piecing
together my own T1 combo along those same lines.

If you were to pose that same question on a forum like http://www.cal-look.com/
or http://shoptalkforums.com/ (the VW Speed & Drag Racing Forum), someone
might plug it into Desktop Dyno for you.  

If not, you could always purchase the program yourself.  I think Summit
Racing carries it, made by Mr. Gasket.

Good Luck,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
