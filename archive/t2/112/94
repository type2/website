Subject: baywindow crew cab gates

Hello all,
           I was finally in the right place at the right time and picked up
a 71 crewcab.  It runs and drives but will need some rust repair.  It's what
I've wanted for a while so I'm feeling fortunate tonight.  The gates are
very rusty in the hinge area and I'm afraid if I try to drop them down they
will just tear off the truck.  So I'll probably just take the hinge bolts
out and pull the gates off that way.  Does anyone know if repair sections
are available for these gates? Or will I have to fabricate something myself.
I checked the archive and didn't get much info.  I briefly looked at busboys
and wolfsburg west websites but didn't see anything.  If anyone has any info
they like to pass my way I would greatly appreciate it.  I'm still riding
high on this crewcab buzz but when I return to reality I'll need to put my
74 bus up for adoption.  If anyone is looking for a 74 automatic bus that is
super clean inside and out in NE Ohio email me for more info.  Thanks, Mark
