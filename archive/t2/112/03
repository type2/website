Just a note that we DO offer same-day shipping, combined with next-day,
second-day, or third-day air delivery, upon request, on anything we stock
(of which a clutch kit is definately one; we have at least 30 on the shelf
at any given time!)  We can also do the same with thousands of items that we
don't have in stock, as long as one of our distributors has it and can drop
ship it for us same-day.

If you order via standard ground delivery, you will be quoted 7-10 working
days delivery, and it may take a day or two for the item to ship. But if you
ask for Expedited shipping you'll have the item in 1-3 days and it will ship
same day as long as you call by mid-afternoon.  (Expedited ordering is best
done by phone.) The cost of 3-day shipping is often just slightly higher
than ground, particularly on items that are not too heavy.  (On heavy items,
like a clutch kit, the price difference could be small or large depending on
destination.)  Frequently, the extra shipping cost is more than offset by
our lower parts prices.

If you need a part in a hurry, that's the way to go.
