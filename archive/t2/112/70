Rob, don't remember for sure what year you are working on, but the pump
looks about right.  Looks a little different than mine for the electrical
connections, but generally the same.

How long since you changed the fuel filter?
I would change filters first.  Then do the other test.

make sure you watch the gauge as the pump is running as it should hit
125psi+ almost instantly if you have a good pump and have the fuel ring
squeezed off on the regulator end.  

This is gonna be dangerous...

You are correct, fuel pump capable of about 125psi.  Pressure regulator
bleeds off what the injectors don't want.

Good luck, dave
