Subject: FI questions: AFC website moved

Volks and T2-admins:

Since excite(-at-)home shut down, I had to move my "bus-stuff" website. 

Both the step-by-step FI troubleshooter and the 911-conversion page are
there. 
(Can the admins please update the links from the type2 library?)

It's now at 
homepage.mac.com/samdak/bus-stuff

Thanks,

Sami
