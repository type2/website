Subject: Why can't people fix things right?

Ever notice just how many VWs out there have some sort of rigging on them? ON 
my recent purchase (86 Vanagon) the $8 plastic ignition switch broke but 
rather than replace it the previous owner went to a discount store, purchased 
a universal ignition, cut the factory wires, butchered the plastic housing 
and now the bus has to use two keys!  SOme people...  Can you guess how long 
I waited before putting it back the RIGHT way? I fixed it on my first day 
off! Same situation on my 63 Beetle! They ruined a never touched car to drill 
a hole in the dash to mount a horn button and to run a new wire to the horn. 
WHY? Because the horn ring broke!!!  Without it the horn won't make the 
needed contact!!! People can be so stupid! Also, this car had a European 
steering lock ignition. When the electrical part burned out the morons 
drilled a hole in the dash to place a regular USA switch in it. All that 
extra work when all they needed to do was to order the switch (like I did!). 
Now my extra dash hole is a cigarette lighter accessory socket.
Just don't get me started on my crew cab's nightmares....
I'm interested in any one elses "horror" stories.

resto), and Mystery (86 Vanagon).
