Subject: Sliding windows

Hey all,

Having a great time going over my new Bus.  For those of you who have
wondered, "leuchtorange" is code L 20 B, and "mexicobeige" is L E1 M.

This Bus has the much coveted sliding windows.  But they are in need of new
weatherstripping.  Is there a kit to replace this?  (It needs the outside
seal too, but that isn't what I'm talking about.)

Also, the bright work looks to be very faded Bright Dip.  Is it possible to
take these windows all apart and redo the metal, or paint it maybe, while I
have them (hopefully) apart to redo the weatherstrip?

What does "leucht" mean, anyway?

Thanks and happy Wednesday.
