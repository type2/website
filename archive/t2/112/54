I would like to remove it as one unit rather than seperating headers, heater boxes, crossover tubes, U tubes, muffler, etc. Many of these pieces are rusted together and while I have access to an acetylene torch, I'm not much good at it and I'd like to save those hours and leave things stuck together. 

Whether or not you can get it off in one piece or not I would break
all the pieces apart and replace the hardware & seals. Use stainless
steel fastners and lock washers & i think you will be pleased w/ the
results. With it off the bus applying heat will be much easier as
well.
