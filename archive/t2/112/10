Subject: Recycling Yards around Ft, Myers, FLA

Dear Members,

Soon the little woman, the dog and I will make our
pilgrimmage to get out of the cold north and into the
sun.  

If you know of any good recycling yards (I hate to use
the term "junkyards" as all the good stuff in them)
particularly for bays and Karmann Ghias, please let me
know.

Also would like to meet bus and KG owners around there
just to shoot the bull, etc...  I'll even bring
refreshments!!

Please help me, so I have an excuse not to go
shopping.

Thanks,
Chuck
