best one I've had was the zip tied broken fuse block, after replaceing it
all kinds of things started to work again ; )
This one might have had an excuse, its a one year only part. A lot of the
other stuff you find tho falls into the 'never enough time to do it right,
but always enough time to do it over' school of mechanics.
