Subject: Accelerator Belt

Hey All!
	   Well, after over 10,000 miles through the desert, forest and coast I
finally saw my poor 76 camper on the back of a tow truck last night. Luckily
it is only the accelerator belt that snapped, but I need another one soon,
because I am moving this weekend! I am in Palo Alto; does anyone know where
to get one short notice around here?

Thanks much!
Cara
