I'm putting the engine in this weekend and I'd appreciate hearing directly
from anyone with a recommendation of which weight oil to use here in Texas
(don't want to start a huge thread on the topic). Also what weight gear oil
is recommended for a manual transmission? -- Richard 78 Westfalia Owner 

New engine HD30.  For break in at least.
From there you can switch to 20-50 or stay straight 30 or 40 (if it is
really hot in the summer).

I tend to stay HD30 all year now in Georgia.  My reason being that the heat
in the heads is enough to break multi viscosity oil down to a straight
weight quickly anyway.  So might as well leave out the extra stabilizers and
just go straight weight.  Make sure the oil has an API "SL" rating (over the
cheaper oils having "SJ") since it is the latest and greatest.  Granted in
the owners manual the factory grade at the time of manufacture was like
"SG", so oil does evolve over time. 

As for the tranny GL-4 for ALL VW bus manuals.  Do not get GL-5!  Only in
the automatic was GL-5 used.

Lots of past threads on this, hit the archives for a weeks worth of reading.
