Subject: '78 Exhaust Removal to swap to new Engine

Hi All,

The new engine came from AVP today for my '78 and I got right to the process of getting things =
swapped. Most of what I see is pretty straightforward (although any tips are more than welcome), =
but I'm having trouble with the exhaust.

I figure it is best to remove the exhaust system while the old engine is in the bus. I would like =
to remove it as one unit rather than seperating headers, heater boxes, crossover tubes, U tubes, =
muffler, etc. Many of these pieces are rusted together and while I have access to an acetylene =
torch, I'm not much good at it and I'd like to save those hours and leave things stuck together.=20

I undid the hangars I could find as well as removed the accordian tubes and disconnected the =
heater box control cables. I removed the nuts on the exhaust manifolds. However, I can't seem to =
jiggle the exhaust free. Am I just dreaming that I can remove it in one piece or is there a trick?

Thanks much!

Mark
