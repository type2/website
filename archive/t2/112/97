almost, i bought a 71 Westy for 60 bucks(dead stickers
on all the windows), with high hopes of restoration.
all four tires where flat, it was made of rust, the
lady who sold it to me had neither keys nor a title,
and as far as the engine, who even knows. one thing i
noticed right off the bat(on the engine), was that the
hoses that are supposed to run from the fan housing to
the heat exchangers were missing because the holes,
both in the fan housing and in engine tin, had been
pop riveted shut. the thing was a filth pit inside. so
much so that it grossed me out to be in there. one
interesting modification that i noticed was that
someone had drilled a hole in the front driver's side
window post(right next to the windshield all the way
up top, and ran a hose through. my only guess as to
why they did that is so that smoke of various kinds
could be blown out of the vehicle with the windows
still up. didnt take me long to realize that this was
a chop job. which is precisely what i've done. 

BTW- I myself am a deadhead. one who takes very good
care of his bus. so just because one listens to the
dead, does not make one a slacker who neglects
beautiful machinery. just wanted to say.
