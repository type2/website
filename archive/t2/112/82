the question:
"Can someone direct me to the W-C VW list? "
was answered with
"We are all on the same team!!!  You just have a bigger wealth of info from a
forum that deals with the waterboxer type buses daily.
You can simply go to www.vanagon.com to sign up for the mailing list.
Good luck!!

	actually it is http://gerry.vanagon.com/ . The vanagon page is a
private page from "coyote" who at one point was moderator of the vanagon
mailing list. But be prepared for lots of non vanagon relevant mail.
