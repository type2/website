IMHO a well designed exhaust system will out perform "no exhaust pipe".
Bear in mind that a VW exhaust system is designed to be quiet and provide a 
source of heat. Exhaust systems can be tuned to help give a good spread of 
power or a good or maximum power but over a limited engine speed. Exhaust 
system design seems to be a black art that every one has an opinion on.
