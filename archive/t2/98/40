David has a point.
The front seats in my 77 Microbus(a bench & a drivers
bucket) have had it in a BIG way & only a blanket & an
EXTREMELY thin seat cover are saving my wife and I
from a trip to the proctologists :-(
Is there any way to re-pad the seats when I have them
re-trimmed so that they'll be a bit more like modern
seat?
I had Recaro's(sports seats) in my last camper & they
were without rival & was wondering if there is a way
to modify the padding so both bucket & the bench are
more comfortable.
:-)
