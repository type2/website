Subject: dizzy-shaft lube/points oxidizing


Hey Volks,

I recently pulled a dizzy from my parts box and popped it in
to my bus, but I've just gotten to thinking that I might
add a drop of lubricant to the dizzy shaft where it rubs
against the points block.

What would one use for this?

Also, the new Bocsh points which I installed 1500 miles ago
have already oxidized pretty bad.  What would cause this?

At the time I had installed a new cap, rotor, and points, 
but had NOT installed a new condenser (this has since
been rectified), could a bad condenser/weak-coil cause
premature oxidation, or...?

Thanks!
