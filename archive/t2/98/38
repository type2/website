Subject: Adding and Converting AC Systems

Hi All,

Anyone see the three part series on adding AC in VW
Trends?  The third part looked pretty informative and
mentioned the lower power demands of Sanden
compressors over the old York.  Are there standard
brackets for adapting Sanden to mount like a York?  I
think the Sanden 508 was supposed to be a good unit,
anyone know if they are used as oe on any vehicles?

I only saw part 3 of the AC series.  Anyone read the
other 2?  They probably talked about where to mount
condensers and evaporators, and maybe where to get
them.

I'm thinking about converting my 80 Westy AC to R134. 
I'm guessing I need to change to barrier hoses, and
probably switch accumulators and go with a Sanden
compressors.  Anyone ever switch theirs to R134?

Rob
