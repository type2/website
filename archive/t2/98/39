    I have a 72 westy with the original seats I rebuilt with pads and =
covers from sew fine. Look great but a bit tough after long drives. I'm =
looking for ideas to replace them with a more user friendly seat, more =
comfortable. Does anybody have experience with seats that will work =
here? By the way, thanks to all for your recent help with my "sudden =
power loss" the other day. Jake Raby suggested a broken hydraylic lifter =
as this is a 2.0L. I'll keep you informed as to the outcome of the =
repair. After eliminating the fuel and spark/electric avenues it seems =
logical that this is the problem....but then logic seems to fly out the =
window with any repair I attempt.
