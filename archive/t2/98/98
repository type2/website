Subject: Re: [T2] VW Thing BN4

The basic heater unit is the same in both applications, however, the ducting
is much different.  In the thing, the ducts are two 90 degree elbows, in the
bus, the duct is a long rectangular metal duct that slips beside the gas
tank.  And if you had a BN4 heater that recycled the inside air, there was
in addition this twisted plastic duct that went up the left rear pillar and
vented inside the bus.

A bug never used the BN4 (16,000 BTU), just the BN2 (8,000 BTU)  In
comparison, the South Wind heaters put out 13,000 BTU for the bug models and
20,000 BTU for the bus models with almost double the cubic feet per minute
of blowing heated air.
