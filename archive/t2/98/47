My only and best advice would be to consult www.busboysinc.com and look for
the rebuild kits for your seats. They sell new covers and padding. You just
need a pair of Hogring pliers to install. The only other option I am aware
of is to get yourself a nice set of Vanagon seats and slide em in. They go
right on a 78' you just have to remove the drivers side left arm rest. In
your case you may need to unbolt the runners from your old seats and bolt
them to the Vanagon seats.

David has a point.
The front seats in my 77 Microbus(a bench & a drivers
bucket) have had it in a BIG way & only a blanket & an
EXTREMELY thin seat cover are saving my wife and I
from a trip to the proctologists :-(
Is there any way to re-pad the seats when I have them
re-trimmed so that they'll be a bit more like modern
seat?
I had Recaro's(sports seats) in my last camper & they
were without rival & was wondering if there is a way
to modify the padding so both bucket & the bench are
more comfortable.
:-)
