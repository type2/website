>http://www.universal-co.com/  They make a great
product in the Tiger 581 and excellent customer
support... Granted it is not listed these days
only the 681 which used to be their "high-end"
unit.  Hoover is a big advocate for the 581 as
well and who turned me onto it.

Is Hoover still around?  I know about the
copyright fiasco on vanagon.com, just wondering
if anyone stays in contact with.  Anyone tried
inviting him here?  

How I miss those sermons.
