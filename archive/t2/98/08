Subject: big exhaust - '77 2.0L Westy

Hello T2ers,
I am looking to put a larger than stock exhaust system on my 77 westy. my 
discovery at the local vw import store yesterday was that the Dual Quiet 
Pack system is unavailable for busses from 75-79. So, i could have a single 
QP, which feels like less than maximum airflow. So, does anyone have a 
source for a fatboy or other large exhaust for the late 70's busses. i am 
considering the ceramic sinlge QP bupack system, any thoughts on all this 
rambling?
Thanks,
-jeremy
