So I posted earlier that I am having problems starting the new engine in =
my 71 bus. I have a compufire installed in a 009 using a blue bosch =
coil. In attempting to troubleshoot why I don't seem to have a coil =
spark (I know there are 12v going into the coil) I was looking at my =
compufire, after putting in a different coil that while I don't know how =
strong it is I know that it worked for me about 3 months ago. So in =
looking at the compufire pamphlet troubleshooting guide I see that it =
says there is supposed to be a gap of only .030-.10 between the =
compufire module and the little round rotor they provide. I would guess =
the gap to be a quarter of an inch or so on mine, which would likely =
give me my starting problems. So my question is does anyone know what I =
am talking about, ever had this problem before, or know how to fix it? I =
believe that they make different modules for different dizzys, would =
this be consistent with the wrong module for the 009? Any ideas? Thanks =
to all for you advice earlier.=20
