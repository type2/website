I just did this on my 76. Most of my VW Buddies refer to pre-80 front seats 
as "torture devices"...especially on long trips...got tired of using 
pillows,etc....soooo...I bought a pair of 86 Vanagon seats, but had to 
replace the seat rails also.  This required chiseling the existing ones off 
my 76 also had to countersink the mounting holes on the rails and use 
stainless tappered bolts to mount the rails. Also need to build up one side 
of each rail with steel shims as there is a drop off on the right rail on 
each side. If you have a buddy that can weld them on, moeasy. If you have a 
78 or later bus, the rails are the same.  Good Luck!
