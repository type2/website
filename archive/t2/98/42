Subject: RE: [T2] Adding and Converting AC Systems

I don't have experience with the converting of an a/c system to use the new
Sanden stuff, but I did read the article. I checked out the websites named
and emailed them. I cannot remember what website it was, but they are in the
process of making a complete custom a/c system for the bay window busses.
They said it will be ready in a few months. This system uses Sanden 508
compressor and will have all brackets. They also sell the stuff separately.
You may want to email them and find out if they have the brackets you need.
The website was the last one in the article. I do not have the mag here
right now, but if you find the website address, send it to the list. I think
it was Gilmore Enterprises or something like that. The author of the article
made it sound like the best deal and I think it may be. The only catch is
that some of their systems for split window busses cost about $1200. A
little high for a/c.

Subject: [T2] Adding and Converting AC Systems


Hi All,

Anyone see the three part series on adding AC in VW
Trends?  The third part looked pretty informative and
mentioned the lower power demands of Sanden
compressors over the old York.  Are there standard
brackets for adapting Sanden to mount like a York?  I
think the Sanden 508 was supposed to be a good unit,
anyone know if they are used as oe on any vehicles?

I only saw part 3 of the AC series.  Anyone read the
other 2?  They probably talked about where to mount
condensers and evaporators, and maybe where to get
them.

I'm thinking about converting my 80 Westy AC to R134. 
I'm guessing I need to change to barrier hoses, and
probably switch accumulators and go with a Sanden
compressors.  Anyone ever switch theirs to R134?

Rob
