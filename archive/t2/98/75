Interesting.  I visited Jerry at his shop a couple of years ago and got the 
impression that he wasn't going to stay "in the business" much longer.  In 
any case, he probably could help.  In my book, he qualifies as a Bus/AC 
guru even though I don't agree with everything he says.  He did also make a 
kit to mount the Sankyo/Sanden compressor in the stock location which 
looked very nice.  Wasn't cheap though.
