Scott et al,
Since you guys seem to have some background here, maybe you can answer a
question.

The 71 adventurewagen i have had an AC system in it. The old lines running
from the front to the back of the machine are some pretty stout stuff and
looks to be in great shape.

Would this line work for replacement hose for the brake booster on 71 and
later busses?

Not sure, but we have the correct brake booster hose for your bus.  It's
wolven with wire in it to keep it from collapsing. It's from Wurth * The
Assembly Professionals* one of our suppliers.
