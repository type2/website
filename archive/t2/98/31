Subject: replaced all hoses but one I cant find a replacement for.

In preparation for the first start of my newly rebuilt engine in my 75
bus I have replaced all hoses but one, the crankcase ventilation hose.
This is the hose leading from the oil breather box to the air intake
elbow.  The metal sleeve in the air intake elbow measures 22 mm or 7/8".
The original hose was brittle and cracked. Asked around at all the FLAPS
in town and no one has anything that would fit snug let alone hold up as
an emissions type hose. I bought some kind of poly hose at the hardware
store that they said would hold up to most anything but it is too stiff
and will not stay bent. It eventually pops loose of the fittings. Any
suggestions? What should this hose be made of to substitute for the
original?

Thanks to all who helped me figure out where all my hoses were supposed
to connect.
Tom
