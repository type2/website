I have tried both.  The problem with the mechanical pump was that the 
replacements did not seem to last as long as they should.  In an emergency 
I had to switch to an electric which has worked fine for years...

except that I have been having more frequent problems with flooding the 
engine lately and I suspect it could be possible the electric pump is 
developing too much fuel pressure and overpowering the float valve.
