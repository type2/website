>>What cleans the upholstery best?<<

i recently used 'Resolve' upholstery cleaner on the 76 Westy plaid in my bus.
it worked wonders.  it was the foaming type of cleaner in an aerosol can.
available at Wally World for a few bucks a can.

if it works on fabric that old, then it might do a good job on the
Vanagon seats.

YMMV.
