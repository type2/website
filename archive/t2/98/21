I've rebuilt enough of them and their stupid little green "O" rings around
the cylinders! Heck, the gasket kit costs about as much as the rebuild!
Remember to put a ground strap from both heads to the crankcase or the
electrolisis will eat up the head gasket mating surface. And you don't need
a special tool for the #2 wrist pin removal, just rotate the crank untill
the wristpin is even with the water pump hole and use a 7/8" easy out and
pull the wrist pin right through the water pump hole. Oh, and stay away from
first year 83 waterboxers, odd size 215mm flywheel. Go with 84 to 90 with
the 228mm flywheel.

I am looking for the spring 2001 issue that has the first part of a
waterboxer rebuild article in it.  If anyone has this issue and can part
with it, let me know.
