Subject: Re: [T2] chopped bus, no title, HELP ME!!!


Well, Matty, i used to have a couch that i did not want. so, i used a 
chainsaw and threw away a chunk each week with regular garbage delivery. it 
took several months, your bus could take a year, but why not practice your 
cutting and grinding techniques?
  in all seriousness, you could post the usable panels on the internet for 
sale, and people with bus damage could be responsible for buying the pieces 
and cutting them off...
