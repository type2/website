Might I suggest Phillip K. Smith's "The Scientific Design of Exhaust and
Intake Systems".  Will be the best $25 investment you'll ever make. 

Another *must have* is A. Graham Bell's "Performance Tuning in Theory &
Practice".  

Between the two tomes, you can design and spec a motor to make the
torque and hp where it needs to be.  I used them to set up a Datsun B110
1200.  Finally dyno'd at 82 hp at the rear wheels.  Nice racecar!

I would not buy a header for any motor without Smith's book.  His tables
allow one to *know* what size primary, collector and secondary pipes are
needed to put the power where you need it to be.
