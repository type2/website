I have heard in the past that a few guys have been using 6 volts starters on 
their 12 volt systems.  They say it had better starting power and more torque 
I believe.  Now I have a new 6 volt starter that is just gathering dust, are 
there any pro's or cons to using the 6 volt starter?  Also is the bushing the 
same?  And if the only draw back is wearing out a starter quicker, no biggy 
I'll throw the old 12 volt inside just in case.
