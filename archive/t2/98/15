Hiya Robert,

It seems that I have run into these hinge covers in a number of places.  One 
aftermarket source that comes to mind is West Coast Metric (211 530A L/R).  
Kinda spendy at $66.00 for the pair.  You might find them cheaper from Ron 
over at the Bus Depot, he handles WCM parts.  And I know that I've seen them 
in other catalogs.  You might also try Wolfsburg West or BFY.
