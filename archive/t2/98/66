Hmmm.  Very interesting.  I'm trying to track down an intermittent "hiccup" and 
have had no success as yet.  It doesn't do it at idle, and I don't notice it at 
full throttle.  But at light-to-medium cruising speeds (any gear, any speed, 
any RPM) it just "hiccups" every minute or so (no particular timing to it, just 
on average about once a minute).  I'll try swapping out for the coil from my 58 
and see if it fixes it...

Thanks.
