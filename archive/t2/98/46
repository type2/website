Kirk,

There is an "overpressure" hold up there that normally allows air in the
trans to escape as everything warms up.  Having the bus jacked in the rear
while you ran for 20 minutes would cause oil to come out instead of air as
everything warmed up.

No biggie, just refill once you set the bus back down.

Cheers, dave
