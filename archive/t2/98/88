Subject: EveryBus 2002 pdf now on line !

Hello,

Greg Potts from the Great White North has kindly put together a flyer 
for EveryBus 2002 that anyone can download and distribute to buses 
and busers in their locale without Internet access. This is a great. 
Print off as many as you like and carry them in the bus with you. 
When you see another bus parked somewhere you can leave it on the 
windshield :)

Big thanks to Greg!
