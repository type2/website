Folks,

I have a'66 Kombi that was retro'ed with a '63 23 window rag top.  The guy =
I bought it from put in cargo doors on the drivers side to turn it into a =
jump through, and it had already beed converted to a bucket seat walk =
through, by cutting out the center and bending down the panel that runs =
along behind the bench seat. =20

I haven't really driven it yet, as my son and I are  building up a =
Bergmann 1835cc long block.  It is taking time because of the extreme =
weather . . . watch for us on tv tomorrow night . . . opening ceremonies!  =
No, not at $800 a ticket!  But we do live right next to the women's hockey =
venue . . .

My question is, should I replace the solid panel that was originally =
behind the bench seats?  It seems to me that would give me back some =
significant structural strength.  I happen to have a '67 Westy who's rear =
interior was torn out and the body is in bad shape.  The front seat panel =
is still in good shape though.  I could just drill out the pop welds, =
clean it up a little and take out the messy walk through set up and =
reinstall the panel. =20

Is it worth it?  I noticed the white and peach custom in this month's Hot =
VW's, 23 window, jump through/walk through.  I wonder what they did to =
beef up the structural integrity of the body/frame?

I enjoy this list!  Fun stuff.  I've been driving a VW air-cooled since I =
got my licence back in 1965!

Best,

Curt Conklin
