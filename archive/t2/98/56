Subject: Last time about ? part

Hey all,
    I promise this will be the last post from me on this topic. I am still
trying to determine 3 things about this piece that came out when I pulled my
rear Trans seal.
1. what is it called (Oil Sling return, bearing race. This is more for my
piece of mind)
2. does it need to be pressed in
3. would I be best served just replacing the bell housing ($20 bucks from my
FLARS)

Rob posted some pics I sent to him on his website. Please take a look and
let me know.

I am trying to get the motor in before Edisto.
Thanks,
Jim
