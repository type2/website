I found some 84 Vanagon seats without any rips. Unfortunately, the seats =
are still attached to the Vanagon, and my Bentley is currently misplaced =
somewhere. I can't figure out how to get either set of seats out short =
of using my Saws-all on the floor boards.=20

Questions are:

Do 84's work well in a 78?

How do you get the seats out of an 84 (and the same question for a 78)?

What cleans the upholstery best?

Will the human race survive the next decade?

Thanks for any answers.
