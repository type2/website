I have used horse stall mat on my floor, it has made a pretty big difference, it is also a heat insulator, but it is heavy, I bought it off a roll at Coastal Farm Supply in Gresham, Oregon, I put a drop under the rear matress to use for kneeling and even though it doesn't cover the whole back I could tell the difference, I plan to cut a piece to fit.
I think it will keep moisture on top off it based on the recommended uses including a mat to protect concrete patios from barbecue grease stains.
I have also used a cheap imitation dynamat in my doors and front ceiling (its a westy) and it was very helpful, probably not as helpful as filling the braces inside the sliding door with fresh caulking, the old caulking had dried up and my door was like a giant cymbal.
I have heard that the wheel wells are where the big difference can be found, I finally have some better seats and will be using fake dynamat under the seats like Cali78VW showed in his pictures when I replace my seats.
Last year I also was amazed to notice how loud hail, rain, and bugs were when they hit my nose, I think that upgrading the insulation and trying to seal up the interior panels in the nose would be a big help.
As for my bus I know that I am hearing a ton of seal air leaks, I know that a complete replacement has to be worth a few decibals, and I am also actively looking for sliders to replace my jalousies to deal with the same issues, plus some others.
I read an article about 18 months ago about a guy building a sound proof room for drumming in his condo, you could probably search the internet for it, very interesting, things to learn.
