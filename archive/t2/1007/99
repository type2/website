Subject: oNCE AGAIN...THE TIRE/RIM CORUNDUM

I have some beautiful audi rims, that fit my van perfectly, and much as I
appreciate the stock reccomendations for tires and van load, they were for the
era of the van, and at that time were the "supreme" knowledge!  But I am going
to go on a "road not taken", and put the Sway away rear bar set up, with "big"
tires, and modified shocks and front stabilzer bars, and  because I mostly use
"normal Government" paved roads, I have here, I am going to see how this 1800,
works with this setup!  The reason, is that I saw that "short show" on
"utube", of the VW bus in action, and ...yes I know costs... create my own
"fun bus"because we decide what we want to do ! Just once I want to be in the
passing lane on the two lane mountain roads around here  Will keep you posted!
"Flame wall up"!
