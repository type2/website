He said he had left them out because they were not on there to begin 
with - he wasn't totally sure if he needed them.  However, he did say 
that there were no head gaskets and he did put 0.010 shims underneath 
each of the cylinders.

I'm wondering if the headers are really seating against the exhaust 
ports.  We'll run it again and do some more research...
