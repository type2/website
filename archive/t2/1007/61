Subject: Removing a rusted side vent window 

Hi Volks,

There's a local bus I am doing some rust repair work on, and part of  
that project is replacing the side rear window vent with a piece of  
solid glass. The problem is that the original vent wing has rusted  
shut, and the lower frame of the vent wing has corroded away to  
almost nothing.

How is the vent-wing attached to the window frame? I can't begin to  
guess looking at the rusty mess in front of me. I could chop it out  
piecemeal with my angle grinder if I had to, but if someone were to  
tell me where the bolts are it would make the process a whole lot  
easier.

This diagram suggests that the L-bracket labeled 7B is what holds it  
in place; I can't quite make that out from the crusty ruin I'm  
working with.

Suggestions would be welcome from those who've done this themselves.


Happy Trails,
