Subject: '78 Hard starting and now it will not idle

Trying to make a long story short, in the year I've known this bus it's been hard starting, a couple months agoI drove it from Central America (5000mi) and it got to where it would not idle, this week it takes starting fluid to get it going. I have all along been thinking fuel pressure valve but posts lately make me not want to spend $120 if it could be 10 other things. I have no garage or test equip so I guess I need a knowledgeable semi local shop in the Philipsburg, NJ, Easton, PA area, any recommendations?
