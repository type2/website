Subject: Re: [T2] E Brake Warning Light Lens

VW# 113 919 233 B

This is the entire warning light assembly, lens was never available
separately.  Fits:

Std Beetles 72-77
Super Beetle 1972
K Ghia Late 72-73
Type 2 68-79

Not to be confused with 111 919 233 B Warning Light, which was similar and
you pushed the lens to "test" the light while the vehicle's engine was
running.  The electrical connections for this unit is different and not
interchangeable with the one you're looking for.  That one fit:

Std Beetles 68-71
Super Beetle 1971
K Ghia 68-Early 72

Time to hit the boneyards.  I'll have to check my stash and see if I have
anything, but it's been awhile.
