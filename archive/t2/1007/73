 Hi, thanks to Karl et al..but I still cannot find a line that might hook to
the brake booster!  Does it follow the Passenger heating tube side or the
drivers side?  I have been out there all day prodding and poking, but can't
seem to find it!  Guess I will have to trace it back from booster, to motor.

Drivers side. Try going from front to back.
