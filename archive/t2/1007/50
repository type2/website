I would try a few things.

First, I would do a test of the AFM to make sure it's in spec - check 
the Bentley for the procedures.

Next I'd clean all of your injector connections with progold - heck, 
clean everything with it.  It's a really good cleaner and I highly 
recommend it.

I would check to make sure your cold-start valve is operating correctly 
- check bentley for test procedures.

I'd also check to see that your head-temp sensor is within spec as well 
per bentley.

Last resort, I'd send your injectors to be cleaned esp cuz some plugs 
are wet and some aren't - that or you're not getting spark.  regardless, 
I think that would probably help a lot of people with 30-y/o injectors...
