Hi Kevin,
 I expect the capacitor is fastened to the body some how.  That is the "other wire" out of the cap.  The capacitor is there mainly to lessen alternator whine coming through the dc supply to the radio.  The "shack", amongst others, sells  inexpensive ~$10, inductor and capacitor filter kits that do a great job of killing that whine in low i.e. standard radio, to moderate power systems.  Adding the inductor in-line with the positive feed to the radio and putting the cap between the output of the inductor and a good solid ground will help any radio/music system in a vehicle. Higher power systems will need high current capability setups available from specialist suppliers. Highly recommended for any auto sound system.  
    Radio static and ignition noise comes in via the antenna, and will not be helped by power supply filters. jon

Thanks, I had heard about hooking a capacitor up, but I didn't understand how you were supposed to do it. Basically there is a wire from the fuse box that splits. One feeds the radio, and one goes into the capacitor. I guess what is weird to me is that the wire goes into the capacitor, but
 nothing comes out? I guess it is grounded on the turn signal cluster?
