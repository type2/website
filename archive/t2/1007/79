Jason,

I would refrain from attempting to draw any conclusions relating the "loss 
of power" and "oil leak" until you have more data.  The oil leak may just 
be a bad seal where the valve cover fits onto the head or something 
similar...hopefully!

What engine are you running/what year is your bus?

Have you done any work on the bus or engine lately?

Whatever you do, add some oil to that puppy and make sure you don't 
get too low!

Cheers,
    Tom
