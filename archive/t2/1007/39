Richard,

I have used E-dead to the same effect in my bus.  Frequently found in 1 
gallon containers on that unmentionable site.

I took the previously used stuff out of the front door panels and used the 
E-dead(two coats just for fun) and then used it under the rear seat along 
with 1/2" carpet insulation.  It goes on pretty thick with a brush.

I need a tach now to figure out if the engine is running...oh, and my 
front doors don't rattle anymore and sound like... ummmm cadilac? doors 
when closing them<grin>.

Took about 1/2 gallon for two coats on the front doors and 1 coat under 
the back seat.

Cheers, dave
