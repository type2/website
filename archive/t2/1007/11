Subject: Clankitty-clank.. Rattle rattle - Boy do I feel like an ass!

In trying to find the source of this clank, I finished lubing the axle and
took Zoe for a ride - still there. Frustrated, I got ready to call it a day
when a voice kept telling me to check the mounting bolts of the shocks once
more.

Turns out that the top DS mounting bolt was just loose enough. I
re-tightened all 4 and added some red Loc-Tite and by God she's tight.

I feel like an ass for not using Occam's Razor, but at the very least, I
learned how to lube the chassis.

Dee dee dee...

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
