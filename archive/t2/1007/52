Hi Airic,

Um... those numbers are a long way from good. 90 psi is the bare  
minimum compression spec according to VW. The conditions creating low  
compression also lead to poor vacuum, which will definitely lead to  
hard starting.

Put some oil in the bores and see if it comes up; might just need a  
ring job. If not, then you should start looking for a replacement  
engine.


Happy Trails,
