Subject: Removing engine with A/C, 1978 

Any pointers for removing an engine on a 1978 bus that has a big a/c
compressor on the left side?  It looks like I just take out the bolts on the
bottom of the bracket and the one on the side.That compressor looks heavy.
It has the under dash type of a/c with a blower on each side.  Is there
anywhere that you know of that has the installation instructions for these a/c
systems, it would be appreciated, which would include the belt size?

Also any suggestions on which pistons and cylinder sets to avoid , in the 94mm
size, would be appreciated.



Thanks

Eric
