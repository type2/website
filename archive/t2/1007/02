Karl,

Thank you very much for sending me the NLA turn signal cancellation nubs 
I needed.  They arrived today, and have already been installed.  Thanks 
for the installation instructions as well.

I've made a small donation to the type2 list on your behalf.  You sent 
me parts for free, and it's greatly appreciated.

Happily using my turn signals once again,

dan
