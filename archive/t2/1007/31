Subject: ZDDP and SM rated oil

On the ratwell.com page about which motor oil to use, Mr. Atwell says to use
SL rated oil if you can find it, because of the higher ZDDP allowed. I did
some research on the API website and found this long document, which in
appendix F (page 61, printed on page) says oil weights higher than 10W-30 do
not have the limitation on how much ZDDP is allowed, though a minimum of .06%
is specified (phosphorus, not ZDDP is actually what is limited):

7.pdf

Also, footnote "d" on that page says this is a non-critical
specification, which is confusing. Does that mean oil with more or less ZDDP
allowed, or what?

Anyway, does this mean I don't need to worry about using
SM-rated castrol GTX in 10W-40 or 20W-50 weights? I think so, but who knows...
