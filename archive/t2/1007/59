Subject: Re: [T2] fuses on a '69 and wiring update...

I noticed that the PO changed some of the fuses on my bus, I see some are
white and some are red. According to the wiring diagram they should all be
white. Which is 8amp. I am reading this thing correctly, and should I change
all my fuses to 8 amp white fuses? This is for my '69 single cab.

Bentley printed a correction to the wiring diagram. It is tough to find on
the website but here it is:
