Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak and lose of power

Hi Tom,

Sorry, my signature used to list that stuff, but I guess I turned it off.

I am running a '76 2.0 liter FI. The last time I did an oil change was a few
months ago, but I have done no significant engine work to speak of.

I am using her right now as my daily driver, which she has not been in over
5 years (primarily stored) so I thought that maybe asking so much out of her
after being stored for so long may have caused the issue. Lord knows I
developed enough vacuum leaks from that 5 years of storage...

-Jason
