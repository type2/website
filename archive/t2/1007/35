Subject: Brake Failure Light Question

Hello,

The brake failure light on my 73' just came on today. I also noticed that I
have to push the peddle in harder in order to get the bus to stop. The bus
still seems to brake fine, just not quite as good as before.

Before I jump into this, does this sound like a major problem? Is is
possible I am just low on brake fluid? Have any of you had similar issues?

Thanks!
