My radio has a fuse socket and fuse built into the back of it, although it
looks like a 10 amp fuse. Should I install an in-line 8 amp fuse as well?

Kevin, 

Regarding the fuses.  I would definitely replace them with the 8 amp fuses.
If they blow, then trace why. Loading a higher amp fuse is an amateur fix to
a overloaded circuit. Usually I have found that higher amp fuses are snapped
in when people connect radios, amps and alarms instead of installing in-line
fuses.
