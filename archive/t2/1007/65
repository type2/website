I see the image you are referring to, but that is the same as what is in my
Bentley. But the 12 fuse version is for later buses. I have a'69 ten fuse
bus.

Bentley printed a correction to the wiring diagram. It is tough to find on
the website but here it is:

Richard has a link for it on his website:
