Subject: E Brake Warning Light Lens

Hey all. If this is old hat I apologize - I searched the archives but cannot
find what I need.

This is probably the least of our worries but can someone point me to a
source for the Lens that covers the emergency brake warning light on the
dash? I've been told they are the same as a beetle but I'm not having any
luck.

Thanks ahead of time
