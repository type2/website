Why is that?  I just got new AVP heads and saw no recommendation to use 
them?  Also, I've read in many different places that you are supposed to 
remove the gaskets and use shims.  If I remember correctly, isn't this 
in the bentley as well?

The only reason I've heard to use them is if the head has been cut and 
the fins are hitting the head, but even then I've heard that it's still 
bad to use the gaskets..
