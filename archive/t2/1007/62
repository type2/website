Subject: RE: [T2] Removing a rusted side vent window

Just cut the seal all the way around.  I just did this on my '69.  I used a
putty knife and went around the whole perimeter of the window pushing it
between the rubber and glass on the outside.  That way you can remove the
whole outside part of the seal and the window will pop out, which will give
you room to work with the vent window.  If the vent window seems stuck, it's
probably got some rust holding it in place, but you shouldn't have to cut
any metal to get the windows out.  The sill is probably pretty munged up if
you already have rust issues, but you'll deal with that after the window is
out.

How is the vent-wing attached to the window frame? I can't begin to  
guess looking at the rusty mess in front of me. I could chop it out  
piecemeal with my angle grinder if I had to, but if someone were to  
tell me where the bolts are it would make the process a whole lot  
easier.

This diagram suggests that the L-bracket labeled 7B is what holds it  
in place; I can't quite make that out from the crusty ruin I'm  
working with.

Suggestions would be welcome from those who've done this themselves.


Happy Trails,
