I looked at the little video for that quiet car stuff and I have to say that
it looks pretty impressive. I love the idea of a roll-on type anyway because
you can get so much more out of it.

Watch the video if you haven't already, the cymbals test blew me away!

Thanks Ratwell!

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
