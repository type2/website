Subject: Clankitty-clank.. Rattle rattle

Hi Gang,

I hope this is just a simple question - but they seldom end up that way...

About 9 months ago, I changed my shocks to the KYB for front and back. Since
I changed them, my front end clanks like something is loose and bolts are
rattling around. My prior shocks were so dead, they seemed to be just for
show - but now that the new ones are actually dampening and doing their job,
I am afraid that it has either jostled something loose, or it is now
showcasing an issue that was otherwise covered up by bad shocks before. I
did in fact ensure that my shocks are on nice and tight (they are) and the
sound it NOT coming from them.

My first action was to look into my disc brakes thinking I might have had
the same problem as DurocShark in a loose bolt. However, when everything
seemed to be pretty stable, I realized that I have never lubed front axle...
ever. I certainly thought that might be the problem, so I got it all greased
up in all 5 points and plan to take it for a drive tomorrow to see.

However, I suspect that the problem would not be as simple as that. Or would
it be?

When I got the DS wheel off, I did push and pull on the disc a little and it
did make a little noise, but nothing like the large crash sound I am hearing
when I hit bumps.

Can an improperly lubed front end really make a lot of noise or does lubing
it simply just lengthen its lifespan?

Mahalo nui loa,

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
