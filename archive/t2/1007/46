I used some stuff from mcmaster carr, although I can't remember the exact
product. It was similar to dynamat but much less expensive. I put some on my
doors, and it made a dramatic difference when opening and closing. I can't
remember if it made a big difference with road noise. I put some in the
engine compartment, and I did not notice as much of a difference. I have
just recently learned about this quiet car stuff. I think I want to try it,
it sounds like a great product.
