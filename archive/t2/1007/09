Hi JC,
The Bolts and bushings that hold the tops and bottoms of the shocks in place.
There are a couple of rubber bushings and a cupped washer that sandwich the
top of the shock tower to the  shock stud on the top of the shock and a rubber
bushing with a metal bushing inside that on the bottom on the front of the
bus. On the rear of the bus, as I recall, you have the same setup as on the
bottom of the front shocks on both the top and bottom of the rear. Everything
should be snug tight. If the rattling continues to happen look for evidence of
cracks around these anchor points.

The 73 bus that I had was very uncomfortable for my size on long trips. I had
difficulty getting my long legs around the steering column and the seat would
not go back far enough for my Daddy Long Legs.  Loved the T-4 motor and trans
loathed the carbs. If  the diaphram in the brake booster goes, get it replaces
ASAP as you will pay the price for it in your knees for years thereafter. No
Kidding. Procrastinate and you'll be using a cane or a walker. By the way 2
walkers with a  pinned 2x4 bridge on each end and a 2X12 plank make a pretty
good light folding adjustable scaffold around the house and job site. The
bridge must be pinned in place with a nail in a small hole to keep the 2x4
bridge from sliding off the handles.

Hi JC,
Be Careful, That little boy is a true jewel and we all kinda like you and
Mandy a lot as well. As I recall Zoey has a 12 volt system. If so Hallogen
bulbs are the way to go.  When choosing between stock and safety, safety
always trumps stock. If you need stock for shows, etc., carry the stockers
with you and exchange them for the show  only, then switch them back before
you leave the event.
To adjust, carry an approptiate screw driver along and while on a straight and
smooth road observe how the high and low beams project. Adjust the low beams
to as high as possible without blinding the oncoming traffic about 100 or so
feet and keep the main part of the left beam just to the right of the center
line and the right beam just to the right of straight ahead. The high beams
take care of themselves.  To learn which direction to turn the screws for up
and down, and right to left, drive up to about 10 ft from a wall and turn the
screws in and out and see what the beams do. This way when you are out on the
road and the oncoming flashes their lights at you, you can quickly pull over
and make a quick adjustment and be back on the road in seconds. This is
similar consumer feedback or testing as a means of quality control in new
manufactured products.

Hugs to the fam.

Great idea! I think that will be a little more plausible for me since I do not
have a "screen" readily available.

I swear man, you need to drop that bug crap and get yourself back into another
bus!

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by their
lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable.
