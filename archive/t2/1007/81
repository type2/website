Subject: Recommended: Eccles' "VW Camper - The Inside Story"

I finally ordered a copy of "VW Camper - The Inside Story: A Guide to  
VW Camping Conversions and Interiors 1951-2005" by David Eccles. I  
got it a couple of days ago, and I recommend it.

It's not the perfect book about campers. The pictures are generally  
very small, and it's the pictures that make the book. It would also  
have been useful to include layout drawings.

(Note the "the inside story" in the title is a pun, not a reference  
to exclusive information.)

That said, the reason for the tiny pictures is that there are so many  
of them. Many, many conversions covered here -- not just those sold  
in the United States. For someone with a conversion they can't  
completely identify, or for people looking for ideas to augment their  
camper, the price of the book ($23.07 on Amazon) is well worth it.
