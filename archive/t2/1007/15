Subject: fuses on a '69 and wiring update...

So aside from working on my horn this weekend, I spent some time cleaning up
the weird wiring stuff going on.

I replaced some wiring that the PO put in with some that more closely
resembled the colors of the wiring diagrams. For example I bought some grey
wire and a red sharpie to make the gray/red wire that lights up the
instrument cluster lights. I got all the instrument lights to work properly.


I took a couple switches out and cleaned up all their connections. The whole
area under the dash was covered in tons of dirt/dust etc. 

I got the interior light to work, the PO had gotten paint all over it when
he painted the interior. I also re-connected the defroster switch, although
I don't have a defroster on my rear window, but now I'm ready to go when I
get one.

I noticed that the PO changed some of the fuses on my bus, I see some are
white and some are red. According to the wiring diagram they should all be
white. Which is 8amp. I am reading this thing correctly, and should I change
all my fuses to 8 amp white fuses? This is for my '69 single cab.

I also noticed that the wire going to the fuse box that is supposed to feed
the radio, also connects to something that looks like a capacitor, that is
connected under the turn signal pod. I don't see this in the wiring diagram,
should I keep it? What does it do? 

Again, thanks for any suggestions comments...
