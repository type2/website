Subject: Oil leak and lose of power

Today I was taking Zoey up to work (which is in the mountains) and I noticed
that not only do I have a very serious oil leak going on that's covering the
PS heater box, but I had to take most of the hills in 2nd that I would
normally have taken in 3rd and pushed 4th!

I have not done a compression test, as I do not have a tester (I am at work
- but will get one on the way home) but I guess I wanted to see if anyone
else thinks that I may have blown a head gasket? I first noticed the oil
last night when I came home from a Dr. appointment. The lose of power is
what is directing me toward compression and the head.

If it is a head gasket leak, must the engine come out to replace it or can
it be done with the engine still in?
