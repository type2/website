Subject: good speaker for my Vanagon 83 wanted !!

Hi Volks ,

I'd like to change my original speakers (front and back) by a good (not 
too expensive) ones.
I would like to know if one of you guys have some nice experience with a 
brand on a vanagon.
I am a jazz-rock musician (my music style is weather report , jaco 
patorious , Stanley Clark , step ahead , .....) and would like a 4" 
speakers which could reproduce the bass sound nicely.
Thanks for any info.

Chris

Vanagon 83
