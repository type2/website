Subject: Converting single to dual carbs

Does anyone know a good write-up, or have any tips for this surgical
procedure?  I need to remove the stock air cleaner on my single carb 1776 to
accommodate dual Kadrons.  Do I have to take out the stand for the filter
(like cut it)?  As a side note, anyone interested in a Zenith dual throat
carb ndjs/32?  From a Porsche 356 I believe.
