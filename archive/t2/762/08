Subject: Oil leaks and danger to engine

I am just wondering if I can let a slight oil leak go on my engine long 
enough to take a trip? It will be 1000 km and it is from the famous #3 
push rod tubes at the valves.

I also have a small persistent leak at my "engine front" or just behind 
the fan.

Total loss of oil, maybe 1 litre every 2500Km. and that is a big guess. 
It's likely smaller.

I am just trying to manage the risk to the engine.

Cheers,

Alan
