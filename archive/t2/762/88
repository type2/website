Hi Richard,

That's true, but when a tired driver wants a chance to catch some Z's  
while the co-pilot takes a turn at the wheel it can be a true PITA in  
the worst kind of way. And in the neck, and in the spine. We drove 12  
hours straight coming back from Harper's Ferry this spring, and the  
lack of recline was a not-so-welcome surprise.



Happy trails,
