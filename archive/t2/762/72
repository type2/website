You can do wonders with the closed cell foam available on a roll at Home 
Depot- (1/8" thick is good).
Run it in the track the original seal pushes against and ity should stop 
the whistle.  If your original seal is shot completely, You can use it 
alone- I sealed up a Hyundai hatchback this way; leaks not a drop; 
before, water would collect in the spare tire well.....
