I am just in the middle of a long term check on my mpg, and have exactly 
the engine setup you describe (1600 dp, 34 pict 3 carb - stock for my UK 
73 kombi). On a mix of town motoring, school runs and faster motoring on 
a main road I get 21.8 mpg with very little variation from one fill up 
to the next. Best I ever had was 28mpg, but that was entirely motorway 
(freeway?) and I had accidentally set my spark to about 10 degrees 
advanced (knew even less then than I do now). Don't want to think about 
that particular run - engine had been completely leak free until then....

Just a thought - how does UK mpg relate to US mpg? Are the gallons and 
miles in question exactly the same?
