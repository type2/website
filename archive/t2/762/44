Subject: AIRS help - Laster stranded in OK

I just got a call from Jason (FasterLaster), who is on the home stretch 
of his tour out west with his wife and four kids.

His one-wheeled trailer had a blowout and he's trying to get it 
repaired (or a new wheel).  He is just shy of Muskogee, and I gave him 
the phone numbers (from the AIRS list) of a few people in Broken Arrow.

if anyone reads this and can offer immediate assistance (or a place to 
sit and watch fireworks with a frosty beverage), I (he, we) sure would 
appreciate it.

Stephanie's cell phone is 615-828-3261.
