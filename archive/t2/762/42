Interesting problem. The bus was rolled. Post photos.
Was there any initial body work performed?
Has the bus been checked by a frame shop or taken for
an accurate wheel alignment check?
Define "slightly askew".
Bent sheet metal askew can be repaired by professional
frame straightening or bodywork techniques beyond the scope
of a beginner. Suspension askew I have a resonably simple
cure for. The rear torsion bars have an adjustment feature.
One side can be adjusted such that the diagonal opposite
corner comes up or down, thus effecting a "corner balance"
condition. This will require accurate measurement on
a level surface at the four corners to determine where
and what to adjust. It really depends on exactly what
is wrong, and how much adjustment is required.

Prime any bare metal or body filler immediately,before it gets wet
or exposed to high humidity. The key is to keep the metal covered.
I use a quality etch primer(Dupont Variprime)on bare metal,
and a quality epoxy primer over filler. Filler is porous,
cheap acrylic or polyester primer is too. Applying primer
is a good place to learn how to paint.
Good Luck!
