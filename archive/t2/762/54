Subject: question about missing

while tweaking the timing, dwell, etc on the craptacular case, i came 
across a bit of a mystery.  dwell is spot on at 50, timing is 8* btdc 
at idle, about 35* at speed.  dizzy is a new 205 (i assume the puebla 
zb, as i bought it new from an ebay store that was bringing in 
grey-market bits a few years ago).

anyways, i did notice that the strobe timing light was indicating a 
random miss at idle - sometimes there, sometimes quite a lot of miss, 
sometimes none.  hmmm.

revved the motor, and the timing light would often simply go OUT at 
30* advance and above. no flashes at all. motor didn't seem to change 
sound or performance any, but it was repeatable almost every time (3 
out of five, say), so i stopped suspecting my 30-yr-old light and 
began to wonder about the motor!
brand new NGK plugs, haveta dig the number out of the trash, but 
similar to bosch w8bc iirc. gapped at .026.

i didn't have time before dark to test other wires for same effect; 
tomorrow i'll do so, and dig up an old wire and see if i get the same 
reaction.

what else should i look for?
