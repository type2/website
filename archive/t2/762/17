Subject: crapcase and carb update

might have gotten lucky on the 30/31 carb (which, as you no doubt 
recall, was not running for long, or restarting when it did work)... 
all the old gas seems to have done was give me a gummy float valve. 
cleaned it off (and polished the varnish off the lil' mixture needle 
- weird, looked like it had been anodized black), and it runs fine. i 
guess the fuel bowl would empty, and when i managed to knock loose 
the valve by my pounding on the dash and screaming, it would fill, 
run for a while, stick and repeat.

carb still needs retuning - too rich. but the thing runs at least. 
driving around the 'hood in the 112* heat last night gave head temps 
of 300, oil pressure of 45 and oil temp of 215.  not very good, 
actually, as i only drove like 5 flat, low-speed miles, but it's a 
start.  the oil pressure is 15 psi off the old figures, which i 
attribute to end play being at wear limit.  began to get drips from 
the case seam, but i sorta suspect  the sump plate is the source; 
sad, cuz i went the extra mile of getting the trick billet one... 
which did help, compared to the stock one, which positively oozed. 
the bugpack hex head oil piston plugs, on the other hand, have been 
great. not a drop, and they've stayed tight; the stock ones WOULD NOT 
stay torqued.

i need to do a compression check, as i suspect worn rings - i hadn't 
yet hooked up the hose from the oil filler to the air filter and a 
small spray of oil was splashed across the filter from the opening. 
if i'd had the $40 to rering it i woulda, but c'est la guerre.  i 
likely will use the bus only for in-town, non-highway trips for the 
10 months before it gets mothballed, so hopefully good enough is good 
enough.......
