Hi,

My type 2 is now really getting good to drive. The ride will soon be
helped with some Konis and I have tuned the engine a treat and starts
immediately. My wind whistle aside I have a final problem in that 2nd
gear is difficult to engage. Its not very bad but is a little stiff
almost like something is squeezing through a gap that is too small. I
have searched the archive but can't find anything to describe the
problem? Anyone know what it may be?

yours

Charles
