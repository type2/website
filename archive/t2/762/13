Subject: Koni's For Sale already

I made a mistake and the rear will not fit my IRS rear Split, to long.  I'll
sale the rears for what they cost me from Ron (Bus Depot), $200, and I'll pay
shipping to you.  If you don't want just rears I'll sale all 4 for the cost
from Ron minus the deposit (I'll eat the deposit and shipping), so that would
be all 4 for $350.
