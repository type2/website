Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting problems

Cable can be checked by having someone push in the clutch while you 
watch the arm on the trans- is it moving the required distance to 
release the clutch disk?  If play is correct but it is not moving far 
enough, suspect a stretching (to break soon if hanging by two threads). 


   I had similar symptoms when the clutch friction disk delaminated 
(came off the rivets) and the pieces pack themselves along the outer 
edge of where it sits against the flywheel.  Tended to grab even when 
pedal was in, finally refused to shift as it couldn't release the disk 
to stop trans shaft from spinning.

I also (on a long 10K trip had a problem where after camping in Upper 
Western Washington (very wet there).  In the morning I hopped in, pushed 
the clutch in (was still in gear) and cranked it and it jumped 
forward-in that case we assumed it was either the pilot bearing or due 
to overnight corrosion of the pressure plate to the flywheel or pressure 
plate.  Having the brakes sturdily on broke it free and it was fine 
after that.
