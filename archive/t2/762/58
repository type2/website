A quick test then:

Get some blue masking tape and tape the seals. It'll thicken the seal
and tell you if that's the problem. Blue tape because it seems to come
off easier than most other tapes.

Oddly enough, that's the one problem my 73 has never had. Even with
badly deteriorated seals it's never whistled. *knocks on wood*
