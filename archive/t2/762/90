I called Pertronix a year or so ago when I was having problems getting the 
gap they specified and was told the gap was not critical

 Don,

 I thought that everyone had agreed that the electronic points replacement
 units were non-adjustable and that the dwell settings taken from them were
 useless?

 Umm...you *do* need about .030 clearance between the magnets and the
 pickup tho....IIRC


 Seems like Richard actually called the Pertronix folks at one point and
 they repeated that the dwell numbers were immaterial and
 unchangeable....so I am really curious about how you changed them!

 Cheers, dave
