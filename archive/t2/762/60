Hi David,

First off, please make sure the CAPS LOCK light on your keyboard is  
not lit before you start typing your emails.

Secondly, A "tune up" is not what you need... you need some  
diagnostics done to determine what the problem is. It is NOT the  
thermostat, though you should get it replaced if it is broken.

If the engine is running rough there are many potential causes...  
ignition, compression or fuel system problems will all lead to  
reduced power. Another "tune up" might help, but I'd suggest you ask  
the mechanic to test the compression while it's in there. You might  
get lucky and find that an injector lead has come loose or a plug  
wire is off, or it could be worse. A compression test will tell your  
mechanic a lot about the condition of the engine.

Driving up a two-mile hill at 65 MPH is something that should be done  
carefully with a heat-soaked aircooled engine... I would strongly  
recommend you add a Cylinder Head Temp gauge if your planning on  
doing that a lot. Your engine will last a LOT longer if you keep the  
temperatures down.


Happy trails,
