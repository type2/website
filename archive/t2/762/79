Don,

I thought that everyone had agreed that the electronic points replacement 
units were non-adjustable and that the dwell settings taken from them were 
useless?

Umm...you *do* need about .030 clearance between the magnets and the 
pickup tho....IIRC


Seems like Richard actually called the Pertronix folks at one point and 
they repeated that the dwell numbers were immaterial and 
unchangeable....so I am really curious about how you changed them!

Cheers, dave
