First, DO suspect your timing light.  Check this with a different light.
Second, as you propose, check the timing light on all three other wires.

I suspect you will find that the light is fine and that the #1 wire is
shorting to ground somewhere but not sure enough to recommend skipping the
step of using a different light.  Occasionally you will find a light that
just cannot keep up at higher RPMs.  Occasionally you will also find a
older coil that cannot keep up at higher RPMs as well, although I doubt
this is your problem if the performance of the engine does not fall off t
higher RPMs, especially when warmed up.

OOK!
