Subject: no "soot" in one exhaust port. Help?

BACKGROUND: My bus has been popcorn-misfiring, and
backfiring on wind-down, plus the mechanic can't get
the newly-rebuilt stock dual carbs to right rich
enough.

I thought it might be the muffler, since every intake
issue has been checked and double-checked.

So I went to put a new stock muffler on, I pulled off
the old quiet-pack, this is what the exhaust port on
the passenger side looked like:

The far right port had no black "soot" in it like the
other three ports did.

Is this indicative of a bad mixture? or not firing at
all?

Which cylinder is that far right port for? The #1 or
the #2?

Can this be a clue to what's going on? I was about to
get a new carb, but maybe something's going on in the
engine/head?

The plugs were changed, the compression was checked,
even checked for a stuck valve and floating seat.  All
came out OK.

Advice?

Oh yeah, 72 Westy, with all stock 1700 type IV
dual-carb engine.
Thanks,
Jason
