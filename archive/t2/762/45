Subject: Shifting problems

Hi Everyone,
      Here is my problem, When I got back 200 mile trip the next morning when 
to work and couple of miles she shifted hard. After work I started her 
(clutch in) and she jumped forward. I played with clutch cable, everything was fine. 
I started her again she was fine until couple more miles I had a real hard 
time getting it in and out of gear.
       At I checked out the cable, shifting coupler, shifter, housing 
anything I could fined When the engine not running she shifts into all gears no 
problems. 
       I searched the archives and I might have what they call sticky 
shifting. A lot of people had this problem but only couple replies. One person talk 
about a bad pilot bearing causing this trouble. What other things should I 
check before dropping the engine.
       Thanks BW
