Depending on your price range... I'd recommend Carroll's Foreign Auto 
over in Glendale. They've done good work on my engines for a while, 
rebuilt for friends, etc. They do quality work. Ask for Bill. Tell him 
Timothy with the High Roof sent you.

BAP has closed their factory for VW engines. They said its because 
Mexico closed peoduction. Never much cared for BAP motors. Had one. It 
went out of warranty just before it went out. Go figure.

I had posted Carroll's as a resource for quality repairs in the Phoenix 
area. Wonder where it went....??? Hmmmmmm

Timothy in Phoenix,
1973 Fasty "Sport"
1977 Highroof "Little Buddha"
