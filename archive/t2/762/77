If you've got a plastic filter after the pump that's a definate no-no -- most plastic-bodied fuel filters can't handle the pressure of an EFI system for very long.  On the other hand, if it's got a metal body you're probably fine as-is, aside from the issue of unfiltered fuel potentially shortening the life of your pump.  Gripping hand is, the engineers at VW had a reason for putting things where & how they did, and putting things back to the way they're supposed to be can't possibly hurt anything.
