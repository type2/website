Subject: Yay! I wasn't overheating!!!

Since I don't yet have a CHT, when I had a sudden power drop when
pulling a long hill I thought (assumed) I was overheating. The odd
part was that if the hill was shallow enough for me to choose between
3rd at 45 (partial throttle) or 4th at 45 (floored) it would only do
the power drop thing in 3rd.

Now, considering the discussions between Richard and Colin over on the
Samba I had started thinking this was the proof... But it didn't make
a lot of sense to me.

So today I checked the dwell on my Pertronix. 65. I dropped it to 55.
Hit the same hill, same ambient temps (high 70's) similar load, etc.

No power loss!

Crap. Something so simple... My coil wasn't given enough time to build
the electrical field between firings is my guess.

Thoughts?
