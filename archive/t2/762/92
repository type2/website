Subject: 1968-1970 Bell housing interchange

Hi Volks,

An off-list friend of mine (Adam Narraway) has an early 68 westy  
whose transmission recently started making more noise than the  
engine. As far as we know this is the bus's original transmission. It  
had been a bit noisy before but since EveryBus it's been getting way  
too loud. So he decided to seek a replacement.

Since I had a spare 3-rib transmission laying around that I pulled  
from a wrecking-yard-bound 1970 panel bus, I offered it up to help  
get Adam back on the road. The PO let me have it cheap as he had  
already removed the bell housing, and I got the axles and CV's with  
it. I have no idea if this tranny was original to the 1970 or not,  
but I was told that it worked when I got it and figured it was worth  
a try.

This past weekend Adam swapped the bell housing from the 68 tranny  
onto the "new" transmission and discovered that although the bolt  
pattern is identical, the mating faces almost don't. Which is to say  
that they do line up, but only just. The Bell housing has a groove in  
the centreline and the tranny sits well inside this. (Or vice- 
versa....I haven't seen this in person and might be describing it  
incorrectly.)

Adam filled the tranny with GL-4 and it doesn't leak while sitting in  
the driveway. Once he gets the CV's bolted in he plans to road-test  
it; possibly as soon as a day or three. If anyone has info about the  
pro's/con's and/or risks/benefits of the above combo it would be  
greatly appreciated.

If we need more info (ie, part numbers) I may be able to get them  
tomorrow night.

Happy trails,
