The sodium exhaust valves came on the 1800cc engines. They were 34mm instead of the usual 33mm so it's unlikely that during the rebuild they upgraded the head.

I think 0.006" is right. I would watch #4 carefully (check the valves in 500 miles or less).

If they don't leak or don't stick I'd wait to replace them. If you have to repalce the brake lines anyway, I'd replace them with new ones (not expensive).
