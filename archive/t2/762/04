Be prepared to carry some huge batteries.  The little unit draws 300W,
which translates to 25 amps continuously.  A good alternator might be able
to keep up with this, but you'd be pushing it with the stock system.

The site says that the unit can "run all night on 2x200ah batteries", but
those are some hefty units.  A 12V 200Ah battery weighs about 130 pounds
and is 20 inches long.
