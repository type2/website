see http://busandmotorhome.com/feature1.htm
it's 39 Amps for the 430 watt model, 300/12 or 25 amps for the other 
one-The wattage (power used) should be the same for 24 volts; you just 
halve the AMPS for the latter.
and they claim you can run it all night on 2 200AMP batts and still
start the bus?

   That looks "cool", but I'm confused. How do you get 1250w of cooling
  with a 300w draw? And how can it draw 300w at both 12v and 24v?
