Subject: Replacing Steering Gear Box

I'm replacing a well worn steering gear box on my 79 Westy.

Bentley sez to remove the drag link. Is there any reason why I have to
remove the whole thing and not just the end near the gear box?

The rest seems straightforward.To paraphrase Junior Johnson, "We done
some unhookin' and some hookin' back up".
