Subject: Brake fluid reservoir cleaning

Hi,   I'm replacing my master cylinder on my '72 bus and it has the twin 
chamber brake fluid reservoir.  I've pulled it off the old master cylinder 
and would like your opinion on whether I ought to clean it before putting 
back on the new cylinder.  It has a black coating on the bottom.  Can't tell 
whether it's just a stain, or actually gunk.  Question is:  should I clean 
it out or leave it as is.  I'm also wondering what to clean it with, and 
whether a few drops of something in there will taint the fluid when I add it 
fresh?  I suppose I'll blow it with compressed air if I clean it.  Please 
advise if this isn't a good idea to proceed with.               Thanks, 
Kevin  Snow
