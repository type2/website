Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats in a 77?

Hi Gary,

The only "Why not" would be if you're really tall. Since the Vanagon  
has a lower fender well where the seat is mounted, the seat itself is  
about an inch taller. Not a big deal for most people, but  it could  
be an issue for those who are really tall or like wearing fancy  
hats. ;-)


Happy trails,
