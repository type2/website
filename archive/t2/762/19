Subject: expansion tank question

Hello all - 
 
My 81 Vanagon is coming along nicely.  However, I've inspected the hoses that go from the fuel tank to the two expansion tanks, and they are in bad shape.  I would like to replace them.  
 
Can I do it without dropping the gas tank?  Is dropping the gas tank as scary as I think it is, if I have to drop it?
 
Thanks as always for any help you can provide.
 
Marc
