Hey,

Our transmissions are rebuilt by a gentleman here in Colorado.

He is very, very good at rebuilding them. Did I say very enough. He gets 
about 25 cores a year from us and turns them into gold. He's an alchemist, 
seriously.  :-)

One of the most important things, and there are many, that he has told me is 
that '68 transmission are not worth the caked on 37 year old grease stuck to 
the ribs. There are some big differences one that comes to mind, I think, is 
the throw out fork. Anyway. Can you put that bell housing on the later 
style??? I am not sure. I would try to get a '69-'70 first, if not and a 
better option is a '71 and change out the clutch kit.

Do you have a '68 only trans? I think you look for bolts and nuts around the 
drive flanges. If you see these then you have the hunk of metal, FKA a 
transmission.

I have a '68-'70/'71 rebuilt that I might make a list discount on. These are 
normally $550 plus shipping and come with a warranty. Call me if you have 
any other questions or if you have any specific questions that you need 
clarified. I can put you in touch with "THE MAN".
