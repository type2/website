Subject: wireing a trailer to the bus!!!!??

ok dumb question maybe for some but for me well i just am not sure is all...?
 
ok i have one question that might turn onto more of a question or questions? hope not but here goes... 

i bought some new tail lights for our new trailer,.... 
ok these lights are turn,brake and running lights all in one and with one bulb to do it all? 
i reran all new wire for them also....

i have two wires coming out the back of the lights.... 

red and black... 

of course black is ground? ?? correct?? not always but maybe >? in this situation?

red is power?  hope so..?

ok i can hook the red to the turn signal and it will blink... 
ok i can hook the red to the brake light and it will brake... 
ok i can hook the red to the running light and it will glow red.... 

but i cant get all three at once....? 

that is the question....???
