Subject: Phoenix Engine Rebuilder

I need to replace my '71 stock engine. It's just getting too weak and it's
currently out of the bus so there is no better time then now. I'm in the
Phoenix area and looking for a recommendation. I'm a little unhappy with BAP
as the last set of heads didn't fair so well so I'm not sure I want to try
them for a rebuilt engine. I have searched the archives and didn't find
anything.

Thanks,
Ray Haynes
'71 Westy (non-poptop)
