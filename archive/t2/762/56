Subject: very high idle problem

After taking my bus on a short trip over some steep mountains. I noticed the 
next day that my idle is very high. If I try to push on the accelerator a 
little more than a pinch it makes a wierd sound.(rubber hamer hitting concrete) I 
think it is just to much gas going into the engine but i might be wrong. I 
know if i just let the start from 0 mph it will work its way up to 20 mph on a 
flat street.(without pushing the accelerator pedal at all) I just had it tuned 
up a week ago which cost a very pretty penny. Im thinking that me going up the 
steep hills for a while had something to do with it. but im not sure. Im 
thining of taking the car back in and telling them what happend. but i do not want 
to pay them to just fix a little nob i can do myself. If anyone has any 
suggestion or advice. Im all ears.
                                                                              
  As always thanks in advance,
