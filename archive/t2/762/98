Subject: Speedometer Read Error

I have a 70 DC with a 68 front beam (I know, sounds weird but so was the PO
who swapped it in).

The speedometer reads 10mph too fast at pretty much any speed but reads 0 at
rest. 

I have checked everything and it looks fine. My tire size is 185 75 R14
standard size.

Any insights?

At least my bus feels faster...

I just want to know how good of mileage I am getting (or poor for that
matter)
