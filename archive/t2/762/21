Changing dwell changes timing. Don't remember if you advanced it or
retarded it, but if it is running better, you most likely advanced it.
You might want to recheck it and make sure your 3500 RPM is not over
32 BTDC (with vacuum disconnected).

 So today I checked the dwell on my Pertronix. 65. I dropped it to 55.
 Hit the same hill, same ambient temps (high 70's) similar load, etc.

 No power loss!

 Crap. Something so simple... My coil wasn't given enough time to build
 the electrical field between firings is my guess.
