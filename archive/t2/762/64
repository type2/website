Subject: AIRS help - Laster stranded in OK

All is O.K. in OK

I just heard from Jason.  He is on his way home with his trailer in tow 
- with a new tire and all that.

I did not get all the details in regards to how he managed, but he did 
say that he was out of money.

Thanks to anyone that may have helped.
