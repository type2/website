Subject: carb adapter

so i am toying with my 'kafer' 34pict-3, and finally found my adapter 
plate to fit it to a  smaller 30pict-1 manifold.

but.

really, these adapters are to fit 30pict1s to a BIGGER manifold - 
therefore, the holes are all the wrong way round.  the 30p1 gets 
attached to the plate using allen-head bolts in place of the carb 
studs, and then the plate goes on to the manifold with regular studs 
and bolts... my best guess so far on a plan is to find some  studs 
that have an allen socket in the end... someone please tell me these 
exist  :)

other than that, i am open to suggestions. local bug shop said they 
can be drilled out and made to fit, but that sounds like too much 
hassle.  'specially since he said putting a 34p3 on a small manifold 
was stoopit, anyhow.
