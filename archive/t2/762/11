Subject: pulling fan to change oil seal engine front.

Hi,

The oil seal behind my fan is leaking.

I have pulled the fan but cannot get it out of the housing.

I have tried to pull the lower tin, but have found that I need to remove 
the muffler to get at one screw closest to the bumper.

Tell me, is there an easier way?

I have to put it back together and just run it the way it is and replace 
the foam around the engine cavity, hoooo well, it will see oil on it.
