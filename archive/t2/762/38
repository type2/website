Subject: cd player - don't be negatif !! ;-)

Hi Volks ,
Here is my little big problem.
In my back speakers , I have 3 wires , I assumed that the one which is 
common to the two speakers (in gray color) is the neg wire  and 
correspond to the  small connector
am I right ?  how do  you connect it to the cd player which got 2 neg 
wire ? if I connect the gray color wire to both neg wire (left and 
right) of the cd player, the  sound is very bad.
if I connect the gray wire to one of the neg wire of the cd player , one 
speaker is more loud than the other.

My second problem is the following , I assumed (according to the back 
speakers that the neg is the small speaker connector ). When it comes to 
test the sound on each speaker , I have a better quality of sound if I 
my (assumed) neg wire is connected to the positive wire of the  cd player.

Those speaker are  Blackpunt  and probably are the originals , so my 
last question is , which connector is positif or negatif on those speaker
