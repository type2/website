Subject: lead Paint?

I am working on restoring a 1971 Bus and need to know if there was lead in the paint.  I searched the archive but found only this: http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/072663.html
And no replies.  I know I can go get a test kit but I would much rather spend the money on parts :-).

Thanks for any help/info you may have.

Sean
