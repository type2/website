Subject: AIRS assistance

I got an AIRS call yesterday afternoon from Josh Thorp, also on the AIRS list, 
who's traveling, with his almost three year old daughter, from El Paso to 
Raleigh for a new job. When he got to my little town along 40 his '70 dropped a valve seat on number three.

He correctly diagnosed his ailment and called me from a rest area. I was able 
to find him a used head and he spent last night and today R/R the head in my 
driveway. He'll be leaving Dickson, 40 miles west of BNA, in a couple of hours 
he hopes. Please watch/listen for him. Great young man, devoted father and an aircooled afficianado since his early teens. Many thanks.
