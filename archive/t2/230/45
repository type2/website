Hal,

Muir was writing in the time of fixing splits that have the tranny bolted in
like in a bug.  For a '70 bus, a plastic milk crate is almost the perfect
height to support the tranny, sometimes with a short piece of 2x4.

I leave them on. If you maneuver it right, the bar is not in the way.

Yes.
