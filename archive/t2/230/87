Subject: idling problem

I replaced the heads on my 1600 in my '71 and installed the engine.  Vroom 
it started right up after a little coaxing, but it won't idle.  It just 
cuts off, I can keep the bus running by giving it gas .  What do I need to 
do.  I've been working like mad to get this ready for our trip to Canada 
and I'm just fried. Advice needed!
