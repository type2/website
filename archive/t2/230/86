Hey all...
I'm in the New York area...most of the mail I read seems to be people from 
out west or down south...bummer!!! ...this doesn't seem to be much of VW 
country out my way...or is it??? ...I'm about 45 minutes west of Albany,NY 
...anyone know of gathering's for VW people or junkyards where I can go and 
browse??? ...I'm driving part time an 80 vanagon ...and restoring a 78 
transporter...and in my spare time [HA HA !!!] ... I enjoy driving my 72 VW 
trike...
Thanks ! 
JIM~
