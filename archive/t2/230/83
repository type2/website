Subject: For Atlanta people

Hi.

There is a 79 Bus in the pull apart on the south side of Atlanta.  Body
pretty good, interior was a camper conversion(it is a standard Bus) that is
trashed, most of the engine parts are there.  It's a stick shift.

I pulled the three good hubcaps off, because as you may remember, I have a
thing for genuine VW hubcaps.  Usually they are 1.50 today they were 4.00!
I decided that was a little too dear.  The fat little guy with the mustache
tried screwing me last week as well, on some factory headlights.  I doubt I
go back there now.

This Bus has the ever-popular sliding windows.  I wanted the solid windows
that go in the very back, but side glass is not listed on their sheets and
who knows what the fat guy would try to soak me for.

So people in the ATL area without predjudices such as mine, go get many
parts from this Bus.  It should be there at least a couple more weeks.
