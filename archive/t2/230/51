Subject: RE: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

Sorry, I know the request is to kill this thread, but I do have something VW
related to say.

With all the talk of trying to save our buses, how hard would it be for
local clubs to organize Co-op type salvage yards. How much red tape would be
involved with such an operation? Does anything like this exist? Has anyone
tried this. No offense meant to many of our list members who operate salvage
businesses. Its just that not everyone has a specialty salvage yard located
near them.
