Yep.. Been there, done that. I've lived in two houses in the last 20 years,
and let me tell you something. The mixed race neighborhood is the way to go.
The all-white or predominantly white neighborhoods in LA County are FULL of
people who will smile and wave "good morning", then call the police to
complain that you are washing your car on your lawn and peek out the
curtains waiting for the action to begin. The ones that you can get along
with are the minority people in the "bad" neighborhoods. If you transgress
them, you apologize and they will forgive and bless you, then invite you to
come over for some barbeque next Saturday...But they are not even so easily
offended as upper-middle-class white people. I've said this before
(elsewhere) but I (a white girl) would rather live in black/latino
neighborhoods any day, than amoung the upper-crusty, holier-than-thou,
self-righteous, PITA, NIMBY ("your hurting my property value"), Martha
Stewart, white people. Y'know what I mean?
Yes, I lost my Buick Wildcat this way, also my husband lost a '57 Chevy and
a '55 Mercury Monterey, years ago, because some fireman in the city
collected and sold vintage cars and had his eye on those two. They ticketed
and striped the tires continually, and we had to bail them out of the
impound a few times before we finally give up and let them have them. Don't
even worry about a black man stealing your car.. Some white men are the real
pro's. And when it happens, don't bother to go to court or file a report.
You might as well take a whiz  facing into a stiff wind.
Sorry if I offended anyone, but that's the way I see it.
