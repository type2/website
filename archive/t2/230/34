Subject: FW: [T2] re-upholster seats

These kits are cut and sewn just like the factory seats. The '79 seats are
really not that bad. The bottom cover just slides into grooves and the back
slips over and onto the spikes on the back. The biggest hurdle is prepping
the old seat cores. i.e. replacing broken springs and cleaning them up in
general. Be careful when pulling these apart. Take time to note how the new
ones will go together. There is a metal rod in the old back rest lower
tubing to support the lower part that attaches to the spikes. Use these in
the unsown loop on the new ones as well. Give me a call if I have confused
you. Anyway it is the best thing you can do for you and your bus. We
recondition all year seats if anyone is interested give us a call. We send
you a set and you send us a core so you never skip a beat.
