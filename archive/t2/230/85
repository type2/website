Hiya Warren,

It won't fit.  

At least, it won't fit without some work on your part.  You'll have to rig 
some sort of rear support for your Type4 engine because the tranny supports 
in that 70 or 71 just aren't up to the job.  Actually they might (if they are 
in good condition) be able to support the tranny and engine, but the 
rotational torque of your 1700 would be a killer.  You won't be able to use 
the so-called moustache bar already in the 70-71 as a rear support.  There's 
not enough clearance there for your bigger block.

Your exhaust will have to be customized in order to accomodate the new rear 
support for the engine.

You'll need new tin to seal the engine in to the engine compartment.

Finally you'll be mating up a tranny (the 091) which was designed to run with 
the lower powered 1600 engines.  Not really an optimum match for the 1700.

However Warren,  If you throw enough time and money at it anything is 
possible.
