Subject: I'm sorry

Group,  I think I inadvertantly started that scapped Bus thread, by
mentioning that I would do something drastic with my Busses if they didn't
sell.

"Drastic" to me is the evil ebarf.  Or maybe advertising openly and risking
selling to someone not worthy of my machinery.  It does not mean giving them
to someone in Canada because they feel too unfortunate to go find a Bus for
themselves.

Drastic may be to completely strip the 79 and make a drag Bus out of it.
I've always wanted to tow an Airstream with a Bus.  I think that would look
cool.  And be able to do wheelies.  Drastic may be to remove the factory air
from the 76, or do some wild and kinky interior treatment.  I doubt very
seriously these two Busses get cut up while in my midst.

It does seem strange to me, that with the volume of people on this list,
that no one is seriously interested in a couple pretty cheep Busses.  I'm
not whining.  But those that do whine about "oh no we are losing another
Bus" get out your checkbook.  Whining and not doing anything about it is
pathetic.  If you really can't do anything about it, but have no other
positive offerings, shut the h* up.

I will not ever mention selling my Busses here again.  Answering ridiculous
emails is almost as bad as fielding ridiculous phone calls.  In the future,
anyone seriously interested can get ahold of me privately, and if I still
have them, we'll talk.  I will still seek the occasional advice, and try to
help where I can.

That's it I'm done for the night.  Thanks for putting up with me.
