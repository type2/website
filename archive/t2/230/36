I just joined this list, "Hi", and am starting to look for a camper.
They seem to be pretty scarce in western NY.  Now y'all are 
worrying me.  My dreams of finding a rust free, great running, 
fully accessorized westy for under a grand seem impossible now. :-)
I previously owned a '69 which was converted by PO as a shag pallace.
(that's the carpet not the activity, ok so it was both) But I've 
never had a pop up camper and want to start enjoying some family
trips.
I'll keep lurking and checking the type2.com want-ads.
