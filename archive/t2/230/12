Subject: parts up for grabs


Hey all!
Been a while, but I finally am almost done with my 69 westfakia.  Have some 
leftover parts which I do not need.  I have a good 1970 bus tranny with cvs, 
and axles.  Have the shelf over bed for a westie.  One solex 34 that needs 
rebuild, a few curtain rods, including the big one, rear bench seat with 
small tear, a brand new pressure plate for a pre 71, and a very good front 
grille.  All parts will fit early bays.  I am in southern Vermont, minutes 
from the Massachussetts, and New Hampshire border. Can ship the small stuff, 
but you must pick up tranny, or shelf.  No reasonable offers refused.  Need 
extra money to finish my electricals.  Thought I would bring this to the 
list before it goes on !(-at-)#$#(-at-) bay.             Happy bussin!
