OK, folks
If I thought a simple suggestion for a cheap place to find good information
on maintaining our beloved busses would sprout such a spirited debate, I
wouldn't have said it.
Let's just leave it at this:
Published books such as the Muir book, Bentley's and other VW tech manuals
are VERY useful and belong in the library of ANYONE who is serious about
maintaining their vehicle. But let's face it- people come from different
walks of life, and if someone is too broke to buy the manual, then at least
it's putting forth the effort to go to the library and get a Xerox'ed wiring
diagram, isn't it?

If I was faced with the choice of going without ANY information while fixing
wiring complications, and using a photocopied schematic from just as
reliable a source as a Bentley, I'd choose the latter......as a matter of
fact, I DID choose the latter, and you didn't hear me complain about it when
I got it fixed either.
