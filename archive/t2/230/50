Hi George et al,

Yes you are right I messed my solving of the quadratic (then messed it up
again when I checked it)

Good luck

I think that you need to check your solution.  I get

t=4.17s or t=3.48s

Which is the answer we want?  I'm not so sure!  They fall on opposite
sides of the number arrived at earlier.  I really think that we are simply
going in circles around the data!  :)
