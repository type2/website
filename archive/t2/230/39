Subject: upgrading altenator

Has anyone put a larger altenator in a 2.0l bus. A guy at a car show had an 
early porsche with a 2.0l in it and said the altenator was GM ac delco but 
didnt have time to tell me what he did to install it. If any one knows about 
the wiring and what each one does could they help, thanks. Dylan
