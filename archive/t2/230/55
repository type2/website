Which engine/alt combo do you have?
If it is the full CV engine from the 80 to 83 aircooled westy then you 
are in the situation that there is no other alternator that is going to 
be useable without major surgery.  Dug into that area thoroughly when i 
first got my 82.

If you have an engine with the alternator exposed and not part of the 
cooling system, then there are lots of options.  Basically if the 
alternator will fit you can design a bracket.  The critical part is 
aligning the belt properly.  I have done several assists to put the 
bigger alternators in cars that have had tunes that exceeded the 
capability of their stock alternator.
