Have you pulled out the idle jets??? That is exactly the habit my '73 Super 
Beetle 40 HP carb had when i was living in Italy.

They added dye to the fuel so that there was a tint to the color of the 
fuel and it could be identified by the guys at the stations.

Some of the dye was ground up fine enough and would create a sediment that 
would get stuck in my idle jets.

I would simply pull them (outside of the carb so it was easy) and spray 
them with a bit of carb cleaner.

Then I would suck on them to see if they flowed correctly.

After that came three tanks fuel of gas and STP ala Muir.

Worked every time and all was well.

Cost? $3.

The other problem that i had occasionally was that the timing would be off.
