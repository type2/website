Subject: Bus sighting near San Fr.-A Bay helping a Ford van?

My SO and daughter are currently near San Francisco on a combined
business/pleasure trip.  While driving the rental out of SF on way to
Yosemite, they saw a Bay Window bus (funky yellow, daughter said), and it
was stopped to help a Ford Van in trouble- she said one guy had long hair-
wonder which one drove the bus and was it a listee??  The humor here is that
the Ford van needed the help (-8
