This is good advice, and just what Mike should do.  Instead of guessing at 
the fuse size, measure the current that the fans draw and pick 
appropriately sized wire and fuse(s).  I have a large fan in my "other" car 
too, and it really does draw 80 amps at startup!  I measured it.  And 21 
amps continuously.  Blows those little black Bosch relays (rated 40 amp) in 
short order.

Sounds like you have them wired in parallel which means each fan only has 
to draw 4 amps to blow the fuse.  From the looks of those fans I'd say they 
could easily draw 4 or more amps so that is likely your problem.

This could easily be caused by the extra volt or so that your electrical 
system sees when the generator/alternator is revved up.  That means extra 
power (V*A) through the fuse and a greater likelyhood that it will blow if 
it is marginally rated.
