Subject: The blues continues! ARGH!

Alright everyone - Please, I am on my hands and knees-

	I emailed the list awhile back with an problem I was having with my new
mexican motor ("Got the 'cant get the new engine to work right' Blues"
thread)

	I followed the advice of the listees to narrow down and hopefully eliminate
any variables in the equation but to no avail.  Heren is where I am at:

	New points, wires, condenser, rotor, cap, mexican engine, fuel pump,
filter, oil, and 34 pict 3 carb.  Freshly adjusted valves and points, rotor
pointing at the right place where cylinder 1 is at TDC, and lined up with my
clean and smooth 205P vacumn advance dizzy.  Timing set to 7.5 BTDC as per
the dizzy specs.

	Engine starts and runs -once the chooke cuts out, idles low but steady.
Tach/Dwell says is idling at 550.  Carb adjustments are per library
instructions- 1 turn out for the big one, 2.5 turns out for small one. Main
throttle cam has that 1/4 turn from touching lobe.

	Turning the carb adjustments past this has no effect, except in the extreme
cases(all the way in) the engine starts to stall.  I've sprayed half a can
of ether around all connections hoping to find a leak, and nothing.  Driving
is okay but it has no power - maxes out at 30-35 MPH and isnt very quick
about getting there.  Seems to be a bit hot, but its been 3 years since my
last aircooled so I can't really be to sure of myself.

	Wits end.  Absolute wits end.  Is it mechanic time ?  Have I exhausted my
options? :(

Hopefully-
-rj
