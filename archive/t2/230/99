Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

[...]

Is there a part number on the fuse box?
The 72 box should be 411 937 505C. [70 was A and 71 was B]
I am wondering how someone can fit a 73 box up above the headlight?
VW made the boxes bigger in 73 when they moved it down to the middle under the
dash. This coincided with the turnsignals moving up above the headlights.
I don't remember seeing any markings on the back of the boxes.
