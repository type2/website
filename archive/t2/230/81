Check your local community laws first...Find out just how many vehicles
constitute a "salvage yard" and what are the requirements? A junkyard
(there, I've said it) near my buddy in a formerly very rural area was 
forced to spend thousands just to put up a 10 or 12 foot wooden fence
next to the original chain link fence because the area was being developed
and the new homeowners objected to the visibility of the yard from the
roads. 
Another consideration is the EPA and such...
Don't take this as a negative vote, BTW, it's just that times change and
some of the same rules and regs that contributed to the demise of the
air-cooled VW are probably gonna be at work here too...;-(
