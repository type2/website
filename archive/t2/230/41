Those folks with nothing better to do are probably idiot Californians who
want to do the same thing to other places, and now that they have lost
California, they want to leave here and make the same mistakes elsewhere.
They are so stupid that they don't even realize what happened.
I will tell you short and sweet who benefits from those regulations.
Government (our only growth industry). It makes work for them, and a means
to pay for it. They will fine you and forfeit your property and to them it's
all revenue. They can't raise taxes anymore, so that's what they do. They
have all these programs and they work with the news media to get people all
worked up so that citizens will allow these laws to pass, then they use the
laws selectively and for their own benefit, as they like or see fit.
Remember the "war on drugs"? They wanted forfeiture laws enacted to fight
the "drug lords". Now that they have the laws they want and need, they take
working peoples' homes and property in the name of the law (trumped-up
criminal charges will do..plenty of laws to enforce where criminal charges
can be invoked), and the crooked danged politicians are taking big money
"campaign contributions" from drug interests to pardon their convicted
people.   Jan B
