One more thing for you...

It may just need an adjustment but I kind of figure that it has received no 
maintenance for about 30 years so it couldn't hurt a thing to get some new 
grease in there and do all of the adjustments.

When I have to futz around with one item on my bus that has never gotten 
any attention from me I just do the whole shebang...

Consequently most everything is in good shape in a reasonable amount of 
time and not waiting to fail so late dark rainy night on the highway... <grin!>
