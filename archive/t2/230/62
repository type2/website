Yes that's true and was part of my reason for the post.

One of the listers is having problems installing a VDO ammeter due to 
interaction with the generator/voltage regulator in his 69 bus. Someone 
suggested he install a voltmeter instead.


Another reason was the tight measurement distribution for the low to high 
priced meters.

The Chinese 3 1/2 LCD Cen Tech uses a 1977 vintage chip (7106) that is hard 
to beat. Its quite rugged. I have dropped it and banged it around with no 
detectable degradation. Just have to keep a fresh 9V battery installed.

What you might do is use a digital meter to verify when your battery is 
fully charged and make a paint dot on the meter glass. At least you would 
know if it is getting a full charge. Manny short trips in a generator 
equipped bus can result in the battery not being charged fully.  Should be 
no problem with your alternator equipped bus.
