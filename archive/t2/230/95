Subject: Re: [T2] idling problem



I would suggest you check the idle-cutoff solenoid for tightnes, and make 
sure the plug in the front of the carburaetor's body is still intact. I have 
had a few blown out via backfires, and been unaware of this fact because of 
my one-piece throttle-position sensor.
