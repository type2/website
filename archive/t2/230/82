But if this gathering is in Ohio, why is it called the DIXIE bus gathering?

Hey Doug,
You are not spoiling any fun!  The author of the song Dixie, was written by
a Yankee.  His name is Daniel Decatur Emmet and he is from Mt Vernon Ohio.
The city has had a large festival the last 15 years to celebrate, and it was
this past weekend.
Since I fly a rebel flag when camping, and since I picked the weekend to
coincide with the COVVC show and the Dixie Days Festival, I named it The
Dixie Bus Gathering.
Have Fun!!
