Subject: Re: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

i lost one of my beetles because the city threatened to tow it. i asked
someone i thought i could trust to tow it out to his shop for me (he also
has a storage lot and vw salvage yard). he did, didnt mention anything
about fees and so i waited til i got my settlement money to have HIM get
it running for me. well, i waited so long that he decided to sell it and
he didnt even tell me. i had to find out from someone else.

oh well, live and learn,
chris
