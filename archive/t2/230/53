Just recently bought a 72 van. Everything looks really old, like no =
parts have been replaced.
What I need help in is determining the cause of shifting problems.
At first I could reverse and shift quite easily.Now after about 3 weeks =
it is hard to shift down from 3rd to
2nd and 2nd to 1st. Going from 3rd to 4th no problem but reverse I cant =
find.
Is this the whole transmission or just the solenoid that needs =
replacing?
I also heard about those shifting couplers, can these cause this =
problem.
