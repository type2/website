You need to do the full maintenance schedule for your tranny and then 
reassess it.

Grease the shifter, replace the shifter bushings, replace the coupler, 
adjust the shifter, adjust the clutch, replace the tranny oil with GL-4 
spec oil ONLY (GL-5 will damage it).

Then see if things have improved. Should be able something you can do at 
home and thus not a high cost.
