One of the local charities here runs the same scheme...They accept almost
everything from houses to shoes and give a blank tax form in exchange. It's
up to the doner to fill out and submit it to the IRS. I've seen a couple three
dicey cars on their "lot"...Saabs, Volvos, etc. all "running" but with serious
problems. My guess is, if you're in the kinda tax bracket that buys these
things new, it's worth it to take the deduction rather than get a low-ball
price on a sale. A scrapyard takes the real clunkers, tho' but a corner
used car lot gets the "maybes"...
