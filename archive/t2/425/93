Subject: 69 DC project

Hi Listees!

    I am new to this list, have been evesdropping for a while....

    I have been eyeing a relatively straight 69 DC rotting in a field down
the street.  All the rot is underneath, in the frame and such, with the
upper body in fair condition. I had a discussion w/ the PO (not current
owner) and he happens to have all the lower body metal and doglegs and such
for whoever buys it from the current owner. I thought I hit the jackpot,
until he said the whole frame will need to be restored.

    My question(s) for y'all is this:  Do any parts stores (Bus Boys, Bus
Depot etc.) sell a complete frame (in one piece), or is my only route to buy
all the pieces? I have only seen individual pieces on on-line catalogues. I
do not wish to gut a donor bus for a frame. OR, is it better for my own
sanity to say good-bye to the happless 69, walk away and look elsewhere for
a project?

    Ben
