Yes, telescoping magnet.

You can orient them with the oiling hole facing up. I can't remember where I
heard that.

Just be sure to keep track of the lifters and put them back into the same
bores they came from.

The lifter has a cup in the center where the push rod makes contact. No
rotating is required you just need to make sure it's seated properly before
you do your valve adjustment. If you haven't done it right, as you rotate
the engine to being another cylinder to TDC you'll hear a loud click and the
adjusting screw you previously tightened will loosen up.
