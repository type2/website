Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Tank Plugged

OK, I finally got the little (-at-)$%#$%#.  I couldn't see it in the tank even w/
mag light & mirror, so I conducted a daily 2 hour fishing expedition with
the grabber tool...for five days. Tried rocking the bus to slosh things
around, but no avail. Finally decided to drain the tank and use a garden
hose sprayer to try to move the thing to where I could see it (understanding
that I'd have to dry the resdidual water out of the tank).  As the last of
the gas trickled out, I shined my light into the sender hole and there the
it was, sitting dead-center in my sights.

It might have been quicker to have dropped the engine, pulled the tank, and
dumped it out...

BTW, I had to buy a plastic jerry can for the gas...it turns out that the
Air Resources folks here in CA have finally acted against the legions of
stranded motorists who constantly ruin our air by transferring minute
quantities of gas to and from jerry cans:  The cans available here now come
with an spring-loaded "airtight" filler nozzle contraption which doesn't
work with any of my cars (new or old), sprays gas everywhere, and has a flow
rate slightly lower than that of an amoeba urinating. If you might ever need
a gas can in our great state, be sure and import one from somewhere else.

As usual, thanks for the info.

Hi Rick
I went through something very similar recently. A piece of the CA
filler neck known as the "bird's beak" fell off some time and fell
down inside the filler neck thus into the tank. It eventually made its
way into the fuel bowl, and clogged the outlet. The PO converted to
carbs on my '77 bus so it didn't pose a problem until i switch back to
Fuel injection. Took me a LONG time to figure out what was making my
fuel pump buzz, and why my fuel pressure was jumping all around. My
filter wasn't clogged and I knew the tank wasn't rusty. So i took my
tank out to check it out thoroughly. In your case i could see you using
a spring loaded claw pickup tool like i used. It has a handle on one
end and on the other it has 3 little claws. Great for maneuvering into
tight places and very flexible. In the third photo i'm sending you,
the tool is pictured. Also get yourself a mechanics mirror, looks like
a doctors tool. Its got a small one inch mirror on the end of a
telescoping pole. Both of these i bought at Auto zone, they aren't hard
to find. As to your question what is the metal bowl? I believe its
supposed to concentrate fuel around outlet and return lines. I don't
see how you could damage anything in there when trying to retrieve the
debris, but be gentle when fishing.

By the way those two tools are great for all sorts of thinks besides
fishing junk out of your gas tank.
