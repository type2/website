Hi Sean,

With a late-Bay (72-79, "narrow-5" rim) you don't have to remove the 
axle nut to get the brake drums off.  There are two 12mm (??) nuts on 
the face of the drum and that's it.

I usually find the drum a lot easier to pull if you slacken off the 
brake adjuster wheels beforehand, as there may be a lip inside the drum 
that will resist removal. Repeated impacts from a large rubber mallet 
usually help, and may relieve frustration at the same time.

Happy trails,
