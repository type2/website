Ruth,
	Like everyone else suggested I would look for an exhaust leak
first. Here is the procedure I use to find an exhaust leak. Get a
shop vac. Shove the end into the exhaust pipe. Make sure the vac is
set to blow. Then turn it on. The longer of a hose you can have the
better as it gets that really loud vac away from what you are working
on. Anyway, I have always found where my leaks are by just feeling
around w/ my bare hands to see if I can feel any air escaping. I
haven't tried this (since I just thought of it) but I suspect if you
took some soapy water in a spray bottle & sprayed on a suspect joint
it should bubble if there is a leak as well. After you determine if
you have a leak or not then access what you need to do to fix it.

Oh BTW did you use new gaskets all around when replacing the exhaust?
