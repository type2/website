Subject: A Vote for Bus Depot

Ordered some parts on Monday via the website.

Received a courtesy call later that day to inform me that a tail pipe for a
muffler would require a slight modification (bend some metal), which was
fine.

Parts arrived (complete, no damage) on Tuesday.

Installed last night, fit fine.

Can't ask for any better service (and the price is good, too...8^)

Casting my vote for Bus Depot.
