Subject: RE: [T2] 78 Westy Interior

Were there different interior scenarios available?  I am looking at a 78
Westy, it has an icebox, not an electric fridge, it doesn't have a stove...I
thought by the late 70, these items were standard.

On the (USA) 76-79 buses, the interior layout was the same. There were 3 models
available a P21 (standard hardtop, no popup), a P22 (standard) and a P27
(deluxe). The deluxe has the stove, fridge and camping stool. The others do
not.

I've got some of that info on my plaid page here:

This came up on my webpage forum the other day, and I went over the differnet
westy models (including colors) in some detail here:

Hope this helps,
