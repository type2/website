No, you didn't.  The type2 list is incapable of spreading viruses because it strips attachments.  If it appears that you got a virus from the type2 list, it is because the headers have been forged to make it appear that way when the message really originated somewhere else.

Please take any further virus-related discussions to another forum.

Thanks,
