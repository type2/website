i got a locking latch from a wrecker here in ontario. it uses the R key, but
it was of course a different key than my bus. i removed the cylinder and
re-tumbled it to my ignition key. it was fairly simple with a small file and
moving the wafers around to make it work. the cylinder in the engine latch
is physically pretty much the same as the ones in the door handles.

i believe from the factory, if they had the locking engine hatch, it was on
a different key than the ignition. i bought a '76 westy parts bus last year
which had a locking engine hatch and this bus was really original and
untouched (aside from the engine fire it had suffered...) the engine hatch
key was different than the ignition, both were original dealer keys with the
numbers on them.
