The problem was that the 959 had no oxygen sensor and the Motronic EFI
couldn't be modified to add one in order to legalize it. With some recent
changes to the law allowing limited edition collectors vehicles on the road
and some extensive modifications, they'll finally be available (for a
price).

I believe it's Bruce Canepa over the hill in Santa Cruz if anyone is curious
and wants to go see one driving around. <http://www.canepa.com/>
