Subject: California Smog Law (Senate Bill 708) appears to be o.k. for

My State Senator (Byron Sher) to whom I wrote,  regarding the proposed 
change in the smog law that would have extended the smog test to continue 
for 45 years post-manufacture, has responded in a manner that suggests that 
the odious provision has been dropped. The only change remaining in the 
draft is to raise the potential fine for non-compliance by $35. So I am 
looking forward to 2004, when my '75 which would have been smogged if they 
extended the period at risk as proposed, will now be free of that burden.(A 
'75 is considered to have been manufactured in '74, 30 years ago and 'off 
the hook'). And what with the dynamometer testing going into effect here in 
the Bay Area the cost of such a test is no longer non-trivial. So let us 
"grandfathers" rejoice!

(Isobel Marie 6/1/03), and can't wait to take her and her older brother 
camping in the Westy).
