Yes, years ago before oils were so heavily formulated.

These days, the
specifications are so tight that it makes little different where the feed
stock comes from.

It also makes little difference what brand is on the
bottle, as long as they can be trusted to make sure that the contents
conform to the API specification

I usually run Mobil or Texaco, whichever is cheaper when I buy the case.
I personally see no point in paying 50% more for "Pennzoil" or "Castrol"
on the bottle.  I run 10W40 in a relatively new Mexican engine and it
seems to work fine.  Oil changes every 2000 miles, doesn't seem to burn
any oil between changes and is usually not quite opaque when I drain it.

Only place I ever used Castrol "R" bean oil was in my 2-stroke dirt bike,
circa 1970.  I can still remember the aroma.  Phew!
