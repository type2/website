Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering

I have just learned a valuable lesson.  It was my plans to take the month of
July off, and spend the weekends doing family activities.  Not that bussing is
not a family orientated sport, it's just that MY family really only enjoys
going to the ice cream shop in the bus.
Anywhoooo, the wife had her mind set on a Yogi Bear park in Ohio, thinking
that was her idea of camping.  Being the man I am, my only goal in life is to
please her.  So we think we should make a reservation.  Call them and
WOW!!!!!!
Are they proud of that campground.  First they charge by the adult and add for
kids.  Next, no side tent.  3rd, and a hummm dinger, $48 per night!!!!!
Well now, I had issues with paying Rustic Knolls per bus, and not being able
to negotiate.
I no longer feel bad.
Let Dixie Bus roll!!!!!!
Were going to have a good time, I AM in the process of putting an inexpensive
shirt together to help sponsor the event.  We are going to enjoy the swimming
lake.  We are going to enjoy our pets, our families and each other.  And who
knows, there may even be fire.
Why???????????
Because we ARE the Ohio Valley Tribe!!!!!

BEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!
