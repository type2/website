Subject: Need VW Bus mechanic contact

I am in the greater Seattle area and I am looking for a good &
affordable VW Bus mechanic.  I have an oil leak that I am just about
ready to turn over to someone who knows what they are doing.  Does
anyone know a good one in my area? Preferably around the eastside...but
not necessary.

Thanks,
-RR
