Do not bother trying to import a vehicle under 25 years unless it's from
Canada and comes with a letter from VW stating compliance (equivalence to US
model for that year with potential minor safety modifications required).

The confusing part of the process is that if your vehicle is older than 21
years but less than 25 and doesn't conform to US emissions you won't be able
to important without going through a RI. I don't know why but I haven't
tried to fight it either.

Only a registered importer (RI) recognized by the govt. can make safety and
emissions modifications to non-Canadian vehicles less than 25 years old. If
the vehicle is Canadian then the RI still has to make the emissions
modifications if the letter states non-compliance. Those businesses largely
exist to bring expensive Ferrari, BMW and other euro only models over to the
states. In other words the cost will be prohibitive. I know someone with a
94 Jetta who was quoted $3000 by the RI to bring it into compliance
requiring on a minor modification. Not worth it.

If its 25 years old or more I think you can bring vehicles in from any
country you choose. As mentioned previously, the biggest difficulties are at
the local level and vary. Some issues include:

- all stickers and VINs appear untampered to police/dmv
- odometer verification (and if there is a minimum mileage can you prove a
5-digit odo rolled over)
- smog equipment in place and functional (for that US model year)
