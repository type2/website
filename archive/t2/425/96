But waaaay before the two strokes from the land of the rising sun
invaded our shores George--the Brit bikes were running that bean
oil---in their oil tanks as well as in the gas to keep the valve stems
from eating up the phosphorous bronze guides --
The Castrol R was a real buzz---
I remember well the high leaving a mile or a half mile.
I still use the stuff in my BMW and my 2 Triumph's gas ---

This is where the Marvel Mystery Oil upper end lubrication factor in my
air cooled Bus and my Vanagons originated---( actually I've done ths in
all my vehicles on a hard, long, road trip )
A little petrolis maximus in the upper end is a good thing---especially
in the hot summer months--
It just doesn't smell quite as sweet as the Castrol-R

I think for grins, I'll drop a pint in the tanks of my VW's to confuse
anyone behind me--:>)  
 

< And originally Castrol was of the castor bean---not good for air
cooled long term duration in maintaining viscosity--- 
Only place I ever used Castrol "R" bean oil was in my 2-stroke dirt
bike, circa 1970. I can still remember the aroma. Phew!
