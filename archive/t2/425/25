Mine did this when we first got G.  Turned out that the nut holding the
wiper arm to the shaft had loosened and allowed the arm to back off of the
shaft a bit, just enough to allow the arm move almost freely on the shaft.

Tightening the nut back up (and adjusting the wiper arm to correct the
positioning) fixed it.
