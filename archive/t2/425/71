Subject: Muffler & "Wire, wire, who's got the wire?"

Got the muffler installed. :O)

I used a 5/16" carriage bolt for an anchor on the muffler hanging bracket by
modifying the bolt head into a T-bolt.  It fit through the slot in the
bracket and turned to lock into the slot just right.  I then used a washer,
split lock washer & nut to secure it firmly to the muffler bracket.

I trimmed the length of the bolt down a bit to get clearance from the
extractor pipes, then installed the other bracket supplied with the muffler
on the upper extractor pipe, pre-drilled to allow the 5/16" bolt shaft to
fit into it.  Another lock washer and nut firmly fastened the muffler to the
extractor pipe.

It appears to be solid as a rock, with the muffler and extractor pipes
vibrating as one unit.  Time will tell.  I just hope to get maybe a year out
of the muffler, and will change it out for a better quality unit when the
time comes.

Maybe I'm losing my ability to read wiring diagrams, but why would the left
rear marker lights on my `77 bay work, but the right rear and both front
ones won't, if the #2 fuse blows?  I worked on the left rear light for about
half an hour after noticing that it was out, then walked up front to notice
that both front markers were out.  A quick check of the fuse box spotted the
fuse out, and changing the fuse brought the other lights back on-line.

I'm still puzzled over why all of the marker lights didn't go out when the
fuse blew.  I'll go over the wiring diagrams again later tonight.  Maybe
there's something that I missed.  It was the working right rear marker that
threw me off the scent.
