Subject: Re: [T2] Karmann camper/new van

friend stuffed into my hand today a copy of the July  issue of VW Scene
magazine...mostly water cooled stuff but this issue had an article on a 
very beautiful 79 Karmann mobile  camper conversion.....some interesting
features noted include dual rear wheels mated to 2 liter engine with auto
tranny this is a pretty rare combination in Germany where this bus was
avaliable seems to be mostly stock,  was this sold anywhere besides the
Germany???  wonder if any made it to the States.

on another note there is also an article on the Leipzig auto show where
the new model T5 van was shown....not a very radical change from the
Eurovan...wonder if/when it will get here and how $$$ it will be, the list
price in Germany is claimed to be 18,900 Euros with the 1.9 TDI engine
stock.  it includes ABS, airbag and variable height seats not much else
mentioned.  interior photos almost look kewl...
