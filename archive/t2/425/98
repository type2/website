ROFL

Amoeba's  *snicker*

seriously though, take a trip down to your local military surplus
store.  I'm talking a full outfit, not just uniforms and all that.
You can very often find actual Jerry cans.  Not the plastic jobbies
mind you but the big steel ones.  Heavy 30 gal tanks that you can
mount on the outside of your vehicle if you choose to, or carry
inside or whatever.  They aren't all that heavy, unless you decide
to carry one for a mile or so,.. but then everything starts to feel
heavy.  Surplus stores usually purchase things in large lots that
are filled with all types of things, and I seriously doubt that the
folks in Sacramento are going to pick through old tent canvas,
butter knives and cargo netting looking for the two jerry cans
included in that 10,000 lb lot that the local surplus store
purchased.  Give it a go at any rate... It may be the last gas can
you ever buy.  So far mine is just as good today as it was 14 years
ago when I picked it up from the Navy surplus.
