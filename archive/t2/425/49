Subject: UPDATE: engine popping noise -I still need help

Original POST:

Type 4- GE010 prefix= 79 2.l
Bus- 76 Westy

The problem is this:

The engine idles fine, but when you rev it, there is a popping noise. It
doesn't disappear when you pull any of the plugs. Lifters are adjusted at 2
turns. Compression is good. Pulled a couple lifters and there is a bit of
scoring on the surface, and they don't push in as others do- they are
completely stiff. The PO said it threw a valve and replaced the heads,
lifters, valves. Replaced with 914 head and VW OE valves and lifters.
Could this cause popping?

The bus is new to me. It ran fine for 2-3 weeks after I had it, and then one
day it started popping like crazy. As a side note- I changed the exhaust from
Monza style back to stock which is when this started. I pulled the exhaust
back off, RTVd it, and no popping. Next day, popping. I don't know if it is a
coincidence. There are no leaks that I can feel.

UPDATE:

The overwhelming response here was- exhaust leak.

I called the mechanic this morning and told the whole story about the popping
stopping after I re-installed the exhaust.. I told him I'd bring my old
exhaust in to swap it and see if the noise stops, but he doesn't think that is
the problem. He says the popping noise (not a metal/metal pop) is originating
in the carb (Single Weber progressive).

I am at a loss on this. What could it be?
