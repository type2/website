I am sticking with the guy from Jersey on this one...even Muir mentions it

There's a grain of truth in the logic...IF you've been using
non-detergent
oil (and why would you, but that's another fettle of kish), a change to 
regular oil might disturb the sludge you've built up in the sump and
might clog an oilway...This is, I'd guess, the basis for the myth of 
changing oils in midstream...
