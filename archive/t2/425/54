Subject: RE: [T2] Virus coming from list member?

I got several copies of the BugBear worm from the list, and actually managed
to get infected. It was a major process to identify and clean up. Regulat
antivirus software won't work.  If you suspect you've gotten this virus or
suspicious emails from the list in the last few weeks, and need help
resolving it, contact me on pmail.
