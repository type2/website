Subject: Re: [T2] help- my engine is making a popping noise

Since the problem began with the change of exhaust that would be my guess
for the popping. Does this popping occur while revving the engine or during
decel? The RTV most likely sealed the leak but then quickly burned off and
the leak began again. Make sure that all of the flanges on the exhaust are
nice and smooth with no gaps.

 Can I eliminate lifters and valves? Can it be something
