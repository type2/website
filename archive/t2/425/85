Subject: Urgent tranny Help!!!

 Hi I've been a lurker on the list for about three years. 
The time has finally come for me to call upon the great wisdom
of the list. I have a 77 Westy with 2.0 F.I. and four speed trans. A Bad pilot bearing ate up the input shaft. So I decided
to put in a Trans from a '78 2.0 F.I. I new I was in trouble When the Trans looked Physically different also the starter from the 77 didnt fit. It's all together now but the motor is locked up. It wont budge. The tranny spins freely. So 77 motor,78 tranny, 77 pilot bearing, 77 clutch set, 77 flywheel,78 Starter. If anyone has any Ideas or suggestions please e-mail me personally. I'm kinda in a bind The bus is on the lift at my shop and my boss will be none to pleased when he comes in tommorrow. He doesn't like my bus as it is. So I have to formulate a diagnosis by 7am tommorrow. Thanks for any and all help.
