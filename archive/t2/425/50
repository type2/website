Subject: Stupid tie rod question

Can I use the left (driver's) side tie rod assembly for both sides?  I'm
getting ready to order new ones and it appears that Bus Depot offers the
left complete assembly only.

Will this make alignment more complicated?  I plan on doing a rough
alignment before taking it to the shop.
