Subject: help- my engine is making a popping noise

I thought you guys would be able to help me on this.

Engine: Type 4 1979 2.l  -GE010 prefix
Bus: 76 Westy

The problem is this:

The engine idles fine, but when you rev it, there is a popping noise. It
doesn't disappear when you pull any of the plugs. Hydraulic lifters are
adjusted at 2 turns. Compression is good. Pulled a couple lifters and there is
a bit of scoring on the surface, and they don't push in as others do- they are
completely stiff. Could this cause popping?

The bus is new to me. I've had it about 2 months (It's been in the shop for a
month of that).
It ran fine for 2-3 weeks after I had it, and then one day it started popping
like crazy.
As a side note- I changed the exhaust from Monza style back to stock which is
when this started. Right after I changed it- it started popping.
The popping stopped when I pulled the newly installed "new"exhaust off and put
RTV all over, but the next day it was back. I can't feel any leaks around the
gaskets, and the noise doesn't seem to come from below. It is a popping like
an explosion, not metal to metal.

The PO said it threw a valve and replaced the heads, lifters, valves. Replaced
with 914 head and VW OE valves and lifters.

Help! What could this be??? First the front beam needed replaced (in
progress), now this. Summer is almost over (I'm a teacher) and I haven't been
camping yet. The mechanic said he pulled the plugs and it doesn't stop it.
What else could it be? Can I eliminate lifters and valves? Can it be something
as simple as the exhaust?
