I have in the past had the big gear slip on the shaft and not move the
blades but sit there spinning

it is.

I fixed mine by taking out the entire rack, (yup PITA) took and mixed a
tooling resin and steel wool concoction and stuffed it in and around the
wiper gear, let it cure, 6 years later it is still working (but I have a
nice rack to replace it with if it fails but if it isn't broke I'm not
fixing it)  now since most folks don't have the shop with tooling resin in
it and the stuff is out ragously expensive (Devcon) and you have to buy at
least a lb to get the quarter ounce you need...I'm not sure what would
work but would probably start with an epoxy of some sort...

good luck
