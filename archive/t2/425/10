Subject: Exhaust manifold heat shield

Hi folks

I just picked up some used exhaust manifolds to replace the rusted set on my
'78. The new set still has the heat shields on them. One is still in good
shape and not rusted at all and in one piece. The heat shield on the other
manifold is rusted and begining to peel off. The first concern I have is what
material the shield is lined with since the shield is loose and the material
is falling out from the inside. Is it Asbestos like in the OEM heat
exchangers? Second, should I leave the good heat shield on the one manifold or
should I just pull them off of both. The manifolds currently on my bus no
longer have the heat shields. Do they make a big difference in keeping the
heads cooler? If I leave the shields on will a normal resperatory mask keep
the fibers at bay when installing the new/old manifolds?

Thanks
