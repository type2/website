Subject: replacing lifters/ pushrods

Hi folks

In the next couple weeks I am planning on replacing my pushrod tube seals.
While I'm in there, I want to pull my lifters and look for any wear. I can
just use a magnet probe to remove them right? When I put them back in do they
need to be lined up in a specific to the cam or can I just carefuly drop them
back down the bore? Also I seem to remember that the pushrods need to be
rotated when I put them back untill they drop into the lifter?

Thanks
