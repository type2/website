I found that out the hard way also. The first can I bought from Kragen was
horribly complicated and expensive so I took it back unused.

The second one I bought from pepboys was in my price range and had a much
simpler design. It's actually really great for filling up a motorcycle gas
tank but that's all: the nozzle is short and there is no vent at the back
you can release so the gas flows quickly. The tip barely goes in the tank
and won't fit most openings as you said.

To make up for it they'll give you a funnel that fits the nozzle but it
doesn't screw on or have a rubber seal so on your first pour, gas goes
everywhere.

What I did was to cut the bottom off a 500ml water bottle and use it as a
funnel for a short term workaround.

Those contraptions end up spilling more gas then a regular gas can would.
