Subject: Virus coming from list member?

I have received several virus alerts to this address that I use for this list.
I also got an email from RMMW saying they received an email from my address
infected with the W32.Klez.H(-at-)mm virus. I have never sent an email to RMMW from
this address so I am assuming that some one is infected and their email
utility is harvesting addresses from their address book. I have also been
receiving the W32.Bugbear.B(-at-)mm virus to this address which is only used for
this list. Time to run a virus scan everyone!  I just did and confirmed I am
not infected.
