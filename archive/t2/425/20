My vote is also exhaust.  I thought I'd throw in my two cents since my 
exhaust is just about down the crapper and I'm experience what seems to 
be exactly what you're describring.  Your motor can be great - good 
compression, well tuned, good on idle, etc.but at higher RPMs it'll 
sound like somebody is cooking up popcorn in the back of your bus. 
 First make sure there is nobody cooking popcorn then check for exhaust 
leaks.

On mine I can just cover the tail pipe with a rag (don't stuff it in 
there and don't burn yourself either) and feel along the exhaust line 
for leaks (not touching the pipes just feeling for air of course).  And 
you must get it fixed before it causes long term damage.  And by all 
means go camping.
