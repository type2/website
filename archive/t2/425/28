To import a vehicle to the US less than 25 years old from countries other
than Canada can be a major pain.  You have to deal with DOT, EPA, and US
Customs at a federal level BEFORE you deal with your states DMV.

Importing cars older than 25 years is also a hassle, but less of a hassle.

Below are some useful links to study before buying a foreign vehicle.  Good
luck getting a late model Mexican vehicle legally into the US!
