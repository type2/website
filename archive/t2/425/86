Subject: re locking engine lid latch

Today I received a like new locking latch for my 1970's engine lid from listee
Karl von Salzen.. This uses the L profile key, which is not an easy thing to
find. I was able to eliminate an extra key, it's great. Many thanks to Karl, I
mailed him my extra key, and it came back working slick as can be. I think he
has more of them too.
