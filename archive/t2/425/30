I'll have to agree on this retort to the original question---

While Pennsylvania crude has been known for years to be far superior to
almost anything else in lubricating qualities--
And originally Castrol was of the castor bean---not good for air cooled
long term duration in maintaining viscosity---

Ask any Brit bike owner--

But since new techno multi viscosity lubricants have hit the
marketplace--the Castrol is as good, if not better than the Pennsylvania
lubricants--

Change with no fear---just use GTX 20/ 50 and everything will be hunky
dorry-

Later,

Terry-

What a load of crap. I have 5 different vehicles, and switch oil often,
including between synthetic and dino oil. All oils are compatible to
federal regulations. In the old days there might have been some truth to
this, but those went out with flatheads and strombergs. :-) I have a hi
performance VW engine with approx. 160HP and I use either Penzoil or
Valvoline, whichever is more reasonable that week at the local flaps. In
my motorcycle I sometimes use synthetic if I'm going to be driving
around town alot as it has great anti-scuff properties. I would say you
have more of a danger of screwing up your engine by using the improper
viscosity than by changing brands. Tell your dad to re-educate himself,
many things have changed since the 40's and 50's technologies. Regards, 
Courtney
