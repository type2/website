Hi Ben. Welcome! I havn't been here very long but have learned alot from
this list in that time.

When you say "frame" what exactly do you mean? The bus doesnt really have a
frame. It's basically a unibody construction with the frame rails and body
being one which the axles,tranny and so forth bolt on to.  There are support
beams that can be replaced by cutting and rewelding. The rockers and doglegs
and such can be replaced without to much pain by a knowledgable body person.
Most online vendors carry replacement pannels for not alot of money but be
aware that alot of the aftermarket stuff doesn't fit perfectly and may need
some tweaking. Body work is not cheap to do right. How far gone is this DC?
