<< the jam is generally where the line-out from the pressure tank leaves

Get an air dryer on the air line.
Whats happening is the condensation created by the compressor is getting
sucked up by the sand and jamming the outlet hole on the bottom of the
tank.

It doesn't take much moisture either to plug the outlet valve.

I grab the handle and bounce the tank a couple of times with the hand
valve held open and it'll free the sand lock up .

It just something that happens, and it isn't because your re-using the
sand.

It'll do this with fresh outa the bag sand.

An air dryer will slow this down--but it'll still happen.
