I was hearing some funny noises from the driver's side and went to check 
the valves.  There was tons of play on the #3 intake rocker arm.  This 
would also explain why sometimes the car would run fine, and sometimes 
it would run horribly (seat sometimes in position, sometimes out).

Now I'm trying to decide whether to change both heads and put the engine 
back in, or put in my other engine... both will entail a good amount of 
work..
