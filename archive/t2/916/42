Subject: Re: [T2] seized transmission?

Steve asked:


 Hi Folks,
I'm getting to work on a 74 with a supposedly just rebuilt engine from a
78.  When I got the bus I couldn't turn the engine manually and assumed it
was seized.  I pulled it, found I could turn it by rotating the flywheel and
put it back in.  It won't turn again.  It rolls fine in neutral but the
engine won't budge a bit.
The PO had reported that the old (also recently rebuilt engine) had seized
so he bought this one about a year before he sold it to me but never got it
running.
Does this sound like a seized transmission?

Sounds like they left the 228mm flywheel on the 78 engine and tried to stuff it into the 74 transaxle......

The 74 transaxle requires a 215mm flywheel [you can use the 210mm also].
