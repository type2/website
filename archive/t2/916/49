Subject: Re: [T2] Another Starting Problem (cranksd, no start when hot)

I am only seven months into my bus owning experience and had a strange problem with the bus not starting when hot.

The PO told me this was an issue sometimes when I bought the bus.

The times it wouldn't start initially were when the bus was hot and increased in frequency, I tried to listen for the click of the solenoid, unsure if I was not hearing it because it was so far away.

I decided I needed the hot start relay recomended for this solution, the only thing was that I discovered that it already had it installed by a PO.

After some honest diagnosis work with help from a friend I figured out that the little plastic piece beneath the part where the key gets stuck in was worn out, what was once a slot was now and hourglass shape (similar to a number 8 shape).

So all of the times I let it cool down it was just getting around to snagging on the ignition switch just right, no electrical or fuel issue here, I just couldn't turn the key far enough to start it anymore, cost under 2 bucks to buy the new part if I remember correctly.

Thanks
