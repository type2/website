You guys make me so envious!  Unfortunately Jerome is just too close to
the start of the school year for me to consider playing hookey to attend.

The good news is that I'll still be on winter break for BBBXI!  I can
even drive out of town without caring if one of my students notices my
bus heading the wrong way on a school day... :)
