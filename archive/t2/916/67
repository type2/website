Subject: Tape of Jerome

I received a video of Jerome today on a VCR  tape  I will bring it to the
meeting for someone to make copies.  I also have ONE gift for the people who
came to Jerome on that Monday for the TV show.  We will have a free raffle
to those who come to the meeting to receive this tape. BIG raffle at a NEW
meeting place. See all of you Wednesday,
