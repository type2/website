Hi Scott,

We had a "Type Two Trouble-shooting Time Trials" event at EveryBus a  
few years ago. The top-scoring non-professional team used only the  
tools from a standard VW repair kit: A 10mm wrench, a reversible  
slotted/phillips screwdriver and a spark plug socket.

It's amazing what you can accomplish with just these few items, but I  
I would add a 12V test light as well. Anything further would depend  
on what items you are anticipating difficulties with: ie, a triple- 
square allen wrench for the CV bolts, etc...

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
