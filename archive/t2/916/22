Subject: RE: [T2] need engine stand plans

I have one of these, and they are good. Two points of warning:

1: It tips over somewhat easily when rotating the engine. Be careful. I
would stand in front of it and twist it by the heater tubes. 

(This is due to the T config of how to has rollers on the bottom.  The H or
V config is safer.)

2:  The rack that bolts to the engine holds up well (at lest in my
circumstance).  However the part that inserts into the stand got a lot of
heavy/deep grooves.  So, if I use it again, I need another rack.
