BLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH

That's me being tired ;)  Anyways, engine's out, I have two brand new 
AMC heads sitting next to me, and now I just have to pull off the rest 
of the tin and cooling shroud and then the heads.  I got a surprise to 
find the engine mounts on the mustache bar completely broken, so I'll 
get some of those tomorrow - good thing I pulled out the engine, huh!

I wish I could hit a button and it would magically tear itself apart and 
put itself back together.  that would be so neat ;)  I guess it's called 
$$$ . hehehehe.e .e. e. e.  e

ok, back to the garage
