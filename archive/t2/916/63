Still can't afford to pay a mechanic to do as thorough a job as I do. I 
replace all the related seals, mounts, hoses and etc if they look 
questionable.


Well, I've had fun going through the receipts the PO gave me on the '84 Vanagon Westy I just bought. He was taking to the worst of all possible places-a Goodyear Service Center. How about 4 new plain white, no name shocks for $575.00 installed? How about new wiper blades for almost $50.00? (they did replace both, though). One section of the exhaust replaced for $350.00. No thanks, if I can't do it myself, it won't get done, I don't care how long it takes!  Jeff
