I can still see the original crosshatch left by the machine shop.  There 
are only about 30-40k miles on these cylinders and pistons.

The sucky part is that the floating seat hit the piston and left a 
little gouge in the "ledge" where the dish is - it's a good 1cm away 
from the edge and I don't see any visual signs of rubbing on the walls 
of the cylinder.  Other than that, the pistons and cylinders are still 
looking really good.

I just wasn't sure if it was ok to take off the cylinders and not hone 
them.  But if it's cool, I'll go ahead and clean 'em and grind them into 
the heads w/ some valve grinding compound to get them to mate nicely.
