Subject: Brake/Idle relationship - how bizarre...

My son and I spent several hours yesterday adjusting the idle on our 71 bus.
All seemed fine, but we noticed that when we put the brake on hard (even
while standing still in neutral) the idle drops down to the point of killing
it.  We checked to make sure that the throttle cable was not being
interfered with and for the life of me can't see the relationship between
the two.  We even went so far as to disconnect the brake light indicators in
case it was having a short.  No luck with this...

Please help!
