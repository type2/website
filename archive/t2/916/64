You know, that really is the reason why I never bring my car in to have 
anything done.  Then I know exactly what was done and even more 
important, I learn even more about how things work.  When it starts 
getting to really advanced measurements and machining, that's when I 
have to bring it in, though.  I just don't have the tools or time to 
learn how to properly machine parts.

Yeah.... since I pulled the engine apart, I cleaned all the tin so it's 
nice and shiny again ;)
