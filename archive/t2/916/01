Subject: winter storage for my 65 beetle ?

I have a 65 beetle...my wife said I have to store it outside for the winter 
;( ...it's complete ...I can push it around...it's a future restoration project 
...good shape...
Looking for advice  for outside winter storage ...
do I jack it off the ground?
cover it? 
any advice will be deeply appreciated...
Thanks !
