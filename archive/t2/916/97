Subject: "Essential" on-board tool kit and parts... 

Hello all. Recently  purchased a 69 Westy and have been lurking here  
for a few months. Any thoughts on what tools and parts to carry along  
as standard equipment?  I am new to VW but mechanically competent.

Also need a  coiled spring for the drivers seat, anyone have one for  
sale or know a parts supply in southern California?

Thanks, Scott
