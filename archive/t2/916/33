Subject: in-car head removal - floating valve seat

Hello everyone,
I have the unfortunate luck of having a bad valve seat so I'm pulling 
off the head (with the engine still in the car).  So far I've gotten 
everything off of the left side of the engine (tin, header, heat 
exchanger, pushrods, tubes, rocker arms, etc).  Now, the only thing left 
really is the one piece of tin that fits between the head and the oil 
cooler.  It kinda extends over the head and doesn't allow me to pull it 
off.  Do I have to loosen the fan housing such that I can pull the tin 
out, or is there another trick to dealing with that piece of tin so I 
can get the head off?

Thanks!
Mike
