Subject: In Car Head Removal-Floating Valve Seat

 MIke, 

Even though it may be a PITA to drop the engine to do the head work,
You'll find that it you would be doing yourself a big favor and getting
the engine outa the Bus to perform the surgery. 

It'll for positively sure make the job a bunch easier--and the shroud &
engine tin removal will be a snap. 

You might actually consider doing both heads---( which you probably
should do anyway ) 

Been there , seen it, done it--- & dropped the engine.--: ) 

Hey----What makes you think the seat is floating?

It may be over cooked along with the valve--but floating ?
naw---: )
