 and the fixed side window.
 
  
 
Question 1 - Is that vertical metal bar between the
vent window and the fixed window part of the vent
frame? The body? A separate piece of metal?

* The bar is the frame of the vent window. 
 
Question 2 - Is it available anywhere?  Does someone
have a good one they'd part with?

* You will need to find someone selling a good non
rusty vent window FOR a Westfalia. Westies are black
metal, passenger buses are chrome. Is it too far gone
to sand and repaint black?

Question 3 - Are the rubber gaskets available for
the vent window?  For the fixed window?  Where?

I have one from a '77 Westy I won't be using.  It has the original seal that
is in very good shape plus I have a replacement seal if you feel so
inclined.  A word of caution, I found the vent and solid window
reinstallation to be extremely frustrating leading me to go with a solid
window on the drivers side (OK purists I'm ready)
