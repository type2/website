Good point. Of course, Benthin's bus cranks okay so
not a start circuit related issue. The causes for not
cranking when hot are usually not enough voltage to
the solenoid to energize it sufficiently to slam the
switch closed to energize the starter. Reasons are
worn out ket switch, corroded wire ends (usually from
the connector ends underneath the insulation for a
bit), dirty solenoid and just plain worn out solenoid.
Old-timers just crawl under with a screwdriver or
other metal tool they have set aside in an
easy-to-rech spot and remove the spade connector at
the top of the solenoid then short across the large
terminal from the battery to that male spade connector
that he just disconnected. Be sure the bus is out of
gear! I usually just bumped it this way with the key
off, as it would usually start from up front after
this exercise. Most people claim that it is due to all
the voltage loss between the battery-to-the keyswitch
and back to the solenoid again. I bought Bosch
remanned starters every 13-14 months for a few years
(12 month warranty!) until I found a new solenoid and
pretty much never had another problem. A remote
starter switch in the engine compartment that either
is in parallel with the solenoid (heavy dut sucker) or
one that is in parallel with the keyswitch but with
much shorter wire run is helpful. It also helps when
adjusting valves or setting ignition points.

The relays are just buying time until the proper fix
is  unavoidable! Keep these things in mind because you
found the weakest point and fixed it, making the new
weakest point somewhere up the line! -BaH
