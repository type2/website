Subject: new heads, need advice (was indeed a floating valve seat)

Ok, I got the engine out and pulled the bad head off.  I'm going to put 
two new heads on and I wanted to see if I should grind the cylinders 
into the heads w/ valve grinding compound like I did before when 
everything was new.  Now, if i do that, do I need to roughen up (hone) 
the cylinders again so the rings seat in again?

Do rings move as the engine is running, or do the find a groove and stay 
there when breaking in?

Thanks!
Mike
