Just replaced the tortuous OEM seats with Vanagon seats ('87 model with
adjustable arms) in my '79.  The slide right in and Mr. Potts is correct you
have to solve the armrest situation.  I chose to take off the door handles
and am currently looking at screwing a strap in to replace those.  The
Vanagon seats are absolutely wonderful!

Does the list have any ideas on what kind of strap will fit in the doors?
Maybe something available from a Beetle?
