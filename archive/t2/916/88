Heheh... yeah, I've seen those.

They aren't actual real busses, but they are made completely of fiberglass. 
You can still buy them. At one point I had the company website bookmarked 
and I even had pictures from one at a local mall.

We had them at the Broward Mall, they may still be there, and I more 
recently saw them at the mall in Oahu in Hawai'i. The drivers seat usually 
has a bunch of stuffed animals sitting in front (as if they were driving or 
something).

The sides usually have one of those pick and grab machines or whatever 
they're called.

Pretty cool!
