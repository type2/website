* You will need to find someone selling a good non
rusty vent window FOR a Westfalia. Westies are black
metal, passenger buses are chrome. Is it too far gone
to sand and repaint black?

Not unless you're building a concours show winner.The windows are exactly the same, I used a chrome one on my '75 Westy.




 found the vent and solid window 
reinstallation to be extremely frustrating leading me to go with a solid
window on the drivers side (OK purists I'm ready)

Ok, IMHO it's really not that hard. I did this on one Westy and regretted it-makes the back of the bus very hot on warm days. The biggest problem you are likely to run into is that the pot metal pin the window pivots on has snapped off, but I've been able fix that too.   Jeff
