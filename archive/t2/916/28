Subject: Re: [T2] Masonry Sand?

FWIW in my experience any sand that I have had in bags or barrels 
outside seemed to absorb moisture. The payground sand was worse than the 
stuff I bought from the tool rental place. That sand was different 
(darker color) and did not seem to absorb moisture. While I had my share 
of moisture problems related to the compressor/dryer - high humidity or 
dew caused problems too.
