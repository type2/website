Seems that it would be easiest to tee into the connectors at the
taillights themselves.  Just put a male and female spade connector on the
end of each wire and tie them in at the backside of the light.  Add a lug
for ground and you're in business.  It it's temporary you could probably
just run the wires out of the engine bay door with some tape to protect
the wires from chafing on the door.
