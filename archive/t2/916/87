I know you're frustrated, but this is important: Black
smoke or blue smoke and does it kinda chug-chug and
blubber when it's happening? If black smoke it is a
rich mixture condition.

Since it is intermittent check every wire connector
you can see in the engine compartment.** One more
time, check (by actually grabbing hold) every hose
connection you can see.

Unplug the connector off the cold start injector (the
one next to the distributor) If the hose from the air
bypass valve is in good shape (most are brittle) clamp
it off - or unhook the hoses on each end and plug
where it goes into the air chamber wit a cork and plug
where it goes into thw "S" hose with a cork. Plug or
block off the decel valve.

Do these things one at a time to isolate the problem.

**See recent posting about the multi-wire plugs at the
double relay - One wire was loose in the middle of the
bunch - loose in the plug assembly.

If your hoses have never been replaced, it is possible
that your fuel line hoses are coming apart inside. If
there is a blockage on the return-to-tank end of
things, your fuel pressure could go sky-high and cause
a very rich mixture situation.

I am leaning toward either a vacuum leak (shouldn't be
intermittent though) or a failing thermo-time switch
that occasionally goes into its cold-start routine and
activates the 5th injector. Happened to me a couple
times. As you get more clues, post 'em! -BaH
