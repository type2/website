Subject: Re: [T2] Correct radio for a 78?

I have been hearing from the specialty rig guys about eliminating the head unit 
and using an mp3 player.

Most mp3 players have there own eq and volume controls, you can plug straight 
into an amp and totally forget about a head unit.

This is great for people that want a stealth setup and have quit radio, all you 
need is a cord to plug into in the cabin and an amp hidden nearby.

I will be doing this in my IH Scout, it is so air leaky I have to bleach the 
ceiling every time I drive it and scrape the rust off the bulb receptacles, it 
isn't a great environment for a head unit.

Has anybody had experience doing this?  Happy about the choice?
