Hey! I "inherited" a 10x12 ft shed  made of 2x4s, 2x6s, and metal roofing.

I mvoed it to our property and extended it to 10x16. Just buy or build a 
10x16 shed. Remove the rear wall and create double doors back there. 
Front is walk-in, rear is drive-in.

Floor is 2x6" and 3/4" plywood. I laid 2x8 planks for the tires to roll on.

Have plenty of room for storing an extra engine, tranny, and a bunch of 
little stuff in the rear two corners in Rubbermaid containers.

Other option would be a "Beetle box".

I am thinking a 12x16 shed might be the answer for weather tight storage 
for my Westfalia too. Of course the floor would need to be much stronger...
