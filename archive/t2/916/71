I was going to suggest the lambda sensor before I even got to this.

There's a test for it (what voltage it generates cold, warm, hot, etc)
but it's kinda like testing the Temp2 sensor. Ranges. Difficult to
nail down.

But for $30, you can get a new one from BD:

It's cheap because it's shared among all VWs until the mid 80's IIRC.

I dunno if the test is in the Bentley, but it'll be around somewhere.
