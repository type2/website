In the movie "1969" Keifer Sutherland trades in his brothers Corvair for 
a bus. My first vehicle was a 66 bus and a couple of years later I 
bought a 65 Corvair.  I saw the movie with my brother and he said, 
"Aren't those your cars?".  The ones in the movie may not be the right 
years, but damn, they looked the same.
