Subject: setting up trailer lights on a 70 bus ?

My friend wants me to help him wire up some trailer lights on his 70 double  
cab, 
 
the trailer has the normal 4 wire plug , 3 hot wires  - running lights  , 
left brake/turm . right brake/turn and a ground
 
whats the cheapest way to set this up ?
 
can we run wires off the fuse box or the turn signal switch to the back of  
the doublecab ?
 
He would not mind that as the tailghts / turn signals on the DC do not  
always work anyway :(
 
not worried about emergancy flashers.....
 
I have not seen the truck so I have no idea how screwed up the wiring  is
 
thanks for your help
