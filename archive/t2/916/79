Subject: Re: [T2] please help... dying at idle again...

Well, it stranded me this morning. Will still start after waiting 30
sec or so, but will only run for another 30 sec before it starts
cutting out and dying, even under throttle. It's also blowing smoke at
this point (when it starts to die), which has never happened before.

I am extremely frustrated, to say the least.
