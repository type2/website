Hi Adam,

If you're having problems with charging and also intermittent non- 
start problems, it sounds like you should investigate the quality of  
all your high-voltage connections.

One corroded or loose link in the chain could easily cause BOTH of  
these problems. Here's the path:

(+)Battery Terminal  to Starter.  (The alternator wire bolts to the  
same post on the starter, be sure to check that it's also clean and  
bolted up tight.)
Starter to Transmission.
Transmission to Chassis.
Chassis to (-)Terminal.

Do this BEFORE you have them replace anything expensive. You might  
also consider replacing the tranny ground strap and battery terminal  
wires while you're at it.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
