Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats in my 77 Bay

Hi Courtney,

All years will fit the tracks. There are two issues to be addressed:

1. The later years (84+??) will have the arms that will interfere  
with the arm-rests on the westy doors. You can either remove the arm  
rest or remove the door handle and replace it with one from a non-westy.

2. The vanagon seats are about an inch taller than bay seats. Only a  
problem if you like to drive with a tall hat on or have a tall torso  
& long next or very short legs.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
