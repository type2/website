Do you have the idle cut off solenoid?
Check the connections and pull the wires to see if they pull out of the 
connector lugs.
Even if you have a connection but too much resistance from loose & oily wires 
the solenoid will not open correctly causing the idle circuit to malfunction 
and this can be intermittent if the wire is loose.
I just had this issue with my bus.
Replaced the jumper wires and everything was good as new, it made a huge 
difference in drivability.
