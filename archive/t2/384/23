I finally had some time to investigate and the problem is a broken
thermostat cable. Thanks to Scott Lyons for drilling it into my head that
low vacuum is caused by low idle: find the source of the low idle.

The temperature is still in the mid-sixties here on the coast with the flaps
in the open position (safety) it's too cold for a normal idle and takes 15
minutes or so to get up to temperature. People who don't have these working
must live where it's hot or not know their bus is suffering unnecessarily.

There is a lot of debate in the archives and I guess it just depends on
where you live. Out here the flaps are needed.

Here's some good archives articles about it:

The rest of my problem was described here:
