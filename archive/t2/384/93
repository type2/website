Subject: bus sighting (friday)

There's a commercial on with a walk/don't walk sign where eventually 
the guy in the sign starts dancing, but at the beginning of the 
commercial, when it says "walk" a bus drives by.  very short, but this 
is the kind of thing you notice when you can't be in the garage because 
the in-laws are over and you're doing  "coffee and..."  in the living 
room:}
