Indeed, if you do want to change at least buy a quality brand name. Crane 
has a great rep for ignition systems. As long as they aren't making them 
with indentured peasants in Asia now, either that or Mallary is where I 
would look. You won't get them for $19.95 and you won't get 10% to 30% 
better mileage, however, in an otherwise stock T-IV. Neither can you put in 
stock points and get home without a tow bill when they fail, which because 
of their quality construction might be 10 or 15 years of perfection until 
nada, and there you is where you is, at the side of the road, waiting for a 
tow truck.
