Chris,

Unfortunately, there seems to be a limited amount of common sense to go 
around and they aren't making it any more...it seems that the more people 
there are in the world, the less common sense is available!

I suppose that we bus owners may be losing our common sense...otherwise 
the Zebra folks(whom I admire fortheir guts on the trips) would have seen
something like this coming as they entered Germany....knowing how the 
germans can be...<grin>...(apologies in advance to any Germans on the 
list, but you *know* what I mean).

Been there and done that many years ago....but in a much nicer manner.

German lady at the gas station had fit over the front windows of a 66 bus 
that still had paint overspray on the front windows(I had bought it used 
in Koln) and went inside and got a razor scraper...cleaned it off 
completely and then washed the window again before she would let us 
head up the mountains(where she knew it was snowing).

Losing my common sense daily, dave
