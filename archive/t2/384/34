Subject: VW brake cylinder paste

Hello Volks folks,
    I'm planning to do some front brake work to our 71 in the near
future.  Checking the Bentely manual I see it calls for using "VW
brake cylinder paste" for lubricating seals and parts in the front
calipers.  Does anyone know if VW still has this paste available or if
there is some other product that is just as good to use.
    Thanks in advance for the advice.
