Subject: Re: [T2] EEC Control Valve question

I found that mine was also not working a couple of weeks ago. The valve is
not available by itself. I had to go to a salvage yard and find another
airbox. Depending on what your local DEQ requirements are you can just leave
it and not worry about it. It helps reduce the emissions by drawing the gas
vapors through the charcoal cannister and back into the fuel mixture to be
reburned intstead of out the exhaust. If you do find one in a salvage yard
you can test it by sucking on the small nipple on the valve and if it holds
a vacuum then it's good. Plugging the hoses on the venting system is not a
good thing to do as I learned from Karl. It helps the fuel tank breath and
keeps it from colapsing in on it self.

Good Luck
