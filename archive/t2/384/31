If you have verified everything, and I mean everything else, and the motor 
does not respond to the idle mixture screw with changes in rpm, you have a 
carb issue, like crud blocking flow of air or fuel in the channels in the 
body of the carb or jets. Poor response to the idle rpm adjustment screw 
means first verify that the throttle gap is spec. If it is, suspect vacuum 
leak somewhere.
