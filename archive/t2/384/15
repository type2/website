Subject: RE: [T2] AGAIN an aluminum case update

As far as my case was concerned, it was tight by .002 full radius and the
align bore took care of that. The front main faces dad to be surfaced to
narrow it down because the saddles on the front main web were too thick.
Haven't got to the cam yet since I still have to sit down with the die grinder
and work out all the casting flash and chunks of aluminum partially blocking
the oil galleys.

This information doesn't resolve the issues
with the new aluminum type 1 engine case.

Craig has previously torqued the case and
not found the crank seized.
Was it correct before machining the stroker
clearance and the problem came from that ?
This would indicate an issue with Rimco, but
Northwest Connecting Rod reports they find
an error on all cases.

Raymond Heath had his mains line-bored .002"
back to standard due to undersize main bearing
journals. This would display as a partial cut
if the journal was accurate but the edge was burred.
He didn't specify if the cut was .002" total or
.002" radius, or which mains were undersize.

Craig originally posted the cam gear getting tight
once in a full revolution, with no visible pattern
displayed on the soft cam gear, and no solution
reported.

Vendors have consistently stated that all issues
have been resolved, and many cases are in use
with no defects.
