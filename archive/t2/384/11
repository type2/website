I'd be curious as to how such laws are applied...Are 20+ year old
Mercedes or BMW's held to the same stringent standards (or even
stopped as often) as VW's, or 2CV's, or Opels...? Is/are the laws
being applied on a 'level playing field'... ? Or (heaven forbid!) are
the inspection laws a form of economic profiling...? Any comments
from across the pond...?
