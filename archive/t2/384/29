Hi Larry,

I wouldn't count on T2a westy's having drains. Since VW was building 
these buses specifically to be converted into campers, they would have 
assembled them without drains, gears and all the other stuff. The 
canvas keeps the water out of the roof hole, so the drains wouldn't be 
required. Campers don't get a headliner, either; westfalia made it out 
of wood panelling.

I've owned and worked on a number of 68-73 campers (Yes, I know the 73 
is a special case...) and I've never seen the drains in any of them. 
But I expect to get a lot more familiar with sunroof hardware tomorrow, 
after I add a 1977 Sunroof Automatic to the fleet.

Happy trails,
