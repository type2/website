Subject: Re: [T2] Points?

My 'nned to keep the original point set-up is based on practicality rather
than economics. Sure, the electronic ignition might be nice, but points
aren't hard to adjust correctly, and I can carry several extra sets with me
for those 'on-the-road' failures.(Both mine and other busser's.) Ten minutes
and I'm back on the road. When those electronic units die, they're
d-e-a-d, dead, and my experince has been that unlike points, they give no
warning of their impending demise. A second electronic ignition system would
be a bit pricey to carry as a spare. [I guess it is partly economic!]

Besides, periodic inspection is and important diagnostic tool and adjusting
the points is a good time to check out the cap and rotor. On top of that,
these old busses just seem happier if you tinker around with them fairly
often.

Regards,
Dave

> 10 or 12 sets of points later, and you could have had yourself a new
 electronic ignition.  I'm a purist about some things, but setting dwell and
 gapping an archaic spring mechanism goes a bit beyond my need to keep it
original.  Anybody care to expand on why you would want to keep your
points(beyond the need out of necessity)?
