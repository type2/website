Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Westy, won't idle, backfires... Part Duex

Okay...Not only was I starting to feel stupid, but it turns out that my bus
was retarded. I advanced the timing a bit, and got it to run, and then
fine-tuned the timing. Thanks much to all you gurus for keeping me moving in
the right direction. I set the dwell to 46 deg, and timing to 7.5-8 deg
BTDC, which I understand is correct for my 009.

Now...It runs well once the engine is warm, but does not want to idle when
cold. It either runs for about 5 seconds and dies, or as it warms up a bit,
surges for a bit and then dies. My chokes are both working, and adjusted to
the marks on the carbs (34-PDSIT-2/3). The carbs have both been recently
rebuilt, and I set both Idle Mixture Screws (nos. 5 and 48 on page 20 of
Bentley) at 2.5 turns, and the Idle Speed Adjusting Screw (no. 8 on same
diagram) at 4 turns as per instructions on the list. One thing that confuses
me though, is that adjusting the Idle Mixture Screw (on top), and the Idle
Speed Adjusting Screw make absolutely no difference.  Even bottoming them
out makes no difference.

What say ye? How do I sort this one out?

Cheers,
Matthew
