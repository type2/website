Subject: Re: [T2] Points?

Hello Guys and Dolls  I use the crane units have for over 15 years,  have 
used points also anybody remember that bad batch of bosch points that would 
run 3 miles then quit. I sure as hell do. then of course theres those 
el-cheapos that are total junk. My thinking is the least time I have to spend 
setting dwell and timing the better I have better things to do and when you 
are in business TIME is money. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing Salem Import
