But where is the bar held to? There is no way a bus of any vintage
over 20 years could possibly be as safe as the new vehicles on the
roads now, with all the safety devices installed. So what standards
are we as bus owners held to? It's a very hard decision. Lots of
unsafe vehicles are on the road daily. I can think of semi-trucks w/
those cheap retreads that constantly blow out. I don't happen to
believe that having a huge chunk of rubber flying at me at 55 mph is a
safe thing. But someone has to make the call. Just keep in mind that
having only vehicles deemed safe on the road is a false sense of
security. Plenty of other things can go wrong while traveling. Just
keep you eyes on the road & do all you can to make sure the bus is as
safe as possible.
