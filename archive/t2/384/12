Standard procedure, every time even it you done it a thousand times 
before!!!! After setting the vehicle on stands go to each corner of the car 
and push it hard. If all four corners are firm, good to go. Any little 
wiggles means improve your foundation. And if it goes crashing to the 
ground, you know your need serious improvement to your procedures and 
equipment, and you can make a correction without killing anyone, including 
yourself.

The cost of medium quality 6 ton rated stands for your Bus is a fraction of 
the cost of cracked ribs. Just the x-ray bill will cost more. Just a deeply 
bruised bone takes 6 months to fully heal. And the only coffin that will 
cost less is one made up of used boards in the back yard.
