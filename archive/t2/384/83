Subject: Re: [T2] EEC Control Valve question

> my EEC Control Valve is gone. I have been trying to
 get the fuel venting system working on my '79 westy. Does anyone have any
 experience replacing the EEC Control Valve (the one in the air filter
 housing)? Or should I just leave it by-passed and not bother?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The EEC valve opens when ported vacuum comes on. With the valve opens, the raw fuel vapors that are stored in
the charcoal canister from the tank vent system is siphoned into the air intake. Purging the canister.
Up to you if you want it working.....but this is why they have smog laws. Gasoline venting to the atmoshere is
raw hydrocarbons. Here in California, we hate the smog check program.... but the air IS getting cleaner!
Sometimes the government is right.....
The valve is not serviceable/replaceable. You will need the front half of the air cleaner to repair it. I do
have an good used one.
