Subject: Re: [VB] Noisy TO bearing saga continues

Hi Joe


I too continue to strugle with a very noisy, grinding, clutch.  Push down on
the clutch pedal and I start to get a grinding noise.   Gets worse the
further you push the pedal. Also increases with the clutch pedal in and
increased engine revs.    I replaced the cross shaft, along with the PP, TO
bearing and disc.  Only thing I did not do was the Gland nut, and I am going
to do it tomorrow.  I tried both a Brazil pp from Ronnie and a German 3
finger.

I don't know what to do if this does not work...

it.
