Subject: Re: [VB] Noisy TO bearing saga continues

Ain't it maddening?  I replaced the gland nut, PP, and TO bearing, 
wired the TOB to the cross shaft, and held my mouth just right -- still 
there.  I think I'll swap out the PP and rebush the cross shaft next, & 
check the arms for parallel.  What else can it be?

Otherwise I love my new tranny and the bus is a cruiser!  I drove it 
250 miles RT on a campout last weekend and the TO was the only thing 
harshing my mellow.

Best of luck, brother in suffering. :-)
