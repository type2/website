Subject: RE: [T2] Cap/Rotor?

If nobody knows for sure...see if they fit OK. If they fit see if they run
OK. If so, it's probably good.

'77 Westy "Pumpkin II"

<SNIP>
Got a brand new cap and rotor That I originall bought for my 79 Westy years
ago
and wanted to put it on my 69. I've looked at the caps and both have the
same
Bosch #'s on them (1235522056) and the rotors also have the same #'s
(1234332215)on them but they also have different markings that make me
wonder
if they are sifferent in some way I cannot tell. The new stuff is orange in
color and clearly has Bosch written on it and the old just has the little
Bosch
