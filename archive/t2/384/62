Perhaps I am the exception to the rule, but I will swear by my Crane CDI.  
I've had it going on 9 years now, and I've never touched it since I 
installed it.  It isn't temperature or moisture sensitive either.  I used to 
dread driving in heavy rain and extreme heat.  Now I rarely think about it 
at all.  It is the single improvement that stands out  for making the most 
noticeable improvement in the way my bus runs and drives.  I guess that's 
why I 'chime in' on this topic whenever it pops up.  You guys don't know 
what you're missing!err...I mean firing!
