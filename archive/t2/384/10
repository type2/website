I have not seen drains in factory Westy buses.
I have a 71 conversion to pop top and have the drains but I don't see them in 
the bone yard buses.
Look in the forward RH and LH corner where a sun roof would rest and see if 
there are holes about 1/2" dia, these are 2 of the 6 drains in a sun roof 
bus.
Also there are 2 mid bus that go between the windows on either side and 2 
more way in the back of the pocket where the sun roof would slide into.
My drains plugged up and this pocket filled up with water the first year I 
had the bus.
My kids were treated to a cold shower ala waterfall.
