Subject: Re: [T2] EEC Control Valve question

I took apart a broken EEC valve recently to see how it functions.
A rubber diaphragm inside eventually tears and it is no longer air 
tight. Normally a spring inside holds the diaphragm closed unless a 
vacuum is able to overcome it. 

The only markings on the diaphragm are "MB94 - 5" and "cFw 3"

I posted some photos if anyone would like to see the inner workings.

I was able to locate a used replacement air cleaner with a working
EEC valve but maybe someone can point out a replacement as these
are not being made anymore.
