Subject: RE: [T2] Points?

My vote would be for the more expensive points at the FLAPS. If you can wait
for shipping, a VW specialty vendor could probably provide the right points
with a cost vs. benefit balance.  With the FLAPS, err on the side of caution
unless you have additional info on the available options. BTDT

My local yocal flaps guy told me he had two different Bosch points sets. He
said one was beefier than the other and ran close to ten bucks and the other
was $3.50. Whats the dealio? Should I just go with the least expensive
seeing
that they are both Bosch points?
