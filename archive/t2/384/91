today i walked around the corner and the hispanic chopemup car dudes 
in the next warehouse were swapping truck frames from underneath two 
different boxes - one a 'taco vendor' type box, the other a phone 
company worktruck body. they were holding up BOTH with  2" x 2" 
cedar posts and a piece of angle iron!!!!!!
to make matters worse, the phone truck's cedar post was stuck on the 
end of a floor jack,,,, and the whole assembly was LEANING a good 
foot from vertical.
they declined my jackstands... 'we're almost done.'

these are the same guys who showed me how to put tires on rims using 
gasoline and a match!
