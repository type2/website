Subject: plug one, plug two

list,

some interesting reading about spark plugs:

http://www.shoptalkforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=46647

note the reference to the type2.com library.

i have never seen reference to the triple-electrode plugs in any "official"
source, but ray greenwood, the fellow who mentions the W7DTC, is one of the
most reliable sources on the shoptalkforums, and always has great, if
sometimes unorthodox, suggestions.

i just picked up a set of these W7DTC's to try out.
