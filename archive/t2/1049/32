Subject: Need exhaust manis for a 75 .18 FI

Hey gang;
 
If anyone has a set of good exhaust manis for a 75 1.8, please email me
offlist.  Mine are rotten at the flange and I need a set.  The U pipes are
bad too so I'm planning on reversing the manis and doing something different
unless someone has good U pipes too.  :)
 
thanks
 
Joe
