Subject: progressive boots

Hi,
Roadtripping through Oregon, I'm planning to work on a friend's bus in 
Bend, it is a Weber conversion t4 that the intake runner boots are 
rotted--can anyone tell me a local or internet source for these boots?  
Part number?  local import parts place suggestion in PDX or Bend would 
be excellent.

TIA,
Will A.

PS an old spark plug wire tip crumbled in my hand in a remote area, 
discovered it works fine to push the bare end onto the spark plug.  
hasn't run this great in a while!  guess it was failing for a while.
