Subject: Diagnostic help - engine stall and can't start for 1/2h 

Hi guys ,

I need to fix my Vanagon 83 for a friend which wants to go to the 
burning man.
Arrrhhh , its hard to give him my baby , but hey he a good friend. ;-) !
Anyway , more and more often when the engine stall for some reason 
(.i.e  I did not properly start on a sloppy  road),  the engine is very 
difficult to start again, I need to wait until the engine cool down to 
restart it (with no problem)
When I don't want to wait 1/2h (because I am stuck in the middle of the 
sloppy road or in the gas station !) , after 15min or so , its possible 
to start to engine with a lots of difficulty playing with the gas pedal 
and crank the engine for a long time. then very very  slowly the engine 
start to emerge again (eventually with some puf puf noise !, than the 
van works just fine.

Precision , I have no problem to start the van when the engine is cold


Any idea what it is , what should I do.

Thanks so much.

Chris
