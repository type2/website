Subject: Afm CO setting

Hi I just went to my regular car auto mechanic the other day and set the co
level while hooked up to his sunbeam exhaust gas analyzer.I just had a
complete overhaul at my local vw guys place and wanted to make sure it was
right.I had been having some minor drivabity problems(cutting out) and assumed
it was too lean.Anyway got the CO level set to about 3% at idle(below that it
started to search a lot at idle(betwwen 800 and 1000).On the way home I had
the cutting out problem again so I got him home and thought about it.After it
cooled off I checked the head temp sensor and was able to turn it by hand.My
rebuilder didnt get it in there tight enough.Anyway I tightened it up.
    Since I know the temp sensor affects the mixture,my question is ,Do I need
to go hook the bus back up to the exhaust analizer and reset It? Also I know
the spec is .2%-2% on a 76 bus,but where should I set it for the best
compromise between cool running temps and fuel economy?Id jsut a soon not
spend another 3500 for a rebuild for a long time so Ill lean towards setting
it to run a little cooler over fuel economy.So is there a sweet spot that will
help keep my head temps down without killing my fuel economy?
