Subject: What to look at next

Hi All, I am back from some vacation time (without my bus) and now have some
time to look at it again. It is a 1981 Vanagon. Starts and Idles fine but
when I give it gas or put it under load it sputters and stalls out. So far I
have replaced the fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel pressure regulator and the
coil. It has a Pertronix ignition. I did try to switch back to points but no
change in symptoms. It started doing this on a camping trip to Maine at the
end of July. As I was driving through Boston to get home 20 miles south it
sputtered once and then died a few miles later. I have also replaced most of
the vacuum lines, checked the s-boot for leaks (it's in good condition) and
taped up the cracks in the other small boot towards the rear of the engine
(FIF). Fixing the vacuum leaks did improve my idle but I still can't drive
it. It will rev up a few times from giving it gas and then starts to die
out. It will also die when trying to put it under load. Starting to get a
littler frustrated with it so if any one can offer suggestions of where to
look next it would be much appreciated.

Thank you all very much
-Jeff

P.S., I get the list in Digest format
