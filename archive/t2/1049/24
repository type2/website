1)  You need to remove the correct bolt for the upper side of the  
starter.  Take off the nut that Dan described; the bolt has a special  
head that locks against the starter body so you can't get it any  
other way.  And tighten the bolt you were loosening -- that one is  
for the bellhousing mount (there's two bolts), which supports a  
majority of the engine & transaxle weight.

2)  Yes, five wires.  Three ring terminals on the stud (one from the  
battery, one from the alternator, one for the rest of the electrical  
system) and two 1/4" quick-disconnects (one activates the solenoid,  
one telling the EFI that the starter is engaged).
