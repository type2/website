Subject: tire pressures

Here is a comments about tire pressure I have never heard before..
because we don't all run factory origninal tires with the same specs.. the
tire pressure listed on the door panel or the sidewall of the tire can not
always be trusted..

This seems to be a very good rule.
 a good guide (from a tire company engineer) is to compare cold pressure
with the pressure after at speed for 15 minutes.If the pressure goes up 3psi
you are just right; more than 3psi your starting pressure was too low, and
less than 3psi your starting pressure was too high.

I am going to give the bus a test run and see...
