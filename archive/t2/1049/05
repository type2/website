True! ... or you can use hemo stats or similar device... I use needle nose
vice grips a lot... make sure you remember to take them off when your done..
lol...    hmmm,, might not apply to a vanagon.. is the tank lower than the
FPR on them... I don't speak much vanagon.. sorry

Someone showed me a motorcycle petcock recently.. it has a vac line to it..
so.. no engine vac.. no fuel delivery...

I can see that being great when the engine isn't running.. but if you spring
a leak while it is running.. the petcock still gets the vac signal.. and
still fuels the fire... oh... only till the engine stalls.......  and that
may be better than not having it.

It was off a honda and was over $100 ... same threads as on a 72 ? thru 74
fuel tank.. but hard to adapt to a EFi tank or Vanagon
