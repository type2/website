There should be a slotted metal tab coming down from the upper ball
joint bolt/nut. Then there's a metal tab that holds the brake line
junction in the slot. This secures the junction between the metal and
rubber line. Without it I'd imagine that metal line would fail rather
quickly.

ps: if you're ever re-doing your torsion arms/ball joints don't forget
to replace the brake line mounts - its no fun realizing you forgot
after the job is "done".
