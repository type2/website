Subject: Re: [VB] tire pressures

Jamie,
That looks like a good test to me. The pressure change would be caused by an increase in the temperature of the air in the tire. If the tire is under-inflated the tire will get hotter than it should. If the temperature goes up enough to cause the pressure to increase more than 3 psi, the pressure is too low.
