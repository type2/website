Subject: Olympics Commercial VW Bus

Hey, I don't know if anyone else caught this... but there was a commerical I saw on TV yesterday for some bank. I don't THINK it was Bank of America, but it might have been. Anyway, it showed some guy with his family hanging out in his 1972 VW Bus (through the years, old family videos, etc...)

The commercial said:

"He has an Italian roadster, a British limo, a German luxury sedan... and the most prized vehicle in his collection... a 1972 Bus."

And then it shows his Bus in one of his garages. It then goes on to talk about investments, and whatever...

Thought it was pretty cool. I'm guessing this was on NBC?
