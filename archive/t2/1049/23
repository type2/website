there are a number of wires, and you appear to have gotten them.

there are two bolts holding the starter.

there is one bolt on the bottom that can be reached from under the bus

theres is also a LONG bolt that is part of the motor mounting system
on the top and hard to see.  this bolt if stock has a D shaped head
and is removed by taking the nut off the bolt from inside the engine
compartment.  it appears to be a motor mount bolt.

once pushed thru the starter should come off.

occasionally the gear is partially engaged and moving the flywheel (or
TC in an automatic) should cause this to pop free
