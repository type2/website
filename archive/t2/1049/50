Even when I'm sitting on a totally level ground, with no feet on any of the pedals, the car idles perfectly. Then, the second I tap the brakes (again, still just standing there not moving) the rpms increase dramatically.

While it just might be the booster, if you really want a conclusive 
test, unplug the booster from the engine and plug the hole going into 
the manifold.  Then press the pedal and see if it still does it.
