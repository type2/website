Subject: Re: Oil leaking from valve covers

I had, one time, valve covers that I could not get to stop dripping oil on
the heater boxes.  It turned out that the cork gasket was getting trapped
between the valve cover and one of the raised areas in the head that the
rockers bolt to.  Maybe those were wider than the norm or whatever.  I
noticed it when I had it off, there was a dented in area on the cork gasket.
Removed that and no more leak and no more burning oil smell in the cab!
