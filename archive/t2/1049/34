Subject: Oil Leak and Valve Cover Gaskets

I recently changed my oil and filter. As I went driving down the road to
pick up my in-laws, I noticed the smell of burning oil. I found it strange
since I haven't really had any burning or leaks since I started using Engine
Restore.

Come to find out after taking a look at the way the oil was leaking onto my
heater boxes that it was again coming from my valves. Last time I had this
problem, I found that the heat had warped the gaskets and caused them to
bend inward allowing for leaks to occur.

My question is, with the installation of new gaskets, can their "life" and
integrity be extended by adding a little Ultra Black (or Ultra Gold) into
the equation? I'm not sure how often you are supposed to change the valve
cover gaskets anyway, but it just seems that I am replacing them more
frequently than I should be... or am I replacing them right on time?
