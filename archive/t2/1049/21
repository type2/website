Subject: removal of starter

BlankOk, so I am attempting to remove the starter on my 79 bus with a 2 liter
fuel injected, manual transmission.
I crawl under, remove the wires from the solenoid, remove the nut on the
bottom housing of the starter (16mm) and then put the extension on the 15mm
socket and then backed out the 3 inch bolt from the top of the starter housing
fully.  I expected the starter to pop off like cracked pecan but NO!.
I leveraged with both arms to try and pop it loose but no success.  I can tell
that the bottom portion is loose because the housing does separate slightly
from the transmission.  There is something holding the top part VERY SNUGGLY!.
What is it?  This appears to be the factory starter.  There are no electrical
wires spliced and everything looks like someone has not got underneath and
started to really screw things up.  This is why I am asking for help.

My 2 questions are this:

1)    What do I need to do to get this starter off?

2)    Are there supposed to be 5 wires on the solenoid?


Thanks so much.
