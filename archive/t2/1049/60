Subject: Which Carb

I've got a 1776 single port engine in my 71 Westy.  The carburetor has never
worked well from when I got it.  It has leaked gas off-and-on around the
throttle lever, idling is awful, and every time the electric choke is
hooked-up it won't even crank.  The carb is an old 28PICT currently.

Question:  Which carb is best?

My other vehicles have 34PICT/3 carbs but they, of course, are dual ports.
Should I, could I, adapt the 34PICT/3 to the single port?  Should I rebuild a
28PICT (or one of the other 28PICTs I have laying around).  I have a two
28PICTs and one 34PICT in my shop I could possibly rebuild, but I need advice
on which way is best to go.

Thanks ahead of time for your help,

Michael in Montevallo
