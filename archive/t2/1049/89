Subject: Re: [T2] Afm CO setting

Anyone know whether the CO setting affects the flapper position or 
affects directly the voltage seen by the "brain"? I thought the CO 
setting is for the idle curcuit only and thus does not affect normal 
driving?- It is a bypass curcuit- the throttle screw determines how much 
of the metered air you let by, while the CO screw determines the 
leaness/richness of what you burn?

the spec is .2%-2% on a 76 bus,but where should I set it for the best
compromise between cool running temps and fuel economy?Id jsut a soon not
spend another 3500 for a rebuild for a long time so Ill lean towards setting
it to run a little cooler over fuel economy.So is there a sweet spot 
that will
help keep my head temps down without killing my fuel economy?
