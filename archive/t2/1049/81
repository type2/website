The canvas replacement top isn't that hard to find.  Busdepot.com,
GoWesty.com, etc... have them.  I bought me a new one and replaced mine but be
aware that there is a lot of differences in the quality of the canvas between
the types for sale.  Also, be sure to hold it up to measure it against your
top when you get it.  When I bought mine for my 71, I was actually sent the
wrong canvas for the later model Bay.

Replacement isn't that bad.  You may need a little help since you really need
to remove the top from the bus first and do that part first.  Then re-attach
the top and replace the strip that holds the canvas to the top.  The most
frustrating part to me was all those tiny tiny Philips screws that hold the
strip that holds the canvas to the bus top.

As far as the cot goes...

Are you talking about the small cot that fits over the front seats or in the
top of the bus?

I just removed my top cot and bought brand new canvas for it.  I have the
poles, mounting brackets, etc...

I also bought a front cot but the pole lengths will need adjusting.  If you
are interested in any of this stuff, email me off list.

If there is anything I can do to help just let me know.

Peace,

Michael in Montevallo
