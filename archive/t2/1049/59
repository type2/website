Subject: BRAKE BOOSTER, and fluid beware !

Ah yes, the memories of removing the booster on my 1971... brake fluid has a
real blan taste from what I remember.

Some things to think about before removing the booster:

1. have your steering free, so you can manipulate the tie rods, and get that
puppy out
2. Do not work under the booster during removal (see note below)
3. Hmmm... where does that "more than little brake fluid" I put in the
resevoir go... hmmm a little bit to pad wear, a (very) little that I can see
as leaks... but I'm using more than that... hmmm
4. OK... here comes the Sherlock Homes statement... it goes into the brake
booster (from the rotted small O-ring seal at the back of the master
cylinder). Don't believe me... work under the booster when you remove it and
you'll find out like I did !Michael J. WearyAMSOIL dealer ZO505009Virgin
