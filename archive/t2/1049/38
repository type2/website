Subject: Cleaning brake fluid from drums

The cylinder in my vans drivers side rear brakes has leaked. I'm going to 
bin the shoes and cylinder and clean everything else up. The question is, 
can the drum be cleaned ?  Will normal brake cleaner do the job safely ?

While I'm more interested in safety than cost, the drum isn't scored so I'm 
loath to chuck it if it can be saved.

cylinder ! :-(

Thanks
