Sometimes I suspect the answer to your questions is "no" and "yes".

One of the guys I work with sometimes sets the radio to their show on  
Saturday mornings .. and more than a time or two I've heard them give  
advice to callers that is downright *dangerous*.  If that's at all  
typical, I've gotta wonder how they haven't been sued into oblivion  
by now...
