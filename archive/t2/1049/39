Subject: Re: [T2] tire pressures

I took my camper for a drive today..  checked the tire pressure at 40 psi
all around.
I drove for about 15 min.. and checked the pressure and they had all
increased about 3psi

so.. I am thinking I might have the pressure almost correct.

Andy alerted me to a point I was missing,, and that is VW talks about
pressure rear vz front.. at about 3 / 4 ratio... based on weight ratio that
is about the same..

My camper has almost equal weight for front and rear axles..    that is why
I decided on 40 psi on front and rear..

tires say.. 1700 lbs at 65 psi
they have about 1100 lbs on them..  so.. 1100 / 1700 X 65 = 42   ... I
lowered that a bit.  to round it to 40psi

If I fully load this vehicle , I will have to increase the tire pressure to
about 53... I'll probably just go with 40 light load.. and 50 loaded...

I will try to do some infared and psi checks in the next little while..
tires still look now, no uneven wear..

Andy

When I calculated this first,,, I took into consideration Vw originally
installed tires with max weight at 40 psi ... and they recommended 40  psi
on
the rear,, and 30 on the front for fully laden vehicle

That is 100 percent inflation on the rear,, and 75 percent inflation on the
front...

then I used the same method to calc as you did.. but I threw in that 75
percent
factor for the front

Also.. i rounded the 47.8 psi up to 48 psi for the rear...
the front came in at 40 psi with the 75 percent factor

Looks like we agree on the rear at about 47 - 48 psi... but I still wonder
about
that 75percent ratio front to rear,,,,

You asked 2 questions.. Why do you have so much weight in the front? Or are
the
numbers reversed?
and you were interested in the year,, as I said in the original message ,,
my
camper is a 74 deluxe

The numbers are NOT reversed... I looked at them the same way...they do
looked
reversed..
 I should have included my conclusion on that in the original email..
When I first weighed the van,, it was 2182 lbs on the front,, and 2380 for
the
rear... 200 lbs heavier in the rear
this is loaded with my camping gear, gas and the driver...
then I weighed it as I headed down the road... with one more passenger in
the
front,, and 2 in the rear.
the front passenger weighs in at 200 lbs,, and the 2 in the back add up to
200
lbs total...[2 kids that weigh 100 lbs each...]
These numbers are guesses,, as I didn't weigh all the people,, they were in
the
camper when it was on the scale.. and the front got heavier than the rear...

Yes,, it appears as GVW is about 5268 lbs....

I had the chance to weigh my camper recently, so here is some info...
My 74 Westfalia Camper ....
Loaded, with the driver , and 1 passenger in the front,  about 400 lbs right
there !
2 passengers  in the rear... only about 200 lbs for both of them!

Scale Weight on Front:  2788 lbs......1399 lbs on each tire
Scale Weight on Back :  2480 lbs......1240 lbs on each tire
Total weight  5268 lbs

Tires:
Yokohama LT195/75R14  Load range "D"   M&S
1710 lbs max _at_ 65 psi


So,, if I did the math right,, I should put 48 psi in the rear tires.. and
40 in
the front tires when I have this much load in the camper....
