Subject: Vacum leak

Hi All,

Thanks everyone for your help in changing my fuel pressure regulator, it was
easy and so was replacing the pump. It is running better but still not
great. It feels like a vacuum leak somewhere. It will idle but when I give
it gas it starts to die after a second of reving and it has no power. I
checked all the vacuum lines I can see. When it died originally it was
backfiring and farting. Is there a vacuum line somewhere that is not
easily visible that could have come off?? Any other suggestions as to why it
is running like this? It is a 1981 Vanagon Westy and has been trouble free
for four years until now.

Thank You all
-Jeff
