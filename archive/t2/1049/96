Subject: Re: [T2] Afm CO setting

I guess what Im really looking for here is a guide to setting an afm that has
had the dial and spring on the inside fiddled with to the extent that its way
out of wack.My mechanics analizer displays rpm co co2 o2 hci and air fuel
ratio.If I get the co set at idle does that mean that the air fuel ratio
should be correct at driving rpm ranges? or are they not really connected?I
can rev the motor to say 2500 rpms and it will display the air fuel ratio and
all the other stuff.With no load what kind of air fuel ratio should I set it
at? I  would really like to get it set close enough that I dont burn my motor
up.
