Subject: Yakima Racks

Hey all:  Did some research on the archives regarding install of Yakima
"rain gutters" on the Bay Window pop top.

I did just that last night and then read with chagrin a post in the archives
that said if the poptop is not reinforced, it will crack under load.  I only
plan on strapping on two 40 lb Old Town River Otter Kayaks for a Tippecanoe
River trip this weekend.   Will that put undue stress on that 1979
fiberglas?

Any opinions appreciated.
