Hey Eric, lighten up man...

The reason that every few months someone posts to this list, The Samba,
FullMoonBusClub, VWVortex, and others about a commercial they have seen,
or what tires to put on their bus, or how to get heat in their bus, is
because every few months, if not more often, someone ressurects a VW
bus, sells it, and we have NEW MEAT in the Type 2 community
