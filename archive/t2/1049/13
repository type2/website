Subject: 1971 Piston retaining plates needed

Hey all,

So the PO changed my 69 drums out to 71 discs on the front which I have 
now rebuilt.  The only thing that seems to be missing are the piston 
retaining plates.  Does anyone know of a source for these new?  I can 
not seem to find them on any parts list.  Will I need to locate some used?

Another question.  Can I just use the brake hoses for a 71 to hook up 
the calipers or is there something special I need to make up?  The 
current setup has a short rubber hose and then a short metal hose going 
into the caliper and the whole thing just floats in space.  Seems 
destined to fail.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Stephen
