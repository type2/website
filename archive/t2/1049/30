Subject: Steering knuckle

Hey everyone,

I have a 69 bus with discs in the front that the PO added.

Does anyone know if there is away to tell what steering knuckle is on 
the front beam?  The one I have has a 12 and 8 and the vw logo.  I tried 
replacing the rotor/caliper with a 71 set and the caliper will not slide 
into place to engage the holes.  It looks to be off by maybe ~3/16.

Is it possible that the knuckle is from the 73-79 years and I have the 
wrong caliper/rotor?

Thanks,

Stephen
