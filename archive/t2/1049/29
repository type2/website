Hi Jamie,

I think that VW's tire pressure spec was intended to complement the 
suspension design and load capacity of the bus.

I've driven with overinflated car tires on my bus; it makes for stiffer 
sidewalls and less understeer, but it also makes the bus impossible to 
stop in wet conditions due to a much smaller contact patch gripping the 
pavement.

IF you want to "reinvent the wheel" (so to speak) and run with a 
non-stock choice of tire and rim then the aforementioned pressure rating 
is probably worth a try. Another option would be to consider adopting 
the pressure ratings that VW used on later Vanagons fitted with wider 
tires on 14" alloy rims and on 15" rims.

Happy Trails,
