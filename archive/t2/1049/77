I'm not sure about sources for new canvas, but if you have all the old
pieces, and aren't going for 100% originality, you can make your own using
the old pieces as a pattern. I had an old camping tent that I got free from
a friend since the poles had disappeared - I traced the old poptop canvas
pieces on that, sewed it up, and had a great canvas with HUGE windows, which
made things a lot cooler in the summer. Not original, but very functional...
