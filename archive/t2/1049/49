Subject: Brake Booster, can I buy new?

Hey guys,

     I'm pretty convinced now that my brake booster is shot. It's the original, and the second I apply the brakes, the engine REVS up at least an extra 1000 rpms. Even when I'm sitting on a totally level ground, with no feet on any of the pedals, the car idles perfectly. Then, the second I tap the brakes (again, still just standing there not moving) the rpms increase dramatically. 

I looked around, and I can't seem to find a brake booster available (new). Do these need to be rebuilt?


Thanks!
