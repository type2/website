Replacement isn't that bad.  You may need a little help since you really need

strip that holds the canvas to the bus top.

I agree - replacing the canvas is not all that bad, but it is tedious, and you should allow the better part of weekend to "git 'er done".



I really don't think you need to remove the top from the bus, and I think that makes the job unecessarily more difficult than it has to be. 
Only remove the top if there are other issues besides the canvas that would require you to do so.
I measured the canvas and marked centerlines front and rear, and made sure those lined up with the centerline of the bus.  
Begin stapling at the cenerline, then it is easier to make sure the fabic is evenly distributed on each side of the centerline.
Before you begin stapling, you will need to disconnect the support bars (rear in 68 to 73, front in 74 and up), and temporarily support the top with a 2X4 or something, so that you can position the canvas before you start stapling it to the wood tack strip on the underside of the top.










After that, I re-attached the support bars and played with the position of the bottom of the canvas under the screw-strip, so that the canvas was properly tight when the top is fully raised.  It took some fussing, but it came out nice, better than the original.  I did this without any help and it took about a day and half.
You don't want to rush this job.
