Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon pressure regulator

Yup.. as Dons pictures show.. the nut goes on the front of the tin.. the
starter side... front is the front of the vehicle...

best way to access the front of the engine tin is to slide under the right
side in front of the rear tire.. and look up by the starter... you'll
probably have to pop out the accordian flex tube for the heat ....

I like to drain the tank before I get into these jobs,, it only takes a few
minutes to do that and then you don't get a bath...  then install new hoses
while you're doing the fpr.. and you're good for another 5 years
