Subject: Cold Start Fuel Injector

I am just putting my engine back together again and performing checks on the
fuel injection system. All my fuel injectors (1-4) measure < 3 ohms across the
terminals, which I understand is within spec. My "5th fuel injector" for the
cold start valve, measures 4.2 ohms. What is the impact of this please, as I
know I have had problems with a cold start prior to taking the engine out, and
am wondering if this could be the cause?

Also, thanks to those for help on the stuck spark plugs, with all your advice,
I got them out successfully without stripping the threads.

I have a 1976 Type 2 Kombi, 2.0 litre.
