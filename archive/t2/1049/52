Subject: 78 convertible parts / question on steering column ????

looking for a reasonable place for parts for my 78 beetle convertible...
window scrapers... [inner rubbers ...outer rubbers with trim ] ...misc.rubber
steering parts...
 
question ???...not sure what goes here...under the gas tank where the end of 
the steering column connects to the upper U joint ...inside the tube where  
the steering column rides  there is a lot of play...there seems to be some kind 
of rubber bushing with something missing ?...giving the shaft play...is there 
some kind of brass bushing in the middle of the rubber to keep the steering 
shaft / column from having alot of play ???
and if so where can I get the part to fix the problem ??? 
 
I hope I have explained this properly...
 
any info will be  GREATLY APPRECIATED ???
