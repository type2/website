I should note that there was no load on the motor,just sitting in the shop
revving the motor with the throttle cable in the engine compartment.I assume
that under load there would be more vacuum therefore more fuel would get
sucked in.Once again Im probably wrong but this makes sense to me,but im a
mailman not a mechanic.
