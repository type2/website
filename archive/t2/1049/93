The pop top canvas I used on my 71 Westy came from Wolfsburg  West, and I got 
it about 10 years ago, or so.  If you are looking for an  exact match to the 
original, this is not it.  The color is not the original  yellow, so right off 
the bat you know this is an aftermarket piece.  It is  a tan color, sort of 
like the color of the cot canvas.  The fabric is more  supple that the original 
and of a different weave.  There are flaps on  the outside that cover the 
zipper area that are not on  the original. 
 
However, I think it is a good functional canvas and has some advantages  over 
the original.  The fabric, being more supple, is also more stretchy  and thus 
somewhat tolerant of installation oopses, which may not be the case  with 
original type fabric.  Even though the color is clearly not original,  I think it 
looks good as it somewhat matches the cot canvas. Those flaps over  the 
zipper areas help keep out the rain - this canvas has never leaked and has  endured 
some pounding rain storms.  The rear window has two zippers, so you  can 
easily open it part way from the middle - not possible on the original with  a 
single zipper - this allows for ventilation to be maintained during rainy  
weather without letting the water in.
 
I have been happy with this canvas and would recommend  it.
