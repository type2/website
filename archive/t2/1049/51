Subject: Re: Brake Booster, can I buy new?

Todd said: Hey guys, I'm pretty convinced now that my brake booster is shot.
It's the original, and the second I apply the brakes, the engine REVS up at
least an extra 1000 rpms. Even when I'm sitting on a totally level ground,
with no feet on any of the pedals, the car idles perfectly. Then, the second I
tap the brakes (again, still just standing there not moving) the rpms increase
dramatically.  I looked around, and I can't seem to find a brake booster
available (new). Do these need to be rebuilt? Thanks!

If yours is bad...... take it off and send it to:
