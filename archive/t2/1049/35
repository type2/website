Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Leak and Valve Cover Gaskets

I change my gaskets at every valve adjustment; so every 3,000ish miles.

They are inexpensive, no need to reuse them.
To keep them in place you can try a little wheel bearing grease on the valve
cover side only.

I'm not sure how often you are supposed to change the valve
cover gaskets anyway, but it just seems that I am replacing them more
frequently than I should be... or am I replacing them right on time?
