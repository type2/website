Hi,
Roadtripping through Oregon, I'm planning to work on a friend's  bus in 
Bend, it is a Weber conversion t4 that the intake runner boots are  
rotted--can anyone tell me a local or internet source for these  boots?  
Part number?  local import parts place suggestion in PDX  or Bend would 
be excellent.

TIA,
Will  A.

skinny type of clamps for them as the thicker clamps will ripp them   later
