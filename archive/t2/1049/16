Subject: custom or fab'd header

Hi All,

Is anyone aware of - particularly in the FL or GA area - of someone who
might be able to either fabricate or customize a header for a 79 2.0?

I have a hitch that is welded to the frame, and have been unable to find a
header that will allow a muffler to clear the hitch, but still have things
semi-hidden... and I'm only shy an inch or 2.

Thanks for any help.  Cheers, Mike
