what I have done for my radio circuit is use the ground in the key circuit
that the key buzzer uses to complete the circuit for another relay.

Using a standard 25 amp style bosch style single pole relay, run fused
always on power like fuse #7 to terminal 30 and to terminal 86, connect
terminal 85 to the key switch ground brown wire, and then connect your
accesories to terminal 87.

As soon as you put any key in the ignition, the relay gets it's ground,
the radio will come on.
I connect my CB radio and my FM radio this way.

This is reverse to most relay installations, in that you run power to the
coil all the time, and switch the ground using the ignition

It works the exact same as the aux heat fan in a 74 bus, where the lever
on the dash completes the relay coil circuit to ground.
