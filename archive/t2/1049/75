Subject: Re: [T2] fridge, how long last the gas reserve.

In my experience with my 84 Westfalia, using ONLY the fridge and not the
stove, I've gotten about 20 days on the average.  Sometimes it stretched to
23 days, sometimes it shrank to 18 days.  Part of the process is what the
outside ambient temperature is during the period and how "full" you keep
it.  I tend to keep the contents to about 75% capacity to allow some air to
circulate, especially with a battery operated internal fan.  Making sure the
open space behind the fridge is free of dust, cobwebs and running a computer
type muffin fan on the outside fins instead of the wimpy fan it came with
does make a difference, especially in warmer weather.
