Hey Eric, lighten up man...

The reason that every few months someone posts to this list, The Samba, FullMoonBusClub, VWVortex, and others about a commercial they have seen, or what tires to put on their bus, or how to get heat in their bus, is because every few months, if not more often, someone ressurects a VW bus, sells it, and we have NEW MEAT in the Type 2 community. Or someone finds a bus in a field somewhere, and has no idea that there is a whole supportive community of VW enthusiasts that are willing to help them get their bus back on the road. That new member, brother or sister, is JUST as enthralled with his or her bus as we were/are when we first got ours. Do you remember the rush whenever you saw a VW bus on the television, the movies, or while driving down the street? Well, thats the same rush that these people get. They love their bus. Do you love your bus? I imagine that you do, otherwise you would not really care what people post to this list that you yourself have
 already covered. Even if its old news to you, its actually NEWS to other people.

Someone posted to the fullmoonbusclub list last night about this commercial, and rather than respond with a samba-like attitude of "why do we have to go through with this" or "here we go again", I posted links to the New York Times article for the members of the FMBC. I even posted the link to the thread we had when this same commercial appeared during the World Series in October of 2007. 

I have seen some of the posts that you have made in the past, and you are *extremely* helpful to those that need it, and I for one applaud you for your knowledge and insight of the Type 2 that I dont have. Lets try to keep this list as *helpful* as possible, and if we can help someone, we do, when we cant, lets not even spend the excess energy to write something negative, or downputting. Lets get along as a community, because we are all in this bus together.
