Subject: My latest invention: Idle Speed Actuator (Busaru)

I wrote about a week back about my newest addition -
the ISA to compensate for no fast idle circuit
(removed air bypass valve on Subaru to accomodate
alternator move.) The sidebar to that was that I have
a microwave oven that likes an idle speed of around
2000r's when running. I have finished the installation
of the ISA and it works just fine. It will allow
opening the throttle to about one-third (and any point
below that), which will probably equate to over
4,000rpm, so I think it's gonna work out for fast idle
speeds!

Two additional photos of the ISA are at the end of my
Busaru album. Link is in my sig, below. -BaH
