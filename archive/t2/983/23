But remember, I said at higher speeds (50+ or so) the air temp going
into the fan approaches the outside temps within a minute or so. Which
shows that air ramming into the scoops keeps that radiant engine heat
diluted.  It's at slower speeds that the fan sucks in the hot engine
compartment heat since not as much air is being forced into the scoops.

What I want to try is taking something like metal clothes dryer ducting
and have it got from the scoop area to right in front of the fan intake.
You arent losing anything at high speeds, but maybe at low speeds, the
fan will be able to pull in "cooler" air. This may not work unless I
totally seal the fan intake. Maybe a metal bowl or a plastic bowl that
can handle the heat, drill large holes to attach the ducts. It'll be
cheap enough to try and I can see what the air temp is going into
fan.

I have thought about this too, but just using a mister. Look at
mistymate.com. Attach a small pump and have it mist water into the air.
...just a thought.
