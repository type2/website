   You might actually get the best return on that car if you can store it in 
a free (big
condition), safe (no deterioration), and also a place where you can at least 
weekly
take it out or at least drive it around and keep the seals (etc.) lubed and 
supple. 
Then sell it years from now when it's even older and rarer (even a common car 
gets
rarer as others dissappear from accidents, rust, etc.)
   The numbers you see that other cars are sold for are "usually" the result 
of much
more being spent on them to get them to that condition. Parts 
notwithstanding, your
labor should be included in the cost of the restoration...You could get a 
part time job
instead of restoring the car and I'd almost bet you'd make more than the sale 
of the
car returned...
    Has anyone actually restored a Bug or a Bus and made money on it? Please 
include
the total hours you "spent" on it...Think like a lawyer...Include the time 
spent looking
for parts/info as well as the actual hours with the wrench and the spray 
gun... ;-)
