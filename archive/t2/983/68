Subject: FI Wire Harness question

I have a 77 Westfalia Automatic that I bought awhile ago with the engine out
of it.  I am putting the engine back in and have two wires from the FI harness
(these two wires are coming from the plug but at not in the larger wire
bundle, they are by themselves)that I have no idea where they go.  The wires
have number's 12 and 40 on them.  I've looked in the manual and on the web but
have not found anything about these wires.  Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Kevin
