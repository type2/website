hmmm, I wonder???  I just put new AVP heads on my 78 auto tranny bus. Sat
was the maiden trip beyond the alley behind my house.  have pretty stiff
grade out and bus ran like a champ.  had more power on the grade than I
remembered, life was good.

  about 3 miles up the road, just going for gas, the engine started making
a terrible racket, in time with engine rpm......pulled over looked could
see nothing, nursed it home....  ran ok, as long as I kept rpm way down no
noise to speak of.  no apparent loss of power, nothing. but I could
"feel" the problem thru the bus.

  when I got home and the engine cooled down, (and I changed back into my
grubbies) I tried finding the problem, first thought was a flex plate bolt
worked loose.  no such luck. trace the problem to the area of #1 but
without taking engine down I can find nothing, need to check compression
and a few other things but at the moment am just drowning in self pity.

> happens.  pretty damn frustrating.

understatement, I feel your pain.

unless you have a known donor engine I would be leary of doing all that
work and getting nowhere, also you have an auto tranny,  the odds of
finding an auto tranny engine is slim and none. so you have the problems
of getting the engine prepared for use on an auto bus. setting endplay in
the field is not something I would relish, and if you swap out the
flywheel for the flexplate you will have to set endplay.

what about getting a two wheeled trailer and just putting the rear wheels
on the trailer, or even just removing the half shafts and towing it on its
wheels.  go VERY VERY slow and stay  of the interstates and you might get
home with no problems.  borrowing a hitch for the bus might be possible.

just some random thoughts, getting stuck on the side of the road is bad
enough, but having family along and going to important event is adding
insult to injury.....

take care
Bob
