I think I type too fast sometimes... here is a few thousand words in 
pictures...

the words from the webpage for the archives

The pair of GREEN corners are identified with the spring loaded silver 
buttons [nipples]
the pair of RED corners,,, installed closest to the camper , have the tubes 
with the holes. The holes are not visible in this picture. ****IMPORTANT*** 
the view you see here shows red corners are NOT 90 deg.. they are slightly 
smaller than 90 deg ...
The Red corners showing the holes to identify the red corner,, and the 
framing square,, shows that the corner isn't square. This allows the leg to 
be close to the drip rail of the camper,, and the foot to slope away .
This is the GREEN corner,, it has the silver nipple.. and a square corner.
interesting ,, I thought the leg tubes were the same length,, or the red 
would be longer maybe,, but the red is 90mm , the green is 95mm, not enough 
to worry about as the leg poles that slide into these are adjustable.
The rear vertical corner seam is about 1830mm. from the peg hole to the roof 
panel. The front seam has about 1760mm .....quite visible if you look at the 
roof panel on the side ... it has quite a taper to it.
Again,, the GREEN parts have the silver nipples.. the red have all holes.
Take notice of the blue panel on the side wall... part of the roof.. it is 
tapered.. from about 200mm on the right to 70 mm on the left, Making the 
tent taller on the camper side [right side in this picture]. It is hard to 
see in the picture, but that makes the water run off away from the camper.
