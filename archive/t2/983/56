Who cares if our motors are using 1930s technology, so is every other car built by a major manufacturer.

I like to tell people that I drive old cars because I am waiting for new technology, I figure that automobiles haven't been improved on since the introduction of electronic fuel injection, when an advancement is made I will buy, but as far as I am concerned most car "inovations" since 1963 have been attempts at increasing profits and selling a bigger piece of junk.

Ask yourself what the difference is between your bus and a new VW bus, really ask, don't say "such and such is better" think in specifics like "the dash is out of a softer plastic" and ask yourself if you really need these differences or if you could fix up your old bus to have the differences you NEED for much less than the extra $40,000 to buy the new VW.

Why do people feel the need to buy new cars every 2 years, really ask the question.

Somebody that I carpooled with asked me if I thought it made sense to buy a new hybrid from an environmental standpoint, I pointed out that the evironmental damage created by the disposal of my current car and the manufacturer, and delivery of a new car were far worse than my barely worse mileage and a few drops of motor oil, my car exists, if I go buy a new one it gives the car companies an excuse to put one more car on earth.

I have a friend that is a Chrysler Master Technician, he also works on Toyotas at a Chrysler/Toyota dealership, he believes that the media blasting SUVs and saying that there is a trend towards new fuel efficient cars is simple propoganda to get people to trade in the SUV they bought 2 years ago, in 2 years the media will say that the trend is sweeping to new SUVs that get better mileage than the ones popular in the lates 00's and everybody will trade in their little car for a guilt free SUV, and then gas will go up again........ and the machine will keep turning and I will still be driving my old bus.

I am going to put my soap box away now, but I will keep it handy just in case.
