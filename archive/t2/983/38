Subject: RE: [T2] Bilbusses? Busboards?

From a lot of the photos on theSamba, Splittys were all painted up,
especially the panels in the 50's and 60's. Our generation is just a decade
too young to have seen the old marketing stuff.

Probably the real reason are Bays are soooo cool and are still plentiful,
where the splittys are soooo cool as well but "antiques".

An Allstate agent using his bay as advertising. I'm seeing more and
more businesses painting up their busses for advertising. I don't
recall splitties getting this treatment... Is this something unique to
bays?
