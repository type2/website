I will admit that I got tired of this topic several times, I followed along at times and then avoided it for a while and then caught back up at other times, now that it is all over I would like to see a full report on what happened, short as possible and to the point, so I can refer to it when I find myself in the same place and so others can do the same.

The first time my bus quit it took me 4 days to get it running and there was barely anything wrong, it can be frustrating, but I learned a lot, and much of it required me to undo several things I had done in the first 15 minutes after it quit.
