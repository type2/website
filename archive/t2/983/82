Subject: Re: [T2] FI Wire Harness question

Kevin asked:


I have a 77 Westfalia Automatic that I bought awhile ago with the engine out of it.  I am putting the engine
back in and have two wires from the FI harness (these two wires are coming from the plug but at not in the
larger wire bundle, they are by themselves)that I have no idea where they go.  The wires have number's 12 and
40 on them.  I've looked in the manual and on the web but
have not found anything about these wires.  Any help would be appreciated.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

If they are the two wires all by themselves that come out of the EFI harness just after it bends towards the
engine below the air cleaner but before the AFM.... disregard them. They go nowhere on USA buses.
