Subject: Engine vacuum

I'm suffering from low engine vacuum.  I get about 14-15" at idle.
I have replaced intake manifold gaskets, fuel injector seals (and
injectors), the 4 intake hoses (sleeves...tightened down with
wire ties). I've checked the S pipe and I've wrapped all my rubber
hoses with silicone tape and tested them for leaks.

I've adjusted my valves too. Man, they were waaay out of spec.
Each valve was anywhere from no preload to 1/2 turn. They are
all 1.5 turns now. Engine running MUCH smoother and quieter.
The biggest change was my CH and oil temps. If I stay under 55 mph
with around town driving, my CH temps rarely reach the 400F mark.
My oil temp used to get up to 240F. Now they get up to 220F and
take a long time to get there.  I've got to still have a vacuum
leak somewhere. I should have 17-18" of vacuum.

I may plug up my brake booster hose and see if that makes a diff.

Any other things to check?
