Subject: it lives, sort of

well in the continuing saga of trying to get my van back on the road (78
2L auto tranny) AVP sent me a replacement head and got it installed this
morning, bus cranked and fired. and even ran, misfires terrible and
running rough but best I can tell it is actually running on all 4 cyl and
doesn't need starter fluid etc.

now considering how I've putzed with it the past month it may take that
long to get it tuned back up, but at least now I know what I'm working
with, the not knowing was driving me whacko...(whacko is a very technical
term) still don't know why it is misfiring but that is just step by step
thru the trouble shooting manual..

thanks to all the folks who were trying to help, strange how a damaged
valve would seal one time and give me a good compression reading, then the
next time it would be zip.....  but once I had it out and knew what I was
looking for it was apparent...

now the drudge work of putting back together what once was a nice running
bus......

thanks

Bob
