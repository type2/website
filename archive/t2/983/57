Let's  make a list:

- 1500cc sewing machine
- reductions boxes
- no  sliding door
- small gas tank
- too many windows for proper signage  :-)
- 1950's safety rated

The baywindow is a superior commerical  vehicle. :-) Check it  out:

hey richard    nothing wrong with the 1500cc motor if fact  most are now 
1600cc  and really might be a better motor than the  type4,   I like redux boxes, 
things will climb like no tommorrow,  sliding door was first offered on a 
split, small gas tank still got 250 miles  between fill ups,  very few windows on 
a panel, and everybus made was 1950  safety rated even bays.    I even have 
the corgi toy that has the  bug painted on the side of a split bus,   Your list 
isn't holding up  too well :)   later  mark d
