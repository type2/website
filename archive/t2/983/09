Subject: Re: [T2] Using smoke to find vacuum leaks

Using a smoker, Why not leave the engine off and find a way to attach a 
shop vac cleaner hose to the airbox, say at the s hose connection- these 
have variable speed and can be reversed to create positive flow-   My 
daughter has super ears and can "hear" sucking air sounds ....
