Yeah, I tend to agree with Jason. That said, there is BIG money to be made in carefully restoring a few select, rare models... but they are becomming harder and harder to come by.

What your bug is worth NOW depends a lot on how bad, or how good it's condition is in. Does it run? If you can drive it around, that's a HUGE positive... even if the buyer intends to completely replace everything anyway, it gives them a good working foundation to build off of. A running / driving car is probably worth around $1,000 bucks. If it doesn't run, and has significant rust, it's probably worth, at best, $500 in it's current condition.

Completely restored, you could probably get 6-10 grand for it (if it was absolutely immaculate).


But... here's the thing. If the car is a particularly rare model, I'd suggest saving EVERYTHING you take off. But, you could probably restore the car fairly well... to the point that it LOOKS good, and runs and drives well, with a new paint job, for about 3 grand. Seat covers, door panels, interior pieces are all very cheap. Door seals and all that stuff, also cheap. The body work will be the most difficult, and you'll want to teach yourself how to fix it, or the cost will immediately double. When all is said and done, you could probably sell it for around 4-5 grand.
