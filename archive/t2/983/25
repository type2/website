Subject: quasi-Friday material

	Tenuous bus content  -  may need a smidgen of Friday excuse
	The accusation that our motors are mid-1930s design is heard 
from e.g media celebrity Clive 'Dog & Lemon Guide', but is 
essentially misleading because of coure Porsche & VW improved design 
& construction for 4 decades.  (They then lost the plot, resorting to 
water cooling & other blunders.)
