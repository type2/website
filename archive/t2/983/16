Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Window Door Panel Drawing

That's something I've always wanted to do... Get schematics for all
the panels. I suck at drafting (took a year of it in high school
before CAD came along) so I wouldn't be the right person to do it.

But I'd be happy to bring my bus along and let someone who knows what
they're doing take the measurements off my panels!
