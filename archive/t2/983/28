Subject: Got insurance settlement - Need new bus NOW!!

Alrighty then, I have finally come to an amicable
settlement with the teenagers insurance company who
crashed my 72 Westy. So now I am looking for a new bus
near the midwest. Prefer 68-71 Westy but will consider
all!! Would like to have one that is road-ready with a
decent body. I have up to $7500 to spend (although I'd
rather not go that high)  I am near Cincinnati Ohio
and will travel up to 8-10 hours for the right
deal...So whatcha got for me?!?!
PEACE! John Baker
