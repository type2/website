this is pretty obviously something "Banging" not an exhaust leak, and
there is no loss of power...  easy enough to do just don't understand the
rationale.

that is why I am confused about this noise.  reason I thought it was a
torque convertor/flexplate bolt..  it is very rythmic in time with engine
(at location of #2 TDC) every RPM, I can sometimes feel it when turning
crank by hand. other times not. the noise comes and goes (off - on)
either is there or isn't and it is very very loud.  sounds like something
attached to crankshaft is hitting something. happens when on gas with
load, and then back off.

remember this is an automatic. so can't push in clutch, but it happens in
any gear and when parked out of gear. I am confused as to what it could
be. very much sounds like something banging and not really sounding like
deep in the engine, and yes it can be felt while it is happening...
