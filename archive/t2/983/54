Bob,

Bob,

I assume you mean the brand MSD.

If so, I had the same thing happen to me with an almost brand new MSD
Blaster II coil, it failed after a very short use. The reason was a constant
undervoltage from a bad alternator and being mounted at an angle.

You have to get the "high vibration" unit Part Number 8222 with a 0.8ohm
ballast resistor. They only offer the resistor with the Blaster 2 coil PN
8203, so you can go down to your FLAPS and get one instead.

FYI to everybody, using a MSD Blaster style coil or some newer Bosch Blue
coils without a resistor burns up pretty much everything except a crane and
Compufire. The Pertronix is at risk and HotSpark and stock points simply
melt or burn up.

Thrilled to hear you are back on the road! I have been pondering your
situation the since it came up.
