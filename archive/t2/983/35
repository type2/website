Subject: font of knowledge, FI, injector trigger???

the continuing saga of trying to get this 78 2l engine running again...

have been going very methodically thru the EFI trouble shooting guide.

what "appears" to be the problem is the injectors are only intermittently
getting the trigger signal to fire, when they get the signal the engine
runs, when they don't it doesn't.

ok, so "Why"???

on pg 11 of the manual I get to "no triggering impulse from coil terminal
1"

"test light does not flicker" when connected to term 1 of control unit.

I get the impression the light should be off and flicker on.  but it is on
and does not flicker off or anything else.???

.?? should light be on?? or off with ignition on but not operating starter

so it says check wire between term 1 coil, & term 1 of ECU.   well that
checks out, the light never goes out??

then says

.breaker not adjusted or defective.  ??
.condenser shorting to ground.  have tried 3 different condensers.
.coil defective, have tried 2 different coils.

also it is happening intermittently ..

???????

also there appears to be an error in the troubleshooting manual.

on pg 53 about 1/3 way down page under "trouble in ignition system" it
says;

."suppression condenser incorrectly connected on terminal 1 instead of
terminal 15"     shouldn't that be the other way round?????


thanks
Bob
