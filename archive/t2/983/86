So I got the engine/tranny pulled from my single cab and was going to
install it in my other truck when I find that some (-at-)#$%%^ has CUT OFF the
engine brackets off the frame. WTF! IS this supposed to be some kind of mod?
So the question is, can you buy some kind of aftermarket engine bracket that
will bolt to the frame (Hah, fat chance)? I don't have a welder to cut off
the brackets from the other truck and weld them to this new one. Options?
Miracles? I'm so running out of time here. Insurance fraud is looking good
about now.
