When I was in High School, splitties were cheap. Heck, I bought one
with a dead engine and perfect body for $200 once. Sold it for $500
minus the engine which I gave to a friend with a baja.

I really don't remember seeing them used the way bays are used now. I
do understand the logo'd ones seen on the Samba. But those were
(usually) done while the bus was relatively new. Not decades old...
