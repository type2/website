Nathaniel,

I hear you. I constantly come across hacked up firewalls in late model buses
for aftermarket A/C compressors. Funny thing is you don't have to hack up a
bus to install a compressor. Oh well.

Do you have photos of the good brackets, cut brackets and your engine cradle
(moustache bar)?

I might be able to come up with something for you in my fabrication shop and
UPS it to you.

There is enough room to run a modified bracket to compensate for the cut
mounts. The Frame has three very strong bolts meant for a factory hitch.
They are almost directly above the factory mounts, on the outside of the
frame.

I have no idea why someone would chop the mounts off. Unless they tried to
shove a Type 4 motor or a Corvair motor in the Single Cab. Has the interior
of the engine compartment been chopped up as well?

Pictures speak a thousand words on this one.

So I got the engine/tranny pulled from my single cab and was going to
install it in my other truck when I find that some (-at-)#$%%^ has CUT OFF the
engine brackets off the frame. WTF! IS this supposed to be some kind of mod?
So the question is, can you buy some kind of aftermarket engine bracket that
will bolt to the frame (Hah, fat chance)? I don't have a welder to cut off
the brackets from the other truck and weld them to this new one. Options?
Miracles? I'm so running out of time here. Insurance fraud is looking good
about now.

Nathaniel
