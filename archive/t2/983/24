When I was staioned at Vandenberg AFB in Lompoc CA there was a muffler shop
that took a dual quiet pack bug muffler that just barely touched the back
bumper of my dblcab and cut and welded the pipes to my liking.  It really
wasn't a difficult task.  AND, it only cost me a six pack of beer.  This was
my kinda muffler guy, works for beer.  This was in 2000.  That muffler is
loooong gone.  I moved to Florida and the humid salt air took it's toll, on
more than just the muffler.  I have a single pipe on there now and every so
often I spray it down with Extend rust converter.  Seems to work....or at
least it makes it black again.
