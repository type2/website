a few years ago.. I worked on a 77 that had the same issue.. I think Karl 
helped me out.. I forget what the answer was tho.. doh!

The only single wires I can think of.. that don't have a plug that fits 
something unique .... are:

2 wires close together.. a single ,, and a double..  they go to the ground 
terminals under the air distributor body.
they are not long out of the harness..

1 single wire,, long lead out of the harness.. it goes to the ignition coil 
, points terminal. #1

the above wires have regular 1/4" spade terminals on them

the rest of the wires in the harness have unique plugs

4 fit the injectors  actually 5 ,, one near each spark plug , and one on the 
air distributor
1 fits the AFM
1 for the thermo time switch
1 for aux air valve
1 double relay
1 resistor bank

maybe the egr, or throttle valve switch, or microswitch.. depending on the 
year of the engine harness.. which may not match the body year... PO's do 
change things.

this picture shows,, 12 for an altitude compensator,, optional.
and 40 is for the resistor/injectors... and should be in a bundle..
