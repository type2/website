Subject: exhaust leak

Well, I feel pretty stupid.  I've had an exhaust leak problem lately and a friend of mine took a look and noticed that my hangers were just hanging.  No bolt even attached.  He took a board and prised up on the muffler and pipes and, wham, the sound went away.  So I bolted it back up.   But here's the thing, I've had some leak there for over 8 years and never knew it.  I just thought mine ran a little louder than others because of the old muffler.  Recently it got worse or I would never have checked for an exhaust leak.  Now it's singing like a Singer, so quiet that I can barely hear the engine.  It's eerily quiet.  It's going to take some getting used to.  Almost like having a new engine in there!  She's really running great.   

Have a great weekend, guys and gals.  Cheers....KR
