Subject: Bay Window Door Panel Drawing

Does anybody have a computer drawing of the bay window front foor panels?  

IGES, DXF, DWG, SLDDRW?

I want to cut out new wood panels with all of the required holes on the CNC routers at work.

Thank you,

JM

Can somebody send me a link to the European company that sells custom bus cabinets, they had a very cool website and cool design, i wanted to share it with the ID guys on my team at work.
