Do you have any pictures of your jack? I've been trying to get an idea for
something to make my Atv jack adjustable like a tranny jack or maybe at 50
bucks its just easier to buy a transmission jack.

  I use a low transmissin jack.  it seems to have the advantages the ATV
  jack doesn't in that it has wheels and it also has some adjustments for
  positioning once raised. allows angle to be changed and some minor side
  to side adjusting.  I have a small harbor freight one that needs to be
  cranked up works ok (even have a seat that fits on top and when not
  dropping engine I have variable height rolling seat to work in engine
  compartment more comfortably)
    however I think I would prefer the hydraulic version over the crank
  version and in the near future I plan on getting a better version at a few
  more $$$ but the Harbor Freight one I have that I got for about $50 has
  made removing those  big type4 engines so much easier, and I'm usually
  working alone so I gotta have that thing under control.  I made an engine
  support that I bolt to the top of the jack for a more solid base for the
  engine to sit on.
