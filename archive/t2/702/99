Subject: CHT lead length question

Just add a few feet of the approximate gauge lead wire to the 15 foot leads.
You can test your work simply by using jumpers on the short lead from the
thermo couple at the spark plug.
You'll see it makes no difference that you added the extra 2 feet.
About the only thing to watch out for is to be sure not to bundle the sender
wire in with the existing VW wire bundle, the current in the VW system flow
will cause a false reading in your gauge.
