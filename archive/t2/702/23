I received my order of Koni adjustable shocks today.  Thanks to a what, 
a reverse "perfect storm"? of a day off work, wife at work and baby 
asleep I was able to get them installed almost immediately (took 55 mins 
including cleaning the hubcaps).  I didn't have a chance to really test 
them out but from the run up the street and back, I can tell the ride is 
not as harsh as before (KYB Gas-adjusts on all four corners).  The Konis 
have absolutely no pressure in them at all and my KYBs, despite being 
around 7-8 years old and 80k miles still felt like they had as much 
pressure as when they were new (they may not be the best shock on the 
market but they are durable!).  As a result my bus sits a bit lower now, 
which I don't particularly like but I'm willing to sacrifice that for  
better ride and handling.  I currently have them set to full soft but 
will probably stiffen them up as the bus felt a little floaty.  In case 
others weren't aware, the adjustability is only for rebound - bump (or 
jounce) is preset and cannot be changed except by revalving at the 
factory.  If only they made the D/A (Dual-Adjustable) Yellows for busses 
- they are separately adjustable for bump and rebound and can be 
adjusted with a small screwdriver without dismounting the shock!  Plus 
I'd rather have yellow shocks than red... but I'll take what I can get.  :-)

Thanks to the Bus Depot and especially Richard Atwell for making this 
happen.
