Hi gang,

Thanks for all of the great replies on our cross country trip planning 
(what would you do with $1300?).  Rachel and I are still sifting 
through the replies and are even more excited to hit the road.  Which 
leads to...

With the sale of the old SAAB came its nice Blau CD player.  I was 
surprised that it didn't fit the opening in the dash (I thought DIN was 
DIN?).  I guess the standard has changed.  Any advice/caveats for 
enlarging the opening?  For those that have done this, does the 
standard, short metal cage that slides into the dash opening provide 
enough support for the stereo?  Any clever support strategies?

I was surprised not to find stereo install instructions in the T2 
Library.

Thanks,
joe and rachel broach
