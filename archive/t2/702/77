Subject: Baltic Birch Plywood Source(s)

I was looking for a "local" source (ie, within 100 miles) of baltic birch plywood to replace the
front headliner on my '69 Westfalia.  I found this appropriately named website:

http://www.woodfinder.com/index.php

You enter the kind of wood that you are looking for and your zip code.  In my case, I found a
place in Indianapolis that sells 1/8" baltic birch in 5'x5' sheets for $15 a sheet.  

Hopefully this will help someone else in their search as well...
