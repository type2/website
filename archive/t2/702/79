Subject: CHT lead length question

Does anyone on the list know the total length of the VDO CHT sender lead
including the extention that run up to the dash? Obviously this question
refers to the gauge made for use in the bus. Thanks. Basically I'm looking at
the total length from the sensor ring to the gauge.
