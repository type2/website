Just moved my parts stash. I have a '78 too. My a/c unit (uninstalled) is totally separate too. All under dash bolt on. You could do it but it would be redundant. HOWEVER I would LOVE to know how to create a flapper to keep the cooled air from back flowing into the heater... How were you going to do this Wayne? 

Anybody got a good design for a passive flapper? I want to use it in a heater bildge blower upgrade and my fan will go before the heater box. So far the only design I have on my mine is duplicating the flappers in the original aux fan...
