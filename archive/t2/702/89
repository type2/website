Subject: Fuel Injection

I am considering trying to gather parts for a fuel injection system to install
on my bus next year. Is their anything special I should know about before I
buy parts. Like what years will work on a 1973 1700 cc engine? I have seen
some on the samba that came of a 79, buy I am thinking this will not work.
Will al system that was made for an 1800 cc engine work? Anyone got a system
that they want to sell that will work on a 1700cc engine? I do not need a
working cpu since I am going with Megasquirt, just need everything else.

Thanks,
Corbett
