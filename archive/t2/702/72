I mentioned to my wife as I walked out the door this AM:

'Wife, since the original hose lasted over 25 years, why do I want to 
replace the
hose with  something that's going to last 50-60 years??'

And the wire reinforced 12 mm hose  is a bit more expensive.  Bel-Metrics 
quoted me a meter price on the basic 12 mm wrapped hose at $10.57/meter, and 
the wire wrapped hose at $22.85/meter.  I foolishly paid Wurth $14.60/meter 
for the basic wrapped 12 mm vacuum hose from Wurth, and they foolishly sent 
me the more expensive wire reinforced hose.

Well, Wurth agreed to take it back, no cost to me...  So although Wurth is 
more expensive than Bel-Metrics, I guess they stand by their service.

BTW, I did order some 100 copper coated exhaust flange nuts [M8x1.25 12mm 
across the flats] from Bel-Metrics.  I was looking FOREVER for a supply of 
these copper coated exhaust flange nuts.   The guy at Bel-Metrics was even 
kind enough to offer that the M8x1.25 13mm were about $8 more that the 12mm! 
  So I really feel comfortable with paying some $36 + S&H for these  (top 
lock??) copper coated exhaust flange nuts.

Yes, it's true that Bel-Metric does not sell to the public, but when I told 
the customer agent that I was a private person, he processed my order.  [It 
pays to act dumb sometimes; for some people, it comes naturally.]
