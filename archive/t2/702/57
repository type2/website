Subject: 12 mm hose wrapped & wire reinforced

I got 5 meters of 12 mm wrapped vacuum hose from Wurth.

I notice that this hose is metal reinforced.

Did Wurth send me the wrong hose??  I cannot find the 12 mm hose on their 
site anymore

Here is a page from Bel-Metrics.  Bel-Metrics said the wire reinforced hose 
is nowhere available!!  And they quoted me an astronomical price for it...

I plan to return the 5 meters of 12 mm wrapped wire reinforced hose to 
Wurth, UOD.
