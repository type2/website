Subject: wiring... last post

<sigh> 
1st- we are talking type2's not boats.. many differences in many
different areas.

2nd- in all posts regarding splicing with solder the use of shrink
tubing
is also talked about ("the connection shall be so located or 
supported as to minimize flexing of the conductor where the solder 
changes the flexible conductor into a solid conductor.")

3rd- when I recieved my NASA soldering certification many moons ago
It was taught that stress relief for ANY kind of connection is required
for MIL spec work. Specifications which should work for a bus. Splicing
wires would be regarded as a "field repair" and solder was the method
of choice. 
  I've been burnen solder for 30+ years and when it comes to CARS I
pick
solder over mech splices.. one works the other doesnt(as well).. If you
pull a
factory harness apart you will find soldered splices .. if any.
  Ive been on this list for a while now.. when the splitty Volks and
the bay Volks went to their respective lists it calmed down a lot.. 
Splitty Volks are less tolerant of less than "perfect methods". As the
years have gone by I have noticed the Bay owners tolerance fading.. I
see someone ask a question on wiring and .. along with some others I
give them an answer.. One other person answered with " I use wire nuts"
which prompted a caustic response.. that poster.. as far as I know
didnt
offer up his method.
  That method may be what is within his level of expertise and also may
fit for someone else.. not everyone solders.. why is a wire nut not as
good as a crimp splice?
  Ladies and gentleman I invite you to watch any of the now popular
bike building or car building shows.. the boys/girls that they bring
in for the sparky work solder. They dont go down to pep boys and by
a box-O-splices.
  How this whole marine spec thing got introduced I havent figured out
yet.. as if cars were to be required to be built to marine
specifications.. you wouldnt want to pay the price!
  In closing.. I'm getten to old an cranky for this shit. I have no
tolerance for lack of tolerance anymore. :-) To all you "oldtimers"..
I learned alot.. it's been good. Karl ure da best! 
  See ya on the road someday.. hopefully not on the shoulder!

 From the Electrical Standards & Recommended Practices For Small Craft:

E-9.17.12.8 Solder shall not be the sole means of mechanical connection

in any circuit. If soldered, the connection shall be so located or 
supported as to minimize flexing of the conductor where the solder 
changes the flexible conductor into a solid conductor.


I don't know much about Type 2s, but I have spent a lifetime with 
sailboats,
