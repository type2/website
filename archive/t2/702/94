I'm the "trollee" who mentioned using wire nuts- The notion that 
something can slip under these and casue a short display ignorance in 
their proper use; twisting wires together well and then snipping it down 
to a short exposed stub that the nut will easily cover.  The parallel 
wires under the nut should be tied together to provide strain relief.
    I use these mostly in applications where the wiring may have to be 
replaced- as it is superior to the "twist and tape over " methods some 
may use.    Example may be when a radio connector is installed; all the 
speaker extensions are wirenutted with strain relief (all wires made 
parallel and tied together with all wire nuts at one end) and then tied 
up under the dash.  This can be used also for failed crimped on 
connectors; I keep wiring from scrounged junkyard harnesses with good 
connectors on one end; these can be temporarily nutted to the cleaned 
butt end of the broken wire.  Example: when the temp sensor wire end 
broke.  I personally don't feel that the "U-squash-it" connectors are 
that good on copper ends, as they can oxidize and conduct poorly.  For 
joining larger gauge wiring I like the connectors that have a slotted 
bolt at each end that squashes into the wiring.  A good example is the 
battery terminal that has a quick release cam tightener at one end and a 
hole for the cut battery cable at the other with a huge slotted bolt to 
grip it.  It is easy to include an accessory wire under this.
