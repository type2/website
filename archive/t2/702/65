I was kind of holding off because like Karl says, it varies. Ideally
you wouldn't want over 220, but 235 can be common, and it can be hard
to keep under 265 on hot days. I would let it rest if it gets over
that. At 280 I experienced thermal breakdown of the oil using
Valvoline VR-1 racing oil. Cylinder head temp can be more critical
than oil temp because you can have good oil temp and ruin a head.
