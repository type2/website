Subject: Re: [T2] CHT lead length question

I suppose if you lengthened the Lead Wire Harness, the CHT Gauge would
have to be re-calibrated, as the reading is dependent on the length of
both the Lead Wire and Thermal Sensor Wire.  I've never run a CHT in a
68-79 Type 2 myself, but I've known others that have, but they never
mentioned any modifications they may or may not have made.  My father
& I ran one underdash on a 67 Dlx 21 Window 25 years ago, but no mod
was made to the Lead Wire Harness.  Maybe it was just right in length
for how we did it.
