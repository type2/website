Subject: cabinet door molding

I'm trying to source the molding similar to the door molding used on
camper doors. This is the stuff that goes on the outside of the door
around the edge and has a "spur" that actually covers up the gap
between the door and cabinet. Here is a pic of the molding

anyone know where I can purchase some? I have come up dry so far. This
is not the T-molding used on edges.
