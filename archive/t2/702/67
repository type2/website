I was kind of holding off because like Karl says, it varies. Ideally
you wouldn't want over 220, but 235 can be common, and it can be hard
to keep under 265 on hot days. I would let it rest if it gets over
that. At 280 I experienced thermal breakdown of the oil using
Valvoline VR-1 racing oil. Cylinder head temp can be more critical
than oil temp because you can have good oil temp and ruin a head.

yes of course this is my next vdo gauge i will buy.... my mechanic friend has shown me that the oil temp and head temp are very important..

as soon as i got the extra 100 bucks i will have me one of those head temps as well then that will keep my fancy till i can get another one like maybe oil pressure etc....

the head and oil temps are the most sufficent to have.....

even though the oil temp isnt that high the head can be,,,,

dont forget the age of these vehicles..... they need rest every now and again on hot days and long trips,....they'll love you more for it,,,

peace
