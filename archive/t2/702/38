Richard:

I read with keen interest your post on the Samba regarding the Dakota 
Digital gauge.  I'm seriously considering this option, but I have some 
questions:

you wrote:**********************

  If you purchase a new 14mm ring terminal or re-use your VDO terminal, 
buy a suitable length of k-type thermocouple from your local 
electronics surplus for 50 cents/ft. you be in CHT Nirvana for only a 
little more money than the VDO setup but for a lot more value.
*************************

What exactly is the k-type thermocouple cable?  The VDO sender comes 
with a very stiff fiberglass insulated wire extending from the ring 
terminal approximately 1 foot in length to a connector.  Then from the 
connector to the gauge is another type of plastic insulated wire.  
Which (if either) of these are the k-type thermocouple cable that you 
refer to?

Are you saying that I should run the k-type thermocouple all the way 
from the sender to the gauge?

Since the Dakota gauge uses as VDO sender, can I use my existing VDO 
wiring all the way to the gauge?

Thanks,

Tim
