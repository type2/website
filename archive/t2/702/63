Subject: Passed CA smog, back on the road

Hey gang,

My old 76 miraculously passed CA smog with flying colors and is now registered
and back on the road after too long a time.  I have also just acquired DSL, so
will probably be reading and enjoying more of your posts again and hopefully
popping in now and again myself.

Good to be with you all again,

Billy
