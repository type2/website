I've had a few inquiries so I'm sending the reply to the list...

I originally found the Eastern Technology E2A leakdown tester through Chief Aircraft:

http://www.chiefaircraft.com/cgi-bin/air/hazel.cgi?client=53673911&action=serve&item=/Aircraft/Tools/CompressionTester.html

This is the address of the company that made it:

http://easterntech.com/e2a.html

Because this is an aircraft gauge it's equipped for an 18mm plug by default and therefore you have to purchase the 10/14mm adapter for it. I asked Eastern if I could buy directly from them and just get the hose made up for a 14mm plug in the first place and they said they could do it. Their price:

$59.25 gauge
$7.50 COD (they can't take credit cards because they don't normally sell direct)
+ UPS ground

They might even agres to you sending them a USPS money order.

Even with COD it's still cheaper than going through Chief. Call (860) 528-9821 and ask for David at Eastern. He says he can make up any hose you'd like: from my own experience a hose that is about half the length of the standard one would be more convenient for threading through the cylinder tin. This is one of the reasons I wanted the ridgid extension made.
