Check your cooling system for sure, I recently saw a webpage that showed an engine with a plexiglass insert in a vavle cover (sorry no link). Was a flat-four VW. At different rpms pictures were taken and it showed that at highway engine speeds the valve cover is full (or almost) of oil. It was easy to understand that hot heads could overheat the oil too. I could see that in a situation where the air cooling of the heads and cylinders could be marginal placing more cooling load on the oil...
