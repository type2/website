It's been widely debated whether or not lengthening that wire will have any effect and the answer is no but the kicker is that the reading you will get will be wrong no matter what the length is...

And that's why the VDO gauge will never read correctly. The cold junction of their thermocouple wire is in the engine compartment (? F), under the cylinder tin (? F)or underneath the bus (? F) depending on how you install it. That temperature is going to vary greatly.

The construction of their harness akes me wonder if the VDO gauge would work properly if thermocouple was run all the way to the gauge. It couldn't cost much to try.

Yep. That harness is pure profit.
