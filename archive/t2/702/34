Jeremy,

 

Thanks for the pictures - I really appreciate them!  From what I can see in
your pictures - there are no 'flex' hoses as I thought. all the vent pieces
that are attached to the metal appear to be formed plastic.  Now I've got to
go under the dash of my bus and see what I have and what's missing.

 

Thanks again,

 

Wayne

Hi Wayne, attached are some pictures for you.  I hope these will help.  Most
of them are taken from above and one is from below.  There is a picture of
the big 4 channel middle part out of the dash, laying where the passenger
seat should be, and then one looking straight down at the hole where it goes
in.

 

Anyway, glad to help if you need any other pictures or descriptions.
