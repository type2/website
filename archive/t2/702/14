You'll find that most folks will recommend NOT cutting your dash. In
this case I agree.

There are plenty of places to purchase a under-dash mount for your
stereo that will save your dash from the hacksaw.

Here's one for $8.50:

Find a delete plate for your dash opening if you don't want to leave
it open. I see them on The Samba and eBay fairly often.
