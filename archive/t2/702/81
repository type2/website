Subject: Re: [T2] CHT lead length question

According to VDO's 1987 Catalog, the CHT Lead Wire (VDO # 240-701)
from the connection points at the Gauge to the thermal sensor wire is
15 feet.  The catalog (or later ones) do not list the length of the
thermal sensor wire, only the spark plug diameters offered:

323-701 - 14mm spark plug (what most use)
323-705 - 12mm spark plug (mainly m/cycles)
