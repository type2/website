Subject: I'm exhausted

I've been trying to change my muffler and my 1970 bus has been fighting me 
every step of the way.  Before taking the old one off, I noticed that there was 
a good 1/4 inch space between the riser from the heat exchanger and the bottom 
of the little heater box on the muffler.  I figured that that was part of my 
exhaust leak problem. Well, with the stock muffler on there's still a space. 
What's the deal?
