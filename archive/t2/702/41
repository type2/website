Subject: Re: [T2] 5x112 EMPI rims?

They COULD be standard wide-5 5 spoke EMPI rims that can be sourced from dozens of suppliers (just look in any VW magazine or Mid-America). They might have had the lug holes welded up and new lug holes cut out. 

Look good. Dunno if they would be strong enough since they are sold for Beetles (unknown to me quality).
