Subject: Re: [T2] Dakota Digital Gauge

FWIW we bought a set of the Dakota Digital instruments for a street rod in 1997/1998. Had LOTS of trouble with them. Sent them back 2-3 times. Different problems. Failure to start up or failure of LED segments. I'm sure that their quality has improved since then BUT I would be sure that I understood the warranty (not buy them and sit them on the shelf for a year or two, we didn't do that but I have done that with a VDO tach I hope works in my bus, it's 3-4 years old but never been used) and prob join a street rod forum (the place I see them used most often) and ask for user experiences. 

We bought a full instrument pack: tach, speedo, water temp, volts, oil pressure, etc. Most of the trouble was with the tach and speedo.

Still have the vehicle and no further problems since. Got tired of pulling the dash (time consuming) to send them back and forth.
