That's called "T" molding, and you can order it in rolls by the foot from a
few different locations.  If you do a search in the archive on T-Molding and
T Molding, there are quite a few posts about it.

I bought mine from the Outwater Plastics catalog.  A quick google search
will pull up their webpage.  That's just one company that provides it, other
folks have used other sources with good results.
