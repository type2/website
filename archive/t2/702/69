Two things you need to do now: first, get a long thermometer to stick 
down your dipstick. Richard Atwell's site has a recommendation, I think 
(www.ratwell.com). Use this to make sense of your gauge reading, which 
may be 10-20% wrong (in either direction).

If you really are getting temps around 250 degrees or more in routine 
driving, suspect leaky cooling tin, or some other source of hot air 
from your engine entering your fan, or possible a forgotten or hacked 
"forget-me-not" (the tin deflectors that are attached directly under 
the cylinders). Are all of your seals in place? Is any of the cooling 
tin loose or so bent that it leaks air? Are there rust holes in your 
battery trays, which can contribute heated air to the engine 
compartment? These are the most likely sources of overheating, and you 
should be concerned to rule them out before worrying about oil cooler 
or adding gauges.

The fact that the engine had a cracked head is a clue; this does not 
happen because the oil isn't getting cooled enough. The problem is more 
likely in your air-cooling system.
