If you look at:

Click the '71 Westy folder and check out photo #8.
I like to use stealth to try and protect my stereo from the casual teen
smash and grab.
I leave the stock saphire am/fm in the dash.  I also use a rocker on/off
switch mounted just below the brake warning light as an alternative to the
ignition switch issue.
These pix are of my previous '71, I now have a '71 Riviera but mounted the
stereo in the same manner.
I can take more pictures if you want, I mount 6x9's in the rear hatch, 3.5"
ers in the vent holes and a 12" kenwood sub with a 250watt amp under the
rear seat.
I push a quarter the wattage my teenage sons have in their cars and they are
impressed by the quality and quanity of sound you can get if you balance out
where the sound comes from.
