Chromel - Alumel
Spelling might or might not be right. They come with a red and yellow wire and
I believe it's the yellow that goes to the positive side. I used to use these
day in and day out, but it's been 5 years and several beers ago. They have a
temp range of  -3280F to 22820F. According to the Omega website, the accuracy
is the greater of 2.20C or 0.75%. We always used them in the lab for high temp
work because, according to my former boss, they were more accurate in that
range. We used Type J thermocouples at low temp for the same reasons. Dakota
says their meter reads Type K thermocouples and from looking at the wire
colors on a VDO sensor, it looks to me as though it's a Type K. Here's one
site you can go to that has everything from probes to high temp connectors of
the correct calibration, ie. Type K, etc.
http://www.omega.com/temperature/tsc.html Don't know if they are the cheapest,
but hey are the ones we used to order from the most. Great looking gauges from
Dakota. Nice find Richard.
