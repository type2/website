Subject: Re: [T2] heat

that is pretty neat mark... i will have to get me one of those so i can test my gauge as well... 
have to look that up...
 
as far as cooling tin if you are missing any or for that rusty holy battery tray a good alternative till you get it fixed or have the deniro is to some roof flashing handy,....
it also goes good for the bottom pushrod tin.... tin screws go right through it and hold nicely....
 
also are you running a engine seal?
 
 
also i was wrong when i said i let mine get up to 220* now that i think more about it....
i dont ever let it get to 240* i made a mark with typewriter correction when i went through atlanta last and that was on july the 4th////errrr damn was it hot.... and yes i could not stand the trafic... next time i will make my way around atlanta and Detour Detour Detour no place IMHO for a bus driver of our sorts...
70mph IMo is way to fast and can burn something up... got a friend nehat that could tell you all about running 70 and 75 ........put him down fo three days just couple weeks ago and slap burned a piston up badly.....
 
peace

Two things you need to do now: first, get a long thermometer to stick 
down your dipstick. Richard Atwell's site has a recommendation, I think 
(www.ratwell.com). Use this to make sense of your gauge reading, which 
may be 10-20% wrong (in either direction).

If you really are getting temps around 250 degrees or more in routine 
driving, suspect leaky cooling tin, or some other source of hot air 
from your engine entering your fan, or possible a forgotten or hacked 
"forget-me-not" (the tin deflectors that are attached directly under 
the cylinders). Are all of your seals in place? Is any of the cooling 
tin loose or so bent that it leaks air? Are there rust holes in your 
battery trays, which can contribute heated air to the engine 
compartment? These are the most likely sources of overheating, and you 
should be concerned to rule them out before worrying about oil cooler 
or adding gauges.

The fact that the engine had a cracked head is a clue; this does not 
happen because the oil isn't getting cooled enough. The problem is more 
likely in your air-cooling system.
