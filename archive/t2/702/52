Subject: Alternator for CV engine

I have a 1972 7-seat Bus.  When I got it I installed a CV Vanagon engine.
Works great.  Now, 60K miles later, I am wanting to install some A/C.  What
is the largest capacity Alternator I can install on this engine?

I was also "given" a 1982 Vanagon just to get it out of the yard where I
found it.  Nothing beats free.  That will be my next project when the '72 is
finished.
