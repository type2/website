Kevin asked:


 I can't believe I didn't get an answer to my question
about oil temperature.  I know that most of you guys
here know about it.  I ask again, in short, what is
the maximum acceptable oil temperature for what period
of time for a Volkswagon Transporter?  My VDO guage
(with the dip-stick thermostat) red-lines at 275. Is
that the max? Is it acceptable to run at 250 for an
hour?  Two hours??  I just ran to Atlanta and was in
stop-and-go traffic all day.  I did stop and cool the
engine whenever it got above 250, but I admit, I was a
little paranoid.  My engine runs great and I don't
want to ruin it by running it too hot.  So please,
please tell me...what is too hot?  I don't find an
answer in my Haynes book.  Thanks...KR

Wellll....... you are not going to like the answer. Because it involves questions.....

Is you gauge accurate?

Are you using single weight oil or multi-grade oil?

Are you using dino oil or synthetic oil?

If your gauge is accurate and you are using multi-grade dino oil, you really want to read the 
section on 'Viscosity Index Improvers' here:
