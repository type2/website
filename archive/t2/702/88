Subject: Re: [T2] CHT lead length question

Guys,

I thought we did this one already?  Just went out and looked at the two 
harnesses that I have...both are plain copper wire with what appears 
to be brass spade lugs.

As long as both wires are the same and the runs are not in 100' distances, 
it shouldn't make any difference.

The only difference would be the minute amount of resistance in the copper 
wires for 20' rather than 15'.

Since the voltage is being produced at the junction, it should be the same 
except for resistance in the lead wires....except for the infamous cold 
junction problem.

My bet is that they would read the same if you used regular old zip cord 
of 15' length or 20' length.

That was the only test I didn't do the other day...mostly cause the 
harness wires were copper.

If someone thinks seriously that it would be different, I'll go get mine 
out of the shop and repeat the test with regular old zip cord rather than 
the "vdo" harness.

Cheers, dave

 It might even correct the VDO gauge. :-)

As soon as they differ then the voltage produced will differ and the gauge will lose it's calibration.
