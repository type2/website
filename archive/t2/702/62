I can't believe I didn't get an answer to my question
about oil temperature. I know that most of you guys
here know about it. I ask again, in short, what is
the maximum acceptable oil temperature for what period
of time for a Volkswagon Transporter? My VDO guage
(with the dip-stick thermostat) red-lines at 275. Is
that the max? Is it acceptable to run at 250 for an
hour? Two hours?? I just ran to Atlanta and was in
stop-and-go traffic all day. I did stop and cool the
engine whenever it got above 250, but I admit, I was a
little paranoid. My engine runs great and I don't
want to ruin it by running it too hot. So please,
please tell me...what is too hot? I don't find an
answer in my Haynes book. Thanks...KR
