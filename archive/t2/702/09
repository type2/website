Subject: oil temp and cooling

Hey, Guys.  I solved my fuel odor problems.  The
carburator was tuned too rich and gas got into the
exhaust.  It would even backfire.  Leaned it out and
it's fine.

I put in a VDO oil temp guage that uses a dip-stick
sensor.  The gauge has a big gap between 180 and 250
but after running long and hard it seems to top out
around 220.  Is this acceptable?  

Is there anything else that can be done to cool the
engine better.  Mine has had a cracked head fixed b/4
I got it.  Doubt they replaced to oil cooler.  Do they
go bad?  Can you change it with the engine in?  

Too many questions, too little time.  Thanks...KR
