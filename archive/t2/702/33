Subject: Type-1 Alternator Face

Volks,

My alternator pulley recently grenaded itself*, taking big chunks out 
of the "face" of my alternator.

When replacing the pulley, I pulled the face and cleaned out all the 
metal shavings that I could before reinstalling.

The face (which supports the alternator shaft/bearings) isn't 
completely ruined, but I'd like to replace it anyway.

Does anyone sell this piece or is it a "find in a junkyard" part only?

I'd hate to buy a new alternator when mine seems to be just fine...

thanks,
	tom
