Hi Corbett,

If you are going with Megasquirt then virtually all of the components 
you need can be gathered from a 74-82 VW. It would help if they all 
come from the same vehicle, but it isn't mandatory. The difference in 
displacement will be compensated for by the MAP sensor.

You are going to need a complete fuel rail, from the pump to the 
regulator, including injectors and their harness. You will also need 
the air plenum, Head temp sender, throttle body and intake runners, and 
a wiring harness. Any year harness will do, as long as the connectors 
to the injectors and sensor are good. You will have to drill and tap 
one of your 1700cc heads to accept the head temp sender switch.  You 
won't need to worry about the EGR hardware, throttle switch, double 
relay, thermo time switch, aux air valve, AFM, or ECU.

I *almost* converted the westfakia to Megasquirt, but I decided that 
L-Jetronic was a safer bet for me, since I travel a lot in my bus and I 
was not familiar enough with FI at the time to be prepared to maintain 
a "homebrewed" FI system if broken down 900 miles from home. YMMV.

As has been stated, there is a great wealth of FI information at 
www.ratwell.com.


Happy trails,
