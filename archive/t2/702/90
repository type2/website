The AFMs and brains should match, but how this works when you insert a 
megasquirt, I don't know.

Everything else can be considered interchangeable except for the 
plenum. There are two plenums fitted for two kinds of EGR (mechanical 
or vacuum), and another that has no fittings for EGR at all. If you do 
not need to install EGR, you can use a plenum for EGR by blanking off 
the EGR fittings with two bolts, a cover plate, and some silicone. But 
there are plenty out there with no such fittings at all. Injectors are 
the same, runners are the same. Harnesses differ a little, but again 
your megasquirt is the bigger variable. Temp sensors, aux air, and 
relays should be identical.
