Subject: Fiberglass pop-top warping.

     So I just picked up this 73 campmobile.  I'm extatic, and I love it.  
It's very nearly rust free, and the interior is pretty decent.  What worries 
me is that the front of the fiberglass pop-top seems warped and wavy.  Where 
it looks like it should meet flush accross the arc of the front roof of the 
bus, it sits a touch high and the fiberglass waves unevenly across the roof 
instead.  It seems to be missing some seals, and the molding that runs 
accross the edges of the pop-rop, could this be related?  I can post 
pictures if this description doesn't cut it.

     I bought my 74 standard (a rust bucket) some time ago to see if I was 
interested in busses at all.  I'm hooked.  Once it was running reasonable 
well, I started to see how versatile it is.  I found out I could haul 
supplies to work on my older home.  Later I installed a Z-bed and my 
girlfriend and I headed out to EveryBus, what a great time!  It turns out to 
be the perfect compromise for my future wife and I, since I'm a long time 
camper, but she's not as into the sleeping on the ground as I am :-)  
Anyway, I ramble, thanks in advance for all the help I will get from the 
list on this project, and all the help I already have.
