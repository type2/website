That poster (myself) didn't feel that it was needed as the method I use --
solder & heatrshrink, for the record -- had been previously mentioned
(and bashed) by others in this discussion.  I grew up with an ex-Navy
father who's an electronics & electrical engineer instructor .. basically
born with a soldering iron in my hand. :-)  Also, my first "wrenching"
experiences were under the wing of a shade-tree good-old-boy (with
a dayjob as a carpenter), and even *he* never used wirenuts for 
anything vehicular.
