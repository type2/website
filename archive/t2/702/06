Loafer,

Ok, now I feel really bad...I respoded to the first post about solder
because I missed the part about *splices*.  

I simply replied with the observation that the DIY FI folks warned about 
using solder on **connections** ... specifically(for the record) spade lug 
type connectors.

If I had to *splice* two wires on my bus, I would solder the connections 
and then shrink wrap them.

For the record, I don't own a boat, I do own a bus!  LOL!

Cheers, dave
