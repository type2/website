Thanks for your dilligence, Richard. Did the CustSvcRep, or did you
discover a significant difference between Odyssey and Solarix guages?
They look pretty much the same; only the Solarix cost $20 more, and the
Odysseys have more documentation available from their site. I've been
needing a guage solution, but I've been gun-shy with all the "bad
gauge" threads.
Thanks,
