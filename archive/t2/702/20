Subject: Are Westies and Westy Campmobiles the same thing?

     This may be a really dumb question.  I just picked up a pretty nice "73 
Westfalia Campmobile".  Are all Westfalia campers campmobiles, or is this a 
different product than the 'normal' Westy?
     Anyway, I've been through the thing, and I love it.  I love the way the 
interior is layed out with the little spice rack and that shelf for the 
stove that flips out, so I'm happy.  I'm just more used to seeing campers 
with a stove and sink on the far wall on the opposite side of the slider.  
I'm just interested in finding out more info on what I have, and if it's 
special (not that it matters, it's already special to me :-)
