Subject: Re: [T2] Re: CHT revisited

I sent email to a couple of different retailers about the Westach and
Falcon dual CHT gauges. They aren't cold junction corrected and neither
retailer provided solid information as to the gauges' accuracy. I was
considering one of the Falcon gauges for a short time as the whole set
with dual senders can be purchased for less than the cost of a VDO CHT.
