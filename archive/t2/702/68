Thanks for all of the advice about temps.  I rode to
Atlanta yesterday.  Never, ever want to live there.
I'd become the Charles Manson of road rage. I was in
heavy traffic from Cartersville (way North) to the
Airport (South  side) and back.  Stop and go all day.
Ambient was in the mid 70's.   Going down, on the
freeway in clear traffic, it ran 190-210.  In the
heavy traffic it got up to 250 a couple of times. 
Then I'd decide to shop or have lunch and let her
cool.  Headed back it was close to 250 again when I
saw traffic easing.  I stopped and cooled her down to
180.  Coming back she settled into the 190-210 range
driving 50-60.  The last 30 miles I pushed her to 70
and it creeped up to 230.  Purred like a cat the whole
time.  Except for a stupid wire that keeps popping off
of the starter, she does fine.  I'm definitely going
to look into an instrument cluster with head temp,
voltage, Tach, etc.  Information saves engines.  Thanks...KR
