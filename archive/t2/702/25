Subject: Yay! I have an oil cap!!!

My package with an oil cap (and some bolts) didn't come from BB today.
I'm nervous driving around with just duct tape over the filler, so
another list member helped me out and gave me one. He's just a few
minutes away from me here in Colorado and has a pair of beautiful
green late bays. I'm sooo jealous. LoL!

I'm now the happy owner of a bus with an oil cap! =)

Thanks man!
