Hi Jaybird,

Having all the seals/moldings present will go a long way towards
keeping the fiberglass in proper shape.

Glad you are enjoying your bus!

  What worries
 me is that the front of the fiberglass pop-top seems warped and wavy.  Where
 it looks like it should meet flush accross the arc of the front roof of the
 bus, it sits a touch high and the fiberglass waves unevenly across the roof
 instead.  It seems to be missing some seals, and the molding that runs
 accross the edges of the pop-rop, could this be related?
