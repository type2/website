Subject: Judgment call about painting pushrod tubes, other things

1. Pushrod tubes: is it better to paint the entire length, or to tape 
off the ends where seals go and leave that in bare metal? (2.0 L - 
style tubes)

2. Has anyone found a substitute for the NLA sealing ring on EGR valve 
(mechanical, not vacuum)?

TIA,

Mark
