I can't believe I didn't get an answer to my question
about oil temperature.  I know that most of you guys
here know about it.  I ask again, in short, what is
the maximum acceptable oil temperature for what period
of time for a Volkswagon Transporter?  My VDO guage
(with the dip-stick thermostat) red-lines at 275. Is
that the max? Is it acceptable to run at 250 for an
hour?  Two hours??  I just ran to Atlanta and was in
stop-and-go traffic all day.  I did stop and cool the
engine whenever it got above 250, but I admit, I was a
little paranoid.  My engine runs great and I don't
want to ruin it by running it too hot.  So please,
please tell me...what is too hot?  I don't find an
answer in my Haynes book.  Thanks...KR
