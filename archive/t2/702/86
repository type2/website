It might even correct the VDO gauge. :-)

From what I understand about thermocouple wiring, you can extend the wiring with regular wire but the splices that you make must be at the same temperature. As soon as they differ then the voltage produced will differ and the gauge will lose it's calibration.

This works when you extend the wiring an extra ft under the dashboard but not when you run a length of wire from the engine compartment to the dash with the markedly different temperature zones. Of course if you run thermocouple all the way it's not a problem.

I'm not sure what the VDO 15' lead wire harness is made from. Does anybody know?
