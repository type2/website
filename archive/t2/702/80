Subject: head and 2 barrel carb for sale or trade

Folks,

Finally trying to clean out some stuff that came with a parts bus from 
long ago.

pics at http://www.shockwaverider.com/parts/  

and they are fairly large.


One head,  looks like about 72-74 or so.  No visible cracks...

One weber?  32/36DFAV  2 barrel carb with base intake manifold and only 
*one* intake manifold runner to fit it...Looks fairly clean inside.

I have never used either of these items and they are sold as-is.

You pay shipping from 72704.

What I really want is a set of *new* tail light inside covers...the ones 
that go on the back side of the taillights to cover the bulbs/wiring.

Please email privately at dbolen(-at-)shockwaverider.com.

Make offer?

Cheers, dave
