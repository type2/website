Subject: Re: [T2] The Physics of Cooling

I believe this---

After a certain point of speed the fan on the engine is actually
cavitating--
Like it is going so fast there is o way it can move all the air that it
is swallowing---

Kinda like a boat prop in the water---
Slam the throttle WFO--when you just start moving--and the prop spins
with no boat movement--
It can't possibly swallow and move all the water that is being moved
into it---

So--as with any fan--or prop---at speed--the fan is sucking more air
than it can possibly move to properly cool the engine-- 

This is how I read it---
