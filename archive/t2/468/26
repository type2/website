Subject: A few camper items FS

I had my 76 Westy towed away a few weeks ago, and I
have a few things left over from it that I'd like to
sell:

-the main cabinet with the sink

-the mat that sits over the engine compartment

-the table

-a few cabinet doors

These are all in good condition, and I'd rather have
someone use them rather than toss them.

If interested let me know by email.
