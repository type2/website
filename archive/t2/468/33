Subject: parts from dealers

usually you just get a hang-up, or laughter when you ask about an 
air-cooled part from a vw dealer... today, i got another unpleasant 
response:

"yeah, i know the part... problem is, vw just rolled out a new parts 
computer system last month, and it will not even TALK to the old 
system, so 1000s of things that used to be in the database just 
AREN'T. it REALLY sucks. sorry."

he suspected that vw might still have some of the old parts in the 
inventory, but the new computer WILL NOT be listing them so they are 
as good as NLA.
hopefully this means vw will at least sell the old stock to someone, 
and not just write it off as scrap :P
