Watching my temp gauge, it seems it runs coolest at the lowest speed you
can do in a given gear- ie, lowest rpms and lowest throttle.  In 4th on
our 78 high milage engine, that's about 50-55 on the flats! I've gotten
it to a scary 270 on long hill pulls even with shifting down, because of
the tendency for one to use the top of the rpm range in the lower gear-
best to settle in at the lowest rpms you can use, which is hardly moving
the throttle very far.

 It may well be that spinning the engine faster makes it run hotter if

 is under load.  My rule of thumb is never to run the engine at WOT
uphill
 if the outside temps are over 80.  I run about 3/4 throttle and shift
down
 when appropriate
