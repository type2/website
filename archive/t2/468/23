Subject: Re: [VB] GL4

The only problem i see with GL4 is that BAP in Arizona is no longer carrying it, and has canceled
out all orders of it, taken away the shelf space and replaced it with Castrol GL5 something or
other. That was the only place i knew of to buy it, so the next time i need it... well i dunno what
ill do. I think someone mentioned NAPA still carrys it so ill try there.

 There are some on this list that swear by non-gl4 products and say they work just fine. On the
other hand there are some tranny rebuilders who say your warranty is voided if you use anything BUT
GL4.
