Subject: The Mechanics of Cooling (flaps)

With all this talk about cooling...

I just want to verify that if the thermostat cable breaks (or is 
missing) that the cooling flaps in the fan shroud spring open to a 
"maximum cooling" position.

Are there any good photos or diagrams out there of how the flaps 
actually redirect the cooling air inside the shroud?

Thanks!
