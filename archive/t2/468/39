The trick is to only give them a part number. Do not tell them what it is for because most of them are lazy and don't care they can make the company money by selling old parts sitting on the shelf. You'll get all sorts of BS about how they can't search back that far etc. I worship my part guy. For all the past ones I have voodoo dolls made up.

In some cases, like the throttle body gasket, I've been bitten when the part came up unavailable but a warehouse search showed they still were. In other words there are several computer systems and ways to check for parts. Even a printed book of just numbers some of course obsolete. You have to be persistent and befriend the guy at the parts counter. Keep looking for a friendly dealer because they do exist. Sometimes you'll find someone who used to own a bus and understands you.

What is encouraging is that VW is starting to make beetle parts available to the public. Of course, here in the US it's very inconvenient at present but still encouraging:

Hopefully they will do the same for the bus.
