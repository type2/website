alternator getting too hot?
Hey. This is kind of a Vanagon question, but it's an 81 Vanagon FI, and
I know this has come up before, but can't find it in the archives. It
happens on my bay also, and every other 2.0FI van, it seems like...
You know when you're driving down the road, and you lose power, engine's
still running, but not actually doing anything, and it stalls, and you
pull over and sit for a while, and then it starts again like nothing
happened?
        Well, what are the chances that's because the
alternator gets too hot and binds up? I know that it could be any number
of several thousands of different problems, but this van has a new fuel
filter and pump. The electrical seems to be in order, as far as
wiring...   The big vacuum dealie on the firewall has the two large
hoses going into it, and the smallest one on on the opposite side is
blocked off. I don't see anything for this line to go to on the
manifold... i thought on my 77 it went to the rubber neck thing, or the
air cleaner housing... nothing there that i could see on this bus.
So yeah... what do you think?
