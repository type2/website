Folks,

I used cheap GL-5 (not 4/5) in my '70 Westy tranny (high mileage already)
and drove it for 35,000 miles before I learned it was the wrong stuff.

It shifts a lot crunchier now--my personal experience is this tranny is
going downhill fast, but that might be because it is just old and worn out.
I now use the Sta-Lube GL-4 in everything.  Why take a chance?
