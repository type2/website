I don't think that the NB was a "loving revision".  It was a cosmetic
reskinning of the Golf.  The New Microbus is the same story, a cosmetic
remake of an existing platform.

The major problem today is the predominance of "form over function" in
marketing.  Does anyone believe that the "Dune" concept vehicle will
actually perform in sand?

At least the Mini was a purpose-built vehicle.  It does pretty much what
it was designed to do.  We almost bought one for my wife, but then the
Scion came along and ended up being better than the Mini...
