Subject: Bleeding brakes

I always thought brake lines should be bled from longest line to shortest
but page 30 of Brakes in Wheels in Bentley says right front, left front,
right rear, left rear is the order.

The left-right order is correct just not the front-rear. I understand the mc
is dual circuit but why does Bentley state that order?
