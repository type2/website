Good gracious ladies and gentlemen,

I am sorry but I cannot believe this is a point of discussion much less a
point of extended discussion.  Volkswagen calls for GL4, GL4 is widely
available, and thus it is what ought to be used.  The danger of n
incompatibility may be miniscule but the risk/reward ratio is huge. GL4 is
in no more danger of disappearing than non-detergent HD30 motor oil which
has not been the oil of choice in 40 years.  In a commercial shop you just
order it in like any other product.  In DIY you may have to visit a few
shops or even mail order it but it IS available and always will be.

At the same time I must say that this discussion is very positive as most
people simply leave the factory transmission fluid in place until the
transmission either dies by grinding itself to death on fluid clogged with
metal bits or it explodes as the last drops of fluid leak out.  Although
Volkswagen did not set an interval for changing the fluid I am very much
in favor of doing so at regular intervals.  At a minimum you should
immediately change the fluid on any bus where you suspect it has not been
done and every other year thereafter.  If you change your transmission
fluid along with your brake fluid you and your bus will both be happier
and live longer.

                             OOK!
