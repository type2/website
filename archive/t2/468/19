Darren,

Let's see, you replaced the two rear cables, which should have left you 
with enough cable to use to replace those two parts....at least that's 
what I did.

Pull the internal actuating "wire" out and then just cut the outer
"liner" to the length you need.  Reinstall inner cable and cut with about
6" too long.  Reinstall both.

If you need to recreate the "special" ends on the lever end(I saved mine) 
then you can heat the cable up and bend it the way you need to....don't 
forget to reheat and then "harden" it by quenching the red hot part in
oil or water.

I save all parts like that when they come off the bus....I probably have
about 8' of cable and wire left over for the next time.

Cheers, dave
