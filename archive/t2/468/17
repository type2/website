Subject: germany info?

Folks,

I have a rare opportunity to be in Germany next week on business.

I will be mostly in the southern part of Germany and around 
Frankfurt and Freiburg and am wondering if any one knows 
of any interesting vw locations in that area that I might be able to visit.

Secret parts stores, swap meets and vw flea markets could be interesting!

pmail if necessary.

Thanks ,dave
