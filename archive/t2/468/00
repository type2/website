it is difficult with any sort of certainly to specify which years had which
components, especially as CA is different than federal, canadian market
different again.

my '79 CA bus has the throttle microswitch. on a bus with an o2 sensor, the
microswitch removes the o2 sensor input from the ECU so the system goes into
open loop, effectively enriching the mixture. i am not sure how the
microswitch functions to enrich the mixture when there is no o2 sensor, but
i believe it works in concert with the afm circuitry.
