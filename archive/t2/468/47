You want Ford Tractor Lube. The Valvoline 5 gallon buckets I get at NAPA 
meet and DO NOT EXCEED GL-4. It is rated for GL-3 and GL-4 use. It says on 
the label Ford Tractor Lube. Any implement shop in the world knows Ford 
Tractor Lube and will have it on the shelf. The only quarts I recall seeing 
it in were by STA-LUBE. Local Napa used to stock it by dropped it on the 
shelves. I do expect they can order it for you.

Check with any local Ford tractor owning farmer and ask him where he gets 
his. Bet he buys it by the bucket. 2 buddies could split a 5 gallon bucket 
and have enough for 200,000 worth of maintenance. I'll bet if you changed 
it that often it might go another big measure of miles under continued 
rational maintenance. And nothing is more rational than following specs to 
be SURE of function at the most rational cost.
