Subject: anyone need a mechanic/apprentice helper...

well it seems that finally the economy caught up with me ...
as of this morning at 9am we had a meeting and i was let go /laid off with no chance to go back .
went to unemployment right there after leaving the office.
might be a week or two before i can even get a check. maybe?
they said that i would have to wait and see after they get the info back from columbia sometime next week.?
 
 
well need to know does anyone local out there need anything done that maybe i can do for them>?
or better yet is there anyone that is a mechanic that needs some help.
i could use the money and education,..
i have been working on my type 4 mostly myself with the help many full moon members i have done everything that i set out to do.
som of the others here like buddah and cgar and phil can possibly tell you that i have gotten down and attempted to do what ever needed to be done to the bus  NO FEAR just learning .
 
i havent come here to beg, but to look for a open oppurtunity to do something finally that i really enjoy doing and thats working on vw air cooled engines and the vehicles themselves.
 
if anyone knows anything please call me at home or email me ...
i can be reached at vwmoon at hotmail dot com or chamoon at vwmail dot net.
my home number can be found in the airs list./..
peace to you all and wish us luck cause things are about to get harder.
 
btw i finally got the time yesterday to pull the engine apart and looks as if the thing sucked a valve... the # 3 valve is broken and look slike maybe it knocked a hole in the back of the head,.
 
i wont know for sure til i get out there and finish pulling the head /s off..
 
i know this isnt job service but the moonies here have always been informative about things.
 
peace to you and yours.
