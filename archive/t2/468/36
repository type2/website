Subject: Re: [T2] parts from dealers

Unfortunately, the way VWoA treats its aircooled followers now days these
parts probably *will* be written off as scrap. On a good note I was able to
find some valve adjustment screws from my local  VW dealership the other
day. I bought all eight they had in stock. Pricey but if they are the
correct hardness I guess its worth it.
