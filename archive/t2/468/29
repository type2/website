Subject: The Physics of Cooling

Okay, all you kooky math teachers, librarians, engineers and what
have you:

Riddle me this ('cuz I really *don't* get it)...

QUOTE (http://www.type2.com/dakhlia/)

Remember that for a given speed, higher engine rpm => faster
cooling fan => cooler engine.

END QUOTE

Why isn't temp a relative constant?  With increased RPM, the fan
would most certainly be turning faster, and the engine would be
enjoying a greater amount of cooling air, but would not the
engine also be creating equivalently MORE heat to be dissipated
(increased RPM = increased combustion).

Perhaps this is a Friday question, not sure.  I just like to
learn things, and I thought what better venue than this to apply
physics to Volkswagens!  Curve graphing not necessary, but
appreciated (hah).
