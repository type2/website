For those with fully instrumented engines, I wonder if there are different
peaks for oil and cylinder head temperatures?  It's the cylinder head temp
that causes mechanical problems for the engine, such as broken and/or
pulled studs.  The oil temp is just a symptom and may not follow along
precisely with the cylinder head temp.
