Subject: How to best use archives?

I have a question concerning the archives.  Before asking my questions I
normally consult them first but have a heck of a time navigating through
them.  I try searching by topic and content but have a hard time finding
results, and I know the info is probably in there somewhere.  Do we have a
"how to" guide somewhere on how to effectively use the list archives?  How
do I use the "match", "sort by" and "score" boxes to help my search?  I have
no idea what boolean means but it does sound very exotic :)

Cheers,
