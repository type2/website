Subject: Camper FOR SALE

Greetings all!

I recently purchased a '68 Camper.  I have done some things to it, but have
decided to sell it.  The reason being that a '61 Single Cab that I once
owned is up for sale and I would really like to have it back.  I can't have
both the camper and the single cab, so the camper must go.

I always feel obligated to offer a Bus to the list before heading to the
Samba or the last resort, Ebay.

I'm looking to get $1850.00.  I hope to have photos by the weekend.

If anyone is seriously interested please e-mail me privately and I will
gladly give you all the details of its condition.  It is truly a unique bus
and has been set up for long distance travel and camping.

I am located in east Tennessee.

Thanks,
Victor
