Subject: Aftermarket T4 fans (was Re: The Physics of Cooling)

Hi Volks,

Branching on the same topic, has anyone ever seen an aftermarket 
replacement for the original T4 squirrel-cage fan?

I know the porsche shroud conversion is popular with the go-fast crowd, 
but I was wondering why no-one has ever come up with a bolt-up 
replacement for the original equipment. Or if it's  just that I haven't 
  see it. With modern technology one would expect to have lighter, more 
aerodynamic parts available that could possibly push as much or more 
air with less HP traded off.

Or is it simply impossible to cost-effectively improve on the original 
VW component?


Happy trails,
