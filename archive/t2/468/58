Found some of the pictures tonight but can't find the one that really showed
the blade!

All this talk last week about the different VW powered items reminded me of
this.
It is Friday here and camping at www.Bustoberfest.com tonight and Sat.  Come
on out if your able

It is in the four corners of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas!
