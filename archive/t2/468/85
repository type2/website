Hi Frank,

Quarter inch aperature approximately centered under the glove box, 
right?

That's a european 12V accessory outlet.  I'm told higher-end BMW 
touring motorcycles share the same system. Jamie Rivers has a original 
Coleman 12V air compressor that plugs into it, it's the only accessory 
I have ever seen for that plug.

Happy trails,
