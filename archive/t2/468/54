Subject: alternator getting too hot?

Hey.  This is kind of a Vanagon question, but it's an 81 Vanagon FI, and 
I know this has come up before, but can't find it in the archives.  It 
happens on my bay also, and every other 2.0FI van, it seems like... 

You know when you're driving down the road, and you lose power, engine's 
still running, but not actually doing anything, and it stalls, and you 
pull over and sit for a while, and then it starts again like nothing 
happened?

    Well, what are the chances that's because the alternator gets too 
hot and binds up?  I know that it could be any number of several 
thousands of different problems, but this van has a new fuel filter and 
pump.  The electrical seems to be in order, as far as wiring...   The 
big vacuum dealie on the firewall has the two large hoses going into it, 
and the smallest one on on the opposite side is blocked off.  I don't 
see anything for this line to go to on the manifold... i thought on my 
77 it went to the rubber neck thing, or the air cleaner housing...  
nothing there that i could see on this bus. 

So yeah... what do you think?
