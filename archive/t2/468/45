Craig--

That guy is full of BS---
Whie I agree that a bunch of stuff is NLA for air cooled  VW's--
I do know that the computer is still alive and well at any VW dealer in
the US for part's--
I was just in the parts department of my VW dealer the other day looking
stuff up myself--and the computer does still function well---

This guy your dealing with just was screwing around with you--

Honest--
