i had a chit chat with a rebuilder in eugene, a feller who claims thousands
of rebuilds under his smock. he gave me some gentle advice about permatex
and i wanted to share it with the list for thought. he sez the permatex on
an oil pump can become a problem; that it doesn't stick to paper - pretty
much all else except paper. if one were to put it between the case and the
gasket i run risk of that blue stuff in my block. i have some curilK2 and
i'll probably go with that, but how many engines, if any at all, lost
pressure due to this kind of possibility?? - steve
