Hi Dave,

I will translate and forward the message to a german aircooled messageboard.
I will send you the results back via P-mail.

What are the dates you are in Germany exactly? i.e. When do you leave home?

 Folks,

 I have a rare opportunity to be in Germany next week on business.

 I will be mostly in the southern part of Germany and around
 Frankfurt and Freiburg and am wondering if any one knows
 of any interesting vw locations in that area that I might be able to visit.
