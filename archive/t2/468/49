Subject: bn4 heater

I just installed a bn4 heater in our bus and got it fired up, do these things 
generally run with lots of exhaust smoke. It was dirty like it was burning 
very inefficiently. After running for about 5 minutes it quit and won;t fired up 
neither will the fan even run, any ideas ,thanks Dylan
