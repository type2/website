Subject: Want real heating for you bus?

For a very toasty bus you could go to the Original manufacturer as they 
are still  in business, and still producing gas heater.  I am sure you 
can find something that will suite your needs between 2900 and 41,000 
(not a typo).  Today their heater are mostly for school buses, suttles,  
trucks....  Of course after over 30 years of evolution the new heaters 
are pretty powerfull and efficient (With a minimum amp draw and a low 
fuel draw).

Of course I am pretty sure it ain't gonna be cheap, let us know if you 
find a price.
