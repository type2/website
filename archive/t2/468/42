number of reasons, remember the aerodynamics of the bus is about as non as

yup, but not because of the reason mentioned.  also the art of fluidics,
there is only so much air that can be pushed thru the cooling tin, not to
mention all the twists and turns in there add air friction and limit the
amount of air,  at some point you just won't be able to push more air thru
the whole...

my 78 seems to cool best at about 57-58 MPH  

YMMV
