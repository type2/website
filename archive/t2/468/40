Subject: RE: [VB] GL4/aughhhhhh

  Here is the scenario.

  I have been on these list since their inception. This debut on gear oil
has gone on since the beginning. I think that after all these years of
debut, all the GERU's and know it all's saying what is right and isn't. Has
ANYBODY had a tranny failure since these list  began to justify the GL4/GL5
conflict.
  I have searched all the achieves, even the vanagon and the vintage VW.
Looked through the shop talk forums and in all the years not ONE MENTION of
a trans failure due to GL4/5, but many a debut on them!!!!
   Before the list had began I had run GL4-5 gear oil in all of my 356's and
early beetles because I liked using 95-150 or something there about in my
trannys and it was only available in a gl4-5 mix. NEVER had a failure in any
of them that I could blame on GEAR OIL.
  Of course on the other hand the tranny GURUS (which ones?) do say that the
GL5 will corrode your syncro's, BUT have they ever said how LONG it would
take.
  Do as you must but I would LOVE to see the gear oil debuts END and if
someone wants to know, send them to the achieves and save the list
administrators some money on band width on a well worn out subject.
  What next, the 009 debut-DONE, tire debut-DONE, I guess hippy bashing will
be next.\
or how bout "Which spark plug is best", I don't think I've seen that one in
a LONG time.

ps. But here's an interesting concept relayed to me by a 20+year trans GERU.
DO NOT USE SYNTHETIC gear oils in VW transmissions or any gear oil with a
silicon content. These cause the syncro's to slip to much causeing premature
wear on them. They will not warranty a transmission (VW), that has ran
synthetic gear oil! As far as GL4 and/or 5 use what you got.

I claim absolutely no expertise on this at all.

I will say, though, that others on the list whose legends approach "Guru"
status have said to me on-list and in person that this is just not true, and
that the MT-5 is no bueno.

Since there doesn't seem to be anything in writing from a manufacturer about
this issue anywhere, myself, I purchased Stalube GL-4 at my local Napa for
about $12/gal.

I just bought a new transmission so I'm not EVEN going to take chances.  The
GL-4 is agreed upon by everyone to be okay, everything else is in debate,
why mess around?
