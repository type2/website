Subject: totally, totally ready for the closet

so confident i had everything right on the bottom end rebuild [connecting
the dots with cam/crank, etc] i saved the valve adjustment for the very
last thing. so here i was ready to adjust the valves and install but i ran
into trouble. dizzy drive gear? sure enough. next morning, today, i
borrowed one and pulled and properly lined the gear up as per all our
manuals. dizzy back in and adjust valves.  at TDC with the rotor pointing
at the cut for #1, and the white mark on the dial at "0" degrees,  only the
exhaust valve is closed on the first cylinder. is my only remedy reopening
the case to quadroople check that the dots are lined up?  - steve, spirit
finally broken.
