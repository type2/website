Subject: Re: [T2] wiring harness

Michael

Do you have a Bentley manual with color coded wiring diagrams for your year 
Bus? $25

Do you have a multi meter? $25

Crimping tool and terminals? $25

Do have the time to interact with the T2 list and learn how your electrical 
system works? 8 to 40 Hrs

By the way the idea that the turn signal relay has something to do with the 
Tach is rather far fetched. When you removed the Tach some wire may have 
been inadvertently disconnected.

The notion that new harness is easier than fixing the old one is only true 
if the wiring is burnt or the PO was a wiring madman.

What year is your bus? List ALL the electrical functions that don't work.



Chuck
