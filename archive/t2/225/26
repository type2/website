This guy lives about 40 miles from me. I was driving on the 401 towards Niagara
Falls a couple years ago in my '77 doing about ~70 mph when this bus passed me
like I was standing still, he was doing well over 100 mph....

That was before the body mods when it was a purple westfalia with the pop-top!!
Go here to see a picture of it before:

Second row, second bus in...

I dont doubt its speed at all, it was built for racing....its something to
see....
