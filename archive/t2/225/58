Wow!  Yep, mcmaster-carr has it!

They have some serious hoses in there including some that
can handle up to 500 degrees farenheit!

Unfortunately, most of the really nice stuff comes in 3" and up
sizes.  Might be ok for the run from front to back though.

Here is where I quit:

 Construction: Orange-red, 2-ply fiberglass fabric with silicone coating
 Reinforcement: Spring-steel wire helix and a fiberglass cord bonded to=20
cover
 Temperature Range:
  -75=B0 to +500=B0 F

It will handle working pressure starting at 28psi and 3/4" sizes.

Others follow, this was on page 170.

Cheers ,dave
