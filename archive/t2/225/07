Subject: Re: [T2] Removable rear aprons versus the non removable ones

* made it easy to remove.  They type IV engine was a different animal,
much more reliable, and they expected it to be removed only by those 
with  professional equipment.*
A recent engine tear down yielded the following results:
a) #3 Main pinched the location pin that didn't hit the hole. (Never spin
the crank to see if it fits, Just keep torquing it down, it'll fit.)
b) AMC heads with cylinder head gaskets (never)
c) 2 end play shims on the crank (must have been a racing engine, needed
more clearance)
The fellow said it was recently rebuilt, sure was clean as a whistle
inside but totally a 5,000 mile low compression engine. Now a junk
engine.
