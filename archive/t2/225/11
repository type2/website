=========================>
Pretty kewel clock job.
You could just run a pair of wires to a small battery pack,
making the batteries easier to change,
or run some wires off of the clock's power connections over to an available 
bus power source somewhere.

Use the appropriate voltage regulator or zener diode to drop the 12 VDC 
down to the voltage required by the clock.
If that sounds complicated, it isn't.
Parts can be had at Radio Shack stores or any number of electronic 
component supply houses.
