You can do it. Save you money to keep your Taurus and buy a Type II. Thanks 
to the list, anything missing can be located in a short time from one of 
the listers. I drove my daily until I pulled it off the road to restore.

The busses go very well in the snow if you keep decent tires on it.

Break downs do occur but they are usually the result of neglect, repairs by 
mechanics who aren't experienced with working on VW's, and the cumulation 
of 30 years of being a beater.

Buy the best rust free bus you can afford and go from there. Keep your 
Taurus and buy a trailer hitch for it and a tow bar for the bus. If you 
have a mechanical failure in town get a ride home and go back with the Taurus.

Our Type II was VERY, VERY reliable and we took it anywhere with little prep.
