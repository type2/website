Off hand I'd guess that that's probably true of most vehicles...I wonder
what the cut off point for most cars/vans is, BTW ?? At what point does
the vehicle become a beater and stop getting real service/care...? Is it
just mileage or the overall condition - dents, dings, etc. ?
Myself, I'm of the run it till it's used up group. Rust is my biggest enemy;
how 'bout you?
