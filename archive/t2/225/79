These are the very reasons anyone who owns a vintage car - anything not 
mainstream - should learn to do their own repairs. There are alot of crummy 
mechanics who think they know about Volkswagens. I would say very few 
common mechanics are qualified to work on a vintage VW these days. I also 
own a Honda and that too will never see the inside of a mechanic's garage 
b/c so many are hacks...

Buy some tools, buy a few good books, and learn. It will be cheaper than 
any mechanic and a much better quality in the long run. Learn how to not be 
a hack.

Fix them, don't sell them. It's cheaper to fix a blown engine than "give" 
away your VW.

Otherwise you are stuck driving a car payment the rest of your life.
