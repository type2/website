I saw a similar approach to opening a garage door.  A fellow bought six
identical-looking switches, some normally-open, some normally closed.  He
mounted them all in a box and wired them all in series.  You had to push
all the normally-open switches to close the circuit and open the door, but
if you pushed one of the normally-closed switches at the same time the
circuit would be opened and the door wouldn't work.  With three of each
switch, there were quite a few combinations to try!

Most pro thieves don't bother with the ignition.  They just drive
up with a flat bed tow truck and load up.  Awful hard to fight that, short
of chaining the bus to something.
