Subject: '77 Engine Pull

Hi Gang,

I'm in the process of pulling the engine on my 77' Westy (2.0L FI CA
emmssions).  I've got everything on top disconnected and most of the stuff
on the bottom.  I'm getting ready to start on the exhaust stuff (after I go
buy a can of WD-40) I had several questions, hopefully someone who's been
there can shed some insight...

1.  When pulling off the flexible couplings to the heat exchangers, I got a
face full of something which looks a lot like asbestos.  Does anyone have
any idea if a '77 would have had asbestos in the heating system?

2.  The engine was making a noise which fit the rod-knock description.  A
couple (non-VW) mechanic buddies also thought it might be rod knock.  Then
the clutch went out, which forced me into the engine pull.  My dillema is
wether to stuff in a new engine while I've got it out...could a clutch going
bad possibly make a rod-knock style noise?

3.  Since $ is an issue, I'm probably can't afford a top-end rebuilt.  Looks
like AVP...has anyone had problems with AVP?

4.  The ATK web site is down.  Does anyone know if they are still in
business?

5.  I'm considering a high-end rebuild from Gary's VW in San Diego, because
I'm local, and would avoid shipping. Any comments?

6.  I'm going to pull the engine w/ the tranny and replace tranny seals and
shift bushings.  Where is the CG on the engine/tranny assembly?

7.  I'm guessing it would be easier to remove exhaust components before
dropping the motor?  I don't want to bend them.

TIA for your input,
Rick
