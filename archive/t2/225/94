Nahhhhhhh,  got both color and B/W versions and for 78 it is 3 fold out

I want one like the "before" 73 model diagrams that show everything on one

one of these days if I can find 2 or 3 spare minutes I may draw one up but
it would probably need a lot of double checking before I would depend on
it.   I did one like that for my gas heater and it saves many headaches
