Subject: Windshield Replacement 

Well despite the general consensus, windshields can be a real bear to =
put in.  I ended up breaking my old one trying to put it in, and so =
after pricing out new windshields I decided to go with a local mobile =
installer who put it in for $150 including the windshield and labor.  =
After it took him and an assistant over 2 hours and repeated attempts to =
get it in. I started not to feel so bad for not being able to do it =
myself.  Also, all the postings and articles state never to use metal =
tools or to hit the window.  Not only did he repeatedly hit the window =
he also used a large metal pick with a 90 deg. bend in the end to work =
the seal into place.  They used a rope that was about as large as a =
clothesline (1/4" diameter).  He smacked the window with an open palm =
and this helped to seat the seal on the inside. =20

If anyone in the Seattle area needs glass installed, these guys are the =
ones to do it.  P-mail me if you want more info.
