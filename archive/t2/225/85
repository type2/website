Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 oil drain plug

Having driven my Westy for eight years and disassembled about ten Type IV
engines I opted for the screen oil change since every 20 year old case
I've seen has oversized drain plugs and I've never seen damage to the
strainer. Nine foot pounds sounds good, I'll have to try it.
