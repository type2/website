daniel,
	while you said there were 3 I suspect that your parts engine is
missing one these are the push rod tubes. I'm pretty sure bentley
mentions something about them in the disassembly section, but these
only can be removed with the head removed as well[0]. Make your live
easier by removeing the rocker arms & push rods before removing the
head. I don't think it's possible to really get a good hold of a few
of the head nuts w/ the rockers in place but I haven't tried.

[0] only on a T1 engine, you can remove them on a T4 w/out removing
the head.
