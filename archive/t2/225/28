All correct information. You could have sloppy shifter linkage, misadjusted 
clutch, or the shifter nose on the tranny itself could be worn. The input 
shaft for the shifter should fit nice and snug - free to move but no axial 
slop. Also inside this housing is the shifter rods (for the lack of a 
better term). These could be worn or not setup correctly. Bentley shows the 
procedure and it looks to be pretty involved.

Lastly there could be internal damage that prevents the tranny from working 
correctly.

Start with the simple stuff and work your way back.
