Chuck,

Looking at the wiring diagram, what you say makes a lot of sense.  I don't
remember it actually functioning this way, but that may be a screwup in my
bus' wiring.  I think the safe option if you don't want the pump to run is
to unplug the double relay no matter whether you are cranking from the
switch or using a remote starter.  That disconnects all possibility of
power to the pump.
