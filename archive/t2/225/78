I find it easier to check when valves are in overlap. That is when #1 is
firing the #3 should be in overlap. I rotate the crankshaft pulley back
and forth (maybe +/- 10 to 20 deg) around TDC and watch the #3 intake
and exhaust valves. They should be in overlap which means as one is
closing the other is opening. It's pretty easy to see as you rock the
crank back and forth and the rocker arms are doing kind of a see-saw
thing.

Or you can start by looking at the #3 valves and blindly rotate the
crank watching for valve overlap where exhaust is just closing and the
intake is starting to open. Set the crank to where the valves are about
equally open (or closed if you're a glass half empty guy) and then look
at the pulley you should be pretty close to TDC. If it's not close then
all that's left is the cam gear alignment.

One last thing. I once build an engine (non-vw) and there was a painted
dot on the cam. It was a definite dot and looked like the alignment
mark. After I had checked and double checked, everything looked ok. I
thought one final check and what did I find? A second dot this one cast
into the gear which turned out to be the correct mark. I had assumed the
painted dot was painted over the cast mark but it was not. The only
thing I could figure was the painted one was used during the balancing
or grinding. Just something to look for if you have to split the case.
