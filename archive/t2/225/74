Hello Listers:

A few weeks ago the Megasquirt fuel injection computer was mentioned here on
the list.  Is anyone using this setup?  I'd like to hear what real people
using this gizmo on air-cooled VW's have to say about it.  I've been
thinking about switching to FI on my 71 Bus, but I don't want to spend $750+
for an FI engine control box.  It seems the next group buy for the
Megasquirt will be in September, so I have some time to spend thinking about
it.  Or if I get really ambitious, I could make my own PCBoard, which is
what I do for a living anyway.
