Jim,

Ed(tbone....) has one on his bus and seems pretty happy with it.

I got in on the last group buy and am waiting for my kits(September).
Several folks on the MS list have put them in their Porsche's.  And
as near as I can tell, several people from this list and the vintagvw list 
are going to try them.

You can probably get an ECU for yours for a lot less than $750, but
for ~$120, you can build your own and make it do waht you want...besides
losing the AFM, double relay and resistor pack and ECU off of your current 
FI.

I want one cause I want one of those bus cams that say 
"not recomended for fi".

YMMV...of course.

Cheers ,dave
