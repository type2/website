Tony,

Check out the schedule 40 pvc fittings at your local
LOwe's or Home depot.  

That plastic stuff has gotta be a tinkerer's dream.

I think schedule 40 will take some serious abuse and they
may have y's like you need.  Wouldn't be usrprised if mcmastercarr had 
some good replacements as well.  Those people are amazing!

Cheers ,dave
