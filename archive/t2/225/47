It should be noted that a Porsche 901 trans is not going to make your bus 
cruise effortlessly at 75mph by itself.  Mike's tranny is backed up by a 
Porsche engine that is making ~50% more power than the average baywindow 
engine.  With a stock motor all that a tall 5th gear (or a tall 4th gear 
for that matter) is going to do is reduce your mpg and cause you to 
overheat your engine.  My 2 cents.
