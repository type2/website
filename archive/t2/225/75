It seems that my vehicles' demise usually start
when the air conditioner breaks.  Then the tranny
goes, then the oil consumption increases, etc. In the
case of my last American car, when it got to that
point, I traded it for my first type 2.  The vehicle
didn't stop getting real service, just became unenjoyable
to drive.
