73 Bus with a 2.o liter engine with Hydrolic valves.  Engine has maybe =
1000 miles on it.  Has never had much power.

Current situation: =20

140 lbs of compression all the way around.=20
Number 4 spark seems weak when in motor!  (pull sparkplug, ground and =
spark good and strong)
Pull the plug and insert compression tester, start motor and only 40 lbs =
of compression? =20
(Carb and Jets clean, valves adjusted correctly)
What could be causing the loss of compression after start up?

Could this be a split valve?

Any suggestions?
