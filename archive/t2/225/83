Even better, remove the plastic insulator from the crimp on terminal, strip 
the wire, slip a piece of heat shrink
tubing onto the wire, solder the wire inside the terminal, and shrink the 
tubing onto the connection with a
heat gun.  Sure, this takes a few more minutes, but the connection is now 
permanent.  I only wish Bob from England
had mentioned this before I'd done most of my wiring (I've gone back and 
re-done most of the connections properly).

I still carry crimp-on terminals, and an OLD pair of crimpers (like Chris 
recommends) in the tool kit for emergencies.
