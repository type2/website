Subject: Re: [T2] Rear vent windows

Though my bus was in good condition and the window opening was in good 
condition the vent window on my bus was VERY rusted. The one I pulled off 
of my parts bus was VERY rusted too.

I went with one piece replacement windows but I'd like to collect a could 
of replacement vent windows as the right ones show themselves.

I installed my front driver's side door glass last night and remarked to 
myself that both that window and the other side would have to come apart in 
the next couple of years so I could have the aluminum polished and 
anodized, the steel portion powered coated (drill the rivets and take it 
apart), and the whole thing reassembled. I figured I would go ahead an 
collect the pieces to reinstall those rear vent windows and do them the 
same way at the same time.
