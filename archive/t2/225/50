 True, that can mean several things....half my fuse box is dead-the left side....have not as of yet figured out why.  The directional lights in the dash do come on, both when either signal is turned on.  My headlights work, as do my dash lights....only one brake light works....

'jacked up.' In older cars, the wiring is often
tampered with to varying degrees. Unless it is a very
old car, these "changes" can often be corrected
without too much work and without replacing the
harness.

If, when you use your turn signal, the littles (either
the one on the dash or the external lights) come on
and stay on, the problem is likely your relay. If you
get nothing, the problem is likely wiring or a bad
turn signal switch.
