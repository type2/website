Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

We can pick these nits all night and there will still be another 200
solutions.
I don't have any tricky things to protect my Westy other than a Club.
Yes I know how easily the Club is defeated.
I'm sure that there are many very good anti theft systems available at
less than a hundred dollars.
If someone is a VW or Vanagon aficionado or Professional Car thief they
will get your van by loading it on a truck if they decide they want it
bad enough.
I stored a 20 foot drive on / off car hauler trailer for about a year
without tires and wheels or the hydraulic brake ball unit that had the
coupler mounted on it, guess what! Sure they measured the yoke built
their own coupler and brought their own tires and wheels and whoosh!
There went my $4000.00 trailer. I've still got the wench and coupler in
my garage so that is $800.00 worth of parts they didn't get.
I'm not willing to give up my Westy to thieves but of all the vehicles
stolen the VW vans and Vanagons have to be way down on the list near the
very bottom.
Over the years I've had numerous burglaries of my business and my home.
Not a pleasant thought but I'm not going to live paranoid worrying about
when its my turn in the barrel again.
On one occasion the thieves stole a truck and ran it through the side of
my concrete block building and walked with thousands in merchandise, the
poor guy that owned the truck had insurance that fixed my building and
his truck. Total cost to the insurance company, about five times what the
thieves took.
