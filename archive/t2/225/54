PB Blaster is better. WD-40 is pretty low ont he food chain. Or try some 
Kroil.

I'm told hot parafin is even better. (Candle Wax)

Saves weight. Go for it.

I see where $ is an issue but you are considering a high end rebuild or an 
AVP rebuild...
I'm confused. You've got a budget or not?

Build it yourself. Nobody is going to take the time and interest that you do.

If you buy a rebuild you won't get back your engine - you get back somebody 
else's engine with an unknown past. Keep your engine if you know it.
