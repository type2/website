I sent out an email weeks ago regarding signal relays....the thing is my signals do not work.  They did, until I took out the nonworking tach that a PO had in.  I was told it was the signal relay, but after further inspection I am not convinced.  All my wiring is totally 'jacked up' under the dash...when I followed each wire from the signals to the fuse box I discovered this.  Now my question-I have a 72 camper....there is little chance I can fix the existing setup.  I am either going to have to go for a new harness or pay someone.  I am not too thrilled at the prospect of paying someone to fix this more than I paid for the bus itself...so any suggestions?  I got the # to Wiring Works off the achives..and folks have said this is not "that" hard of an undertaking.  Is there another source I can try too?  Do these things come with good instructions? and what could I expect to pay for a new harness? RMMW has the complete, which due to the signal problem I assume I need, for 360 ish.....I would appreciate any suggestions on where to take it or how to fix it...I would even appreciate any attempts at help>>>:)
