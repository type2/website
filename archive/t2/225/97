Ftbllfn4lf,

Ya gotta remember what list this is though.

This is where folks talk about their T2's and the problems and a fair 
number of people on the list are "newbies" to their T2's.

Might not be much fun if every one here reported that their 30 year old 
buses were running just fine every morning, now would it?<big grin>


Cheers ,dave
