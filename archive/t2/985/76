OOPS, I meant to say that! You are right, I used faulty memory.

  The vacuum line from the airbox (air plenum) DOES NOT go to the air filter
  valve.  It goes to the fuel pressure regulator (O, P), and from the FPR it
  goes to the DECEL valve (S).  Other things kick in, but that's it for the
  5mm vacuum line from the airbox nib.
  At the airbox nib, I am reading 17 in hg,
  The other vacuum line goes from throttle body nib to distributor (M); and
  from distributor to air filter valve (K).
