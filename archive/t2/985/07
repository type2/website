Subject: Need advice and recommendations for replacement engine

Hello all,

My trip to Inuvik was cut short due to my magnesium block unleashing
an eight inch crack of fury. JBWeld held her for the 800 miles until I
got home which is where she is now parked.

KK held my 1600dp, which I lovingly crafted and it worked great, even
gushing oil from the rear of the block on the way back. Cruised at
55-65mph no problem to Chetwynd, BC and back. I do not currently have
the time to and money to reassemble the internals of a new engine and
the heads on my engine are in great shape.

What are the main advantages of a larger engine for the bus other
than, it will go faster.

Thank you,

Max
