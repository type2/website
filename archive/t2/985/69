Subject: Re: [T2] rocker arm spring

Be aware that this "spring" is the pushrod tube
retainer. When properly installed, it holds a slight
amount of pressure downward on the lip at the end of
the tube. I found that it was easiest to install it
not worrying about whether it was against the lip,
then after the upper part is seated in the grooves of
the rocker shaft carriers, reach in there with
needle-nosed pliers and pull upward until it pops into
place against the lip on the end of the tube. Repeat
for each. Easy. -BaH

 There is a spring that goes across the rocker arm
 assembly.
 
  
 
 The part that goes to the other side, is it above or
 below the two bolts.
 
  
 
 I think below and I am hoping this is not a "dumb
 question".
