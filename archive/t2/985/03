Subject: RE: [T2] How hot can a head get?

My Redline/Weber EFI module has a automatic retard feature if the oil
temperature gets beyond 300 degrees or so. Perhaps programming the
megasquirt to do the same at critical head temps, say 450 degrees would be a
real asset. Any higher than 450 degrees, the metallurgy changes in the
aluminum head and things can go bad quickly. At least that is what I
remember.

Perhaps you could program the computer to shut down ignition at 500 degrees
or to cut 1 and 3 on the injector cycle to "warn" the driver to pull over or
slow down?

Just a thought.

Hey guys,
I'm working with Megasquirt (MS2Extra to be exact) and I'm doing some 
code mods to allow the MS to handle aircooled temp ranges instead of 
being restricted to the current -40f to +215f limits.  This should make 
tuning for the aircooleds a little less problematic because then you'll 
be able to use the stock L-Jet (or other similar type) head-temp sensor 
instead of trying to fab up something funky using the GM coolant sensors 
to read the ambient air temp.

So, I am trying to set up the temp range in the include file and I want 
to know the hottest temp that you've seen on your heads.  I was 
initially going to set the limit at 500, but if you've seen 500f before, 
then I'm going to set the limit 600 - this is what the VDO head gauge 
maxes out at, too - I guess I just answered my question, but I thought 
I'd post this up for comment anyways...

I want the limit high enough that you'd never make it that high, but not 
too high because otherwise it messes with how much resolution I have 
within the 1024 individual temperature points.

Thanks!
Mike
