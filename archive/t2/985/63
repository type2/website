Nevermind. I got it figured out.

The nuts are Nylock nuts. I didnt use any thread locker.
Flat side towards the surface.

At first I couldn't get the drag link to seat all the way.
Turns out it doesn't. The bolt part of the drag link appears
tapered. Just tighten to 22 ft/lbs per Bentley.

Now time for a test drive. It looks like all the slack in
my steering is gone. Yeah!
