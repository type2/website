After getting the magnet sleeve seated completely, sometimes, especially 
with a non-Bosch rotor, you have to grind as much as 1.0 mm or so from the 
bottom of the rotor shorten it enough so that it doesn't make the 
distributor cap wobble as it turns (wearing out the distributor cap and 
rotor). A belt sander is handy for grinding rotors down. Grind for a few 
seconds with the rotor facing one direction, and then turn it 180 degrees 
and grind the same amount (to keep the bottom of the rotor square and even), 
until it's short enough.
