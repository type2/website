Karl's right, they're usually part of the phenolic block.

BUT

Just in case your block's gaskets are shot, you can scrape away the old
material and if your VW FLAPS carries EMPI, just buy their gaskets
skin-packed as a pair under EMPI 3227 (or 00-3227-0) - you'll need two pairs
- one pair for each block.  A bit of Gasgacinch to attach the gaskets to the
block.  It's one the few EMPI products made well and works well, from my
experience at least.
