It's always sad to see one leave the road for good.  Having said that ...

I always enjoy seeing buses when out and about.  I love to see them on 
the roads, parked in parking lots, and even rusting away in fields and 
side yards.  I guess that includes seeing them serve hot dogs to the 
masses of Nashville.  Having said that ...

The bus serving as a prototype for their franchise is another story.  I 
guess I'd sacrifice one for the cause, but an entire franchise is 
another story.  Neat idea though.  I'm bet they'll do well.
