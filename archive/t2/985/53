No such thing as too much lube!!!

I clean and slop moly grease in all 3 tracks at least twice a year. I
use moly even though it's black and ugly because it seems to be less
affected by the cold temps here in Colorado. White lithium would
probably be fine in TX.

I'm paranoid about having to deal with adjusting the door if something
goes wrong, so that thing gets lots of attention.
