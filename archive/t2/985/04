Right. While its melting point is really high (12200F) around 6000F it
will start to dissolve! Remember the temps inside the combustion
chamber are a bit higher than what you can measure from the outside.
Especially if there are hot spots.

Grab a chunk of aluminum and some pennies, toss 'em into a cast iron
pan on your stove, make alloys! Cast your own heads!
