Mike, you said:

I put a vac gauge in the line that goes from airbox nib to pressure
regulator and air filter valve. Only 11.5 at idle, and increased to a max of
16.5 as rpms were slowly increase- am I using the wrong vac takeoff point

The vacuum line from the airbox (air plenum) DOES NOT go to the air filter
valve.  It goes to the fuel pressure regulator (O, P), and from the FPR it
goes to the DECEL valve (S).  Other things kick in, but that's it for the
5mm vacuum line from the airbox nib.

The other vacuum line goes from throttle body nib to distributor (M); and
from distributor to air filter valve (K).

Still, I measure vacuum off the airbox nib.

At the airbox nib, I am reading 17 in hg, which increases to 22 in hg upon
deceleration, because the 22 in hg vacuum is the point where the decel valve
opens and lets tons of (only air)  from the 'S' tube into the decel valve,
bypassing throttle (D) and at the same time the decel valve feeds this into
the brake booster vacuum line (D -> C -> B), and from the brake booster
line into the airbox.

The is a one-way valve upstream in the brake booster line that keeps the
vacuum at the brake booster so it does not affect the power assisted brakes.

This mass of fresh, non-fuel air from the 'S' tube -> Decel valve -> brake
booster line -> airbox gives a very lean mixture that helps on deceleration,
or so I am guessing.  I can't figure out why, because this air is measured
as it goes through the AFM to the 'S' tube, and it is reported.

Good luck.

Barry
