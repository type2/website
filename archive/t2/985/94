just an addendum to that, I was watching the news the other night and they
were covering the Lake Tahoe fire and as they paned the camera along some
houses there sat a Bay still smouldering from the flames, based on where
it was located in the driveway etc. I suspect it was on the road and just
wasn't able to escape...  in the general scheme of things a minor issue
but another Bay bites the dust...
