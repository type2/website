Subject: Looking for a front clip for my 1978 westy

Hey Everyone,
I am FINALLY going to fix the front of my bus.  I just met with a guy 
that's going to fix up the front of the bus and now I'm in search of a 
RUST FREE front clip for the entire front of my bus from just above the 
bottom edge of the windshield down to the bumper.  I think that the 
fronts are the same from 73-79, but I could be wrong about the lower dates.

The metal guy that I'm working with doesn't like to work with new metal 
because he can't guarantee that it will fit, so I'm looking for a donor 
bus that has a good front end.  I saw some of his metal work and it's 
pretty amazing so I trust him on that one.

Any leads would be much appreciated.  I live in Long Beach, California...

Thanks!
Mike
