Subject: Re: [T2] Paper gasket alternate for FI intake at heads

I like the gasket paper idea. It is thicker than the standard gasket, but
with that added thickness, you are less likely to see it get sucked into the
manifold like Don's picture depicted.

I made a lot of those for my '74 thing when I was 16. Stuff works great!
