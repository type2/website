dayum, I don't even know 'em, nor did I hear about a burning bus (although I haven't talked to Mike yet. . .it wasn't sahara beige was it?) .  I live 1/2 mile from ground zero, fortunately the wind blew the fire the other way, my buses were in the driveway while I was off in San Diego for the weekend, flew back early to a lot of smoke but I was lucky, unlike some friends. . .
