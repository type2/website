Subject: Any tips for Las Vegas?

I am heading off to Las Vegas for a few days to do some work and want to
know if there are any cool shops or places I should visit that are VW
related?

I have been looking online at a new steering pin set for my '75 Riv, but
would rather see if I can pick it up in my travels than pay the shipping (I
mean, since I am already there and all).

Any suggestions?
