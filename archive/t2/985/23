Subject: Re: [T2] weird oil cooler

Not as wierd as the one I made for my 71 bus back around 1974-took the 
strainerplate and braised on 2 1/2" pipes- one covered over the takeup 
tube so oil could be sucked through a finned cooler and a Per 1 filter 
mounted in series between the body beams near the tranny.  The other 
just went into the sump.  I believe I used an oil pressure gauge and it 
worked with multivscisity oil.  In winter I bypassed the 
cooler....Always worried that a hose could snag on a branch or hump in 
the road, and ended up screwing a screen of some kind over it all.  Took 
a bit to prime after an oil change.

  Now, is it just me or is this thing going to require major oil
  pressure to keep oil flowing through it with all the bends and drag
  from the tubing?
