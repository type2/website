Subject: Buses Of The Corn 2007 - T-shirt and Event info!

Hi Volks,

Just a reminder that Buses Of The Corn is coming up in just six weeks  
from now...  Buses from early splits through to eurovans will be  
gathering in Brooklin  on August 10th to 12th for a schedule of  
activities that has something for everyone: It starts with Breakfast  
Burritos and goes on to include Tie-Dye Workshop - Swap Meet -  
Frisbee Golf - Bocce Ball - Bus Driver's Challenge - Corn Roast   
until we bring it to an end with a jam session at the Group Campfire.

Heber Down Conservation Area has a group camping area with room for  
plenty of buses... last year we saw over sixty buses attend and there  
was still plenty of room for more. There is plenty to do and see in  
the Greater Toronto Area, visit the "Local Information" link on the  
website for just a few of the local attractions.

A NOTE TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS, and those from other nations:
US and Canadian citizens are still welcome to cross the border by  
vehicle without a passport. Legal requirements stipulate a govt.  
issued photo-ID and birth certificate as acceptable. The law proposed  
to change this does not come into effect until December 31st, 2007.  
Although a passport is required to enter Canada by air or sea, there  
is currently no requirement for a passport at vehicle crossings for  
Canadian or US citizens.

OTHER DETAILS:
Heber Down's group camping area does not have hookups available. The  
electricity available on-site is reserved for medical and  
administrative purposes. Please bring your own drinking water, and  
quarters for the coin-op showers. Pets must be kept on a leash at all  
times. The area surrounding Heber Down has been extensively developed  
over the past few years and virtually anything a camper could need  
can now be found within minutes from the campground. If you have any  
other inquiries, please email for more information.


Happy Trails,
