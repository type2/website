	No problem.  Being as how 1' = 12" (ah, the nostalgia for the 
Imperial system  -  NZ went metric in the late 1960s), 10 ft-lb is 
for this practical purpose near enough to 111 inch-lb.

	BTW this here TORQUE is force (in this case lb force  -  not 
the same as the unit of mass lb)  TIMES  distance.  Thus the unit we 
mainly use is lb-ft, same as ft-lb.
	And while I'm out-teaching Teach, let me mention that all 
scientific measurements are in the form
		number     name of unit

The name of unit has *no plural*.
Thus we say, verbally, 'my camper is so many feet long', but when it 
comes to stating measurements formally, one writes   e.g

		1 yard  =  3 foot      (not feet)
	or
		  torque   =  10  ft-lb    (not ft-lbs)
