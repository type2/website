Subject: Re: [T2] Paper gasket alternate for FI intake at heads

I'm thinking the paper was to make up for imperfect
surfaces and the phenolic block is to block heat
transfer. Consider that anything beyond Gaskacinch or
weatherstrip adhesive (Gorilla Snot) will make for a
difficult removal in future. Maybe pick up some gasket
material at your FLAPS and hand cut it. It will be
much thicker of course. I used to use covers off JC
Whitney catalogs. 

Maybe use something able to withstand heat at the
bottom and something less aggressive for top. Both
should have capability of leveling small gaps in the
surface and use just a thin film. -BaH

 Hello, I am putting the 2.0l FI back together, but
 the paper gaskets for 
 either side of the phenolic block at the head
 intakes are missing from 
 the gasket kit.
 
 I have Loctite 574, high-temp red RTV, Durko, Curil
 all hanging about my 
 toolbox.
 
 Is it advisable to use one of those as an alternate
 or should I hunt 
 down the gaskets?  Thx,
