Same here.

Mike, I don't think you want to see temps over 450F at any speed.

Here's some 4th gear data from my bus (ambient temp was 55F). Keep in  
mind that those figures will rise against outside temperature.

MPH RPM CHT
50 2620 340F
55 2860 360F
60 3150 380F
65 3440 380F
70 3720 400F
75 4010 420F

CHT taken at #3 spark plug (wisest choice on the Type 4 engine).
