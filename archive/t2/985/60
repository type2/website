Subject: Drag Link Replacement

'79 Federal FI 2.0L

First off, the tool I got from Scott at germansupply.com is awesome!
That drag link came off so easy (for me). I laughed when it popped off,
because it popped off with such force, I would have NEVER gotten it
off with a hammer or other wimpy puller.

Ok, now that I have it off, a couple of questions.

1) The old drag link had a castellated nut and cotter pin. My replacement
   from Busdepot.com just has a nut, no place for a cotter pin.
   Should I use blue thread locker?

2) The nut has a rounded edge and a flat edge. I assume the flat edge goes
   toward the surface and the rounded edge out, correct?
