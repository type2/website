Too bad, but you came out of it very lucky
otherwise...
Pay attention to your brakes. You may have to loosen
the brake pushrod a half turn or a turn to keep the
rears from dragging. That's about the same angle mine
got nailed at. Had to loosen brake rod 1/8inch! Girl
who hit me spent hospital time and her new Ford Probe
was totalled. I drove the bus home. Her insurance
didn't even pay off what she owed on almost a year old
car. I did okay. -BaH
