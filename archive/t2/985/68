Subject: Re: [T2] dent in pushrod tube opions requested

Alan, what year bus is it? If it is a T4 motor, good
chance that it's okay. If a T1 motor, probably not
okay.

If your chasing an oil leak and it is a T4 motor, take
a good long look at the oil pressure idiot light
sending unit. Pull the connector off the top and reach
down and pull the rubber seal from around it, then
start the engine and watsh it while the engine is
running. They leak at various spots, but mostly around
the top rim. You can actually see the oil oozing out.
Remember to reinstall the rubber and the wire.

Leaking senders put the oil right in the cooling air
stream and it collects on everything - making every
item look like the problem. Another common source is
the dipstick tube bellows that you can see when lying
on your back looking up. Any oil leak in the airstream
is especially deceiving as the oil gets thrown about
by the airstream. -BaH

 Hi,
 
 
 
 I have a dent in a push rod tube at the drivers
 side, closest tube to the
 bumper.
 
 
 
 I was doing a repair to the motor to get rid of a
 leak, perhaps would be the
 reason for the leak?
 
 
 
 It runs along the push rod tube, about < inch and
 about 1/16 to 1/8 deep.
 
 
 
 No damage to the push rod at all.
