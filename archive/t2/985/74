Subject: rocker arm loose

As I am putting the engine back together there is one rocker arm quite a
distance away from the spring.

 

Torque is just tighter than hand tight.

 

I am spooked, but expect this is because the engine is at the bottom of the
cam for this valve.

 

Please confirm.

 

I am certain that the push rods are bottomed out in the dip in the hydraulic
lifters.

 

Thanks for the notes on the spring, got that one.

 

Alan
