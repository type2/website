I currently have 3 vehicles with the Pertronix operating in them.  On each and every one, it has been a B*#*h to get the magnetic circular thingy to fully seat on the distributor drive.  Makes sure it is fully seated and lined up on a horizontal plane with the magnetic pickup.  It it is, the rotor should fit as normal.  Greg
