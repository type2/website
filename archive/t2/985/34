Thanks Ted... I'm sure my wife will appreciate that choice as well.


Hey Kevin, thanks for the intel. I wish I could say I was going to be there
on Friday (actually I'm not since I can't stand Vegas heat), but I am
heading home on the 4th first thing.

As far as the breaking down thing goes, if my rental car does break down,
all it will do is affirm my disdain for American cars.
