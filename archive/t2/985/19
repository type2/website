Subject: Re: [T2] Paper gasket alternate for FI intake at heads

GG said:

Hello, I am putting the 2.0l FI back together, but the paper gaskets for either side of the phenolic block at
the head intakes are missing from the gasket kit.

The paper gaskets should not be separate. They come attached to the phenolic blocks. You should have gotten 2
new ones in your gasket set.

They are part number 022 129 707 F.

2 required.

Probably why the 1.8/2.0 gasket set is $10 more than the 1,7 set:
