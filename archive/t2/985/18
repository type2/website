Subject: Paper gasket alternate for FI intake at heads

Hello, I am putting the 2.0l FI back together, but the paper gaskets for 
either side of the phenolic block at the head intakes are missing from 
the gasket kit.

I have Loctite 574, high-temp red RTV, Durko, Curil all hanging about my 
toolbox.

Is it advisable to use one of those as an alternate or should I hunt 
down the gaskets?  Thx,
