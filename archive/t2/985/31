Subject: Re: [T2] Paper gasket alternate for FI intake at heads

Thanks, my local VW flaps has a set waiting for me, so off I go to get
them.  I must have the wrong gasket set, but this is the only thing
missing I have found so far. Lots of extra bits, though.

You should have gotten 2 new ones in your gasket set.
