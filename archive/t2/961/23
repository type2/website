Subject: Installed my USED thermostat today. :-)

Yep it's true, I've gone and used a used thermostat. I'm expecting my engine to blow up any second. ;-) Say a prayer to the VW gods for me.

Now to the question I really wanted to put out there. I installed the wire with a tiny amount of slack in it, as first time, it was guitar string tight, you could hit a high note on it. I gave it enough slack so that I could deflect it at the thermostat about 1/8". I'm assuming that making it ultra tight would stress the thermostat unnecessarily. Opinions?
Thanks,
Courtney
