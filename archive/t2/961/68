Subject: Re: [T2] engine tin placement

i have posted the pics of the tin on flickr.com.  type unknown tin in
the search box.  sorry if this is not the most efficient way to use
flckr.  i'm just learning.
if anyone recognizes this piece and where it goes, that would be a great help.
by the search box, i mean the one on flickr.

thanks,


jeremiah
