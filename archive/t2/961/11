I've used the spongy disks and they do work great, but will wear out very
quickly.  A fine bristle wire cup on an angle grinder is just as gentle and
lasts a lot longer, IMHO.  With any of the wire cups eye protection, full face
shield preferred, is a must.  The wires will come off and stick in you like
little arrows.JT Beaufort, SC
