Subject: [T2]burning points

what causes points to burn?
   
  76 hightop
   
  i have been having some problems with my points burning up to fast lately.
   
  i was told the condensor or the ignition coil was the problem possibly...
   so i replaced the condensor and points...
   
  i went on a 3 hour drive the other day and by the time i had gotten back home later the points had burned again from 22-26 on a 8cyl multimeter.
   
  so this is when i replaced the coil and they are still burning but not like they were...?
   
  What else could be causeing my points to burn up so fast...?
   
  i just dont get whats happening here? why i cant keep a set of points very long... this has been going on now for couple of months..
  one thing indeed i have gotten pretty darn good at adjusting them....
   
  I do not Like points at all though... they have made me very unhappy lately...just aggrivating...is all... to have to keep buying new ones and re adjusting them every few hundred miles...
   
   
  TIA
