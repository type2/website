	Right on, check, and this would be correct.

	These precautions haven't been needed on any motor I've 
worked on.  Are you sure there's syphoning when you switch off, 
absent those solenoids?

	I don't envy you your FI as opposed to carb, but I do envy 
your suction!  On my Brazilian Weber the vac nozzle for the dizzie 
has what we call in the Brit Empah 'bugger all' suction  -  I sure 
can't understand how it governs both retard and advance  -  anyhow it 
doesn't suck water even thru a big needle.
	I'm therefore resorting to the intake horn just below the 
carb, where there's a handy nozzle blanked-off in my motor; works OK 
but needs a v small needle, say 0.54 mm or I have to fill the water 
bottle too often.  Mark Dearing's idea of using that nozzle but 
presenting it with water-saturated air sucked thru a sparger is also 
worth trying.

	My main R&D motor, the mighty Renault 1108cc, with CR 8.5:1 
and a better shape of combustion chamber than VW's, is normally 40 
BTDC but when I slapped on an extra 200 or even 300 of advance it 
still wouldn't knock on low-octane petrol, and gave yet further 
improvement in economy.  The only drawback was that in starting when 
the battery was a bit low, the spark going off so early would tend to 
turn the motor backwards.
	I do hope more Volksfolk will try WI as I'm sure it has much 
to offer in engine longevity, fuel economy, cleaner exhaust gases, 
and power.
