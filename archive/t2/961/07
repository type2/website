No, the lifters seem to pump up in the normal timeframe. First thing in 
the AM they are a little noisy for less than a minute, then quite down 
usually and I won't hear them for the rest of the day, almost no matter 
how long I go in between drives.

Oil pressure is good I think. It sorta hovers around 35 PSI at idle, as 
it surges up and down.

Im not sure about the compression, it doesn't seem to have any loss in 
power. Im a little afraid of doing the compression test because of my 
CHT sender on the #3 side, pulling all of that tin apart again to make 
sure it doesn't get messed up when pulling that plug scares me.

Manual transmission.

I actually recorded some audio of this sound, if that helps.
Ill try and get it uploaded here in a bit.

Thanks,
