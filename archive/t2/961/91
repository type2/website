Subject: Re: [T2] auto tranny shifter box

don't know quite what it is called but am looking for the plastic housing
that encloses the shifter lever and linkage that sits on the cab floor
between the front seats...was checking something today and notice mine is
almost entirely cracked on the passenger side, works fine but looks
crappy.

will (hopefully) be at everybus where I could pick it up..

thanks
Bob
