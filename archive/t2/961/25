Subject: 68 DC: More Resto and Mod Photos

If any of you have been following my 68 Double Cab project "Sgt. Pepper"; I
have posted more detail shots on some of the mods. I'll try to post new
photos and updates every week. I'll get more descriptions and photos of the
EFI system very soon

Also, "Toffee" is up for sale if anyone is interested. I'm getting way too
attached and it was supposed to go about a month ago.sigh
