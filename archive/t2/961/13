Subject: Going offline temporarily

This time definitely: I am moving from Maryland to South Carolina; just now 
taking some email down-time while packing-up.  I will be checking email 
irregularly via the 'webmail' feature of my old ISP for awhile, but to keep 
mail volume down, I will have to unsubscribe in a day or two.

If you would like to reach me, or return a tool, the surest way would be by 
snailmail in care of my attorney -- address to

  Glenn McComas
  c/o John C Williams Law Office
  409 S Pine St
  Spartanburg,  SC 29302

I am looking forward to subscribing to the T2 list in a couple of months; 
meantime best wishes to all and auf Wiederheuren...  Glenn
