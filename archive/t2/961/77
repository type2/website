Subject: RE: [T2] H2O injection

Hadn't thought of hydrogen peroxide.  If you guys want to discuss this on
list, I guess that's fine, I just thought the forum at FMBC might work better,
or a Samba forum.
Anyway, started with a 23 ga needle, 35 deg total timing, going to boot around
like that for a little bit untill I'm sure it's doing ok, then make a milage
test.  Got a baseline best possible milage of 31 mpg 'hypermiling'.JT
