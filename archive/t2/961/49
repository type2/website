Subject: Re: [T2] new beam

New front beam's in...What a royal PITA...;-(
The old beam had KYB shocks and the upper
bolts caught on the frame. I ended up cutting
the horn to free it. Even on the ground, the 
upper bolts were so frozen that heat and PB
Blaster couldn't free the bolts from the shock
bushing. Same with the lower studs...;-(
The new beam went in quite easily. I used a
trolley jack in the center of the beam with
a section of 2/6 and a small canvas sand
bag to allow me to orient the beam and lift
it straight into position...;-)
It "just" takes time after that to reconnect
every system on the Bus that runs thru' those
torsion tubes...A dozen or so boxes with labels
and baggies of fasteners helps to "remember"
which goes with which and in reverse order...
I even noted the torque specs on each system
so I won't hafta do this again for another 275,
000 miles... ;-)
