I wouldn't even consider spending a lot of money on an RCA cable for the 
car.  One, you would probably never tell the difference between a "high 
quality" monster cable and your average rca cable, two, there isn't much 
AC interference in the car anyways, and three, the bus is so noisy that 
it would probably mask any differences that you *might* be able to hear 
between the two, which again, I think would be un-noticeable.  I'd just 
stop at your local electronics shop and see what they've got.  I found 
some really long 4-plug RCA cables that also had a signal line molded 
alongside the cable.  If worst comes to worst, just get a nice 
gold-plated connector to join two shorter cables, zip-tie the lines 
together so it doesn't come apart, and tuck it all away.

btw, I guess you do have to be careful of noise in one area.  Try and 
keep your amp power line far away from your line-level input wires going 
into your amp because otherwise you'll hear the engine whine.
