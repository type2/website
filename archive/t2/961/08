	There's a newer type of thick, very porous, dark plastic 
wheel that works a treat.  The factory that makes them in Auckland 
was taken over recently by Rubbermaid with a view to closure, but I 
imagine such a ferociously good device will go on being mfd 
somewheres.  They rip off paint phenomenally, but will be gentler to 
any metal that may lie just underneath (there probably is some).
