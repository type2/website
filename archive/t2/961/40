Hey Chris

I am about to install one also.
Are you saying the thermostat should be squeezed together tight such  
as hand strength or by channel locks???  I assume a good tstat is  
already in its fully contracted position at room temp while  
installing.  Should I put the known good used tstat in a freezer   
first ??? (assuming room temp is about 80 F).
