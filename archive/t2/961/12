Subject: RE: [T2] bodywork on my bus continued

Nathaniel,

I have done this kind of work a couple of times now. It will be MUCH easier
to call up Chris at BustedBus and have him ship you a rust-free door. The
metal is so thin and broad, it is difficult (but not impossible) to patch
without getting heat warping from the welder.

Just scuff and shoot the new color on the new door. POR-15 doesn't lend
itself well to accepting other paint enamels over it. It is strong, but
doesn't make a good basecoat. Inside the doors and other hidden areas, it is
excellent at killing rust permanently.

As for a step-by-step, the body shop you are going to use can guide you on
what to do to prepare it for them. Every project is unique and buses are
especially unique because of their uni-body and multi-layer construction.
All the body shops I have worked with have been more than willing to guide
me so they don't get a project that isn't ready for them.

GL,

Jon Stiles
