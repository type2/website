Subject: Re: [T2]burning points

Is your coil wired backwards?  I've read somewhere that having the  
coil wired up backwards can be a possible cause of poor running and  
points burning up quickly.

For a regular (negative ground) bus your condenser should be  
connected to the negative side of your coil.
