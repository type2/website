I would completely agree on the lamp cord/extension cord/whatever cord 
for the speaker-level wires, but I would probably still use coax for the 
line-level wires.  That way, in the event that you do get some noise 
induced into the line, that noise will be sent down the shield instead 
of down the signal line.
