Subject: Re: [T2] Really long RCA cable for Type2

Use lamp cord. Most hardware stores sell it for like 50c a foot. It
can handle a lot of power, and my brother-in-law (a Dolby audio
engineer) says it's at least as good as good as the mid range Monster
Cable and much better than most cheaper speaker cords. Put whatever
ends you need (RCA or whatever) and you're golden.

As Mike said, in a noisy environment like a bus, the difference
between a highly shielded wire and something cheap will be
unnoticable.
