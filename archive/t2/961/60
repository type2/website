Thought I'd forward this since there are sometimes a few aircooled Vanagon
guys here as well. (Also, the engine, if good, will fit a 72-up Bus if you
swap a few external parts from your old engine.) Contact Matt, not me. And
act fast; it goes to the crusher this weekend.

scrapper(crusher}I talked the into waiting till sat to crush it-body is
rough outside not so bad inside-no monetary gain for me just seemed wrong to
