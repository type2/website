Mike: That's a great feeling, isn't it? There is a small possibility 
that it was not the new distributor, but the act of jiggling wires, 
that lead to the fine running. I've seen this more than once on my 
fleet. If you have the time, stick your old distributor back in there 
and put this possibility to the test
