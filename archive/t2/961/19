Hi Jeremiah,

On my 79 2.0L FI,  you can sorta see the top here...

If you need something closer- or a full alternator pic- let me know; I'll
snap a few shots tomorrow morning before I begin reinstalling the FI/
intakes.

Cheers, Mike



oes anyone have a pic. of the tin, in place, that goes around the
alt. on a 75 or later bus engine?
