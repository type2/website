Subject: Sway Bars

I've read around a bit on the sway bar thing and am really thinking  
about trying to install a stiffer version before our haul to EB.   
Sway Away and Whitline seem like the two major options but I have  
read about possible problems with both.  Has anyone installed either  
of these kits in the past 6 months to a year that can provide feedback?

I am looking at the following:
