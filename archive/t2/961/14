I have heard from several people that the problem with
my thermo time switch and cold start valve may be a
loose ground. This is of course because of the faint
light I get from it when I am testing it.
One can't over emphasize how important grounds are in FI vehicles of any vintage and especially so for ones of our species.  Aluminum oxidizes to one of the best and hardest insulators known. Clean ALL grounds associated with the electronics in the bus.  Clean to bare metal and immediately treat with some oxygen excluding compound.  I use silicone grease. I get it from hot tub/spa suppliers.  A small tube will last a lifetime.  Dow Corning dielectric grease is preferred, but the O-ring grease is fine, and easier to find.   Cleaning and treating the grounds, and that also means the threaded, i.e. case, end of temperature sensors, cleaned up a host of fuel injection problems with my bus.  Just because you get a faint glow on your trouble light or a "low" reading on the ohm meter does not mean you have adequate ground.  Scrupulously clean and step by step though the wiring to make sure those old wires are solid through each connection (and between them of course).  This will
 cure almost all bus FI problems.  It is a very simple system and proven reliable if the basics are kept up to snuff. jon
