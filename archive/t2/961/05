Subject: loose cam bearing?

About 6,000 miles on my AVP rebuilt motor, and starting back in October 
it started making a funky sound.

the local mechanic said it sounds somewhat like a loose cam bearing.

When you first fire up the van (81 aircooled, fed model) you can of 
course hear the lifters banging away for a few seconds and then they are 
properly pumped up and sound just fine.

If I rev the motor, the lifters banging sound fluctuates as you rev up 
and down until they are pumped up.

This noise on the other hand doesn't seem to start until after about a 
minute or so after the lifters have quited down - and is a completely 
separate sounding noise from the lifters when they are pumping up.

It sounds like something is loose somewhere in the middle of the motor, 
just clanking around when it is idling low. If you give it gas, you 
can't hear the sound again, it just goes away completely (seemingly.) - 
not to reappear again until the motor goes back to a really low idle.

I run a CHT/OP/OT gauge and the temps are seemingly normal, for an 
aircooled motor anyway (hits close to 425 when on a long drive at about 
65 mph.)


Is this even possible? Or am I shooting in the wrong direction?

Thanks for any tips, suggestions or tomfoolery.

Chris
