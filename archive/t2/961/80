Subject: Re: loose cam bearing?

I am interested in hearing this sound clip also.  I have an avp long block
in my bus (about 9 years old, probably under 20k on the engine), and it has
had a clatter at idle.  They attributed it to a hydro lifter, but I don't
think it is that.  I have not tore it down to investigate further, though,
either.  Other than any and all recommended lifter priming procedures,
which eliminate that lifter clatter at start up, but have done nothing to
the at idle clatter I get after the engine is warmed up.  I suspected a
loose valve seat, but the spark plugs indicate no foul play there... I will
keep watching this thread with anticipation.
