Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump/FI question of the day 

I just noticed another posting from Dave Maurio, a 76 Westy owner, under 
the subject line "electrical woes,"  addressing the same general questions 
as my post of a few minutes ago. Only, he includes an address of a web site 
with pictures of the starter solenoid and the wires in that area. His 
pictures show the two upper male solenoid push-on blades, but only one of 
them has a wire attached. You can see the lower push-on blade, although it 
is not clear in the photo that it is even a blade connector. Everything is 
MUCH newer looking on my bus....

Anyhow, I thought that this series of photos might help us communicate.

I really don't know what the non-double relay red push-on wire is for 
either. He mentions that his is badly disintegrated and he also is 
questioning its function. Hope we can find some answers.

End of postscript. (I am copying this to Mr. Maurio.)

I'm on the digest and appreciate a carbon copy of anything you send to the 
tytpe2 list.

I am sitting at my computer, live, at  <doyt(-at-)buckeye-express.com>   hoping 
this day under the bus will go better.
