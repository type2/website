Subject: starting problems

I think I know the answer but would like to make sure!

71 Westy, with practically a new starter and solenoid, bosch, engine gets 
hot, park it, come out a few minutes later turn the key, nothing but lights 
on the dash, not even a starter click, 1/2 HR or so maybe more maybe less 
goes bye turn the key and wallah I'm off and running.

So I need to but the Bosch starter relay right? Just wanted to make sure. 
Thank you.

I've had this bus since 1985 and I'm mainly into motorcycles now, anyone want 
to trade it fir and year BMW motorcycle?
