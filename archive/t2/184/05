Subject: 79 westy wind noise


    Hi all,

    Thanks everyone for the information on the wind noise coming from the
front end of my '79 westy. Most said it was the fiberglass top, so I took it
off and tested out the van and that was definitely the problem. I will order
a proper seal for it. Thanks again -- The replies are copied here just in
case someone has the same problem, and it is a bit deceiving because the
sound appears to be coming from the dashboard.

It is probably from the fiberglass top as I had something very similar with
my '79.  Check the condition of the rubber seal that goes around the base of
the fiberglass luggage rack over the cab.  If there is an air gap between
the bottom of the seal and the body, then that's the problem.

Pull the seal down until it contacts the body all around and this should
take care of the problem.

I get that too on my '78.  It is the fiberglass top. I've tried to look if
some of the retaining bolts were loose or something but everything is
fine...  It's probably just the design of the thing that makes it vibrate
at a certain wind velocity...  Maybe if you find a way to fill that gap
between the frame and the fiberglass it would cut the wind going in there
thus removing the vibrations...  just an idea.


Take care,

Check the seal to the fiberglass top. If air gets under it will drone and
vibrate like mad.
