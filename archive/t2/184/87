The only problem is that it is too small to flow enough gasoline just like 
the first electric solenoid I posted.

The only cheap alternative I know of right now is a used gas tank selector 
valve from a full size Ford p/u. To stop fuel flow you set the switch to 
the gas tank that isn't there (and to the nipples that have been capped off).

Cheap and basic.
