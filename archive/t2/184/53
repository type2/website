The '78 Mercedes I drive has the bolt setup also. It has had no problems
in ~500,000 Miles of operation (It hasn't had a days rest since it was
purchased) with loose wheels. 
It actually has the opposite problem, when you get them on there with
the correct torque 
they are a pain to get back off. You would be in quite a situation if
you were on the side 
of the road without a long pipe to put on the wrench.

VW (and others) have used that bolt design for many years.  However i 
have heard of many vintage vehicles (several brands) with wheel torque 
problems.  As far as i know all were resolved by using new bolts/nuts.  
Another problem with lug centric wheels is that it can be difficult to 
tell if the wheel was properly seated.  What is strange about this is 
that it is very rare that you will lose a wheel from lugs.  Generally 
your vehicle handling will tell you something is wrong long before you 
separate from your wheel.  Ball joint separation or axel nut loss are 
more likely causes of lost wheels.
