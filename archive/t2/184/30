The all great and powerful list,

will a steering lock and ignition switch from a 70 bus work in a 73? =
Mine is gone and has a bug ignition switch spliced in.  Very scary.  =
Sparks and stuff.  I need the electric half, key half and steering lock. =
 I just did not want to spend the $100 at RMMW.  If anyone has any =
suggestions or insight.
