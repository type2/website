they only come in one size for diameter that I know of, my local FLAPS had a
generic one that had 3 different lengths ,I think I used the longest , just
look at the plug and match it up . Hope that works for ya, You might also
have a crack in the head , but the helicoil is a cheap way to test it. Just
follow the directions on the package for the helicoil.
