WELL the list just saved me a lot of headache....not something I didn't
know about (the list too) but when you are expecting one thing and
something totally different wacks out it takes someone here to mention the
obvious that you overlook.

I have been nursing an older head until I take the engine out for
something else then will stick on the rebuilt one...well when exhaust
system sounds like it blew up you at first think, "there goes the
head" and gird your loins (what ever that means) and prepare yourself for
an engine pull,  well someone here mentions "did you check to see if you
spit a spark plug" 
  noooooooo I'm too busy getting ready to pull the engine.....check sure
enough plug is just lying in the hole....screw it back in, engine runs
fine...list saved me a lot of kicking myself when I found out I had pulled
an engine to change a spark plug......duh.....

THANKS 
I owe the list a big one
