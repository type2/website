Subject: Re: [T2] escutcheon tool

Get a cheepo 1/4" drive deep socket to match the outside dimension of the
slot. For example, on a 411 941 531C headlight switch the slot is 13mm long.
[don't ask why I have a 73 412 h/light switch sitting here....] For this
example you would need a 3/8ths socket and a bench grinder. Grind down each
side of the end to leave a square edge the width of the slot.
Wallah!    An inexpensive escutcheon tool.
