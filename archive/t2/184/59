Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

Hello List,

The subject of gas cut foo valves made me think of the
cut off valve used on my motorcycle's gas tank. Here
is an article about converting a generic petcock to
use on a sx650. Any way, I thought the picture could
be helpful. I know that these are made to screw
directly into a gas tank but you could just take a
large diameter piece of fuel line and slip it over the
threaded end with a hose clamp. then, you would just
need to buy one of those plastic fuel line step down
fittings and connect that to your fuel line from the
tank. If I am not mistaken, the filter on it comes out
if it makes it easier. This little gadget only costs
about $15.00 from what I understand. 

Here is a link to the article.

I have not tried this conversion but it might be
plausable. That is my $0.02 worth. Have a great day!
