Ive used varied things to get them out. but a pair of 8" channel locks and
grab em and twist back and forth and work them out has done it for real
stubborn ones.
The 2 parts will likely be frozen together so then you can get a serious
grip with pliars and vise grips and get them seperated.
I usually clean them up with the dremel and anti sieze them well.
