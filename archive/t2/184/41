Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump/FI question of the day

Very close.
If you crawl under the Bus you will notice 2 wires to the push-on connection
on the solenoid unlike a carbed Bus which only has one.

The second wire runs straight from there up to the double relay.  When the
key is turned to start, that wire is energized and it closes the double
relay and provides power to the fuel pump.

Once the engine starts, the starter motor stops and so does the current to
the relay via that wire.  However by then the flap in the air flow meter has
deflected and allowed a set of contacts inside to close, and this provides a
12v signal to the double relay to keep the relay closed and the fuel pump
running.

If the engine should stall, the flap will close all the way and an arm
attached to the flap breaks the fuel pump contacts and the fuel pump stops.
