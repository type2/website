probably type 3-sender is on the cooler. Just tap it for a sender.

Hi Guys,
Have a 56' single cab that someone in the past put in a 1600. When pulling
the motor to freshen it up, I couldn't find the oil pressure sender. Upon
pulling the motor found that the oil pressure sender area was never tapped.
There's no machine marks, plugs, etc, anywhere for a oil sender. Any ideas
what this block came out of ? Motor runs great.

MANY THANKS,
Jim In Nashville "Music City"
