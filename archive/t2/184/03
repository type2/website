Subject: Re: [T2] WANTED: dual circuit brake light switch

> If anyone out there has a dual circuit brake warning light switch that they would like to sell, please Pmail me.  I am trying to get my bus back together after someone let it rot for 5 years.  Perhaps someone knows of a source on the net to buy one.  This is the light assembly that is in the dash.

What year bus?
