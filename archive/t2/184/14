Subject: Re: [T2] question: replacing rear brake shoes

I tried the long bot idea also.  It did not work, I think that the threads
in the star adjuster we not good.  I found success with vice grips and a pry
bar.  This was the biggest pain for rear brakes.  Boy was I glad when those
finally came out.  Be careful to not break off the clips that keep the stars
from inadvertently turning.
