You need a tuned pair - a hi and a low. You can get regular tuned horns at 
any FLAPS. Two VW horns would sound rotten - like two instruments slightly 
out of tune.

Maybe they would sound so bad people would get out of your way.... <grin>

I plan to run air horns for the highway and the regular horn for in town 
with a toggle switch for whatever mood I'm in.
