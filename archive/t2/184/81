An engine in the middle of it's service life needing
a minor repair does NOT necessarily have to be
completely rebuilt or replaced with a new engine.
Good oil pressure and compression are the key factors.
Crankshaft endplay tells a lot about the mains.
If there are NO specific defects in the bottom end,
it may continue to provide good service for a very long time.
Have the  $2.00 valve seat replaced and that head rebuilt.
Want to get fancy ? Do both heads. They probably both need it.
Replacing one head only will require matching compression
chamber volumes, this is what we call "cc the heads ".
You would be extremely lucky to buy a single matching
replacement head, so have yours measured and rebuilt.
Replacing lifters is tricky, you may need a cam, and for
that, "Why not split the case and do it all ? It is surprisingly
simple in there " :)....
