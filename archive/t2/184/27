Chuck, 

I have a book I believe is called "bosch fuel injection systems", can't remember the author's name, which may be the best resource. I've looked thru it only lightly, as of yet, but being in elec. engineering trade, I would imagine a complete schematic would've stuck in my head.

Will take a look at lunchtime. (west coast time)
