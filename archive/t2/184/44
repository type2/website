Jamie,

I'm not sure that I believe this(no disrespect here).  Powdercoating has 
to get up to 400 degrees before flowing...right?

The story doesn't talk about them going down a long incline at that point 
and I also cannot believe that all 5 lugs would fall off instantly at the 
exact same time.

Dave,
I'm kind of befuddled too over all this loose wheel talk as of late. All of
a sudden it seems to be a fad or something. "well, my bus lost all five
wheels before I knew what was going on". Come on guys, I have a 67 SC and I
have to take it over to the tire shop so they can break the lug bolts loose
before I change tires. Seems that after only a couple of months driving the
darn things cinch down so tight it bends my X wrench trying to get them off.
My four bolt 71 transaxle assembly on my trike has the same problem, the
longer I drive the tighter they get. This last time I even wire brushed the
threads on the lugs and in the receiver holes and applied a little grease.
No dice. When the winter rear tires had to come off, back to the tire shop I
went. They like seeing me around there hoping I will buy more tires and
getting a good look at the truck. At least they have good coffee since I
have to go there. By the way, My beautiful white powder coated wheels are
painted in the lug hole and the paint there is still intact. That powder
coating can take some abuse!
