Steve & others,
I called the vendor I got the drag link from. They said the part number 
on the box was right. The only had one drag link in stock and it was for
a 67 bus. He couldn't really describe it well and didn't have the other 
to compare to. He did mention he heard something like this about the
78 and 79 buses before. I wonder if it different from the other bays. I 
just can't see having to cut the cross member hole larger so the drag link
can clear it. So still wondering?

Bill
