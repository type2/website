Very close.
If you crawl under the Bus you will notice 2 wires to the push-on connection
on the solenoid unlike a carbed Bus which only has one.
The second wire runs straight from there up to the double relay. When the
key is turned to start, that wire is energized and it closes the double
relay and provides power to the fuel pump.
Once the engine starts, the starter motor stops and so does the current to
the relay via that wire. However by then the flap in the air flow meter has
deflected and allowed a set of contacts inside to close, and this provides a
12v signal to the double relay to keep the relay closed and the fuel pump
running.
If the engine should stall, the flap will close all the way and an arm
attached to the flap breaks the fuel pump contacts and the fuel pump stops.

OK, Sean, now lets look at it from my perspective.....flat on my back under 
the rear of my 76 Westy, with the original engine and FI system:

I look straight up and see the starter solenoid. It has a big center bolt 
with a nut, and a two heavy red wires ending on that bolt and held by the 
nut. At the side of the bolt is a huge bare braided ground wire attaching 
to the solenoid, close to the bolt. Below the bolt there is a male push-on 
connection blade, and above the bolt there are two male push-on connection 
blades.  I see two wires coming to this general location that have push-on 
type female connectors. Does it make any difference which male connector 
they are on? Are a total of three male connectors around the solenoid 
available to me, for attaching these two wires.

Are the two male connectors _above_ the bolt on the same circuit as the 
single male connector below the bolt? Saying it another way, does it make 
any difference which of the 3 blades get which connector? Myabe even the 
two upper blades are different. I can't really assume anything.

With the double relay wire stuck onto the LOWER male connector at the 
starter (and the other one on the most lateral of the two upper connector 
blades), my engine has been cutting out about 8 seconds after it kicks 
over. In this configuration, I still haven't been able to get it to idle 
without stalling, although it can be kept running longer than 8 seconds by 
running it at about half speed, but even then it tends to go into a slowing 
down and stalling mode very easily. Racing the engine does keep it going, 
and seems to be the only way to keep it running for long periods.

With the double relay wire on the UPPER and more medial male connector at 
the starter, the engine starts easier and runs stronger, as long as I keep 
the RPMs up, but it still stalls when I try to let it idle.

So, you see, I am reaching for straws, and the solution might be getting 
those female push-on connectors on the correct blades at the 
starter......or not.  So I'm asking. Is there any difference between the three?

Maybe the other (non-double relay) push-on wire should be on the lower male 
connector. Haven't tried that yet.

Maybe there is a third wire that ISN'T present but should be, to go on one 
of those available male connectors.

Hoping to get some details from you, Sean. I may be on the final track of 
getting this newly rebuilt engine to run right. And you have been a HUGE 
help already.
