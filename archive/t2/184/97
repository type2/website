Subject: Re: [T2] Re: tightening rims/ wheels coming off

Anti seize on the threads is a good idea.
I've done this as preventive maintenance for 30 years, and never lost a
wheel, but saved my back when it comes time to change / rotate the
tires.

The anti-anti seize / grease story is an old wives tale.--:>)

I resemble that remark!! 
I *do* grease my lug nuts and the contact area....very lightly.

Hmmm- 80 ft lbs - I gotta stand on the sliding handle to get off the
nuts sometimes- a lot must be too tight (of course there is friction
involved here- who greases their lug nuts)? I don't stand on them to
tighten, but do give it an "umphhh pull/push until I hear that "creak".
So a 16" grab on a sliding handle needs at least 60 lbs of "umphh"
applied. If you pull up that's like picking up a bag of cement- ok for
those with good backs- others, I'd say make sure you are setting to pull
down and even step on it if you only weigh 110 lbs! I never let them use
an air tool on installing rims BTW, I specify hand tightening and check
it myself.
