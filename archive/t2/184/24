Robert K & The List at Large:

	Yes, indeedy, it was a good show...

<begin broad humor now>

	You and many others similarly situated received a visit from the
elusive and highly secretive "Save the Bays" Faerie.  Word on the street is
that The STBs Faerie (a distant relative of the "Missing Parts Replacement"
Faerie, periodically observed at East Coast Bus gatherings, we hear) had
flown in after personally dropping off stickers in Canada, Australia,
Mexico, The Netherlands, and a number of other undisclosed Northeastern U.S.
locations.

	Boy, were his/her arms (wings?) tired...

but The STBs Faerie has promised that very, very soon, "Save the Bays"
stickers will be adorning Bay
Window buses planet-wide.  All good little Bay Window pilot's rides will be
sporting
one for the holidays this year, if The STBs Faerie has his/her way.  At
least, that's what our sources are telling us...  YMMV, etc. ad nauseum.

	That is all...
