Hold on a minute there guys.  That mount on the C-pillar looks to be way 
too low for a seat belt anchor.  In an accident, if the upper mount is too 
low the shoulder belt will tend to compress one's spine as the body is 
thrown forward.  Compare the height of this so-called mount on the C-pillar 
to the one on the B-pillar (for driver or front-seat passenger).  See the 
difference?
