Oh no.  Value is whatever arbitrary figure you
pick.  Just read an ad on thesamba.com by a guy
who took his email off the bus ad because he
didn't want to be bothered by inquiries and was
only going to accept $5500 AND NOT A DIME LESS!!!
FIRM!!!  IT'S WORTH IT!!!!!!!

The ad had been running for about a year.  :)It's
worth what someone will pay you for it, and not a
dime more.  I wish they hadn't stopped teaching
economics (and civics) in hI-sKuLEs.
