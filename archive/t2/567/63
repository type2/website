I don't start getting cold until the temps hit 60. 


Shoot... I don't put away my motorcycle until it snows or the temps dip below freezing.... <grin>

I made the ride from Chattanooga to Cookeville (90 miles roughly) from a visit (in 1997) with my girlfriend (now wife) and saw on my keyring thermometer that it was 27/28 deg and it was flurrying. 

That is how I set my low temp personal cutoff... 

I get along with a cold VW just fine... <grin!>
