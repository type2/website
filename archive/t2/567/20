Subject: Re: [T2] Switch Bad?

Sure sounds like the switch isn't working .

Check it out with a circuit tester.
 
 
<<When I turn off the igniton switch in my 76 it has no effect. It is
just like the on position. I have to pop the clutch to kill the engine
and then disconnect the negative battery terminal to turn off the lights
on the dash. Is this typically indicative of a bad switch or a wiring
issue? Thanks!
