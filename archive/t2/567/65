The pump runs at a constant speed as long as the engine is running.  If 
the pump is noisy, I would say you most likely have:

* Clogged fuel line.
* Clogged fuel filter.
* Clogged tank outlet.

Since you said you changed the filter and it improved things, it could 
be that your filter is clogged again.  If it is 1 month old, it could 
mean you have nasty goop in your tank that is coming loose and clogging 
your filter.

I had a similar problem -- turned out, there were bits and pieces of 
junk (old fuel filler restrictor and other random things) floating 
around in there and clogging my tank outlet.  I had my tank removed, 
boiled out, and relined.  Problem solved, tank is better than new.
