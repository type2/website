I should have used Pigs instead,, then when the pigs get wings,, hahaha!

Sorry,,  <regaining composure>

To get back to trying to help Greg,,  It was worried that he has an
over pressure problem because his T is too small, <is that getting too personal?>  LOL

I want to clarify *my* situation.  The T that works.

I installed a TEE in the bottom of my 1974 tank, to install a Fuel injection
system.

I used 2" of 3/8" steel fuel line, which I flared the end,, then hammer tap tap
tapped it over <peened> so it effectively had a washer on the one end.
Reasonable facsimile to the factory outlet tube... but much bigger inside diameter!

I drilled out the Factory Tank outlet coupling nut,, so that 3/8" tube would
just pass thru it. It sat in there nice and sealed up with the gasket.

Now I have a new ... albeit still a single outlet from the bottom of the 74
tank. Instead of the 2 nipples [outlet/return] on the 78 tank

The factory fuel injection tank outlet calculates to 15.9 square millimeters
The 3/8" line I installed calculates to 56.75 square millimeters

That is 3.5 times the area,, I figured I needed at least 2 times the area to be
equivalent to the factory tank.

So my hamsters can do syncronized swimming in that larger area
without causing any friction or increasing the pressure

Oh,, and also, I used a very large T ,, then reduced it to the stock return hose and
filter hose

I *think* Greg has proven this is NOT his problem by running a return line to an open
container with no restriction. Effectively having the one tank outlet feed the pump
just
like stock,, and the return passing back to the tank via the filler neck.
