Subject: Re: [T2] Just added up the cost of parts that I want/need for 

I assumed I would find deals around, or some stuff used, etc. But I was
budgeting based on BD's price list. Not counting shipping (oops).

Sometime this fall I'll start my quest to find used HEs. I realized that I
don't need heat, but the family does. ;-) My wife gets cold if it's under
72. I don't start getting cold until the temps hit 60. We drive each other
nuts. It's gotten to the point where she keeps a blanket in the car in
winter so she can bundle up while I'm cruising with my window open and a
T-shirt on.
