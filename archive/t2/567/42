Fluid Hydraulics 101 .... Fluid flows to the point of least amount of 
pressure. I am not stating that the above statement is false. There are 
certain dynamics that would apply to the head pressure at the Tee/Splitter, 
but they would be so miniscule that I will not bother. This type of 
connection should work fine. But I have never run a fuel pump through a 
regulator in "series" to another pump to see the end result, meaning that it 
is basically pumping to itself. Can a pump increase it's own pressure? Would 
it increase the pressure to the pump the second time around? Seems very 
remotely possible, not likely.  So this being said and that "series" would 
be a stand alone deal. If everything is connected and the fuel ring is 
losing the slightest amount of pressure through the injectors and plenty 
more back at the Tee/Splitter. It should work.
