Subject: POR-15 and TK---

Ok--here is a true revolation for all of the proponents of the POR
products--and my persistant anti quickie solutions to any sort of rust
repair work.

I have in the shop a Daewoo tw20 end loader---large wheeled 4 yard
bucket type machine.
The thing is only 2 yeras old, and it was a victim of calcium chloride
all of it's life at a local private airport--thta's all it was used
for--loading salt.

The floor inside of it is in terrible shape, and I removed the rubber
mat, and tossed it--the metal below it is pitiful.

The step ladder on the side of it is rusted beyond belief--
The battery box cover's are a nice rusted patine type look.

Yuck.

So here's what I did today--and this will be the ultimate test of the
derusto treatment.
I wire brushed the cab floor,and took a stell putty knife to it to
remove the loose rust and crud--and blew itall outa there with an air
hose--

I applied a coat of the POR product--and when it is dry--I'm laying a
heavy coat of urethane bed liner in leauof replacing the rubber matt.

I'm sandblasting the ladder--the battery box cover's , and the front
fender's--slapping a coat of this allegid miracle in a can--and laying
some of the black bed liner on top of that.

This will be a true test of the durability of this stuff---which Istill
feel is hokus pokus--but I do know the bed liner will last--done this to
many a cab of a machine instead of replacing a worn out rubber mat with
great success--

I just wanted to seal down the crummy floor of this particular unit
because of the salt is was in and really caused the floor to be
Ca-Ca--and lumpy, and it would take me forever to get it straight to
refinish in std. painting proceedures--

I may be eating my words on this product--and I will post the results in
time--

I will say this---

After I brushed a coat of this stuff on the flor--the little bit I got
on my hands and arms wouldn't come off with laquer thinner--this may be
an indication of it's durability--but I ain't giving in yet--:>)

Stay tuned--:>)
