I've found every Home Depot hopeless for metric. Lowe's has always been better and ACE has always been expensive. Out here we have OSH and Mintons and a couple of others. OSH might have metric and stainless but not both, and the stocks are always low.

Finding the local company through the yellow pages that can order you any kind of metric fastener will do you well in the long run. For example, much of the hardware used in the chassic has automotive thread (large 12.9 bolt, fine thread) and you'll never find that at ACE.

No, I said the part numbers are not made from the item numbers listed in the illustrations:

If you get desperate enough, the dealer will have:

N 011 006 24 (M6 nut)
N 012 226 5 (M6 washer)
