Subject: speedo/odometer gauge replacement

Hi,

I remember someone linked a web page where they detail the replacement
steps for a speedo/odometer unit. I can't find it, anyone know the link?
I could use any info or tips you think I may need. I have a replacement
unit, suppose to work:-) My speedo works but the odometer doesn't. I
want to roll it back to zero before I install it, can I?

Thanks for all the help:-)

Peace

Meg
