Many racecars use this method too.  Sounds like a good idea except that the 
bar would have to be mounted right in the middle of the window (for the 
rear seat at least).  I think you'd have to have two (very strong) verticle 
bars spanning the rear window and have a crossbar mounted between 
those.  I'm sure it would work but I'm not sure how it would 
look.  :-(  The bars themselves are also dangerous - they would have to be 
well padded - and I'm not talking about the pipe insulation commonly used 
for this purpose, which will not protect your head in an accident.
