O.K. Ted no more cherries for you while you are
working on your bus...(chuckle, snort, Hehehe)All
kidding aside, get yourself a small hose that you can
get into the spark plug hole and connect it to a big
vacuum cleaner hose and see what you can vacuum out of
the cylinder, something laying around must have gotten
in it without you seeing it, have had it happen to me,
just gotta do some cleaning.. Phil
