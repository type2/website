Just curious:

Where to makers of aftermarket parts (for example; fuel pumps, sensors, wheel 
cylinders) get their specifications?  Do they reverse engineer OE parts? Do 
they obtain specifications from the OEM?  Do they merely re-label parts from 
other makers?  Also, I kinda remember something about the OEMs being legally 
required to provide specifications to aftermarket makers?  Anyone know about how
this works?
