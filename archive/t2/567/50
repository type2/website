Subject: urgent help, how to install Earl's AN fittings

Esteemed list,

I got my spankin new 1776 longblock installed yesterday and primed the oil
pump (full flowed) and cranked for oil pressure, good news is this engine
holds lots of pressure, bad news is it is leaking out of one of the BRAND
NEW braided stainless oil lines that the engine builder made.  Fittings are
dry as a bone-must be a fluke bad hose, I can see where it is leaking.

I'm referring to 1/2" ID braided stainless oil hose (oil pump to full-flow
filter) with "Earl's" blue and red swivel-seal flare fittings.  I bought the
hoses with the fittings installed.  I have obtained a replacement hose, but
don't know how the fittings work--do these just screw on the end of the hose
or what? does anyone know?  I tried an online search but running out of
time.

Any advice appreciated, I was supposed to have everything out of the house
yesterday, the landlord is having it painted so I have a day or two to
slide, but it would really hurt to have to call AAA to tow this bus over
just a hose!

TIA,
