I thought I posted about this... (sorry!)

Smell is gone. After ripping out anything fabric short of the seats
themselves and letting it air out for a coupla months, PLUS scrubbing as
much as possible (and getting rid of the little turds I found all over the
inside.. ewww...) It smells just like a normal used car now.

When I replace all the upholstery and padding, and install new
flooring/carpets it should smell much like a new car. :-D
