Subject: Recurring acceleration problem - fuel pump?

I would like to describe my difficulties in the hopes that someone might
recognize the symptoms.  Ok, I9ve had this problem where after a while on
the road (2-3 hrs) suddenly the bus starts to lurch.  Increase pressure on
accelerator makes me go slower.  The first time I thought it was a FI relay
on one side of the motor.  Cleaned it and fixed it.  Checked all vacuum
hoses and connections.  Next time I thought it was the fuel pump, it was
really singing.  New fuel filter.  Seemed to work, at least the pump quieted
down.  Well, this last time was after crossing a major pass and about 3 hrs
of driving.  This time the fuel pump started to sing again, and its only
been about 1 month since I changed that fuel filter.  I haven9t checked the
amount of gas that is pumped in x amount of time yet.  I suspect the fuel
pump itself might be the culprit, or perhaps a sensor is not controlling the
pump correctly.  Maybe my gas tank is full of gunk which has already got my
new fuel filter clogged.  Dunno.
Thanks, Nik
