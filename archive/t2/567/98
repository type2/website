Subject: Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

This if for any other wet-behind-the-ears bus owner who buys a bus with 
low mileage tires and thinks "cool, I won't have to replace those for a 
long time." Um....WRONG!  I learned the hard way that tread life or 
even sidewall appearance is a poor indicator of tire safety. These 
tires looked better than the ones on my daily driver and yet...BOOM.

If you want to see what happens to a "practically new" tire when the 
tread separates at 60 mph, follow the link below.
