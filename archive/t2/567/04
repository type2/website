Subject: Fuel Pump Relay ..

So I ordered my Bosch Fuel Pump relay for my temporary facet fuel pump 
on my 73 while I rebuild my mech pump.  The part that arrived is BOSCH  
0 332 514 120 with about a bajillion connections on it ... well, ok, 
more like 11 but it seems rather a lot for a simple relay. Now the 
kicker is that I have NOOOO idea how to hook this bad boy up if it IS 
the right thing. I ordered it from the Bus Depot so I assume its the 
right part but I could be wrong. From the looks of it it its like two 
normal sized relays side by side ...

Any thoughts ? Anyone else ordered the Fuel Pump Relay from BD and 
hooked it up ? Do I have an FI double relay or something ?

Steve
