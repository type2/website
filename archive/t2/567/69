I'll try and dig up a couple of pictures from one of my volksair
projects and the one engine I had put in my old 71 westy and post them.

Has anyone managed to use one of these brackets without massive oil
leaks?  I needed to get a bus running on the double, so I used the
bracket on a 1974 Super Beetle engine I had laying around.  Engine
works great, but the oil leak is ugly at best.
