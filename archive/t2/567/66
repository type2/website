I suggest you try just flushing the brake system before resigning to 
replacing the master cylinder.

Get a power bleeder (see Richard Atwell's site for more info) and just 
flush it all out until you get clean fluid out the bleeder valves.  
Might take a lot of fluid, but is cheaper than replacing the cylinder 
(and the power bleeder is nice to have as a maintenance tool anyway).
