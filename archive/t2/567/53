And more. OEM parts for cars come from a variety of supplies, some of 
which supply the aftermarket (think "Bosch").

Many aftermarket parts are rebuilt from cores.

Anything that is cast in aluminum, iron, potmetal, even plastic can be 
used  as a casting for a new mold. This is one way that specification 
errors accumulate, especially if you start adding generations of molds.

And some parts on the markets are outright piracy: made to look like 
parts but not designed to fit anything.
