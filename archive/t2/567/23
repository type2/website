That's what I thought when I first saw them too, but I've grown more 
safety-conscious since I became a father also.

I took some measurements from seat bottom to seatbelt mount on the vehicles 
I have available to me:

'93 Mustang front seat: 28"
'73 VW bus front seat: 26"
'93 Mustang rear seat: 23"

'73 VW bus C-pillar "mount" (for middle seat?): 18"
'73 VW bus "mount" under rear window (for rearmost seat): 13"

I would want a lot more information before I used those mounts for shoulder 
belt anchors.  My gut tells me they are too low to be safe.
