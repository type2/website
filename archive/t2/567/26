I wonder if a method like the Volvo wagons used is possible...

The 240 body wagons have a steel bar running vertically behind the rear
seat. The shoulder belt attaches to that bar, and automatically adjusts (by
sliding up or down) to the necessary height. A bar could easily be bolted or
welded to our busses allowing this attachment.

This may be the least intrusive way to get a well designed shoulder belt.
