I like to ski and when I crank up the VW long before dawn and the temps
are well below zero, well first I want the engine to fire. and second I
wanna thaw out.  So

the engine is well tuned, have twin 950CCA batteries, and all synthetic
lubes.

then for me, I have a truckers heat pad on my seat and underneath the
front end a nice gas heater that recirculates the interior air.

the proof, driving to Killington at 10below in my shirt sleeves and the
window cracked.   don't know what the wind was but the gas station I
filled up at had a temp sign...

next morning before dawn up on the mountain, she starts on the second
turn, and I'm warmed up by the time I get to the lodge for first tracks

a vw bus doesn't need to be cold....
