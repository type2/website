Yes, and everyone knows that all of William Shakespeare's plays were 
written by another playwrite with the same name.

"No such thing as suction" is interesting high school physics (sorry 
George), but I've never heard anyone who says that tell me what they 
think suction would be if there were such a thing. Suction is just a 
word that describes a pressure differential. Same thing.
