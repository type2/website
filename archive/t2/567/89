Subject: Re: [T2] FI Update... Pretty near done now.

Hi Volks,

I didn't *really* want to announce anything until I was completely
finished, but since this thread refuses to die I might as well 'fess
up.

This afternoon I swapped the throttle body, AFM, ECU and wiring harness
from our 77 Sunroof Automatic over to the westfakia. It now starts and
runs with a somewhat lumpy idle.

The cause of the high fuel pressure is definitely a vacuum leak, as I
have confirmed that the rubber gaskets between the plenum and the
intake runners are sucking air. When I spray quickstart anywhere near
them the engine RPMs climb immediately. Yes, I do know ether is
flammable and I did this with an extinguisher close at hand. When the
engine is revved enough to get the vacuum up to 15" or better the fuel
pressure does drop back to 28PSI. At idle the vacuum surges between 6
and 10 inches, which is nowhere near enough, and the fuel pressure is
closer to 36-38 PSI.

Once I have the vacuum leak tamed I will be able to set the timing
properly and the engine should smooth out.

I had resisted turning the sunroof into a parts bus, but I can't keep
the westfakia off the road forever. Since I have enough known-good
parts to build a megasquirt system, this is probably what I will do for
the sunroof bus. Megasquirt FI will allow me to ditch a 25-year-old
wiring harness, AFM, ECU, Cold start and Aux Air valve. Once it's
proven to work on the sunroof (ie, at least a full season)  I will see
about putting one on the westfakia as well.

More info will be forthcoming as I get more work done. I'm planning on
going camping this weekend so I hope to be done soon.

Happy trails,
