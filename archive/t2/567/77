Okay okay, not vacuum but it is easier to say than, amplified atmospheric 
pressure or the pulling of the fuel, drawing of the fuel, decrease of 
pressure in the fuel line on the supply side, negative pressure, etc. etc. 
It sounds as if you know what I meant and that is what I intended. Thanks.

suction  n.
The act or process of sucking.
A force that causes a fluid or solid to be drawn into an interior space or 
to adhere to a surface because of the difference between the external and 
internal pressures.

pt. v.
suctioned, suctioning, suctions
To draw away or remove by the force of suction: suction fluid from the 
lungs.
To clean or evacuate (a body cavity, for example) by the force of suction.

adj.
Creating suction.
Operating or operated by suction.

Unrelated to vw but how does it push uphill if the level of the fuel pump is 
above the level of the fuel. Would the pump create a vacuum(suction) in 
order to draw the fuel to it or do Hamsters do that, too?

Basically what it comes down to is, what if all your hamsters are running 
through the fuel ring through the regulator and back to the tee.  They all 
came out of there original hole (the tank oulet) and not enough are leaving 
the ring so too many are heading back to the tee. Is it conceivable that too 
many hampsters end up having to go back through the hole from where they 
came because enough can't jump ship in time and now the hole that let them 
out one at a time is not letting them back in 4 at a time and they are 
starting to get squished. That is excess pressure! I also might add that it 
is just a theory, hamsters or not!LOLLOLLOLLOLLOL.
