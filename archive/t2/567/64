Pretty simple:

1. There is a line from the tee to the pump, when the pump is on, negative 
pressure at tee.
2. There is fuel coming to the tee from the tank at the "pressure of 
gravity".
3. There is also fuel coming to the tee from the return line at the 
"pressure of the return line"
4. The tee has three sides. Lets call them A(to pump), B(from the tank), 
C(return line).

Given: Pressure is pressure. Fluids move to the point of the least amount of 
pressure.

When the pump is off, the only pressure is that of the gravity pushing the 
fuel to outlet at the bottom of the tank(also to the other outlet if 
equipped). When the pump is on, it's vacuum creates a decrease in pressure 
on the A side. So it sucks the fuel. The valve in the regulator should slow 
enough or stop the flow, through the fuel ring to build the pressure for the 
injectors. So at C there should be a pressure greater than that of A and B. 
The fuel is not going to go back through the regulator, like trying to blow 
through a straw with one finger on the other end, lots of pressure. Now if 
you could slide your finger up through that straw the pressure would 
increase.

When the regulator opens and fuel flows back to the tee at C. C would have 
the highest pressure, presumably. Point B on the tee only has the low 
pressure of gravity pushing the fuel downward to the tee. Point A has a 
vacuum or negative pressure, so dynamically the fluid is drawn to A. A is 
the point of lowest pressure.

If the fuel filter gets clogged and the pressure A is increased the lowest 
point of pressure would be B and the fuel would push that way. But not for 
long...if the fuel pump can't suck the return can't blow.


Hope this helps,
