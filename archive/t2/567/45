In case you needed a laugh...
Just got back from ACE hardware in NW Portland (Pearl Hardware, for you
locals). I asked the person wandering the fasteners section about an M6
nut and washer. <puzzled look> "Lemmme get <name omitted to protect the
innocent>, he's the expert on this stuff". I tell the guy I "need an M6
nut". He looks at me like I just sprouted a second head and says "you
mean a 6mm nut". "no, that nut looks too small", I said. "I was told
that M6 is the naming or sizing convention of the nut and washer I
need." His response: "I have no idea what that is, try a 6mm."
Good stuff, eh? Too bad I work in the foofoo part of the city with a
wide variety of weird food for $20+ a plate, but only one poorly
staffed hardware store, where I could choose from a wide assortment of
$$$ chandeliers, but can't find a $.10 nut.

Oh, bus content: I gave the bus a test drive yestreday after completing
the install of the air flaps, and the ACN thermostat. I found the flaps
hadn't moved after I got home from ~20 minutes of driving. I
push/pulled a bit on the thing the cable connects to, and the flaps
gave a bit and then opened. Are they hung up on something, or did the
heat increase ust enough after I shut off the motor? When I checked
this morning, the flaps were closed. No, I don't have any temperature
guages yet.
