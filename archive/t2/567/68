Subject: Re: [VB] making a Bug engine fit a Bus with a hanger

Has anyone managed to use one of these brackets without massive oil 
leaks?  I needed to get a bus running on the double, so I used the 
bracket on a 1974 Super Beetle engine I had laying around.  Engine 
works great, but the oil leak is ugly at best.
