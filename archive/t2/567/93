We went down to the store again tonight and I checked both filters when we
got back.  Ran fine both directions.

Yeouch!  The filter on the tank side of the pump was pristine when I
installed it yesterday.  The other filter on the carb side is fine, but this
one is a nasty mess.  What looks like rust mostly.  I'll take it off and
clean it again.  What a mess...
