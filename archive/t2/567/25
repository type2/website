You said you were going to rebuild the stock mechanical pump. I can only 
suggest that is what you should do if you can find a rebuild kit. Check 
with BusDepot. If they don't have a kit, I did get a NEW mechanical pump 
from them.

The time/money you spend on the temporary elec. pump is just wasted. To 
engineer that so it runs only when the motor is turning is a bit of 
engineering that will cost far more than a new mechanical fix.
