Subject: Switch Bad?

When I turn off the igniton switch in my 76 it has no effect.  It is just like
the on position.  I have to pop the clutch to kill the engine and then
disconnect the negative battery terminal to turn off the lights on the dash.
Is this typically indicative of a bad switch or a wiring issue?
Thanks!
Mike
