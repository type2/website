Subject: The Great Flood

I think I have a problem here: Monday early morning a flash flood hit my 
property without warning... the yard filled to 1-1/2 feet of water and my 
Aircooled Vanagon was sitting there. the good news is that it only barely 
reached the cargo floor...leaving the front dry. The bad news is that the oil 
is now a brownish white opaque thick liquid. 

I am thinking that water got into the crankcase. I ran the engine long enough 
to get it to higher ground. I drained out the oil  put fresh oil and new oil 
filter in place. The Dipstick, however still shows evidence of somme of the 
whitish emulsusion. After changing oil, I ran the engine until the oil got up 
to normal operating temerature. The engine does not seem to be running 
excessively hot. 

Do I need to change the oil again? Will the whitish emulsion clear once the 
engine gets runnning for extended periods of time? Is this going to shorten 
the life of the engine? 

I'm keeping the "hilbilly hotel" parked until I get some feedback from those 
perhaps more experienced than me at waterlogged engines. 

BTW: the geo metro survived intact despite being filled up to the driver seat 
level with water... after I bailed it out, I chwecked the engine and the oil 
is normal color (clear) and it's runnning with normal power and smoothness.
