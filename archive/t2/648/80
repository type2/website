Subject: Freeing up a stuck engine

Yes, the key is time.  A friend who restores old farm tractors has a large vat 
with maybe 10-15 gallons of Diesel fuel in it.  He removes oil pan, valve 
cover, plugs, etc.... then soaks the block with crank, pistons, head for a good 
long while.  He lifts the engine, allows it to drain, then blows it out, then 
tries to turn it a bit..... and repeats the soaking.  His method has the 
advantage of cleaning out oil passages. YMMV.  But basically the important 
thing is not to rush it.  The engine took months/years to get stuck.  Take it 
easy.  Glenn

I had good luck with PB Blaster on an old Toyota engine. Really, most
any penetrating oil will probably work. The key is time.

You will NOT be able to do this in a day.
