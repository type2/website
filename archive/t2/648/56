of a semi-trailer load. If they have to transfer it to a smaller truck for
local delivery you REALLY pay for it.

Agreed...I had about three hundred pounds of engine parts shipped from
Canada to NJ...It was about a hundred bucks, but only if I picked up the
crate myself at the terminal. Home delivery (about ten miles) would
have been another hundred... ;-(
