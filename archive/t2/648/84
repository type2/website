Subject: California testing

Hi there,

 

I've just acquired a 1977 Californian Westfalia. The thing is that it was
exported to Canada and licensed in Yukon. Next summer, my wife and I are
relocating down in San Diego for work purpose and are planning to bring our
Bus with us. What are the tests that I'll have to conform to? Does someone
have the smog test specifications for a 1977 bus? And finally, what do you
guys suggest I check/repair/change before leaving Canada?

 

Cheers

 

Antonio
