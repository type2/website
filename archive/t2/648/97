Subject: Stolen Emblem/MTV Pimp My Ride

My perfect, original chrome VW emblem from the front of my 1971 Bus was  
stolen today when I took my son to see a movie at the mall.
I noticed that someone else posted a stolen emblem recently. I suspect some  
young punks who saw the pimp my ride episode (which did a bus) ,  where the 
host spoke about stealing emblems, may have gave these fools the idea  to steal 
my emblem. But I don`t know.
I`m going to order a new one at the VW shop ($50). I hope it is good  
quality, 
Any advice will be appreciated as to where to buy a quality emblem.
 
I hope this Bus popularity among young people who don`t respect other  
peoples property wears off quickly.
