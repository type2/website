 You certainly bring up a good mystery with the conflict in your
sources. I hesitate to make assumptions without examination of sample
vehicles. I have a late 60's bay in storage at my friend's. I'll have
to check it out when I get better.

I have not been able to prove it, but I believe only the early 68's lack the 
panel between the engine and gas tank.

Does anyone out there have a 68 with or without panel?

I know all the 69 and up have them.
