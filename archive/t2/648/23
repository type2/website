If the book says 100 psi is low limit for adequate combustion and you find 
99 psi, you are out of spec regardless the cause. If the cause is non spec 
assembly, ie, starting with less than spec compression, it's still out of spec.

Leak down can only measure issue with the rings at TDC. It is possible to 
have no leak at TDC and too much loss just down the cylinder a ways. If 
compression is poor, the leak down test is used to determine where the leak 
might be. Crankcase, exhaust, intake or head seal are all possibles, and 
sometimes in combination. If leak down is fine but compression is low, look 
for evidence of wear down from the top of travel. This is possible, but I 
would say a very rare anomaly. Wear at the extreme top of travel is the 
norm as there is far more loading of the rings during combustion at the 
point of travel.
