Absolutely, good focus. Who assembled the motor?? What type of motor and 
what was the cost?? If memory serves, compression at 100psi is under 
minimum spec for a T-IV motor. Honor that fact, regardless emotions.

Lots and lots of "new" motors fail in short mileage due to just flat not 
meeting specs. Even a good assembly will puke in short miles if the cooling 
system is not spec, like a big hole under the battery while under hot 
summer loading, a clogged oil cooler or stuck oil bypass valve or leaves or 
mouse house blocking air somewhere. 2 minutes at too much heat and the 
rings will warp. Scouring of the cylinders follows. Then burning of valves 
and pistons.

Next step to confirm is a set of leakdown gauges and compressed air at 
100psi. Buy the tools or hire the test. Bet most tool rentals will have a 
leak down test gauge set and a compressor as well.

There are only 2 things that can cause excess crankcase pressure. Clogged 
breather or excess blow by.

Remove oil fill cap, hook hose to breather outlet, blow. No resistance at 
all is spec. If that is the case, pull the motor, heads and cylinders and 
verify the cause.
