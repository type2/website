Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum and timing

The manifold vacuum retards your timing whenever the throttle is
closed, whether at idle or if, for example, you let your foot off the
gas after cresting a hill. This is supposed to reduce emissions. Maybe
Richard or some of the others know if there is a corresponding affect
on economy or performance.
