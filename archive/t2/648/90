many many years ago, a friend and I found an old MG-TC under a tarp behind
some old guys house, he practically gave it to us, but it had been under
that tarp for years,  we finally took the long block and put it in a 55
gal drum and filled the drum with used motor oil and diesel fuel...capped
it and left it all winter in a corner of the garage while we worked on
other things...finally after several months in the "can" we pulled it out
and got it to turn over freely, and when put together it ran quite
decently...I went into the service then and never saw the car again since
friend totalled it about a year later....oh well!
