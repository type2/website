Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck Gas Cap

Early 68's did not have the panel between the engine
and tank. 
Does yours?
The filler neck comes off easy. [if you do not have
the panel] Otherwise you have remove the engine and
panel. 
Remove the 3 10mm headed bolts at the gas cap area.
Loosen the clamp on the large rubber hose between the
tank and neck. Loosen the upper one!
Pull neck out of hole.
If you want to destroy the neck to remove the cap, go
ahead.....I have an extra neck.

 Richard,
 
Been a long time since I looked at the filler set up
on a 68, but i would 
say engine out probably...
 
If you do destroy it to get it off, use the tin can
type approach where 
you literally peel the edges up and go slowly from
there....i suspect a 
filler tube would be much harder to replace than the
cap.

 Hi Dave, everyone,
 
 Yes, pushing in hard was my _first_ reaction, but
 it's hard to push _and_
 turn it with any force at the same time. Someone
 at the gas station I was
 stuck at suggested using an oil filter wrench,
 but, since VWs don't ever
 need those, I don't own that tool. -frown-
 
 I'm hoping to save the cap as it's original and
 perfect - I'd rather loose
 the filler neck. Tell me, please: Can I remove the
 filler neck from the
 outside, or do I have to get into the gas tank
 compartment (remove engine)?
