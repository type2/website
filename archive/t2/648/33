gas after cresting a hill. This is supposed to reduce emissions. Maybe
Richard or some of the others know if there is a corresponding affect
on economy or performance."  <<- excessive quote alert!!


Thanks, John.  I hope it has a positive effect on performance, particularly 
during warm-up.  I have to let  the '76 get to operating temperature before 
it will idle with confidence.  Maybe this retard addition will have a 
positive effect on the idle.
