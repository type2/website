John asked:

 Does that mean early bays have no round inspection port inside the
engine compartment?

I believe the hole is shown here as # 30A:

The engine panel is  # 29.  ETKA shows this in all the pics of 68 - 79 bus body parts,
but it is not shown in my old printed paper 68-71 parts book. Neither is 30A. Since both 
are pictured in ETKA but both show as NLA, I cannot give you a breakdown of which 
year model they started in. But since my paper parts book is dated 2/71 and they are not 
listed or shown there, then it is logical to assume those two parts came later......
