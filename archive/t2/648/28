Hi Barry,

Those are heads designed for D-Jet Fuel Injection. Apparently the D-Jet
system requires such a stable vacuum that the heads were vented back to the
case in order to keep the case pressure as even as possible.

We have a pair of them on the 412 engine destined to power "Franklin", my
Dad's 1975 westy project. They'll be capped off in our case since they
aren't needed for L-jet FI.

Happy trails,
