Try the soundtrack for "Sorcerer" by Tangerine Dream...
And if the weather's too bad for real drivin', get both
versions from the video store...Henri-George Cluzot's
La Salaire De La Peur (The Wages of Fear) and William
Friedkin's remake, Sorcerer...Get the 2 1/2 hour ver-
sion of Cluzot's masterpiece of tension...Both great
car flicks even if the stars are trucks...You'll never
cross a bridge in the rain again... :-o
