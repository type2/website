A back-authorized bus song: Jessica (Allman Brothers) is the music that 
plays in "Field of Dreams" when Kevin Kostner drives to Boston to pick 
up Darth Vader. The movie used the studio version (from "Brothers and 
Sisters") but I strongly recommend the version on the much later live 
album with Warren Haynes. The tune slips into a short fast version of 
"Mountain Jam" and otherwise kicks.
