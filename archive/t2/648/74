PB Blaster is the very best rust penetrant, bar none. However, if it is 
locked up due to rust of rings/cylinders/bearings, if you can break it free 
the bits of rust scale will immediatly destroy the surfaces in play. Some 
of the valve will be off their seats and the faces and seats will have a 
rust film that means no seal there. Assumption should be that no useful 
running of the motor will occur without teardown and reworking or 
replacement of pitted parts. Best case, you can break it free and get it 
running, but life of the motor will be short.

I recall back in HS I helped a bud rebuild a Ford Y block V-8. He left the 
new motor sitting under a tarp through the winter. Despite everything being 
lubed and assembled with the 50/50 oil and STP mix, rust scale really 
grabbed hold of all the cross hatch on the cylinders. Cylinders and rings 
were trashed. I told him so but he went ahead and installed the motor and 
sure enough, copious billowing smoke from the get go and no such thing as 
breakin could occur.

I have seen this issue require breaking the pistons into bits and pieces 
for disassembly in some cases.
