Chris,

Don't forget about the dual carb deal you had. When asking how this could 
happen on a fresh rebuild with only 8000 mi on it. If the conclusion for 
that was true, jets were too small. Your lack of power with the duals caused 
by a lean mixture due to the small jets. If all of it is correct than you 
may be closer to the answer than you think. Or atleast as to why. Dam if CB 
would have just had that Weber in stock you might be posting about other 
more pleasurable experiences.

Good Luck,
