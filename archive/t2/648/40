So, how do you quickly convert a SAE measurement wrench to a government 
metric equivalent (government equivalent = close enough for government 
work)??

Make the SAE into X/16 and multiply X times 16!!

So, 1" wrench is 16/16 is 16 * 16 = 256 = just over 25mm.  OK, pretty much 
over 25mm!!

But a 5/16" is 5 * 16 = 80 = pretty darn close to 8mm!!

1/2" = 8/16  is 8 * 16 = 128 which is why a 1/2" wrench usually will not fit 
a 13 mm nut, but a 13mm wrench will be comfortable with a 1/2  nut!  Carry 
your 13 mm with confidence!!  Forgo the 1/2"!!!  Burn your bras!!!!  (Sorry, 
I got carried away)


And the ever popular 7/8" = 14/16 = 14 * 16 = 224 = close enough to a 22 mm 
to fit the alternator nut for turning the engine.

And how about 3/4" = 12/16 = 12 * 16 = 192 = close enough for the 19 mm 
wheel nuts...

1 1/16" = 17/16 = 17 * 16 = 272 = close enough for the 27 mm ball joint 
nuts.

Thanks for your continued support.
