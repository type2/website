Richard,

Been a long time since I looked at the filler set up on a 68, but i would 
say engine out probably...

If you do destroy it to get it off, use the tin can type approach where 
you literally peel the edges up and go slowly from there....i suspect a 
filler tube would be much harder to replace than the cap.

Cheers, dave
