Hi Antonio,

To pass smog the engine fuel and emissions systems must be 100% stock
as manufactured. It must be equipped with California standards
equipment. It doesn't have to  VW brand, but the technology must be as
per stock. You will be tested to standards the same as that year and
model equipped with Calif smog equipment and licensed in California.

You will want to have the bus in optimal state of tune and maintenance
for most efficient and cleanest running, with all tuning done to
factory specs. Make sure your ignition system is fresh, and all vacuum
and manifold hoses fresh and not leaking. Fresh oil change and air
filter will reduce HC emissions. If you are equipped with a catalytic
converter, a new one will clean up most any engine deficiencies.

You may not be into spending that kind of money if not necessary, but
if you do, wait till you get to San Diego because if your fuel mixture
is rich, you will burn up the new unit on the trip. Ask for a smog
pre-test before they start. That way you will know if it will pass or
not. Much better than doing the official test and getting labelled in
DMV computers as a gross polluter which will make your life miserable!

Good luck,

John

 I've just acquired a 1977 Californian Westfalia. The thing is that it was
 exported to Canada and licensed in Yukon. Next summer, my wife and I are
 relocating down in San Diego for work purpose and are planning to bring our
 Bus with us. What are the tests that I'll have to conform to? Does someone
 have the smog test specifications for a 1977 bus? And finally, what do you
 guys suggest I check/repair/change before leaving Canada?
 
 Cheers
