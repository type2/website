Damn, just when you think you have a winner . . .    I did notice that the 
idle was down quite a bit with the retard hoses on.  I did not drive it 
since I put the hoses on yesterday, I just checked the timing.

Richard, with your confirmation of my observation, I will bring the idle 
back up from the 750 observed after retard added, to the 950 previous seen 
with just advance.  I am ever thankful that I have that 36 inch fillister 
driver; works perfectly for tin screws and the long reach to the idle screw.

Also, I bought a #4 Sears Craftsman hex shaft phillips screwdriver , new, 
from a flea market vendor, with a 5/16 (equates to a 8mm)  small combination 
wrench for the hex shaft ($8 for the set).   Now I can challenge the 
phillips screws on my cooling tin, similar to the fillisters.  Man, it is so 
NICE to hear the 'crack' when those fillister screws give up their grip!!  
and brush with a wire brush and a dip in the phosphoric acid and they are 
ready to go back in...  (Yes, I have new cooling tin screws, but I only 
bought a small bag of 50 screws/washers last summer.)

Thanks for the note.  It really was helpful.
