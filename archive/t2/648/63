Another one that seems to catch the spirit of the VW bus is "Steam Powered
Aero Plane" by John Hartford.  My favorite version is by The Grateful
Dudes (not the Dead!)

---------------------------------

Well I never went away on a Steam Powered Aero plane.
Well I went and stayed and damn near didn't come back again.
Didn't go very fast on a steam powered aero plane,
Oh the wheel went around, up and down, and inside and then back again.


Sittin' in a 747 just watching them clouds roll by,
Can't tell if it's sunshine or if it's rain.
Rather be sittin' in a deck chair high above Kansas City,
On a genuine old fashioned steam powered aero plane.


Well I'd like to be a pilot on a steam powered aero plane.
Well I'd pull that pilot wheel around and then back again.
Well, I'll wear a blue hat, yeah, that says Steam Powered Aero plane
With letters that go around the rim and then back again.
