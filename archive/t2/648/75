Yes, that fits. Just a few degrees too far advanced and/or a lean mixture 
and you get excess heat real fast.

Don't waste another dime on the breather. Prove it clear. Put a hose on the 
nipple, remove the oil fill cap, and blow. No resistance means no 
time/money spent here. PROOF!!! Not throwing time/money at things not wrong 
is the key to best cost per mile no matter the real cost for real results.

Think again about going all stock. Stock compression, stock carb, stock 
settings, stock procedures. Think about what the engineers who designed and 
built that machine think it should do. Not good enough for you?? It's just 
like Vegas. Don't take a dime that doesn't come from disposable income and 
chalk it up to entertainment. Not even 1 in 1000 will beat the house in the 
long term. Change their specs and you better have a very good engineer's 
hat with years of sweat on the band if you expect to improve on their efforts.
