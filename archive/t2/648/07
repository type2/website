Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick(update)

Try putting a few cotton balls in a paper coffee filter.
Use a rubber band the hold the thing on the top of your dipstick tube to see
just how much oil you're getting.
I had a Type IV that would move the dip stick out about a quarter inch under
normal operating situations.
When I blew the #2 ring off of #4 cylinder I got leaks from the head
gaskets, oil dipstick tube and everyplace else that was possible.
In a "Rube Goldberg" test you might just slip a piece of rubber hose over
the tube and let it the oil catch in a soft drink can over a ten mile or
more trip at various speeds.
This should (If you stop often enough) tell you at what speeds, RPMs it
blows the oil.
