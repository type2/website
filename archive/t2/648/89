Subject: Gen light on...please help

I just finished installing a CDI from Aircooled.net today. This also
included new plugs and wires. When I fired her up to check it out this
afternoon, she drove great. After maybe .75 miles or so my GEN light
came on. After I saw that my belt was plenty tight, I headed for home.
Someone please help me diagnose as I have no idea. Is this mere
coincidence that my Generator goes kaput exactly after I put in the CDI?
For some reason I doubt it.
 
How does one test a generator? Would this be a good time for a
alternator upgrade?? Suggestions welcome.
Thanks
