To reinforce the suggestions............ buy tires for ICE, rather than 
SNOW. In my northern "snowbelt"  Ohio world, The snow usually gets plowed 
and salted soon after it falls, and what is left turns into ice and icy 
slush, which stays around and gets packed down into rutted ice. 
So....packed ice and icy slush is what we usually are driving on when there 
is a traction problem,,,,,not snow.

Therefore, I buy tires that are designed specifically for ice/icy slush.  I 
say that to the tire seller. I look for that in the consumer reports on 
winter tires.  "Snow" as a search tool will get you lots of hits outside 
your problem target.

Personally, last year and this winter I've put my money into 
Nokians....running 2 sets this winter on family cars. One has a WR tread 
and the other has a Hakka tread pattern. Couldn't find any better tires for 
the rutted hard-packed ice we have most of the winter in northern Ohio. 
This is after 4 winters on Michelin Arctic Alpins. They were very good, but 
the Nokians are a whole dimension better, IMO.

And I put them on all 4 wheels.....the idea being that it is very important 
for me to stop, and I want all 4 wheels working at that goal.  Steering is 
important, and getting the vehicle moving is important......but stopping 
will save both lives and the vehicle, once it gets rolling.  So that leaves 
stopping and steering as critical, and I want them both working in my 
favor. I'd rather not get it moving, if I can't steer and stop.
