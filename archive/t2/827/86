Isn't that the fun part of driving a RWD car in the winter or off
pavement (or with sufficient power, on pavement)?  At least the bus
has the engine and transaxle weight (meager as it is) at the end of
the car with the drive wheels.  Which also means that you have to be
careful with power oversteer.  The bus isn't as bad, but the reason I
didn't get to find out how well the oil pan heater worked on the 58
Beetle was because I found myself going backwards down the road one
evening.  The back end didn't just follow, it decided to lead...
