Michael,

I'm looking at getting a Crane.  From what I can tell, it's a
combination CDI and points replacement (XR700)..about $100.
Check out: http://www.shopcranecams.com/xrandxrig1.html

I plan on getting one, plus a new distributor (SVDA). Just need
to make sure I get the correct model of XR700 and SVDA.
