Subject: i need some winter driving tips

so i am finally picking my bus up on friday :-) after
11 months and heres the deal i am going to drive her
during the winter as much as possible to break in the
engine so when spring come i can take her on the
highway and take her to the shows. The question i have
is in the 7 years i have awned the bus i have never
driven her in the winter meaning snow can anyone give
me tips  on how they handle in snowy weather any
secrets i have a automatic so any lower gear better
than drive. The second question is my heating systems
works decents but if i am going to drive her in colder
weather is there anything portable that i can plug in
the ciggerette lighter that can give me heat to get me
to and from work any answer would be grateful
everybody have a safe and happy holiday
