I'm sure there is an easy test but I haven't thought about it or tried it.

I suppose you could feed D+ 11-13V from a variable voltage power supply and check the duty cycle at DF. The resistance of the rotor is about 4.5 ohms (I'd have to remeasure to be sure) so you'd have to put that kind of resistance into the circuit between DF and D-. I'm not sure how much current that resistor has to sink during the test. When I get some time I'll test out this theory.
