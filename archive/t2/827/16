Not sure this made it the first time I sent it to the list - sorry if this
is a repeat.

 

I have a related question.  I have a '79 federal - when I turn on the heat I
get some nasty engine smells.  Where should I look first - the air tube, the
H/Es or could I just be sucking the smell in from the squirrel cage in the
engine compartment or ???

 

Thanks for your input.
