Actually, it helps when you're going really slowly and the engine at
idle is sufficient to move the rear wheels faster than you're going.
Very little brake pedal pressure is suffcient to lock up the front
wheels, but not sufficient to overpower the engine on the rear wheels.
 You're going 4 mph, and the rear wheels are still powered, turning
and and trying to accelerate you.  You can either mash on the brake
pedal harder (which you're avoiding because maybe you don't actually
want your front wheels locked up), or put it in neutral.  Nothing more
interesting than approaching the bumper in front of you while sliding
on ice at 4 mph......3 mph.....2 mph......1 mph......  From experience
driving a lot on ice around town, putting it in to neutral while
coming to a stop works.

With most automatics I've got experience with (not sure about the VW
automatic) selector in 2nd gear means the trans starts in 2nd gear,
and never shifts out of 2nd gear.
