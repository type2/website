Heat exchangers, is leaking oil dripping on them?  Hot oil stinks, and
it's a bear to clean the exchangers.  I cleaned mine by soaking them is
solvent for quite a while then washed them out with a stream of water.
After that, I'm very careful to make sure that the valve cover gaskets are
leak-free.

Engine air seals, are they tight, or is exhaust being drawn into the
engine bay?

General engine bay cleanliness.
