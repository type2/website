Subject: Electronic Ignition Kits

While we are on the subject of points...

Just wondering what kinda feedback, experience, and advice might be out
there for those thinking of replacing their points with one of the
electronic ignition kits?

Is one brand better than another (Pertronix, EMPI/Accufire, etc...)?

Are some over priced?  Are some worth more money than others?

Any input would be appreciated.

Thanks,
