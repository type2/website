just be aware in the past 35 years your bus has probably had a lot of "Non
standard" wiring repairs that are probably not documented.  I'm an
engineer (not electrical) and I tremble to think about taking all the wire
out at one time, when I replace I pull a new replacement wire, disconect
the old one BUT NOT REMOVE IT. and plug up the new wire. drive for a bit,
then if everything works I remove the old wire....
