Maybe it's an A/C condensor?  ;-)


The late model air-cooled buses seem to have
the familiar "upright" engine configuration
with throttle body injection.  I suspect that
they are dual-fuel as well.  A small tank of
gasoline is on board for starting and when
all warmed up, switch over to alcohol fuel. ?
