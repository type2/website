Hi all,

Here I am again... A broken generator I tried to replace with an unknown
alternator...
I now got them both out and I am wondering what to do. The generator seems
to work sometimes but mostly not - maybe only the brushes need replacement?
But I can see a through the holes a wire which should be insulated but which
is now naked, so I am afraid there's more to it than replacing the brushes.
Better switch to an alternator with all it's advantages. The alternator is a
bit bigger but I already once installed it and it fits perfectly. Also the
pulley is as long as the one on the generator. Anything else considering the
size and interchangebility?
And I do not have the voltage regulator. There's a FLAPS here specialized in
car-electricity. Should they be able to trace the right regulator?

I live on low budget this year, so I am also looking for the cheapest
solution. But I can wait if necessary...

Thanks for advice!
