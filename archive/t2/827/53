Subject: Compression Test

Hi folks,

I am getting my 82 Westy ready for a big trip next summer and I have a few 
things that I need done.  Besides the usual brakes and auto trans service etc.  
I want to check the cylinder compression and would like an opinion on 
tolerable readings and danger readings that would warrant a rebuild.  My only 
complaint about the engine is at start up I have a noisy hydrolic lifter noise for 
about 7 seconds till the oil gets there.  I read about the GM Oil Additive and as 
soon as I am down 12 oz I plan on adding to see if it fixes the problem.  

My mechanic doesnt want to replace one lifter and says do all or none.  I see 
that the heads were redone and one cylinder was replaced a few thousand miles 
prior to my owning the van.  It had been running with the spark way too far 
advanced by about 20 degrees so that is why the heads kept going.

E mail me at chuckinsey(-at-)aol.com or I will look here.

Thanks and Merry ChrisChanKwanzMas (have to be PC these days)
Chuck
