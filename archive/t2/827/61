Subject: 1969 westy

Just became the proud owner of a 1969 Westfalia! I plan to do some camping with it. But I'd like to upgrade some things first. When I drove it home (about 90 miles) it was all over the road. I could also feel a flat spot on the tires. What is the best way to upgrade the tires. I want to feel comfortable driving down the freeway with my family on board. Any suggestions?
