Welcome Peter,
Tires is one of the most discussed and archived topics on this list.
Please check the archives to find all you need to know. Shop wisely
and do not let tire merchants sell you crap.

Wandering seems to be a common problem of old busses. You should get a
Bentley manual for the Type 2 and understand how the steering works.
Then check/replace one item after the other. Among other things you
should consider replacing : drag link, tie rods, center pin bushing,
ball joints and lastly steering box. Every new item will improve
wandering a bit, stop when you are happy or poor.
