Subject: Re: hot air tube under the bus

I've got some of the 3" / 3.5" ?? mm TUBE that delivers air from the rear of
the Vanagon to the Front of the bus.
One piece is about 4 foot long from the rear cross member to the gas tank
area and the second piece goes from the front of the floor air box to the
inlet for the heater director under the dash.

I'm not real sure it's pictured but it's available if someone needs it.
