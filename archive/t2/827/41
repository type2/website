Please make that 'computed' circumference.


Not all tires of the same rating have the same circumferences.

From one of my empirical tests, I was surprised at the differences.

I had two different brands of 185R14 tires on rims, and rolled them along 
the sidewalk.  One was the Michelin XZX 185R14.     Twenty rotations each, 
from the same starting point.  There was an astonishingly large difference 
in the length of the rolls.


In fact, I have a single 185R14 ORIGINAL tire that I will challenge anyone 
on a roll-off.  The tire is a Nylon belted, with a 6 ply rating on an 8 ply 
tire.  It looks to have been used solely as a spare, and has almost new 
tread on it.


What would you compute the distance to be if I rolled it down a line some 20 
rolls and measured the distance covered??  Fully inflated to 32 psi.  No 
funny stuff.... 185R14...
