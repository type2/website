Subject: Re: [T2] Why would points wear abnormally fast?

hey guys  If you have the wrong coil it will also burn the points quick . 
Certain coils require a resistor where the Bosch blue coil has the ressistor made 
in it. .  Also I have seen the cheap points burn quicker than the good bosch 
ones.  #01 030 are the good ones.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
