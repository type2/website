Subject: bus in PA for sale

 My last bus is for sale in PA, I dont have  the time money energy to get it but she should go to a good  home...Solid west coast bus on the east coast.
  
  Im not related to the seller in anyway, so dont call me, call him...If she goes to a listee I would love to hear about it.
  
  Lots of good karma on her.
