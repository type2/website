Hi Arnaud

The rim is 14" rim in DIAMETER, not radius. This messed up your  
calculations.

The correct calculation is  (7"+ (18.5cm divided by 2.54)) x .82 x 2pi
I worked that out to 81.5" circumference.

vs

  (7"+ (21.5cm divided by 2.54)) x .70 x 2pi
That gives me 81.2"

Which is VERY close to the same thing.

The deal-breaker is the weight limit, and how well the width of a 215  
tire fits into a rim designed for a tire 30mm narrower.


Happy trails,
