Subject: Why would points wear abnormally fast?

   This bus I was working on, for a friend, is acting strangly.  At first we 
thought it was the cold idle jet, because that elecrical connector was 
loose.  We re-connected that, and tested the temp sender.  It wasn't that.  
I replaced the points and it started right up and ran fine!  They got it 
home, and the next day it didn't want to start well, now not at all.  He 
says it turns over but it doesn't start, and the battery wears down in the 
attempt.
   The points that we pulled out were pitted and looked pretty bad.  Could 
this be a wiring issue where the points are burning out?  We replaced the 
ignition switch with a push button, because the ignition switch was bad.  We 
have it wired so you have to turn the key and then press a button to start 
it. Could this be keeping the acc position on and wearing the points?
    Anything else you can think of???
