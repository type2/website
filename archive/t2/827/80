Subject: Re: [T2] Why would points wear abnormally fast?

When I had a 72 Westy I upgraded the points to the Pertronix 
electronic system.  After that I drove 50,000 miles without ever 
having to touch them again.  One of the smartest upgrades I ever did.

And yes, as a backup I kept the old set of points under the passenger 
seat in case of emergency but never needed them.
