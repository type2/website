Subject: Re: [T2] Why would points wear abnormally fast?

I've done the momentary switch for starting trick on other cars before
- worked great.  If you didn't connect things correctly there (and the
points were energized when the ignition switch was off), you probably
wouldn't be able to turn the engine off.

If the condenser is shot (rarely happens) or not connected properly,
the points will also have a very short lifespan.
