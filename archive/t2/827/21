everyone that my engine of 7 years not knowing the
history behind it decided to end it's life pistons

mechanic has been driving my bus around for over a
week. He says the bus has been hadling beautiful and
the en gine that boston bob built did a beautiful job
without any problems in fact the oil temperature
sender has been telling him the engine has been
keeping cool. In fact through out all the nasty posts
from previous people saying they are not going to get
