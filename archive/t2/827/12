Subject: you dont usualy see that kind of behavior in glassware.

 The sliding glass on the window on my  sliding door exploded(75 ASI camper). there was no sign of a rock or  bullet, so I can only assume that 30 years of stress and sun made it  brittle- still it was pretty exciting. So my question is; as the rest  of the window is intact, would it be cheeper to replace the glass or  just get a used window? And has anyone had this happen?
  
  Ill take my answer off the air...
