Kyle, 

 

I might be interested in your 79.  I bought a 76 a few months ago and since
I am a newbie to bus restoration, I am learning the hard way on how to go
about this.   So far I have learned that I paid too much for a bus with too
much rust in all the well documented places.  I wish that I would have been
a avid reader of this list about six months BEFORE I bought a bus.  Anyway,
if your 79 has a good body with not so much rust, I have a good engine (it
runs).  Do you have any pictures?  I am about 8 hours north east of you in
Chesapeake, VA.  How much are you looking to get for it?  Jeff.
