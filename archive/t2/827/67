Hi Dave,

Sounds good to me. I have colour matched the rims to the body on my  
westy since 1997. (At least I did up until I found a good set of  
michelins on black vanagon rims back in february. Somehow I haven't  
had time to paint them red yet.  I also paint the VW logo on the  
hubcaps to match the body, it looks good to me.

Note: Be sure not to get paint into the bolt-holes where the lug nut  
presses against the rim.

Happy trails,
