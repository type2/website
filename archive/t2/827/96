 >Mark, I have an older Crane XR700 kit I havne't installed yet, but on 
looking at the plastic collar they supply(shutter), it goes over the lobes 
and the slot that lets the light through to the optical trigger, sits 
halfway between the lobes on the dizzy shaft. That means it will fire 
between the lobes instead of on them as points would. Will I just turn my 
dizzy that bit more to adjust the timing then to make up for the different 
place the dizzy is going to fire?
Also, some are saying this is a HEI or CDI setup, but I think it is only a 
point replcaement system, correct?
Thanks,
Courtney

 From Crane's description on their website, the XR700 and XR3000 are NOT 
CDI type ignitions. Crane are not backwards in coming forwards when the 
ignition IS a CDI - look elsewhere on the site. :)

Cheers,
