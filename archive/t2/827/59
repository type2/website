you can leave it in Drive, it will pick the gear you need, I ski and have
driven my 78 Automatic for 13 winters now and I have never needed any
other gear.   put good all season radials on all four wheels. (I have
Michelin Agelis 81's) make sure your brakes are even.   the only trick if
you will that the bus has and this is only the automatic.  on snow or ice
if you step on the brake the front wheels can lock and the rear keep
pushing.  of course then you can't steer.  I have gotten into the habit of
when in conditions I think the front may lock up I get ready to quickly
push it into neutral.

  the front is very light and has disk brakes, the  rear is quite heavy
and has drum brakes  easy for this to happen.  the other option is to come
down hard on the brakes so the back wheels stop too,  or back off and pump
the brakes like they taught us in driver ed.   first time you get some
snow find a big empty parking lot and practice getting the feel for it,
the bus will go thru some pretty deep snow so enjoy

only thing that is usefull is a seat heater.  I have a Truckers bunk
heater as my seat cover in the winter, it works reasonably well, the other
thing would be to keep your eye open for a gas heater...the stock
Eberspracher or a newer Wabasto or Espar..

enjoy your bus
