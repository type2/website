Subject: Engine out - can't turn it over

All-

I'm a total newbie looking for a little guidance.  I took my '72 1700 type4 engine out of my bus to fix massive oil leaks and to clean it up.  I've got a 800 mile road trip coming up on the 17th (back home for Christmas) which has provided me the proper motivation to get the engine back in the bus and running.  I took everything off the engine except the heads and clean it up, replaced seals, etc.  While it was out I was cranking the engine over by using a 13mm socket on the bolt that holds the fan (hub?) onto the case.  It work liked a champ.  While I was re-installing the heat exchangers, ratwell's how-to suggests cranking the engine and blowing compressed air into each cylinder to check for sealing leaks.  

Here's the problem, I can no longer turn the engine over using that 13mm fan hub bolt.  The alternator bracket isn't installed yet so turning the alternator won't turn over the engine.  If I turn the 13mm bolt counter-clockwise the bolt slowly turns (but not the flywheel) and if I turn the 13mm bolt clockwise the bolt slowly turns (but not the flywheel).  I'm freaked out that I've somehow stripped it or am about to shear it off.

Above, when I said that the bolt spins when I turn it I haven't turned it much and it does require about 15 ft-lbs of torque to get it to spin clockwise, about 10 ft-lbs to spin counter-clockwise.  What am I to do?  Waiting until I get it installed and letting the starter turn the flywheel seems like a naive idea.  What is this 13mm bolt hooked to, the crankshaft?  Is it possible I'm about to break it off?

Thanks for all your help in advance (I really don't want to take the train back for Christmas),
