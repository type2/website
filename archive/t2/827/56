I spent most of last Spring in Hawaii.  Don't miss Lahaina, Mauii.   Biggest banyan tree in the world.  It's a whole park.  And the  beaches!  You'll love Mauii.  Wish I could join you.  Aloha and  Mahalo...KR

any folks who might want to meet a Canadian Bus driver... I can't bring the 
dog sled... but I will have my tuque , which I am told is genuine saskatawan 
seal skin.  I might need it as Haleakala apperantly is cool in the morning 
.. I'll be hanging loose in Kihei

If there are any list members on the island who might have time to get 
together... let me know at jrivers_at_globalserve.net
