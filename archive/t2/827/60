Subject: RE: [T2] i need some winter driving tips

Be vewwy caweful.  I would suggest putting a GOOD set of snow tires all 
around, or at least on the rear wheels.  Ice on the windshield WILL be an 
issue.  I used a littleportable heater and a timer so the bus was nice and 
thawed before I climbed inside to start her each morning.  Use a silicone 
lubricant on your rubber seals so that ice won't build up in the nooks and 
crannies(doorjambs) and freeze the doors shut.  R&R your doorlocks for the 
aforementioned reason.  Be sure the charging system is in tip-top shape.  A 
weak battery WILL fail you in cold weather, at least once.  Once is more 
than enough. AMHIK.   Carry jumper cables.   A bus handles fine in snow, but 
like a toboggan on ice.  Have a set of chains(or cables) handy.
