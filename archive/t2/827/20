Thanks George -

Sorry to say that, based on your input, I've got a problem with oil dripping
from valve cover gasket.  PO's mechanic did a lousy job - the valve cover
gaskets are on my list for spring.

Engine are seals are pretty good.  Am missing one for alternator and some
misc odds and ends - oh yeah, the seal around the old AC compressor could be
better.

I guess I've got a longer list for spring ;-(

Heat exchangers, is leaking oil dripping on them?  Hot oil stinks, and
it's a bear to clean the exchangers.  I cleaned mine by soaking them is
solvent for quite a while then washed them out with a stream of water.
After that, I'm very careful to make sure that the valve cover gaskets are
leak-free.

Engine air seals, are they tight, or is exhaust being drawn into the
engine bay?

General engine bay cleanliness.

HTH, George
