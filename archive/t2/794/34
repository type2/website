Subject: Re: [T2] front left (?) wheel knocking with braking

If it wasn't doing the noise before the brake repair, it is either because
something is wrong with the brake repair or because of the improved braking
power it makes other problems show up...

Are the calipers, pads, pins all tight ? Torqued to spec ?

If all brake parts are fine, move to Chris's advise
good luck
