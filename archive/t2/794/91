Thanks, Gail,

Actually now that you mention it, mine may not have been the actual release 
bearing either. The left side spring was snapped when we pulled the engine. I 
thought that the spring had snapped because the bearing seized. I'll have to 
check it out tonight...Maybe it was just a faulty spring?
