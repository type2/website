Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Release Bearing Failure

Make sure that the crossbar (the part with the fingers) isn't drifting out towards the driver's side. Also saw one with the fingers tearing loose at the crossbar. Both can cause the throwout bearing to ride the clutch pressure plate off center which ultimately overheats it (friction from touching clutch off center) and kills it. 

It took 3 of these bears at $20 a pop to figure this out on a Beetle powered '70 Westy. Mine were going boom at 5 miles. 

Replaced arm, replaced the bushing next to where the clutch arm attached and all was well again. 

Yeha, means an engine pull.
