Thanks all for the hints.  Especially about matching bias.  That, 
unfortunately, might require a less-efficient cutting job, and call for 
more fabric...

I'm guessing, if it's really nasty, washing the old one will make 
working on it that much more pleasant, and avoid transferring a massive 
quantity of mould and mildew spores to the new canvas.  And I would 
assume the old canvas has been wetted enough times over its life that 
washing it one more time won't change anything.

Question: Would washing the *new* canvas shrink it enough that one 
would not have to guess-timate over-sizing it?  Does the Sunbrella 
stuff shrink as much as cotton?

And for Robert, so you made the entire top out of tent fabric?  How's 
that holding up?  It seems it might be a fair bit thinner than the 
canvas; does it show wear where it contacts the struts?  Mark 
recommends against using a coated fabric (why?  Breathability?); have 
you noticed any problems with that?

I haven't quite decided whether or when to go ahead with this project, 
but thanks for the hints and things to think about :)

Anton.
