I'll second that! Yes they are available new ex Brazil, and a bit pricey. 
They look OK, but not the quality of original German ones. I have a received 
number of sets from Karl and all have been great.
BTW Karl, I have seen some much worse than that, but what can you expect 
from bus's that are taken regularly on the beach :)
