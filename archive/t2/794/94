Well, it would be a bit faster than it is in the Vanagon!

As I recall, the term "wasserleaker" generally refers to the opposed-four
water cooled engine as installed in Vanagons  They were truly prone to
leakage.  The Diesel Vanagons (I think) had an in-line four, so they
probably don't fall into that group.
