I think everyone is considering biodiesel these
days.  Those VW diesel are going to be hard to
become hard to find.  I'm told that the brand
spanking new industrial engines will also work.

Also, check out Kennedy Engineered's site.  For
$3 or so, they will send you lotsa information.

These guys were doing Snoopy's conversion, but I
think there was a glitch with the engine.  It was
a used rabbit diesel.
