Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Release Bearing Failure

I recently bought a new "German" Sachs throwout bearing for my bus.
 http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D111%2D141%2D165%2DAGR(I think this was it unless they've sourced them elsewhere since)Since I had the engine and trans out I thought I'd replace it. The existingoriginal bearing was solid steel, very substantial and turned smoothly. Thenew one was made from stamped steel, but it was Sach's so I thought nothingof it.After installing it, I noticed that the bus was whining while stopped withthe clutch pedal down. It could only be...the new bearing was crap.I pulled the engine for various reasons this spring and put the old one backin. Not a sound since.Sad thing is, so many of the parts you can buy now are CRAP, no matter wherethey're made. Nothing touches the original quality that made us love ourVW's. Jamie Rivers told me he keeps a bunch of used parts, and when he needsto replace something he picks the best of them. I think he's on to somethingTom70 High RoofHey All,Any ideas what would cause a one-year-old throwout bearing to fail? Ithoughtperhaps it was because we didn't grease it when we put it in, but I pickedupa new one and it doesn't look like it can be greased...The bus has just 3,000 miles on it since I redid the engine and replaced theclutch and bearing.--Peter Pankonin, digitalcrucible
