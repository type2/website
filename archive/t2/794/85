It could only be...the new bearing was crap.I pulled the engine for various reasons this spring and put the old one backin. Not a sound since.

This has been my experience also. Somewhat disappointing after trying to source THE most German clutch kit parts I could lay my hands on. I'm more inclined to suspect the bearing and not the way the clutch cable was adjusted...

I've seen Clutch discs stamped Germany on the metal but with a Mexico label in the box to indicate where it really came from.

Ron Salmon, is the expert on these kits and where the parts really originate.
