<While I'm down there, is there some easy way to check the ball joints or
bushings without taking them off or anything? Or without using a caliper
that Bently wants me to use?>

The last guy that did an alignment on my car (VW Cabrio) used a pry bar to try to pry the spindle away from the control arm... Excess movement indicates a worn ball joint. I'm sure that Bentley prob has a spec that is tiny. You might have a need for a dial indicator here.
