Subject: Re: [T2] bolt size?

10 x 110 Bolt on the Upper Right (Starter) Side. This has a special
Half-Moon shaped head to lock against a "boss" on the starter to prevent it
from rotating when attaching and tightening the nut. VW # 111 199 101
 10 x 70 Bolt on the Upper Left Side. Because there is usually a "captive
nut" on the case, this is usually inserted and tightened from the
bell-housing side. VW # N 010 470 7
 There are 10mm studs already on the case for the Lower Left and Right. 10mm
nuts (17mm hex) are used to tighten all of the above up.
