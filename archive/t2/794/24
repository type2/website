Hi Mark,

I know of no-one on the list who has installed a Jeep 2.5L engine in  
a 68 type2. More common engine transplants come from porsche,  
corvair, toyota or inline-4 watercooled VW's (gas or diesel). Whether  
it will fit largely depends on exhaust, electrical and intake  
plumbing, which are impossible to guess at since they will be unique  
to your install.

Most people on this list are going to tell you that the best engine  
to use in a 68-79 type2 is an air-cooled horizontally opposed 4  
cylinder. The original engine is adequate for any load the vehicle  
can safely carry, although it probably won't deliver the fuel economy  
you desire at the speeds you wish to travel. Spend money on  
performance improvements, instead of a conversion.


Happy trails,

Hello Everyone,

I am new to the list and I would like some advice.Upon returning to  
the US I will buy a baywindow bus, my question is what is the best  
engine to use in the van or single cab.


Two questions:

1. Will the Jeep 2.5L fit under the engine top cover of a 68 - 79 vw  
van, or will I need to raise the access lid?

2. Is there a better engine to use that will fit my needs, while  
maintaining simplicity and reliability.

My thoughts are an engine conversion to a Jeep 2.5L . It will be used  
for hauling wood, plasterboard, stones, and other house renovation  
materials,  one part of the solution an engine with good low-end toque.

Being retired and single I also like to travel, another desire is an  
engine that will maintain around 25 mpg at 60 to 70 mph on the  
highway. Here again I think the Jeep engine will fit my needs.

The final part is long term reliability and simplicity,  I am willing  
to sacrifice some  fuel consumption for simplicity, but I want to  
maintain at least 20 mpg on the highway.
