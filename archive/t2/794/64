Hi Greg,

I think you are right. I think if you do a good prep job they also
have a little more respect that they are painting an enthusiast
vehicle that will be appreciated rather than an end user's car that
just needs a little freshening up.

 The $400CDN paint they applied is still holding up well. I think the
 trick with Maaco (or other budhet-minded paint shops) is to deliver
 them as little prep work as possible. Because that is precisely what
 they plan to do regardless.  *some* of the time they save in prep
 *might* get spent in getting better results in the spray; but that's
 probably just wishful thinking.

 The fact that you do your own prep does tell the paint shop that you
 are an informed consumer and they're going to be less likely to try
 and pass off a substandard job if they think that way.
