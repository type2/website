<In the Vanagon, it was rated at a WHOPPING 45 hp!!! In the Rabbit, it was 58 HP.>

In other words - slower than the stock aircooled engine at 67 HP... And probably able to pull telephone poles out of the ground if it is anything like the diesels I have driven... <grin!> 

Actually I drove a Vanagon double-cab diesel quite a bit in Italy and though I would have gladly owned one it was not fast at all... Did drive several early 90's turbo diesel Golfs and they were quite fun.
