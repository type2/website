Subject: Re: [T2] Crankshaft Endplay

Hello Max  Check the dead end play that is without any shimms  if it is over 
.055 then it is time to rebuild and linebore the case.  If you try thicker 
shims it will just lock the motor up. When these motors get too much end play you 
wont be able to stop it from leaking oil cause the crank will move back and 
forth actting like an oil pump.  later and have fun  Mark dearing
