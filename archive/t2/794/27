Hey Mark! I've got a Corvair 110 HP in my bus. 

Questions to ponder: who's doing the work? has it been done before (therefore telling you it will fit)? Have you considered what the low geared VW tranny is going to be like mated to a modern engine with lots of torque and HP? I my experience with a stock 1500cc Beetle (~50 HP) tranny mated to a slightly warmed 2.0 Type IV (~80-90 HP) it seemed too low geared... 

Who will maintain it? Many shops will not touch it...

Have you compared weights between the stock and the implant engine? Might affect handling... Dunno...

Will you keep it EFI or go carb? 

Where do you put the radiator? 

The water cooled implant idea hs been successful for many people with different engines. It can be done so I'm not trying to discourage you... Just trying to help you cover all the bases before you start buying the pieces. 

The VW Type II remains a true utility vehicle! More versatile than many of the more modern vehicles. 

An easier watercooled implant would be a Subbieroo flat-4 or flat-6...

Good luck!!!
