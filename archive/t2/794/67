If anyone knows how to get a new pair, please help...
I know that these parts get rusty pretty bad in all VW's so anyone that made
an restoration, probably had the same problem...

I second the opinion to find good used frames. If you can't find any near you, there are some online wreckers in the U.S. listed on ratwell.com that may ship to Europe. (Be sure to compare prices because prices vary greatly between wreckers). Almost all of these frames will have some rust because they are designed to pass water down the channel between the frame and rubber and allow it to exit by dripping out of a hole in the bottom. When you find one that is in pretty good shape, treating it with POR15 or something equivalent will stabilize the rust. The only thing to watch out for is to not use too much POR15 liquid inside the channel. If it puddles up in the channel while it is drying it will form a thick spot when dry and the rubber will be hard to install as it is normally a tight fit anyway. --Ask me how I know. :( 

Good Luck,
