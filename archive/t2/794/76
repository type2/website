Subject: Re: [T2] bolt size?

Dear Gail,

Is it the upper bolt by the clutch cable (rather than by the starter)? 
I'm missing that one (have been for a long time apparently), and a 
knowledgeable friend told me it was often left off by less fastidious 
mechanics because it is the most difficult one to access. Doesn't seem 
to have done any harm in 46000 miles, although I do worry about it.
