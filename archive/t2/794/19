Subject: Crankshaft Endplay

Hi all,



Last weekend I pulled the engine from my 71' westy, 1600dp, to replace a
suspected leaking front seal. This was my first VW engine pull, so nice
and easy. Once I got it out and pulled the flywheel off, I could easily
see that the front seal was not seated properly. I was happy that it was
just the seal. BUT... the reason the seal was not properly seated was
that the crankshaft endplay has decided to shoot to the moon. I checked
my endplay and I need a .045" shim to get it into specification. That is
a bit insane. I assume a shim that large is not manufactured, so I will
just stick the thickest one on and run her until she breaks. The engine
ran fine, just leaked oil where the transmission and engine mate. How
many more miles should I suspect out of the engine before I have to tear
it down? Also, any ideas on how to stop the oil leak should it start
reoccurring.



Thanks,



Max Bronsema
