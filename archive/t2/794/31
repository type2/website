Dunk,

Try to pull them before your professional painting.  I've just had my
windshield out, and am about to do my rear window, and the rust under the
seals is considerable.  It would be best for you to get all your glass out,
deal with rust, and have some quality paint put down.

Spray paint, yes.

Good Luck,
