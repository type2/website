Subject: Re: [T2] DIY tent patterns?

I made my own canvas for a '75 top I put on an old bus. It wasn't too
hard, although I did use my old one as a pattern. I just took it apart
very carefully, then traced each of the 4 sides. If you didn't want to
take yours apart, though, maybe you could find an old canvas at a junkyard
or something.
  Also, instead of starting with plain canvas, and doing windows & such, I
had an old tent that I cut up. I ended up with even bigger windows than
the standard top, and the best part was that the tent was free because
someone had lost the poles. Can't beat that. If you don't have a free
tent, you can usually pick up cheap tents at walmart or someplace for
$50-$75. cheaper than canvas, and sewing windows & screens & all that is
a huge pain...
