I believe the VW diesel was essentially the same block as the Rabbit - as in - a traditional in-line 4 cylinder. Not a flat 4 engine - if you didn't know. 

You might compare the gear ratios of the diesel Vanagon to the Baywindow bus to see if the power/weight/rpm numbers at similar. 

Lastly I'd hazard a guess and say the diesel is going to be as slow as the stock 4 cylinder air cooled version so all you might gain is fuel economy. What was the diesel Vanagon rated at? 

FWIW with the stock aircooled VW engine I managed plenty of trips with 2000+ lbs of weight in or behind the vehicle without much trouble and not on the interstate. I went places where I could drive whatever speeds I was capable - which was slow on the mountain roads. Now admittedly I was not crossing the Rockies but for around town it was A+ and I even pulled my Beetle over the TN hills to Chattanooga several times - all with the stock everything. 

Is it really, really interesting to you? <grin!> Was to me and that is how I ended up with a Corvair implant. 

Seems like the parts are available. Tilts the engine over to miss the ceiling of the engine bay, special oil pan, and I would ASSUME it is much like putting a Tiico implant in since I think the block is the same. Still got the radiator to place. 

If I was going through the trouble of adding a diesel I'd go with a Porsche 5 speed (lots of custom ratios to match engine to vehicle) and a late model TDi engine.
