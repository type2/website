Dear list,

Some might consider this fun, but not many. When I drop the engine this 
week on my kombi (1600 DP), what sort of crankshaft endplay do you think 
I will find? The engine has 46000 miles on it since installation, and as 
far as I know this is the first time it has been checked. Not pushed too 
hard, a fairly normal mix of town, country and high speed (OK 65mph) 
miles covered.

There is a use for this info. This is my first tim, and I want some idea 
what ball park figure I should get so I know if I have made a complete 
mess of the procedure.

Can't wait for the weekend. And neither can my engine.

Stephen W
