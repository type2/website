Yes, I've heard this.  I think it was on Click
and Clack.  Not sure, but it was definitely
someone promoting SAE30, but even VW abandoned
that thinking in the 1977 oil recommendations.  

HOWEVER, let me amend my original statement to
say that oil viscosity is on page two of a double
column list of things that might cause
overheating. 

He should first be looking at cooling issues and
tuning.
