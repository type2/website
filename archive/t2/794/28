Here are the reasons why I am NOT going to have the '76 rebuilt as a '78 
with hydr lifters. (Mostly, it is the 'etc' part of your question that is 
giving me pause!!)

   The '76 engine/setup may have some differences that I am not aware of.

   There was a Bob Hoover article where Bob said the solid lifters were 
different sized from the hydraulic lifters.  I don't know if he was 
referring to the diameter or not, so I will have to check that out.  If so, 
then then the lifter bore in the block may be different.  The blocks are 
coded GE and GD, so what is the differences in the block.

   People talk about the differences in the cam.  This is my biggest hold 
back.  I do have a set of hydraulic lifters, hydr push rods and valve 
springs and rocker assembly (in case there is any difference in the geometry 
of the rocker arms, other than the spring VS spacer setup between the arms 
themselves)  But no hyrdraulic lifters' cam....

  The '76 has a different EGR setup than the '78.  Different EGR valve 
setup, and there is something on the throttle of the '76 that is not on the 
'78   This may feed back into the ECU Brain, so I don't know if the harness 
is the same.  I am going to use a '78 harness and a '78 throttle and a '78 
ECU.

  The charcoal canister setup is different.  I don't know if I can use the 
existing '76 setup with a '78 engine.

  Is the decel valve the same??

  The air distribution box is different.  I am going to use the '78 box, but 
block off the EGR recirculation.  The EGR valve sits on the '78 air 
distribution box.  I don't know what's happening with the '76, but I am 
going to remove ALL the EGR configuration from the '78.

  I am going to bring in a turn-key '78 FI engine with exhaust and heater 
(heat exchangers and heater control box) setup.   '78 cooling tin, although 
I don't know if there is any difference

Well, I hope Murphy comes in with a hand when I have to drop and install the 
engine(s)   ;-)
