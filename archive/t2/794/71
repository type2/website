Hi Duncan,

That sounds like a reasonable plan (It's what I did) ... BUT....

....Talk to the bodyshop before you prime it. Some paints won't  
adhere properly to rattle-can primers. If that is the case, the body  
shop may be able to supply you with a more appropriate primer for the  
paint they are using.

Happy trails,
