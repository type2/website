Ah..... the Mossberg repair technique!  Load up the
shotgun and throw a bunch of new parts at it til it
fixes it.

STOP!  Learn how an ignition system works first,
before you throw more $$ away.

Checklist run, no spark observed from HT wire from
coil to distributor when disconnected from rotor and
leaning against metal of distributor body while
cranking.
 
Replaced Coil with new one from autozone, I watched
the guy test the new coil and he says the new one
checks out.
 
New coil, same problem.  Verified that the ignition
wire (15) is getting power by holding against metal
distributor body with ignition on, sparking
observed.
 
If the points/condensor are bad would not there
still be a spark observed from the HT while cranking ?

Could I have got a bad coil from autozone ?
 
Help in what to check next !
