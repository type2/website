I didn't catch where you live or what the weather there is like, but...

Rust Bullet is awesome on stopping rust dead and yet is still sandable. If
you're leaving it outside for a whole winter, dabbing the rust spots with 2
coats of RB will provide outstanding protection in the meantime.

I used RB on some areas of my bus and I could actually watch it soaking into
the rust. It will easily hold off additional rust through the winter. The
"DoubleShot" kit is like $20 and one can did most of the areas I wanted rust
stopped at, yet still left me one can to use later.

Here's a thread I started about it on The Samba:
