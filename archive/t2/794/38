I'll redo the torquing on all the bolts on the calipers. I need to get a
ratchet torque wrench anyway, the spring beam torque wrench I had was made
in Chinazone and the 1/2" to 3/8" adapter snapped off (still in my 6mm allen
socket :( need one of those too)

 If all brake parts are fine, move to Chris's advise


While I'm down there, is there some easy way to check the ball joints or
bushings without taking them off or anything? Or without using a caliper
that Bently wants me to use?

Thanks for the advice
