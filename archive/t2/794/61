What year is the double cab? If it has the bus mounts for the rear
support bar, you should be fine. If not, an adaptor is available.

 We have Greg's 69 Westy at our place now so we can work on it a little
 easier.  One of the quickest options we have to get him back on the road is
 to possibly take a 1600 SP out of a Double Cab and stick that in his 69
 Westy.  First question is, should this be pretty straight forward?  I have
 only worked on type 4's and have not done much with type 1's.
