Subject: Leaving For HAvasu

Wish us luck!  Leaving now for Kansas than driving all day tomorrow so I can 
see you people!   1500 miles one way!
If you see a gray Splitty and a tan diesel Rabbit  between here and there it 
is probably us!  Answer your phone if you are on the AIRS list and if you 
aren't....get on it!
Supposed to be -8 f at home on Friday so glad I am leaving!
HAVASU OR BUST!
