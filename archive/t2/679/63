Subject: Extra hole in shroud

On my friend's 72 bus I noticed this hole in the shroud:

Normally I would suspect it was for the charcoal canister so the fan could
blow air through it on the earlier models but this engine has the opening on
the top (the converted inspection hole for 411s/914s/etc):

Was there a plug on the side of the shroud originally?
