Hello Dana...If I wanted a propane tank, I'd check the web site 
<http://www.mantank.com/products/rv_cylinder.htm> of the original 
manufacturer (Manchester Tanks & Equipment) and then ask questions with 
either the toll-free number or the email address of their sales force:

Manchester Tank & Equipment Co
62626 Stephanie St
Goshen, IN, 574-534-9328
1-800-877-8265
sales(-at-)mantank.com

And, listen to the other replies to your post.
