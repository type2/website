I'm thinking of buying a cover for my bus to try to
slow the rusting process...Any suggestions on where to
buy one/what one to buy/how much it will cost? Also,
does anyone know any place in the NJ area that could
possibly do body work, as in rust removal and welding
replacement metal on?  As always, thanks for any help.
