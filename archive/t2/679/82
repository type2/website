Subject: Re: [T2] Choice of Power Inverters?

You are best making tea with gas or a 12 volt appliance. 

I have an older square wave inverter and it works very well (600W peak back when 600W inverters were $200!) but with some audio appliances it causes electrical hums or lines on a TV. 

On a laptop which is powered by a transformer, I expect it would be fine. 

A true sine wave inverter best duplicates the wall current. More expensive to be sure but they are best for running electronics. 

A motorized gadget won't care I'd expect. My powertools certainly don't... 

True sine wave inverters may not like power tools or heater elements though...

Make sure it has a fan built in. Mine gets hot running at max output. Mine had a manufacturing defect and the fan would not run. It got HOT. Fixed the fan and it was DANDY. 

Look at the RV catalogs and then comparison shop.
