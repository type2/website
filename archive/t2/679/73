Richard,

When I built up the engine forthe 78 Champagne, i used some T4 parts that 
had been thrown in with a car deal several years ago.

The fan shround was probably from a 74 or so and had a pipe sticking out 
from the location you show on the drivers side.

You can see it here

It *came* with a closed plug in the  middle .
I used  a piece of hose with a plug in it to close off the one on the drivers side.

My opinion was that it was for charcoal canister as I had to "build' a 
connector on the passenger side to make my 78 match correctly.

Cheers, dave

 Normally I would suspect it was for the charcoal canister so the fan could
 blow air through it on the earlier models but this engine has the opening on
 the top (the converted inspection hole for 411s/914s/etc):
