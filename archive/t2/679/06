Subject: Re: [T2] Satellite Radio and iPod install ?

I've got Sirius satellite - 

but I opted not to go with the permanent install...  the car cradle has a 
built-in FM transmitter that broadcasts to my radio on any of 4 different 
frequencies - so I've just been tossing the antenna up on my dash, plugging into the 
cigarette lighter, turning it on, tuning in to one of those frequencies, and 
going on about my business- around town (Austin TX) it works fine - very few 
drop outs and those are instantaneous - (Sirius also has one or more ground 
repeaters in/around town) -

between me and the wife we have 3 vehicles, and this has worked well for me - 
just take the unit in whatever vehicle we happen to be driving at the time...

I did notice on a 500 -mile trip to Arkansas and back that there were more 
dropouts on the interstate when we started out with the antenna on the dash - 
but these were remedied by going ahead and putting the antenna up on the roof 
and running the (21 foot) cable through the interior of the vehicle I was 
driving at the time up to the front...

I haven't tried that with our Westy yet - the antenna has a magnetic mount, 
so we might have to devise an alternative means of securing it to the 
fiberglass... but the long and short of it is I'd rather be able to go between vehicles 
with one unit than go through the hassle of "permanent" installation in each 
one at $50 per pop for the cradles...
