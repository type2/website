I realize I am "ringing in late" here, but what the heck.  Jeremy, have
you preformed a compression test lately?  If so, was the squeaking
side compression low compared to the quiet side of the engine?
Try a valve adjustment (even hydraulic lifter engines need a valve
adjustment occaisionally) and retest the compression.

I heard the squeak/cricket chirp coming from my engine in '87,
and the noise was from compression leaking out between the
cylinder and head.
