Research it some more (different sources) b/c when I lived in Italy many cars and vans ran on propane becauser the cost was lower and I DID see it on aircooled vehicles. 

Maybe you could wrap a fuel line around a hot exhaust pipe or something or introduce a loop of fuel line into the heat exhaust coming off the engine.

BEWARE: none of these are complete ideas and pose some potential risks but just making the point that your engine makes heat too, just how are you going to capture it? 

GOOD LUCK!
