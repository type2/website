Subject: Motivation and priorities (was: It's the wrong color, Grommit)

I've got the paint book, Chris. I don't want to be motivated to get it 
done. I really don't. That's what this is all about. As far as I'm 
concerned, shiny paint on straight sides is really the lowest possible 
priority (but something I want to have some day when all the other 
higher priorities are taken care of).

I just want it to be the right color, and I want the bus to be 
basically waterproof so I can drive it in the rain. And when I pull 
into a camping spot, I don't want the people on either side to think 
"oh crap."

And I want to take my time. If it takes a decade to get the bodywork 
done, that's okay. I just hope there'll still be petroleum products 
then.
