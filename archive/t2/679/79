Subject: Bentley schematic question

On schematic 'E' - 'From Aug 70 (71 Models)' of Bentley there are two 
front 'fan motors' shown. They are marked V1 and V2 along with switch E9 
on the schematic. I have a 71 and don't have any fans that I know of. 
Was this an option of some sort?

Sincere Thanks,
