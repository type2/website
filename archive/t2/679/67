Subject: It's the wrong color, Grommit

Preamble: Yes, I know this is not the _right_ way to do bodywork and 
paint.

Okay, here's the thing. Peregrine is the wrong color. Actually, the bus 
is stock '76 chrome yellow. Has never been repainted. Standard 
transporter scheme: white from the waist up, and interior. Chrome 
yellow below. I don't like it. I'm sure that some people do, and this 
is just a matter of subjective taste. I always seem to end up with 
vehicles that are the wrong color, and I live with it. Had two Volvos 
with the identical orange paint, hated it both times.

I want Peregrine to be "polar blue," or approximately the same color as 
that "show bus" that I posted last week. But there is a lot of bodywork 
standing between me and a good paint job. Not to mention that 
thoroughly upgraded mechanicals are my highest priority.

Every once in a while, I start to wonder why I can't follow this scheme:

1. Wash and prep sand the lower panels

2. Hit the rusty spots (dents and gouges) with POR and sand

3. Spray on sealer

4. Spray one good coat of the right color, single stage

5. Relax about the danged color, even though the dents and creases are 
still there, and holes are covered with fiberglass

6. Do bodywork, section by section, "in my spare time" -- some welding 
here and there, down to metal where absolutely necessary, good primer,  
respraying with the same paint

7. Eventually, when I have done the whole bus, sand one more time and 
paint with two-stage paint.

The other option is to just do (6) and (7) but live with the wrong 
color for a few years until I get that all done.

Question: Any tips on how to follow this plan and make sure that 
everything adheres well when I get around to (7)?
