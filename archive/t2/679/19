Subject: Re: Satellite Radio and iPod install ?

My brother has the XM setup that works thru the FM tuner on your radio. I
have taken several trips with him and I have never experienced a drop out.
He says that hte only times it has problems is when your in a parking deck
or in the middle of a big city with tall buildings. According to him, other
than that it rarely ever fades out. The channels are good to. I have no idea
what the channels are like on the sirius brand.
