I replaced the grommets one time long ago with a piece of vacuum tubing that I slit the side open on, and then cut to length. Push around the inside lip of the hole. Fit my budget and I had the supplies on hand. 

There are many different tubing sizes - thick wall, thin wall, different I.D. so look around if the first one you pick doesn't fit. Most stores will give you little snips to test.
