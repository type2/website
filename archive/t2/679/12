List Members,

do you have any recommendations for a VW mechanic in or within tow range of zip code 60540 (Naperville, 50 miles West of Chicago)? My 82 Vanagon (air+carb) has gone electrically inert and is beyond my powers to diagnose/fix. I moved up from KCMO (Vee Village is great down there) and don't know anybody. Help!

Many thanks
