Subject: Is it possible to install thermo flaps without pulling engine?

Hello all - 
 
I have an 81 Vanagon.  I took some bad advice and did not reinstall the thermostat flaps when I installed the engine.  The more I read, the more ill this decision makes me feel.  
 
I want to rectify the situation.  But I don't want to pull the engine!  
 
Can I install the flaps without pulling the engine?
 
Thanks - 
 
Marc 
 
P.S.  The hot start relay did the trick with my sticking starter!
