not that it is anything about the valves::::: but once my carb manifold came loose and on the side it came loose it was chirping just like a bird just LIKE a bird. sounded like a squeek when it idled low and then a fast chirp when high.
good luck to you either way or for whatever it is or may be?

I realize I am "ringing in late" here, but what the heck. Jeremy, have
you preformed a compression test lately? If so, was the squeaking
side compression low compared to the quiet side of the engine?
Try a valve adjustment (even hydraulic lifter engines need a valve
adjustment occaisionally) and retest the compression.

I heard the squeak/cricket chirp coming from my engine in '87,
and the noise was from compression leaking out between the
cylinder and head.
