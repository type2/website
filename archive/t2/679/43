The bus drives great, has aprox. 3000 miles on rebuilt engine (rebuilt by VW
mechanic) I drove it here (Northern Virginia) from Fort Walton Beach, Florida
without problems.
Nice interior. Needs tires, paint job and a little body work. Photos available
upon request. Price is $2500. The bus is located at Fort Belvoir Virginia.
