Hello All,

I just bought a 1974 hgih roof delivery van, pretty much empty save the sofa
bed. I'd like to adapt it, and make it more usable for long journeys, by adding
furnitures in it (cooking gear, covert).

My question is how do you actually attach the furnitures to the van inside
(screw through the walls?) ? COuld you point me to some documentation about
this?

Many thanks for the help,
Olivier./.
