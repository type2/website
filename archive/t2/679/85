The Italians used a "bombola" (aka 80 lb propane tank similar to the gas grill tanks here). Of course the "bomb" portion of the word got my attention... <griN!>

Saw them on the roof mostly. Ugly arrangement really. 

Most folks had the OEM gasoline system with the propane system piggy backed on top. A flip of a switch would give them dual fuel options. 

Important b/c the Italian gas stations would go on strike from time to time with political rhetoric about taxes and gov't restrictions when we all knew better... They just wanted to see the big soccer game downtown or go on vacation for a few days.... <grin!> 

Once was without gasoline options for a bit over a week. Luckily had a reserve supply at the house. When gone though...
