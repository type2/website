Hi Marc,

The trick is to lift the main side tins. To do this you need to remove
the intake manifolds and release the tin that crosses the engine from
side to side at the front of the engine (towards the front of the
vehicle) by removing the sheet bolts that hold it to the side tin. Of
course the small tin pieces at the rear of the vehicle will have to be
loosened or removed too.

I think we have all fallen prey to this bad advice at one time or
another. When you are first starting out and looking for information,
you tend to find the people with casual knowledge before you find the
experts. I'm running an engine myself I put together before I found
out flaps were important.
