I have been using one in my bus for about the past year, and have had one 
in my "other" vehicle for many years.  They are perfectly suited to 
starting, in fact they are designed for it and do a better job than a 
flooded lead-acid ever could.  I would upgrade to a solid-state regulator 
at the same time to be sure it charges properly.

Depends on the person.  You can get them for about $100 from the membership 
stores.
