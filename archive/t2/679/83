Look here for info:  http://www.impco.ws/

The problem is you need to convert the propane fuel from a liquid (it is a liquid in the tank) to a gas (LPG carbs are gas/gas).  In a watercooled system, this is accomnplished by heat exchanging with the coolant.  Not possible in an aircooled system.  However, one could just as easily use the air-cooled coolants (the air or better, the oil).  One just cannot buy a ready made heat exchanger like this, thus this needs to be engineered.  Not that big a deal, really.

I plan to do a LPG conversion at some point.  I am probably dreaming, but I see a future where I pay Jake Raby to rebuild my engine specifically for LPG (higher compression that gas is optimal for LPG) and I use the Megasquirt system for either liquid LPG injection, or a LPG carb, and really work this out properly.  To me, the biggest challenge is obtaining a good fuel tank.  Optimally, one that will fit where the existing one is and will also hold a reasonable quantity.

Bogged down right now with rust repair/painting/interior resto.
