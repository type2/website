Antonio,

Is it a 3 way or 2 way fridge? That is, can it run on propane as well as 
battery and grid power? If it's a 3 way fridge you can forget running it 
from solar power. 3 way fridges are very convenient but also generally less 
efficient than 2 way fridges. 3 way fridges also only run fully on propane 
or grid power - battery power is only enough to keep an already cold fridge 
going when you're on the road.

I don't know much about 2 way fridges except that people do run modern ones 
from solar power. Also, if I was doing what you suggest I would increase 
the insulation thickness on the fridge, as it is usually minimal, and I'd 
wire my solar charged battery to also be charged by the van alternator so 
that it is charged when you're travelling and to give you a "back-up" 
generator for cloudy days.

'I'm looking for the fridge specifications of a 1977 deluxe campmobile. In 
fact,
I need to know what's the current (A) and the energy (W) required for the
fridge to work properly. All those informations will be used to design a system
of self automony (solar power) when camping in the middle of but nowhere. Let
you guys know when I have a working prototype.'


Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
