should I guess but I've run out of time, got one day left tommorrow and
only a few hours at that, I will use em as alignment studs and weld. won't
hurt em and maybe later I will grind the welds off and do it "right" but
just plain outta time gonna have to use the "big sledge hammer" and just
weld it together.  we had a brief warm spell here in the east but Fri it
is supposed to get VERY cold again and I have to work outside.  she gets
back on the road tommorrow if at all possible.

thanks anyway
Bob
