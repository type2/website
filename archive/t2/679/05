Subject: parcel trays revisited

Did anyone ever find out if the ones like BD sells fit into a standard 
bus(with air channels on the door)?

Chris?  was it you that had some coming and then weren't sure?

I don't remember Ron at BD ever piping up and saying that they fit with 
the air channels either.

Anyone?

Cheers, dave
