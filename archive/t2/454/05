Paul,

You don't need a might-vac....mouth will do fine....use a new piece of 
hose tho!

Suck on it and you should see a small arm that goes from inside the can
to the "plate" on the distributor get sucked in towards the can.
THe "plate" is what the points are attached to.

Simple as that!

Cheers, dave
