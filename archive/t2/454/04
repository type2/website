Hi Paul,

We need more info: What year bus, and what engine/fuel system do you 
have?

If it is a dual-carbed 72-74 1.7/1.8L, I'd suspect either a vacuum leak 
or an electric lead has fallen off a solenoid on a carb.  This has 
happened to my bus on occaision.

The backfires are probably related to exhaust leaks: did you use fresh 
gaskets when you reassembled it?

Happy trails,
