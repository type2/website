First of all, nice job.

I'm on my second windshield. The original sekurit developed a nasty crack in the driver's corner and there was one too many rock ding. The replacement was a PPG windshield put in 5 years ago and seems the same. If you have an original I bet it's no where near as clear to see through as a new one. Something to keep in mind...

When I had the windshield out recently for rust repair I debated for a long time on which seal to purchase to replace the old seal. Talking with Richard at OEVeedub he convinced me that the majority of seals out there including the Genuine VW Brazil seal (which is slightly different than stock) breaks more windshields than necessary upon installation. With that advice I decided to get seal he sells that's German OEM. He told me it's made from EPDM rubber by Metzler and I decided (before the Euro went up against the dollar) that it was work the extra $20 not to risk breaking the windshield.

When it arrived it looked very nice. Sure enough the bodymen who installed it said it was a perfect fit and a breeze to install. I was really taken back when they were thanking me for doing this for them. I strongly recommend it.
