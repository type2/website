I bought the Lincoln 100 a small mig welder that will run on 120 and it
has served me well, since I didn't have any power in the garage I just
bought a generator big enough to operate the welder...don't usually have
anything else going when the welder is being used so the full power oof
the generator is avaliable for the arc...

killed two birds at the same time, limited funds and I needed the
generator too for some other things(it sure came in handy this week with
no power here in the Northeast)
