Subject: Window Sealant Questions

"I'm getting ready to put all the windows back in the bus and I'm trying to

decide what, if anything, to seal things up with."

IMHO Nothing, factory did not use anything, and as long as you have good
seals you shouldn't need anything.

"So what is the best?  What would seal the best, keep the rust away, not
hurt
my not-so-cheap paint job, last the longest...."

"Seems to me like the Window Weld Sealer 08606."

Probably pretty good stuff. I've always been a big 3M fan.

"And finally what would one use to clean up the excess sealant? Something
paint freindly."

Not certain but this type of stuff usually cleans up with denatured alcohol
which is paint safe, check the tube.

But if it were me I would not use anything unless you found that they
leaked, then i would find out why and only use the sealant as a last
resort. These glues can be great but who knows what they will be like in 15
years...
