Subject: Compression test logistics

Hey folks...

I have a question about compression test logistics... I learned long 
ago that one should never remove spark plugs from a VW unless the 
engine is cold, so as to reduce the chance of stripping the threads.

However, I understand that compression tests need to be done warm, and 
will all plugs removed.

Seems like there's a conflict here that needs to be resolved.

I'm super paranoid about stripping plug threads because it happened to 
me on a Beetle I had years ago; the cost in time and $$ is hard to 
forget.

Any advice?
