Subject: Engine cutting out

 Hi everyone,

I was wondering whether you could help.  On the way back form the Vanfest
this weekend my bus appeared to cut out when coming to a stop - especially
once the clutch had been pressed.  It's been back firing for some time now
since  I change my exhaust.

I realise this has been a common theme for discussion in recent months buy I
seem to have deleted all entries about this.

many thanks
