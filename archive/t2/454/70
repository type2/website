On a cold engine, break torque on the plugs then tighten them only a little
bit by hand. Run the engine for 5 mins to warm up then shut it down and do
your compression tests. You'll be able to remove the plugs easily without
worrying about threads (unless the unknown damage was done by the PO).

I have little experience using anti-seize as a preventative agent wrt spark
plugs. Generally it's a great addition but as far as spark plugs go, it
seemed an unnecessary mess to have to clean up after it dries when as it's
been pointed out so well on the list in the past, the threads on Bosch plugs
already are nickel plated to ease removal.
