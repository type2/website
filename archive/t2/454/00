Subject: Re: [T2] checking for brake fluid leaks

>>So, I wanted to repair the system before bleeding it.<<

good idea.

>>Any advice on how to check for the leak?<<

get under the bus with a light & inspect all of the components
very carefully. of course, you could have the problem of a 
bad MC leaking into the booster as someome recently posted.

i would suspect any joints or meeting places in the system &
of course the wheel cylinders on the rear.

>> and any advice for bleeding the brakes.<<

start with longest pipe & go to shortest. get a helper
with a strong leg!

good luck,
