on that note a quick VW story:

my old college advisor spend many years as a high school shop teacher
in NC. One day while covering the ignition system in auto tech they
had a beetle in there that one of the students owned. One particular
student was very interested in the lecture that day. The odd thing was
that this student had never paid attention before, but was for some
reason, very interested in how the ignition system worked. 

well the next day he wasn't in class. At the end of the day my advisor
was called in to see the boss (principle). Earlier that day he
received a call on the telephone informing him that one of his
students was pulled over 2 or 3 counties away driving a stolen VW
Beetle. 

Turns out he knew of a beetle in the neighborhood as was paying
attention that day so he could hot wire the thing. It apparently took
quite a while for my advisor to reason with the principle about the
episode. He just couldn't grasp the idea that having the knowledge of
how an ignition system works is just enough to hot wire a car.
