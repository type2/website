Subject: After 4 1/2 yrs my Bus is Done!!!

Hi, After working on my bus for 4 1/2 years it's finally painted & put back
together!  Just a few things need to be done next spring: undercoat some of
the bottom & work a bit on the rims, they're very close to the body.
Anyway, if you're interested check out the photos:

Happy Bussing,
