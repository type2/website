Step right up!
        You say you wanna remove that rust but it's just too much 
hard work? Saw this over the weekend and it really works...
First, get a container large enough to hold the object you want
to derust. A plastic garbage can of appropriate size is OK...
Second, fill with water... enough to cover the object.
Third, clean a spot on the object (wire brush, whatever) so you'll
get good contact and attach the negative clip of a battery charger.
Fourth, get a fair sized piece of stainless steel or clean steel and
attach the positive clip of the charger.
Fifth, immerse both in the container; careful they don't touch.
Sixth, turn on charger.
Seventh, add washing soda (sodium carbonate) to the water until
the meter reads 1-2 amps. Arm and Hammer makes a washing
soda, but I'm sure there are other brands.
Eighth, wait and see...Takes a few hours but when the little bubbles
start forming on the rusted piece, you'll know it's working.
After a few hours, check the progress, and brush off the rust. Con-
tinue until the rust is all removed. 
Then, quickly clean and dry the piece and primer or seal it... 8-)
