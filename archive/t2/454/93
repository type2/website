I don't think that would be the best course.  The compound used by my glass
man was a urethane compound that came out like dark black axle grease and is
really messy stuff.  Before it sets it oozes in and fills all the dead space
in your seal and It sets up great.  Also on the same note I used a gasket
for the windshield from West Coast Metrics & I haven't had any problems for
about 7 years so far.
