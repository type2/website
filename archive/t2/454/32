    I too have replaced the hinge for the pedal with a standard hardware
hinge. I went one step further however and replaced the link  from the pedal
to the "lever" (swiveling piece that the cable hooks onto) with an
adjustable length link comprised of a two threaded ball or "heim" joints
with a threaded section between.
    This modification has improved the feel of the gas pedal dramatically.
Good Luck
