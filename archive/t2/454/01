Bill,

I think someone offered the vacuum can replacement for about 
$35.00(bus depot?)...might not have been the one you need though.

As to muffler/header you can go two ways.  After many years ofthis stuff, 
I've realized that if I want it to last, you buy the best thing you can 
get, and if you can't afford it, then you have to buy cheap and then 
upgrade your part.

For example, you might buy a set of "cheap" headers/muffler and then 
upgrade by buying the do-it-yourself ceramic coating or taking it to
the local powder coating shop and having them coat it with hi-temp powder
coat.

On the other hand, maybe a stainless steel standard muffler would be a 
better deal.

You know how much money you have...your choice....

Cheers, dave
