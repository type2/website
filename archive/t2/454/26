Jason,

Disconnect all hoses to the stube and plug them.
One place I didn't think of till a few days ago would be the
oil breather box.

It sits on top of a seal to the engine that may be leaking.

If you pull and plug *all* of the tubes to the s-tube and then add them 
back one by one, i think you have a better chance of finding your problem.



Cheers, dave
