Jay,
    Here's some info that might help.......
We will also be camping at the Metrowest Hopkinton YMCA
(Camp Bob Jones) before the show. Send me an
e-mail(stan.wohlfarth(-at-)bentleypublishers.com) if you are interested in
more details on the camping.

Paul A
Huntington Station, New York
71 westy

PS  It's never too cold for the dog to go camping, but as for your
girlfriend, only she knows for sure.
