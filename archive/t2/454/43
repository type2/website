Subject: Re: [T2]Been ROBBED? Lock up your fuel.

Regarding installing a lock on the fuel door, I have posted some PICS of my 
lock which can be viewed here.
A pretty simple idea that works but the purists may cringe.

If you go to your local hardware store you can buy this lock for about $5.00, 
this one measures about 1-1/4" just over 3 cm long along the threaded portion 
of the cylinder.
If you have access to a panel punch this will be easy but if you don't then I 
recommend a sheet metal "step" bit which can be purchased from Harbor freight 
for about $25.00 (they also have panel punch sets) 
The hole is centered on the door 1" or 2.5 cm from the edge of the door to 
the center of the lock cylinder.
The slot for the cam latch can be created with a dremmel tool.

Any how this lock has kept my fuel safe from pilferage for 20 years.

Have fun!
Rusty
