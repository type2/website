Subject: Window Sealant Questions

Greetings List,

I'm getting ready to put all the windows back in the bus and I'm trying to 
decide what, if anything, to seal things up with.

The guy that I just bought my windsheild from said to use silicone spray. 
And that "as the silicone dries it forms a bond between the body and the 
seal."  Hmmm, seems fishy.

Then I went to by my local body shop supply house and found two different 
kinds of 3M products that seemed appropriate. One is called "Window Weld 
Sealer" - 08606.  The other ones are urethane based one is called "Fast Cure 
Urethane" and the other is called "Super Fast Urethane" or something catchy. 
Then I asked them what to use and they made a phone call, went to the back, 
and came up with a tube of silicone (the kind that would fit in a caulking 
gun, not the spray as recommended by the windsheild guy).

And finally the libarary talks about dish soap. Though I figure this is just 
applied to the interior sides of the seals to aid the whole pull through 
string installation process.

So what is the best?  What would seal the best, keep the rust away, not hurt 
my not-so-cheap paint job, last the longest....

Seems to me like the Window Weld Sealer 08606.

And finally what would one use to clean up the excess sealant? Something 
paint freindly.

Thanks,
Brandt
