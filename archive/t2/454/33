Ben,
Good to see you survived the little "incident" without any
more extreme damage(internal!) Bear with the pain, and
follow the doctors directions, and yo8u will be out and
about in no time.....too bad you won't be able to ride for
quite a while(what did teh doc say? six months to a year
before riding? or was he one of those anti-bike guys who
tells you to never ride again?  ;-(  ...anyway, from te
photo's it looks like you should be able to easilly get teh
ol' GPZ back up to snuff pretty easilly as long as teh
frame is strait...assuming his insurance is taking care of
EVERYTHING???  right  medical bills etc?

anyway sorry to see one of us down for a while, get lots of
rest/recuperation, and hang in there!

Paul
my first ever bike was a gpz! wonderfull bike...
'78 westy
'92 Ducati 750ss
'65 Garelli
...etc
and al the land-rovers...
