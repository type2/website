Theodore,

I believe the torque value for spark plugs is pretty high...my problem is 
I am always leery of torqing them too hi.  I have actually started using a 
torque wrench when I do mine and it always seems more than necessary.

Until I remember troubleshooting a t1 for carb problems and finally 
figuring out(3 hours later) that one of the plugs was just not tight 
enough....makes for a funny acting engine.

Cheers, dave
