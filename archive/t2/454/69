Hard to say.  The CO is set at idle.  At idle the EGR valve is closed.  So
why would removing the EGR filter, and blocking it off, affect this?

Of course, if the EGR filter was leaking, you'd be introducing unmetered air
into the system at partial throttle and if the CO had been set with this
false air in the system then blocking off the pipe to the EGR valve would
affect things.

Question:  You did block off the hole in your exhaust system - the one at
the crossover pipe that the EGR filter attached to - right?

I guess I'd feel more secure if the block-off plate sat under the EGR valve
itself.

Seems like it's time for a comprehensive tune-up, with a CO adjustment
coming after everything else is set.
