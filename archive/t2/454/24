Subject: Acc pedal probs

In my futile attempt to get an accelerator pedal that won't stick, I think
I've found a new wrench in the works. My acc. pedal hinge (
http://www.busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211721613 ) seems to
be lifting off of the floor a bit. Not down where its welded, but where the
curl is that holds the pin. This results in my pedal being turned too far to
the right, thus throwing off all the linkage under the bus. Sounds good, eh
:)

So I'm thinking that it just needs another little spot weld to hold it in
place, but here's the problem, the welder is in my Dad's garage 20 miles away.
Does any one have any ideas as to how I can solve this problem.
