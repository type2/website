Subject: RE: latex gloves

I bought a box of nitrite (large size) gloves from Harbor Frieght.

They are just adequate.  The purple loves I 'borrowed' from my doctor are 
MUCH stronger, and not noticably thicker.

I use CORN STARCH on my hands before I slip into the gloves.


The gloves ARE reuseable, if you pull them off inside out, and no rips.  Of 
course, to get all the finger to pop out, you have to blow into the gloves.  
This adds exhaust vapor (breath sweat) into the gloves, and it will be near 
impossible to get them on when even slightly moist.  That is, impossible 
without the corn starch.


I asked my wife for some corn starch from her cupboard, and she gave it to 
me in a small bowl..  I was getting a pinch of corn starch, and trying to 
slap my habds together to get my hands covered.

A better idea...  I filled the toe of an old sock with the corn starck, tied 
it off, and now I just slap the old sock in my hands and I get a perfect, 
even covering of corn starch.

The second-time-around nitrite gloves go on easily, and my hands enjoy it 
too.  This should work with latex gloves, too.
