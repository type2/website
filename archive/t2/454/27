The metal that holds the pin may be fine, but the "curls" on both that 
part and you accelerator pedal are deformed from 30+ years of useage.

You *can* bend them back.  Take the pin out and the pedal off and look
both of them over carefully.  Does the pin flop around int the curls of 
both pieces?...use pliers and *carefully* reshape and bend them so that 
they are straight and tight like they used to be.

Re-install and then move/bend the whole pedal to one side or 
another(gently!) so that the rod goes thru the hole in the floor smoothly 
without touching the sides.

Be creative...can you make a better one than the vw engineers did?
In my experience, this is one of those things that we can do a little 
better on in our bus than the original...

Cheers,dave
