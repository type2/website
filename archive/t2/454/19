Subject: Will this stuff fit??

I am currently looking into westfakiaing my bus, and I found a very cheap interior of a camper.  But there's a little problem.  The stuff is 68-72 camper stuff.  My bus is a 74 kombi.  Does anyone know if this stuff will fit?  If so, I'm set.  If not, I'll have to keep looking.
