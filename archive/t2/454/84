I have a Crane XR700 and a Pertronix.   

The sensor on the Crane is inferior to the Pertronix, in my opinion.  

The Crane is an optical pickup and uses several complicated brackets to mount it into the distributor.  I can see that this will be the likely failure of this unit.  I can see that something will loosen up or something.  One must also be careful to adjust for rotor phasing, since it is a general application, and not a VW specific application, as I suspect the Pertronix is.  It may be that Crane makes a VW specific sensor, I plan to find out.

The Pertronix is a magnetic (Hall effect) sensor that appears to be made specifically for the VW distributor and fits perfectly.  

The XR700 and other Crane units have a separate electronics box from the sensor, where the Pertronix is only the single unit.  One assumes that the electronics unit of the Crane appears to be superior to the Pertronix.   The Pertronix is only a sensor.  I suspect that the Crane can handle a much hotter coil, but the performance of the petronics is flawless so far.  

The Pertronix installation is much simpler than the Crane-something like 30 minutes.  The Crane XR700, like the Pertronix, does not have active dwell control.  However,  my measurements show that the dwell does not change much, at least in my backyard, at RPM's upto 4500.

I have wondered if I can use my Pertronix sensor with the Crane switch.
