>  I think that the downside of this method of adjustment (practically speaking) is
 simply that one has no exact way of being precise in determining how much of a
 negative load to put on the needle. The only way is to guess and check which can
 run into a lot of pull, reset, install, and checks. But it did work for me - and I'm delighted!

The factory preload on the spring is the white mark at the bottom of the face. All VDO speedo's have this
white line. This is where the needle is set to and then you gently lift it over the pin. Being as it is
accurate now, you might want to lift it back over the pin and see where it points to.
The line is about 1" to the right of the pin and about 1/4" to the left of the bottom VDO.
