Subject: Driving (was tailgating)

My bus is my daily driver now, and I couldn't be happier (except for the 
additional time I need to spend on routine maintentnace, which in 
retrospect, is a part of the bus zen - a plus).

Anyhoo, driving a bus is cool.  Face it.

It appears (among the majority of traffic on the road) that the point is to 
keep up with the prevailng flow, no matter that it is above the posted 
speed limit - just maintanin your distance (no matter how short it is) 
behind the car (or bus) in front of you.  This is referred to as bovine 
behavior, or herd mentality.  Are the rest of the lemmings rushing for the 
edge of the cliff?  Then I must do that too!

I will drive a little above the posted speed (I think, my speedo is a 
little off) and largely ignore those that feel they must hurry to get 
wherever it is they think they're going.  Sometimes it is a source of 
amusement.  I mean, what's their hurry anyway?

The very act of hurrying is a source of stress.  Stress results in muscle 
tension (and increased sympathetic nervous system tone), which leads to a 
host of ills, not the least of which is muscular aches and pains (think of 
headache).

So my bus helps me take a more laid back approach to my daily drive (among 
other things), I feel better about myself and life in general, and I'm 
among friends (other bus pilots and the Type 2 list community).  I may be 
going to hell in a bucket...
