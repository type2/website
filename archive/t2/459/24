Subject: ADMIN:  List/website downtime (prepare for a move!)

Listees,

On October 9th, the VintageBus and Type2 mailing lists, as well
as the type2.com and vintagebus.com web sites, will be down for 2
to 3 days while the computer that hosts them is moved to a new
location.

You do not need to do anything.  All of the mailing lists will still work
and send mail to all current subscribers once the server is turned on in
the new location.  You just won't receive any mail from the lists, or be
able to send any mail to the lists, for a few days.  The www.type2.com and
www.vintagebus.com websites will also be affected.

Please contact me offlist at keen(-at-)type2.com if you have any additional
questions.

Our ISP, Atlasta Networks, is moving to a better hosting facility. They're
moving from the AT&T facility in Seattle to the CCC carrier-neutral
facility in San Diego.

For various reasons that I don't disagree with, we only have a short
notice.  The AT&T facility will be disconnecting us on October 10th, if
we're still there.

On October 9th, the server will be securely packaged and shipped to
San Diego via private courier, along with other hardware from Atlasta.

Once the box arrives in San Diego I hope to make some upgrades to the
software, which will result in some additional downtime.

Our new IP address, when we arrive, will be:

38.112.134.126

DNS records will of course be updated as needed.

Again, contact me offlist at keen(-at-)type2.com if you have any additional
questions.
