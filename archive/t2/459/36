Subject: 79 Rattle Clips - Haiku

Hi Folks,

Now that I have new wheel bearings on all 4 wheels, my ride is quiet enough 
to hear the front brake pads rattling on bumpy roads and sometimes even on 
smooth pavement.  After pulling the wheel apart and consulting Bentley 
several times, I discovered that I seem to be missing the "Rattle Clips" on 
both calipers.  Lack of clips does not seem to affect braking (after 35k 
miles of testing), but it sure makes bumpy roads that much more annoying.

So, does anybody know a good source for these items?  Can they be found at 
my FLAPS as a generic item, or are they VW-specific?  If a VW part, are they 
available from one of the many mail-order places out there?  Or can they 
only be found in the dreaded land of N.L.A. (with apologies to anyone living 
near Glendale or Burbank)?

To put it another way:

Consult List for help

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
