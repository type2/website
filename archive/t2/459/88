Subject: Re: [T2] Oil breather questions

The normal products of combustion are carbon dioxide and water.  The
normal exit for these products is the exhaust system.  That is on a
perfect engine.  On your engine and on any aging engine substantial
amounts of combustion gas exit the cylinder thru the rings and valve
guides into the crankcase where the water condenses out and gets beaten
into the oil and forms the "Castrol aioli" that you refer to.  The
techical name for this is "blow by" and it is not good. If you have
a thermostat installed or if your air temperatures are high the normal
running of the engine will riase the oil temperature above 100C and the
water will be boiled off and that will eliminate the aioli but it will not
eliminate the underlying wear.  For that you will need to replace the
pistons and cylinders and the heads.

In one sense this is normal but just because it is normal does not mean
that it is good.  You should put a leak-down test on your todo list with
the expectation that your engine will not fare well.  I believe that you
are correct that your leaking oil cooler gaskets and oil-soaked hose are
related.  As the blow-by gets worse sealing the breather only increses
pressure inside the case and forces oil past seals.  These include the oil
cooler seals, the front and rear main seals, and the pushrod tube seals.

                             OOK!
