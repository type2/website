You want to talk about a good feeling when your
driving your bus??

The other day I'm coming home and driving down my
street, when I see my pregnant wife and my little
daughter (17months), and my little girl starts jumping
up and down, laughing, pointing as I pull in the
drive.

Boy what a feeling it was, my little girl absolutely
LOVES my bus, she has helped me even sand on it when i
was in paint mode. I have been driving my bus now for
the past couple weeks, and I just love the feeling I
get when i drive it.. My notchback may handle a whole
lot better, and even get better mileage, but nothing
is like driving the BUSTER>>

peace,
