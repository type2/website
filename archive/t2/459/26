So your filter is no longer between the pump and the carb, right?
Best place for the filter is right were it exits the fuel tank under the
bus.

People who have those little inline filters mounted between the pump and
the carb need to know that location is the wrong place and increases
their risk of fire.

. Well, duh, my filter went from between the pump and my carbs, and it
had a bit of crap in it. Well I figured all that crap went through my
pump and trashed it. So a half hour later, I had a new pump on, put my
filter in the right place and I was back home.
