I got peddle before noon today!!!!  Whhooooooo Hoooooooo!!!!!

Major shakedown drive proves everything out.  No hot wheels, no weird
noises, and no tugs in various directions.  This is so cool.

Gonna change the oil today, and try to find out what's happening with the
fuel guage.  I was out getting a tire to have as a spare and someone
almost backed into me.  That was the one time the horn didn't work.  It
started working again promptly after that.  Hmmmmmm...

Thanks so much!

Jennifer
