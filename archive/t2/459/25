 You got to love the smiles of people around you as they pass... old, young,
everyone..smiling, pointing, thumbs up..
.

Of course, when you're at the head of a 200 vehicle train going up a hill on
a 2 lane road, those smiles and waves aren't quite as friendly...and it
isn't always a thumb you see up...  :-P
