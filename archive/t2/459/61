Subject: Oct. Bus dates?

Hey all, after a few months off the List, (due to the care and upkeep of a 
new baby girl), I'm ready to get back in the swing of things again. Can anyone 
tell me the dates and location of this years October Bus? Missed High Country 
as momma was about ready to pop, and wasn't about to let me go anywhere outside 
of the driveway, but I've got the thumbs up to hit Oct. Bus if its still on.
Thanks, and nice to be back,
Robb
