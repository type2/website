&*(*&%$&^!~!!!!!

<grin>

No good news at all huh? <grin>

I've got to do this shifter bushing as there is NO bushing in front and 
both boots are torn and the rear bushings are suspect - though I suspect 
not suspect  enough to remove the engine and tranny...

Time to get out the catalog tonight. Looks like I'll try the front bushing 
and inspect everything else a bit closer.

Dunno if I'm ready to have two disabled busses on the property. Neighbors 
are bound to talk... <grin>

Believe it or not this bus in need of bushings is a '78 bus with 83K miles 
on it and as far as I can tell has never had the engine or tranny out.

Problem is that the way i do things if the the engine comes out then I 
start replacing everything that is marginal and that means clutch, paint, 
rubber, etc. etc. etc. Maybe I can break my ways and just do the least I 
have to.
