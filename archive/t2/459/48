Oh man!!! I may just saw the bus in half and do it that way... <grin>

I've got access to the lift. May do it, may just tell my friend no way. 
Don't like pulling engines this week...

Besides the neighbors are going to be talking! I've already got my bus in 
the air to receive the Corvair. What will they say with two busses in the 
air???

(alot less than what they'd with 1 bus sawn in half...)

Thanks Paul!
