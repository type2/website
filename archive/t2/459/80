Subject: fuel pump pressure

Regarding fuel pressure with a restricted filter, I
think the fuel pressure is determined by the strength
of the fuel pump spring. A restriction between the
pump and the carburetor will not raise the fuel
pressure. The mechanical fuel pump has self-regulated
pressure.

consider what 
will 
happen when the filter becomes clogged.  Pressure
will build between the pump and the filter<
