No.

Just go to the smog referee like everyone else coming from out of state with
a federal model, get smogged, pass and drive it. I'd get an emission test
done in your current state first to determine if it's worth bringing in your
vehicle: it may need expensive modifications to be brought into line with CA
code depending on what the PO did to it before you bought it.

Email me for details if you are considering doing this in future.
