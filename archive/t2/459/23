Just the other day on my way to work I got a nice treat in my bus. On
the trip to work there is a stop light that backs up horribly and can
be bypassed by cutting through an upper demographic neighborhood. You
know the ones, 2 acre lots w/ Ford windstars and whatever SUV is
popular at the time gracing the driveways.... Well I come to a stop
sign and look over. Business suit man was putting his kid in the
minivan. The little boy was about 2.5-3. He saw my bus and got real
excited waving and pointing and laughing. Natually I waved back and he
got even more excited. Suit man also smiled and waved. It's funny, the
simple act of driving my bus to work that day brought a smile to at
least 2 people first thing in the morning, well 3 people including me
:)
