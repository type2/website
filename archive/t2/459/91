Check your timing.  A VW engine is designed to run on 87 octane regular gas.

Could be that they installed the wrong t/o bearing.  A new bearing will 
not make noise and it will not quiet down with use.  There is no way to 
grease it.  Take it back and insist that it be repaired properly.  If 
it's making noise, something's wrong.
