Hiya Rusty,

I read your comments on adjusting the speedo.  Just wanted to say that my 
speedo is living proof for your theory.  The procedure you outlined is almost 
exactly what I did with my speedometer when I got the Bus about three years ago.  
I had to go the other way (counterclockwise) with my adjustment.  Adjusting 
the needle with a "negative load" (I had to actually "hop over" the needle stop 
to effect that negative adjust) really did the trick for me.  The speedo has 
been "dead on" at all speeds since.
But, I am going to be the very first person to admit that I was big time 
lucky in doing this adjustment.  I hit it dead on with my very first try.  I think 
that the downside of this method of adjustment (practically speaking) is 
simply that one has no exact way of being precise in determining how much of a 
negative load to put on the needle. The only way is to guess and check which can 
run into a lot of pull, reset, install, and checks.
But it did work for me - and I'm delighted!
