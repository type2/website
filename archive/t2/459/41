Subject: 1978 Shift Rod R&Rquestion

I'm trying to gather the materials for the shift rod bushing replacement on 
a friend's bus. I've checked ETKA for the diagram and then the Type2 
library but I'm still a bit unclear on the assembly.

#1 There are three bushings? One in the front, 1 in the middle, 1 at the 
rear? 2 dust boots?

#2 How do I get the shifter rods out? Out the front or... <gulp> out the 
rear (meaning I've got to pull the engine and tranny????) Say it isn't so!!!!

Thanks for any guidance.
