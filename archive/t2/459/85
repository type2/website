Welcome to Minnesota!

This may not seem like a big deal to you or others who aren't from the rusty
north, but you won't see many "old' cars in MN that aren't rusted to
nothing.  Even if you can keep the body clean up here, everything on the
underside gets rusted into one big mess.

If I were you, I would get the bus shipped here or store in CA until you can
have it shipped.  Once you get it here, store it in the winter.  It won't
last long with all of the salt they use on the roads.  You won't believe how
many people will just come up and admire your bus because it isn't rusty!
Trust me, you won't see many nice bays up here.  Don't get me wrong they're
here, but most of them have succumbed to the inevitable.

I've got a '79 Westy that lived in Florida before I got it 4 years ago, and
although it isn't perfect (nose pushed in alittle), it doesn't have any
rust.  It's a real treat to drive a '79 vehicle around here and have people
admire it for it's lack of rust alone.

My brother worked for a company that transported classic cars around the
country and I was amazed how inexpensive it was.  If you can be flexible in
timeframe you should be able to find a good deal.  I know when you're in the
middle of a cross-country move, it's a lot to take care of, but you'll be
glad you did.  Minnesota is a great place to have a Westy.  The state has
some beautiful places to camp and visit.  The state park system is
excellent.

Good luck!
