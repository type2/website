Do you mean the screw that attaches the disc to the
wheel? So is partnr 14 on the picture below?

If so then the actual partnr is:

  N 014 779 1 "SCREW, CHEESE HD. M 8x20"

The number doesn't start with the usual '211' because
it is a multi purpose part (so it starts with an 'N').
Quite a regular thing which you might also be able to
get at your local hardware store. But then I don't
know if there are any differences in metalstrength.
The description above is the only thing that is
mentioned on the microfiche.
