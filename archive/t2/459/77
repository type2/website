The VW fuel pump is designed to pull, not push.  It will not like pushing 
through the restricted flow of a filter after the pump.
Notice that the stock filter locations are at the fuel outlet in the fuel 
tank, and a small filter in the pump on the inlet side--
of course, this only applies to the quality, old (or old style) pumps, like 
the 40 horse pump.  The crappy disposable pumps
have none--or perhaps they do, but since you can't open them up, you must 
throw the pump away when the filter gets clogged.

As far as putting one between the pump and the carb., consider what will 
happen when the filter becomes clogged.  Pressure
will build between the pump and the filter, and if the fuel line is not in 
excellent condition, and the clamps well tightened,
and the filter casing perfectly strong, then something is gonna' 
burst--spewing gasoline all over the place.  Hope you've got
your marshmallow sticks ready.  If the filter clogs on the intake of the 
pump, you just don't get sufficient fuel flow, and will
investigate the situation.
