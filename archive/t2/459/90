Subject: 68 Baywindow Out Preforms All Expectations

Yesterday, with more than just a little trepidation, we loaded up and took
a 150 =/- journey.  Five people, two coolers, lawnchairs, two toolboxes,
Jackstand, and other related survival gear.  We hit the freeway and she
drove a steady 55 to 60, depending upon the grade.  It's noisey as hell
(road noise) but I'm still working on that.

She pinged a little on some hills, at this point she is running on low
octane, I think I'll bump it up a notch to a better grade.

No failures to report.  She preformed flawlessly and brought us all home
safe and sound.

Question:  When the engine was reinstalled a new throw out bearing was
installed.  It makes an ungodly racket with the clutch pushed in.  Was
told it will "go away" but it's making me insane.  Should I press to have
the engine removed and the thing greased up?

Thanks,
Jennifer
