Subject: Re: [T2] brake disc screw

It's probably a special proprietary bolt for VW's. It would certainly be
very high grade etc. Why not call Charles at Busted VW in Boulder? I'm sure
he'd have one and he's reasonable. Tom

Richard let me know that this screw is M8 & 20mm long (thanks Richard).
Now, does anyone happen to have the part number for these things or happen
to know where I can get a few?

thanks,
