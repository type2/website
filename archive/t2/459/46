it ain't so.

but i just said that 'cause you wanted me to.

 the front one is cake to get out. you have to pull the engine and
transmission out to remove the rear shift rod.

2 or 3 bushings depends on the year of the bus. busboys website has the
details on the cutoff, i think, but i am almost certain 78 has 3 total.

the replacement rear bushings are pathetic quality, impossible to install
without doing quite a bit of work to them. they are very poorly molded and
don't fit on the rod. the front bushing i would buy from the dealer, the
rubber quality is completely different between the dealer ones and the
aftermarket.
