Hey there,
I've got a 75' westy that I'm putting a corvair motor in so that I can tow a
trailer with my motorcycles. Anyhow, I'm selling the motor and the tranny
that is in the bus now to offset the cost. THe motor is a 1800cc fuel
injected pancake. Bus has about 90,000 miles, but I guessing that the top
end was done recently because I did a compression test when I got the bus
two months ago and all the cylinders had 125 lbs of compression. I just took
her on a trip accross the country and did not have a single problem. The
tranny is a 6 rib from a post 76 bus. It grinds a little into and out of 3rd
gear, but not if you double clutch it. Anyhow...Fuel injection and
everything goes with the motor and tranny since I'm switching to the
corvair. 

The motor will be in the bus until the weekend of the 4th of Oct. when I'll
be dropping it to put in the corvair. So you can come by and take her for a
spin if you like.

Thanks,
Matthew
