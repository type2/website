 From the speed and air temps you state, my guess is also that you 
overheated and are now lacking compression in one or more cylinders.

One thing about the Grapevine - approaching it from the North the road 
starts to gradually incline a LONG way before you get to the base of the 
visible hill.  Your friend's right foot was probably going slowly downward 
to maintain 70mph as the grade increased.  The couple of times I've driven 
that route, I was already in 3rd before I reached the base of the visible 
hill.  A vacuum gauge in your dash is great for detecting subtle changes in 
incline and the resultant subtle changes in throttle position.  Other 
gauges (like oil temp) might also have been useful.  Good luck - I hope 
your engine was not badly damaged.
