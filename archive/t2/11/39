Subject: Vanagon for sale!

I have Decided to sell my 81 air-cooled Vanagon It is tan over caramel in
color. (were they all?) It has a new motor with less than 3000 miles and an
automatic. It has the 7 passenger interior in brown All lights Ect. work and
it is equipped with H-4 headlights. It has good tires on it and is a daily
driven van. I would consider any VW trades although I am trying to thin out
my fleet! Did I mention that I bought this off the original owner and it
only shows 87,000 miles? Oh yea it has A/C although its getting kind of
weak. The price is $1600 obo
    I have to get my sliding door splitty painted!! (Bus Content)
God bless
