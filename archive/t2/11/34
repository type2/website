How about this:

http://www.smarthome.com/9209.html

Says it draws less than 4 amps.  My guess is that it would heat about as 
well as the 110v blankets on the 80 watt setting.

And a clip from a Miata mailing list:

"My wife and I stopped at a central Illinois truckstop for lunch yesterday. 
They sell a 12v electric blanket that has a cigarette lighter plug on it. 
All ready to go for in-car operation!!"

I bet most large truck stops (i.e. Pilot, Petro) would have one too.
