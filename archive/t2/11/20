Subject: Re: [T2] Electric heat... possible??

Hi,
   The short answer is no.

 To get any useful heat you need a fair bit of power. Kilowatts rather than Watts
and your stock alternator only puts out 35*14=~500w (ie half a Kilowatt) of power.

 The engine itself puts out about 50KW- The battery stores maybe 50 Amp-hours
which is 50*12*3600/1000= 2200 KJ- enough for a 1KW heater to run for a couple
of hours. Run an ancillary alternator and you are still going to be struggling
to generate more than a KW or two, even while the engine is running (and
that assumes you can cope with the power loss from the engine, the drivebelts,
the cabling to carry the current etc). IMHO it would be technically feasible
to provide electric heating from a running engine but the effort would be 
better spent making more efficient use of the waste heat from the exhaust
system.

 Battery technology just isn't up to storing enough energy to provide useful
heat- if it was we'd be driving electric busses.

Cheers,
       W.
