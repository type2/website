It's shaped differently than the Bosch starters, but seems to work fine.  It makes a neat kind of whirring, gear-like noise when it turns.  Has anyone used one of these before, and would like to comment on longevity?

I work in the transit industry and those buses (big ones) all have air
starters. which make a very high pitched whirring sound when operating, I
have often thought I would like an air starter.

of course then I need an air pump and storage tank and regulators etc etc 

oh well
