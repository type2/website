Subject: advice sought, re: headliner, floor mat, front seat pedestal covers for '70 bus


I've now recovered the driver and front passenger seats on my 1970 
[walk-through] bus, using the covers and foam padding from TMI.  They look 
good and are very comfortable.

Unfortunately--and a lot of you are probably already way ahead of me 
here--now they make the rest of the interior look a little crappy. It's like 
when you pick something up off a shelf, then put it down in a slightly 
different position.  You notice the dust, wipe it away with your fingertips, 
realize that the dust on the rest of the shelf now shows, wipe that away 
with a cloth . . . and suddenly it's three weeks later and you're shampooing 
your carpets, wondering how things could have escalated to this point!

So here are my questions:

1. My original headliner, otherwise in good condition, abruptly sprang a 
6-inch tear near one of the rear corners several months ago. I really don't 
want to replace the entire headliner, but I also don't want to make a 
"repair" that will leaving it looking worse than the original tear or will 
increase the damage in the process.  If I leave it alone, is the tear likely 
to spread?  Is there a way to mend the tear that's fairly simple and 
non-invasive?  I don't have to have my bus excruciatingly stock, but I'd 
like it to look nice.

2. The rubber floor mat in the front [not the cargo bay] is pretty badly 
worn and torn. My catalog research says that the floor mats for the 68-72 
buses are no longer available. Is that right, or have I missed a source 
somewhere?

3. The molded 2-part covers for the pedestals the front seats sit on look 
especially ratty. Big chunks are missing, other parts are cracked or frayed, 
stray bits of horsehair from the old seats and other accumulated gunk have 
bonded to them at the molecular level over the years.  I've seen some buses 
with these covers removed, and the pedestals sanded and repainted--either to 
match the upholstery [black] or the body paint [sky blue]. I've also priced 
new covers.  Any thoughts about the aesthetics and materials science of 
going one way versus another? Are the replacement covers durable and 
well-fitting?

Thanks for any suggestions and information.

best
