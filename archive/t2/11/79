Subject: Re: [T2] homemade instrument cluster


I just wanted to re-state something someone said earlier this year about 
the instrument cluster.  The hole it fits in is the same size as the 
glove box.  Therefore, a custom instrument panel could be made out of an 
extra glove box lid with gages set in it....

something to think about. ....
