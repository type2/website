I'd recommend not going there anymore. Does this guy do a lot of commercial
diesel rebuilds? Perhaps he thinks "torquing heads" means "tighten the head
nuts to 350 lb-ft like you do on a Detroit Diesel 6V71" but to us VW types
it means something else entirely.

Don't torque the heads on a VW. Uhh...yeah.
