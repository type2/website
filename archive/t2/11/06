Subject: What is it!


I'm a Newbie and heres a newbie question. I was investigating an oil leak in
my 76 loaf. (2.0 liter fi) I took off the right lower pan, and there was
this ...thing, that looks like a spring on a little cable, that goes to a
pully. (the cable is broken) so i don't know where it goes. When i pull on
the cable, the spring goes Click,click.  the only ref book that i have at
the moment is Muir's. and i didn't see anything about it. What is it!
Heres another question while i'm here. What does it mean when your oil as a
gas smell?
