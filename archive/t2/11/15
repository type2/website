Subject: Oil pressure sender, 914 oil temp sender plate and vacuum port

Volks,

I was talking with Mike Noble about a Vanagon he is thinking of buiying
and I promised him some pictures.  I thought there might be general
interest, so I put them up as inaguration on my new Unix box, which I got
up and running 99% by myself! The pictures are:

The Porsche 914 temp sender plate that David Schwarze gave me when I
passed theru Dallas this June.

My oil pressure sender.  It is the dual light/gauge sender. I careved a
bit on the tin with a die grinder and it dropped right in.  I am just a
bit proud of this.  No extension tube, no altered threads, just dropped
right in.  If you own a Dremel or equivalent, this takes a whole 5
minutes!

The correct location to plug in a vacuum gauge on an FI engine.

And the URL is:

Let me know what you think!  (other than on the incredibly basic, done at
midnight html :-)
