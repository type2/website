Subject: RE: [T2] Westy Window pattern

This sounds like an excellent idea. I was just going to take some
measurements and make a curtain, but if we had a pattern online I could make
something a lot closer to original. 

Has anybody bought one of the aftermarket curtains I see for sale, if so how
well do they fit and compare to the original?

every once and a while. If anyone can keep their pattern I will offer my
time to draft them up in CAD if they get me a pattern.
