Subject: VW Camper & Commercial Magazine now in Stock!

As promised, I now have the current Issue # 3 of Volkswagen Camper &
Commercial Magazine in stock. To recap, this is a British magazine devoted
exclusively to VW Campers. It has until now been available only via overseas
mail directly from the publisher.  Details at
http://www.volkswagencamper.co.uk/ .

The price is $5.95 for an issue. (By comparison, it's about $8 if you order
it from the publisher, and you have to wait 3-4 weeks for delivery from
England.)

If you add the magazine it to an order that you're already placing, it will
add very little or no shipping cost since it is small and inexpensive, so
$5.95 is about all it costs you. However, if you order it by itself, our
minimum shipping charge will apply, which is about $4.50. So it's much more
economical to add it to an order, even if that just means throwing in a few
tune up parts or whatever to get the most out of your shipping charge.

Part number is CAMPERMAG .  It's on the website or you can order toll-free.
