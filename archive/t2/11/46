Subject: rear axle fell off (!)


hi all
I was driving home today, went to turn out of an intersections and BOOM!
then bang bang bang as I started to move.... I first thought the clutch
went..... but i was still moving when I engaged the clutch..
Luckily I was only about 2 miles from home.
Got a tow home and got under there.....

The Right Rear axle was completely free of the rear wheel, bolts and all.
The bolts all looked ok... as if it had just been removed from the
wheel......as did the threads they go into..
 
The boom was the joint breaking(for lack of a better word) free and the
banging was the free axle whacking the torsion arm (as well as everything
in reach i would imagine)


HOW THE HELL CAN THIS HAPPEN?!!

could the CV joint be busted and cause this?
or were the bolts just not tourqued to spec...
(or heck, never tightened at all?)

I've never touched them so I am cluless
but I don't think this should result as a sign of wear on the CV's
axles, or transmission.

I am gonna drop the engine and tranny this week to replace my tranny, I
got a hold of a good one. Im gonna fix this when i do that


what should i be looking out for?
should I replace the CV joint over there... it didn't look too bad.... now
that I have a *real* good look at it....

I am still in shock......
