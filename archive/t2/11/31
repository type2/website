Subject: Electric Heat?

The electric blanket thing just doesn't sound real toasty----
And it also sounds expensive--- power inverter's, the blanket's
themselves, and the possibility of a smoked alternator.

Last winter when the front heater motor fried in My 85 GL, I purchased a
"Portable Buddy Heater", at Ace is the place which uses disposable
propane cylinder's.
I also use it in my Westy, and I have a hook-up to the propane tank l
aready have in the bus.

Works out real nice, plenty of heat, simple, and portable.

Cost?

$99.00 ---a cheap, not complicated, heat solution.

Later,
