Subject: starter problems...... resolved..(finally)

After 6 starters from a local FLAPS, all only lasting between one and 12
starts,
my 78 Westy (fiasco) is now equiped with a new bosch starter and no more
problems.
Thanks to all that offered advise.  This is a really great list.... and has
helped us alot...
Thanks
