Hello everyone,

Just a reminder that less than two weeks away, we'll be hosting another o=
f
the Busses Nowhere Near The Arch / Busses By The Arch" events over the
upcoming Labor Day weekend.  Several people have e-mailed us to see if th=
e
event is on schedule.  This is understandable, as for the first time we
decided not to send out a postal flyer and transfer the info to the
internet.  Yes, we finally decided to modernize and establish a web site
(thanks again to "No Quarter") for the event to pass along the event info=
. =

I've added below a standard e-mail form letter about the event too.  I
suspect that because we didn't send out a mailing, that a few folks might=

think it isn't happening.  The number of Busses in attendance might drop =
a
little bit, but that makes it a little bit more roomy for all of us, and
certainly a little bit easier to run for us.  A portion of the proceeds
this year will be passed on to both NEATO and the American Red Cross
organization for the great relief work that they do.  Anyway, we hopefull=
y
look forward to seeing your smiling faces and Type 2's in a little over a=

week from now!  We'll catch up on the last year's activities while loungi=
ng
in our easy chairs around a campfire in the campground!

Form e-mail/letter follows:

Thanks for your inquiry.  Yes, BNNTA#17 is definitely on as usual.  This
Bus extravaganza is held over the long Labor Day weekend which for this
year is Friday thru Monday, Aug 31st, Sept 1-3, 2001.  The location is at=

the "group" campground within the Indian Creek Recreational Area located =
on
the north side of Mark Twain Lake, which is about 30 miles to the west of=

the city of Hannibal, Missouri.  We expect between 120-150 Type 2's of al=
l
styles and eras for the long holiday weekend.  The event AND camping fee
for each VW vehicle for the entire weekend is a grand total of $25 and as=

in the past, "ONLY VW's" will be allowed to enter and camp. =


We'd love to have you join us for the Type 2 festivities.  You'll meet a
lot of people and enjoy seeing a whole lot of VW's camping out!  If you'd=

These linked web sites show the 2001event info.  The event format and eve=
nt
schedule doesn't change much from year to year, we figure why mess with a=

great thing?  There is a "Mapquest" map link there also to aid you in
finding all of us!

We look forward to seeing you amid all the VW's!  So make plans, pack up
your Bus, and get on over here for all the fun!
