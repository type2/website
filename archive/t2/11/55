In my 69 Transporter, the pull switch you describe opens up the little vent on the floor between the
front seats, sends air/heat to the rear passengers...Maybe you can pull out your drivers seat, look
down through those holes in the pedestal, see if that's what's going on in the Westy...

I recently purchased a 1970 Westy.  While I was cleaning out the front of the bus I noticed a pull
switch of somekind built into the drivers seat pedistal.  Can anyone give a hint as to
what this might be?  It looks almost like a manual choke cable, but I have pretty much disproved
that idea since this bus has an electric choke.
