Subject: Pull Knob Under the Front Seat

OK Folks.  Here's one for ya, and I know someone out there will have an 
answer.  In my bus (1973 VW Camper Bus - Sufari) 1800cc Motor, there is a 
black knob, similar to a choke knob that you would find on an old car.  You 
can pull up on it, and it will pull on a cable.  I followed the tube that 
this cable runs in and it ends somewhere in or near the gas tank area.  What 
is this knob used for, and how does it work?  Was it an old choke connection 
to my carborator at one time, or does this serve a different purpose?
