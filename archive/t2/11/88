Subject: Choke for Carborator

While I'm at it this morning, I have another question for the list.

Is it possible to hook up a manual choke to the carborator in a bus, so that 
I can have better control on the butterfly valve in the carborator?   It 
seems every time the temperature changes, the settings that I carefully 
adjusted on the carborator are no longer effective, and the vehicle doesn't 
run smoothly again until it reaches the approimate outdoor temperature that 
was prevelent when I adjusted the choke.  (and yes, in case you are 
wondering, I do have a Weber Conversion Dual Barrel Carb in place of the 
Stock Dual Carbs that used to be on there)  My questions are:

1.  Is there anyone on the list that has tried this, and has this been 
effective for you?

2.  Are there carborator choke kits available for a VW Bus, and is the cable 
long enough so that the knob can be mounted on the front dash?

Any suggestions, comments or ideas are welcome.

Thanks All!
