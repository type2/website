Gail and list:

I just installed my new engine this past weekend, and I put in a new high-torque gear-reduction starter that you see advertised in the VW magazines.  It's shaped differently than the Bosch starters, but seems to work fine.  It makes a neat kind of whirring, gear-like noise when it turns.  Has anyone used one of these before, and would like to comment on longevity?
