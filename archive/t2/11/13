Subject: canvas install-er-ing- help? bay area? bus depot

Hello,

Well I to ordered a replacement canvas from Bus Depot, except I ordered a
Yellow one and got GOLD instead. I didn't even see that as an option. I
don't care, I just want to replace it. The place that I was going to have do
it scares me a little too much to put faith in now, they are cheap, and say
they have done them before, but I have this gut feeling I better try and
stick with a bus expert on this one.

And with that note, this is my cry for help. I am going to try and attack
this project this saturday, I live
in San Francisco, and could use a little help. I'll be the first to admit,
when I need a tool, I have to go buy
it. I am slowly learning my bus, but am not the handyman I would like to be,
and could use the guidance and assistance of a professional. I can pay for
the help, time, beer, etc, if anyone in my area or driving distance has the
tools (I can always go get them) time, or knowledge to help out. Its a 76
westy that im trying to get ready to take to the grand canyon (to, if all
plans go accordingly, become engaged!)- so you can see the importance of my
getting it up and running. The current canvas works, as long as you don't
touch it, or move it in any way. My significant other tried to unzip the
screen on our last trip, and it just tore along the seam instead. (thank
goodness for duct tape!)

Or if you know of a place in my area that does do this kind of work for a
reasonable price, let me know also.

Thanks for taking the time to read this....
