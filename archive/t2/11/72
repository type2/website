Subject: dist. vacuum advance hose attachment

Its a 1974 bus, (EGR system has been removed)

Can anyone help me out with the correct attachment point for the 
distributor's vacuum advance hose?

It's vacuum retard hose?

I see one vacuum tap on the side of each carb and I see a second vacuum tap 
on the base of the left carb.

I also see a vacuum tap at the junction of the metal pipes that connect the 
vacuum of the two carbs together.  

thanks!
