When we use 2 160 electric blankets off the inverter, usually the 80
watt setting is used if at night.  I have a continuous voltmeter on the
dash..  I assume it draws only the wattage of what you are running. 
These blankets are good for prewarming the bed before crawling in.  As
to  the alternator, yes it too has 227+ K miles on it!  Anyone know of
direct 12v electric blankets??  MB
