Subject: digest help, please!

howdy folks!
first off, let me offer a huge group thanks to all of you unknowing kind 
folks who've helped this lurker with my camper...
secondly, i was wondering if someone could direct me on how to switch from 
individual posts to digest form...i belong to a few mailing lists and the 
time has come to get a little more organized...THANKS, yet again!
