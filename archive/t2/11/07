Subject: heads and torque

If one is using 10mm studs and case savers it is ok to torque to 28 ft-lbs.
Checking that they are still at 28 ft-lbs is not that big of a deal after
initial break in. Valves, rings and even cylinders seat. This is not off the
wall. Remember everyone is an expert. I only know what I have done and
believe selective pieces of littereatur.
