Subject: getting off the list

Due to work and time constraints I havn't been keeping up with with list
mail. I wish to "unsubscribe". My e-mails to
type2-digest-unsubscribe(-at-)pon.type2.com keep getting returned as "vwgary" is
not a subscriber. Any advice?  Who is administering the the list so I can
e-mail them directly? At this point I'm considering the mail as spam.

Thx
