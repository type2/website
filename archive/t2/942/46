An interesting technique, that I've not used for brake lines and probably wouldn't for cleanliness issues, but some people might consider for other times was featured in the real original "Flight of the Navigator" movie.  The German model airplane designer is building a still to distill urine or dirty water for drinking and to bend the thin wall copper tubing, he fills it with fine sand (they are crashed in the desert of Australia after all) before he bends it.  I've used the technique for a tight bend of flexible copper water line and it works very nicely.  Like I said, probably not for brake lines, but still good to know.
