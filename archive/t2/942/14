Bending em freehand will work if you are real careful like Hal says, but bending around a broomstick or something like that as a form is a much safer idea for most people if a tubing bender radius is too big.  BTW never hurts to start from new (even Autozone will have the appropriate size lines in several lengths) if you have to rebend anyway.  The line location on '72-'85 (all sort of functionally mechanically the same in mounting) varies between ATE and Girling, and even in Girling I've seen from caliper to caliper (year to year I take it.)  They all pretty much fit (though I'm not totally sure that the '72ish calipers for the thinner discs interchange) but may be plumbed directly into the back of the piston or into the top of the caliper depending on the caliper model.

calipers from BD (not that it matters). I carefully re-bent the lines 
in sort of a "corkscrew" configuration and it's been fine.

Re-bending those suckers by hand was nerve-wracking, but there was no 
way a tubing bender would've been able to get them into the shape 
needed. Not that I *own* a tubing bender in the first place. :-)
