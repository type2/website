Subject: Was runs rich after warmed up now surging and very low idle

List

 

I posted a couple weeks back about an issue I was having wit my 77 bus with
fuel injection running rich. The situation has changed slightly since I've
tried to fix this. Cool thing is that it doest run so rich after it warms up
that it shuts off and wont start until it cools down. It does run now but
still runs rich. Its better than it was but still rich. The other thing it
does now it very very low idle warm or cold. 

 

Last night I replaced the points, gaped them to .016. Also replaced the fuel
pressure regulator, condenser, plugs, and wires. Then I re-timed it to 5
degrees ATDC. What ever it was in that bag of goodies seems to cure the
shutdown issue because I can at least drive it now. I looked for vacuum
leaks both with a manual inspection as well as squirting starting fluid on
the connectors to see if that would effect the Idle. Nothing, no vacuum
leaks as far as I can see either. 

 

When I pulled the plugs they were all VERY black so I think it was the
pressure regulator replacement that got me a little closer to a properly
running bus. 

 

Heres a quick summary of the things I have done.

 

-          Replaced Plugs (gaped .28)

-          Replaced Wires

-          Replaced Points (gaped .016)

-          Statically timed the engine to 5 degrees ATDC

-          Replaced condenser

-          Replaced Coil

-          Replaced the head temperature sensor

-          Replaced Fuel pressure regulator

-          Removed cold start air valve

-          Bypassed cold start injector

-          Checked for vacuum leaks. Replaced the questionable hoses.

-          Put hose claps on whatever hoses I could

-          Fuel injector cleaner in the gas tank.

 

Heres a quick summary of what it still does

 

-          Low lumpy idle.

-          Surging and fading. Most noticeable going down the highway.

-          A little pop from the exhaust between a lot of the shifts.

-          Seems to be running rich still although not as bad as before.

-          Lack of power compared to this summer when it was running
correctly.

 

What Else can I try? I guess the only thing I have left is the MAF or the
ECU. If I cant figure it out soon I'm just going to mothball it until I can
rip out the fuel injection system and replace it with carbs. I know some of
you have brought up that double relay located on the firewall and I'm
willing to try that next. Does anyone know what the price on one of these
is? Anyone have a working used one? If I have to go as far as the MAF or the
ECU would anyone here have these for sale?

 

Thanks

Mike
