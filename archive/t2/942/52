The grinder at 120VAC uses 480W at 4amps.

The Battery pack supplying the 480W at 12VDC is pushing about 40amps
to make the same wattage.  According to the NEC, you need more like a
6 AWG wire to support that load.

Add the loss going through the inverter and you'll also probably be
running out of power in less than 1/2 hour with the 18AH battery.

Bob's battery sawzall idea is much more efficient.
