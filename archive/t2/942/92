I am trying to get my 80 vanagon back together after an engine
re-builder lost many of my accessories.  I think I just about got all
the pieces now except the big S shaped hose that goes from the Air flow
control meter to the throttle valve. Does anybody know of a source for
one of these, or can I use one from a 79 van with some slight
modifications ?
