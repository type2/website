Subject: Looking for parts for a european 69 bus

Hey Everyone,
My mechanic is looking for some parts so I thought I'd see if any of you 
have 'em.  He's looking for a tail-light lens and fusebox for a european 
'69 bus.  He wasn't sure if there's any difference between the Eurpoean 
and domestic models, but thought he'd mention it anyways.

We're in Long Beach, CA, btw.

Thanks!
Mike
