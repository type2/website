In addition to what Don suggests, if you have a cable that's too long and
trim to fit, you can use EMPI's #3170 Throttle Cable Shortening Kit
(actually it is a piece that can be attached to the end of the braided cable
via an allen set screw) - I would recommend additionally soldering (as Don
suggests) to "reinforce" the attachment.

OTOH, if you find that one of the cables you try is like say, an inch too
short to meet the barrel nut/linkage, you can use EMPI's #3171 Throttle
Cable Extending Kit, which just attaches over the solid end of the cable
again via an allen set screw (never needed to use solder on this though).

I have used both of the above, depending on the situation at-hand for the
past 25 years with very good results.  EMPI does have some garbage, but this
product hold-over from their "Mr Bug" days is one of their better products.

After all is said and done and you know which cable is best for your setup,
order a couple more of the same cables as spares (they're cheep, remember?)
to have handy for the worst case scenario.
