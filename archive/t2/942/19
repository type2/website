Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an engine- AVP?

Stay away from AVP. Nice folks, but somewhat shoddy work.
I have about 5,000 on my AVP right now and it sounds like a cam bearing
is loose already, the lifters knock pretty loudly on a daily basis when
gapped properly and it just doesn't feel right.

maybe it'll last 30,000 miles, but id probably be a little surprised if
it did.

CHT temps are a little high even in a colder area, so you really need to
watch when lugging up hills.
