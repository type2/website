I had a similar problem and it turned out to be a tiny hole in the
diaphram in the vacuum timing advance unit.  when it gets hot take a spare
piece of tubing and put it on the vacuum advance unit and suck on it and
see if it holds the vacuum, also make sure the plate inside the
distributor with the points on it moves when you suck on it, it doesn't
move much but it must move....

also you might want to check for loose wire connections they can drive you
nuts and we have all probably had our share.
