Subject: Re: [T2] air intake boot

I haven't tried it yet, but have thought of cleaning my "S" boot very well 
and then either dipping it or painting it with the tool "dip" product
sold at Lowe's and other hardware stores.

You know, the stuff you use to dip tool handles in that gives them
a "plastic" soft grip.

It can be bought in various colors and the instructions say that you can 
actually paint it if you thin it a little.

It is still flexible and should look nice as well.  If have used the stuff 
on some tool handles and it's still there many years later.

Just a thought....I buy a lot of car parts at the Hardware store<grin>.

Cheers, dave

  Clean the whole thing with degreaser then wipe with alcohol. Apply
  just enough silicone to fill the crack(s) and a wee bit more. Let dry
  overnight at least. Then apply a skim coat of the silicone all the way
  around the s-boot. Even where there are no cracks. Make sure it's
  about 1/8" thick. Let dry overnight. Wrap with 3 layers of the
  silicone tape. I'd coat everything with a good rubber protectant (NOT
  Armor-All) to reduce future cracks.

  The skim coat gives a huge sealing surface so if for whatever reason
  the silicone in the crack itself comes loose the skim coat keeps it
sealed. The silicone tape backs THAT up and also provides a good solid
> structure to minimize flex.
