Subject: Re: [T2] diff. in caliper hose inlet placement

The flex hose goes from above down to the mount on the upper ball joint,
and screwed to that is the steel tube compression fitting, with the other
end going to the caliper center (needing two 90 deg bends to do it).
Going to the top of the caliper seems to require less total distance- do
they make a flex hose with one end going right into the caliper and thus
needing NO steel line?

more common than the others, too, and more readily
available..........
