I believe the coil is inside the distributor, as well as the ignition
module. This is classic high mileage Honda problem, and he's lucky he got
that far; IME usually you get this problem at about 225,000 K. Usually it's
the ignition module that goes, and should be replaceable, sometimes it's the
coil. A lot of guys will replace both coil and module at the same time,
because one is usually not far behind the other. If I remember right these
cars use a blink code to show if there's a problem in the computer
system/sensors, the CPU box  (might) be under the dash, on the firewall of
the passenger seat, under the carpet. You put a jumper on the test harness
and watch the blinking led to see if the CPU has found a problem. The number
of blinks tells you where the problem is. Important to check this first
before replacing any parts. Time for a manual.

At best he'll be looking at replacing the coil and module; quite a bit
cheaper than a new dizzy. There are TDC and other sensors in the dizzy that
can screw up the computer, but then a blink code will tell you. These
sensors are not replaceable, you have to get a new dizzy.

Hope that helps.
