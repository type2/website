Actually WCM is in Harbor City (they moved from Torrance in 1992).  They'd
be a bit closer to travel to than WWest.

Both WWest and WCM are USA made quality EPDM repros ($25.70 for WCM, $29 for
WWest).  I've used both and the OE as well with no problems.

I have some OE VW Mexico seals for $24 each.
