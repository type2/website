Subject: RE:Looking for an engine- AVP?

I got a 1600 for our 71 from Bob Donalds of Boston Engine fame.  The engine
is nothing but reliable and Bob was/is good to deal with.  I'd suggest you
check out his web site and then talk to him at least once.  We drove to his
shop to pick up our engine but he told us that he ships them too.
