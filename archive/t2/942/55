Subject: Rare part find!

I just located a source for Double Cab 3rd door seals. They are made in the
Netherlands by Paruzzi.

 

I ordered three if anyone needs one.

 

www.paruzzi.com <http://www.paruzzi.com/>  Make sure you select the UK
English site.

 

I will report on the quality etc when they arrive.
