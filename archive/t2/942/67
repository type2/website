Subject: "Almost" Friday  "post open"

Not to jump the gun, and on a topic which is dear to us all, but if a can of
food has a "blister", on the top or bottom, isn't that a sign of Botulism of
the contents?  And if so, then how can a can of beer have the same "fault",
and still taste like beer?  Like, what caused the "dimple", on the bottom of
the can, when it had not been opened, and was in a "gov't beer store"?
Inquiring minds want to know, eh?
