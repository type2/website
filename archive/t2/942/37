Subject: Re: [T2] best rubber for sliding window on my 78

Hey guys, what are the WCM issues? I have a bus full of it via Bus Depot 
as I recall and am wondering if I could do better next time. Noticed one 
of the rear side windows has a seal that is dying 7 yrs later outside 
100% of the time. Everything else looks okay and seals fine.
