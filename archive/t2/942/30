Subject: Re: [T2] best rubber for sliding window on my 78

I haven't seen any OE German-made seals for the side windows in a long,
long time because VW switched production of the Bay Window to Mexico over
two decades ago along with production of many components.  I'd bet my bottom
dollar that the seals OEVeedub gets from Europe are OE Mexico relabeled with
German stickers (and priced accordingly).  In fact the packaging bag under
the seal in your link is identical to what I have.  But I could be wrong -
there may still be a manufacturer in Europe still churning out Side Window
(and other) Seals.

Here's another example - The Vent Wing Seals for the 65-77 Beetle Sedan -
Back in 1984 I was buying them from the local VW dealer for my Old Volks
Home Rubber Program (no Aftermarket Importers were carrying them at the
time).  When I received them in I inspected the part number stickers to ID
them as left and right and in very fine print on the VW/Audi sticker was
"Made In Mexico" (they were assembling Beetles in Mexico then).  Genuine VW,
but made south of the border because the tooling was shifted from Europe to
there.  That is why I suspect the Bay Window Seal production shifted to
there as well.

This is not intended in anyway to "bad mouth" OEVeedub or anyone else that
carries OE Packaged products.  The above is to educate owners where some
(but not all) items originally come from. As always - Caveat Emptor.
