 Rent or borrow a gas generator. The smallest should
 work with an AC sawzall or a skilsaw with a metal

 front of a '67 bus. It was the first of many times
 Karl and I went to salvage yards. He got all the pop
 out windows as I remember. Paid $75 for the clip
 which included the steering box and brake master
 cylinder.

And Harry neglected to mention using a metal cutting
saw when we cut the whole drivers side off a split bus
for his 65 21 window.  I can't remember if it was gas
or electric......
