As long as the linkage lets you pull the cable through, just get the
longest and trim to fit. If you have a soldering gun or iron, solder
the cut end so it doesnt' fray. Or wrap some tape around it.

The stock dual carb one (and others I assume) has a nice cast end on
it to fit the linkage... Something for the set screw to tighten down
on. If you find you need something similar, a bit of solder at that
point works wonders as well.
