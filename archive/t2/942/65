With the pump running unrestricted (no PR), 1.5-2L/min is the minimum output. When I tested my pump, it did 2-2.25L/min. 

With the pressure regulator (PR) attached, there should be at least 1L/min coming out of the PR when the injectors are not firing. This is naturally hard to test when the fuel tank is not empty but it's easy to do on the bench.

I don't think so unless the gas turned to sludge.
