Does anyone know which distributor is in the 2.0 AC engine in the '80
vanagon? I'm wanting to install a PER-1847-A - PERTRONIX ELECTRONIC IGNITION
FOR BOSCH 009 & 050 DISTRIBUTORS, and not sure if this one is the correct
model. CiP also sells the ACC-C10-5844 - ACCUFIRE for "most" AC engines, but
again doesn't list according to model, at least not vanagons.
