Subject: Re: [T2] diff. in caliper hose inlet placement

I ran into the same situation last summer on a '78, and with a pair of 
calipers from BD (not that it matters).  I carefully re-bent the lines 
in sort of a "corkscrew" configuration and it's been fine.

Re-bending those suckers by hand was nerve-wracking, but there was no 
way a tubing bender would've been able to get them into the shape 
needed.  Not that I *own* a tubing bender in the first place. :-)

Tip:  Grip the line in both hands and keep your thumbs about an inch 
apart, and you can bend metal lines just fine without tools.  If you 
put the tips of your thumbs against each other, you'll kink it.
