Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for parts for a European 69 bus

Mike,

There is no difference in the fuse box according to my very early print
Haynes Manual, but '69 is a funky one-year-only fuse box. I have seen a few
on BustedBus' shelves.

However the Euro spec rear lens is a two color unit with an amber turn
signal light on the top and the red brake light on the bottom. The bucket is
also different with two sections and are larger. They fit right into US
models. The lenses can still be purchased new from suppliers with Hella
products. I think Ron has them listed.

Hey Everyone,
My mechanic is looking for some parts so I thought I'd see if any of you 
have 'em.  He's looking for a tail-light lens and fusebox for a european 
'69 bus.  He wasn't sure if there's any difference between the Eurpoean 
and domestic models, but thought he'd mention it anyways.

We're in Long Beach, CA, btw.

Thanks!
Mike
