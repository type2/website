Subject: I'm back, and so is Uncle Gerbelmann

Hi Volks!

Just a quick note to say that I'm back reading this list (as
opposed to only being subscribed to it), because "Uncle
Gerbelmann", my '72 panel van (which some of you may remember:
http://www.gerbelmann.de/gerbelmann.en.html) has just returned
from a really big inspection after several years of standstill.
The only thing that needs to be done yet is the replacement of
the dead generator.  That's scheduled for Friday.

So I'm a Bus driver again, and my, it sure feels good.

If any of you need any help which I can provide through being
German and/or living not too far from either Volkswagenwerk,
let me know.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
