Subject: VW Bus Junk Yard recycling

Rent or borrow a gas generator. The smallest should work with an AC sawzall or a skilsaw with a metal cutting blade. I used both to remove the entire front of a '67 bus. It was the first of many times Karl and I went to salvage yards. He got all the pop out windows as I remember. Paid $75 for the clip which included the steering box and brake master cylinder. 

A quality, non-Harbor Fright cordless sawzall should be able to do the job. Take extra batteries and blades.
