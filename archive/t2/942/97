Not sure.

I bought one in an eBay auction last year. No bidders and paid much  
less. Sometimes, it's sold as buy it now, auction or in lots of 10.

It was a poor reproduction and I didn't bother trying to fit it  
because I was disappointed by the quality. I still have it and can  
try to put it to use if anyone is interested.

The same seller also has the diaphragm for the EEC valve but the  
rubber is too thin and uneven.
