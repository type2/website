Yeah, it's pretty easy.  Just pull off the air filter, turn on the 
ignition, and stick a screwdriver in there to deflect the flapper door. 
  It should kick on the fuel pump and you'll hear the fuel flowing 
through the fuel lines and out the pressure regulator.  You can also 
hook up a fuel pressure guage on the driver's side fuel rail and then 
run the pump to see if it's putting out a descent pressure.

You might also want to dispose of the bad fuel and fill it up with good 
fuel.
