Subject: childs cot question

Hi, I received a child's cot this last summer & want to install it.  I 
have some holes where I believe the brackets go (behind the front 
seats), but have no idea about the front brackets.  Just wondering if 
anyone has up close photos of all 4 brackets?  Before I start to 
drilling I want to make sure I have them in the right place.  I have a 
'69 bus.
thanks,
Keri
