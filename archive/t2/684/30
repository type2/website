 If you can't find a replacement for that integrated thermostat you
could swap in the '68-'70 air cleaner and wire it up to the flaps with
a cable.  That is how the stock '68-'70 system works.  Good luck!

Well.....sort of..... the right thermostat flap on a 68-70 SP engine has the extended
shaft for the cable to attach to it.  The 71 bus is a DP with different flaps and cross over
bar. There is no provision to attach a cable.
