OK I have fuel injection so I'm a little rusty on the older buses but all
engines have a few basics.

you gotta have fuel
you gotta have fire (electric)
you gotta have compression

so you check em one at a time from the cyl back to where it stops.

fuel.

  does the engine flood???
  can you get it started with starter fluid (D-method disapproval)
  is you carb(s) working
  are you intake valves opening correctly (set valve gaps)

fire
  do the spark plugs get fire,  check with a gap to see if it arc's
  check gap in points
  check coil for spark

compression
  do a compression test, (need a compression tester, $20 at Flaps)

this should keep you busy for a few hours ,  good luck
