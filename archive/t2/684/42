Actually, I don't know.  I was away when the shop called to tell my wife the
vehicle was ready, and the paperwork that was in the car (we picked it up
outside the shop after it closed last night) doesn't say anything beyond
enumerating the fuel cap and labor.  Since everything in the engine
compartment was in excellent shape and since the failure involved slightly
too-high CO the logical "fix" is to keep turning the air/fuel mixture screw
clockwise until the CO comes into spec.

I think it's up to $500.  At least, that's what my approval letter says.  I
think the $100 co-pay is your contribution to the $500, not an add to.
