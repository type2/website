Subject: Re: [T2] Temp 2 Stand-off Prototype

"Mr. Rhoton" is too formal.  Clifford is preferred. 
Scott Lyons of GermanSupply.com is sending me the
actual part.  Based upon it's dimensions, I will
certaily look into increasing it's diameter.  I don't
have the paperwork in front of me but I think the
Aluminum hex bar stock we are using is (not a metric
size) 3/4" hex face to face.  Since 1" = 2.54
centimeters, .75 In. x 2.54 CM/In. = 1.905 cm or 19.05
millimeters.  We appear to be in the ball-park
size-wise, don't you think?
   
Now, if we end-up with bar stock which is (less than)
not the 19.05 size, then I would consider increasing
the length of the male thread protrusion, and include
a fender washer in a 20 mm diameter, to assure contact
and lock-down of the tin.  What do you think?
     
Suspections for the NEED for the stand-off?  I no
longer have suspections.  I'm using a prototype now. 
From a need or functionality stand-point, my 1978 VW
T2 Temp 2 sensor has a jury-rigged stand-off right
now, and the engine warm-up problem symptoms have
disappeared.  The stand-off solved the warm-up idle
problem.  My vehicle definitely needs this stand-off. 
So from the standpoint of NEED for this part, I know
it is needed.  I presume my bus has need of the
stand-off due to the temperature differences with the
Spanish/Portugese Heads I am currently running, versus
the heads VW used originally, and designed the Bosch
Temp 2 sensor for.  (I'm currently running heads
purchased from www2.cip1.com of part number
VWC-039-101-061-M.  The country of manufacture shows I
think as Portugal.  I know the Brazilians speak
portugese, but the heads are not Brazilian, they are
Portugese or Spanish.)
