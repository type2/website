Subject: Bentley erratum?

Chapter 5, page 63 (Engine and clutch): Caption to figure 17-11 says 
"Main bearing dowels in bearing saddles (arrows). These dowels are 
found in the left-hand side of the crankcase only."

Shouldn't there a dowel on both sides of the #2 bearing? (For a total 
of five dowels: four on the left-hand side, one on the right)?
