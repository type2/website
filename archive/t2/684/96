Subject: The knack

As usual, this is for duffers and shade-tree mechanics like me, not for 
old hands or pros.

When you have to pull a stud for some reason, the usual advice is to 
place two nuts on the open threads, tighten them together, then turn 
the inside nut with a wrench. This doesn't always work smoothly. 
Sometimes the nuts line up, and it's hard to turn just the inside nut. 
Sometimes no matter how tight you think the two nuts are, they both 
back off together.

The trick is to keep two wrenches on the nuts -- an open ended wrench 
on the inside nut, and a 12-point box wrench on the outside. Get them 
to form a very tight V that you can squeeze with your hand. The outer 
wrench should be the left side of the V. Then turn while squeezing.  
This solves the problems above, and it also feels right. Once the stud 
starts to turn, it's usually okay to remove the outer wrench to finish. 
Then reverse the V and squeeze to loosen the nuts.
