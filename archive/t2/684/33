Subject: TCWBC Shirts and the Winter Bus Haiku Contest

Hi Volks,

As it says in the subject line, there are two related topics in this 
post...

Topic #1 - EVENT SHIRTS:

Suburban Design Corp has released the designs for the official 2005 
TCWBC fashion lineup, and I'm pleased to be able to offer them to you 
for order. The design is here:

http://www.pottsfamily.ca/The_Bug_Pack/TCWBC/TCWBC.gif

The 2005 design will be printed on a quality $12CDN gray T-shirt or on 
a quality heavy fleece gray "Hoodie" sweatshirt for $30CDN . (Add an 
extra dollar for an XXL T or two bucks extra for a XXL hoodie). Shirts 
will be delivered at the event or can be mailed at extra cost.  If you 
wish to order a shirt, email Adam at suburban(-at-)busesofthecorn.com, and 
be sure to get your order in before February 7th.




Topic #2 - HAIKU CONTEST:

Suburban Design Corps and the TCWBC are teaming up to offer an official 
TCWBC hoodie sweatshirt to the author of the best Winter Bus Camping 
haiku submitted before February 7th.

Remember the haiku? It's a japanese form of poetry consisting of three 
lines having 5, 7 and 5 syllables respectively. Eligible TCWBC Haiku 
must also include inferences to buses and winter (or cold places).

Send your Haiku to Greg(-at-)pottsfamily.ca, along with your shirt size and 
address info if you're not attending the event. Share it with the 
mailing list if you want to, but be sure to obey list policies about 
post content where applicable. I'll post my favorites on a weekly 
basis, and I'll have a panel of local bus-fanatics pick the winner.

The contest winner will be announced on February 11th. This contest is 
open to all members of the lists I post it to, but we reserve the right 
to share costs on mailing to an overseas winner should the situation 
arise.

Here's a sample haiku Adam wrote last year during his preparations for 
EveryBus:
  Frosted bare knuckles
  Heart races beyond my hands
  Nine more sleeps to go.

Happy trails,
