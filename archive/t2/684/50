Hi Volks,

Here's a related question.... Did VW change the length of the connector 
tube than runs from the frame to the trans carrier for FI buses?

I have a 1973 connector tube in the westfakia and the FI accellerator 
cable I am using comes up a couple inches too long. AFAIK I have the 
correct cable, so I am supposing that the problem is with the 1973 
connector tube being too short.

Happy trails,
