Subject: California Smog - '82 Vanagon

Well, with a little help from the state of California, I passed smog.

Recap:

Failed smog fairly big-time back in Septemeber.  Had VW dealer set idle air
mixture according to spec, put on a new catalytic converter and went for
retest.  Just barely failed CO at 15 and 25 mph, everything else was OK.

Applied to the state for assistance and it was granted.  Took the vehicle to
a "Gold Shield" station.  On their "baseline" test I passed at 15 mph, and
missed CO by .07% (!) at 25 mph.  Mysteriously, the fuel cap, which had
passed at the "test only" station, failed!

The state bought me a $41.47 (!) fuel cap and 2 hours (-at-) $125 per hour to get
the vehicle to pass.  No out-of-pocket for me as I'd already spent more than
the Co-pay with the VW dealer.
