Subject: Pico  Engine-Diagnostic Technology

Pico Technology Ltd has a nice engine-analysis system that is based 
on hardware that transforms a PC into an oscilloscope and software to 
analyze various engine electrical signals.  For me, the concept is 
cool but the cost puts it outside my sphere of affording.

Does anyone have experience with this or similar systems with an AC VW?
