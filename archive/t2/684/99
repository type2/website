Subject: Rust on cylinder tops

I've seen all-rusty cylinders, and I've seen oil-fouled cylinders. But never
this funny pattern. Maybe it's common.
-------------- Clip -----------------------
A little rust on the cylinders is expected since they aren't coated with
anything but light machine oil from the factory.
Over years or just months of use they all rust some from road splash and the
bottoms tend to be oily because of small leaks that mist them with oil.
Some people paint the cylinders when they install new or refurbished (just
cleaned up) and the paint is applied very thin. There might some minor
temperature difference in painted vs. unpainted but It won't kill your
engine or shorten the life cycle.
I coat lots of cylinders with a ceramic material to dissipate heat and
prevent rust. I doubt it would be worth your time or money to coat VW
cylinders. Many motorcycle owners coat the cylinders with ceramic as an
appearance and for better heat dissipation.
The thing you need to watch out for is build up of crud and oil residue that
builds and fills the fins that cause severe oveheating.
