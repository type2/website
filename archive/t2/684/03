Subject: RE: [T2] Clutch and Brake Pedal Seals?

Look like they have a VW part#, but it's at home so I couldn't tell you what
it is. I already had one reply that I need to take the bolt loose that holds
the pedal shaft to the arm, slip it on, and bolt it back up. I was hoping I
could put them on from topside as I'm rather lazy, the floor is cold, and
although I'll do it, I generally like to take the path of least resistance:-)
Thanks for the feedback.
Tim

Are they aftermarket on genuine VW? I've replaced those twice with genuine
pads and not had them split during install.
