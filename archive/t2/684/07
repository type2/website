In my opinion, a good interim solution would be any that lets you have the
valve in the "cold" position on a normal basis, but gives you the option to
change it to the "hot" position without more than a minute or two of fuss.
That way, if the engine starts running roughly on a cool day with moisture in
the air, you'll be able to go back and turn your carb heat on.  I'd probably
do this somehow with aircraft safety wire (that's how my Bus's
lever-incompatible mexi-heaterboxes are secured in the "on" position for the
winter), but you could use any method that pleases you.

I'm a thousand miles from my Bus at the moment and I'm having trouble
visualizing what you intend to do with lines and holes in tin, but it sounds
like overkill.  I'd leave the tube that serves as a hot air source in place.

Cheers,
