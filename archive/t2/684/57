Jason,

When I first read it, I thought YEOUCH!!!!  I think I will look into a
custom fabric mill!

On second thought tho, there's a lot of sewing in a full set of curtains
and that's all hand labor so her price is not that unreasonable.
Looking at the two-tone plaid for $250 gives you an idea of the labor
cost, so it's $450 extra for the original cloth.  I was thinking $2-300
but it might well turn out to cost the same $450-500.... short runs are
very expensive.  And think of the amount of labor that the $250 buys
(discounting the cost of the cloth)!  I had not counted but she says there
are 16 pieces... at any decent hourly rate for cutting and sewing, you are
getting a bit of a bargain.

I dunno... I will keep thinking.

Steve
