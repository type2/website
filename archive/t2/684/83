Subject: '76 heads + '78 bottom

My bottom end is a '78, hydraulic lifters and cams. I have correct 
pushrods for hydraulics. My heads, however, are from my old engine (a 
'76), set up for solid lifters.

If I am very lucky, I may be able to find some spacers/washers from a 
hydraulic set-up in the junkyards before I want to close this engine 
up. But if I am not so lucky, can I run this engine configuration 
through the break-in period (that is, with the '76 rockers, no solid 
spacers)? Since I will be dropping the engine to retorque the heads, 
that will be a good time to change the rockers, and it will give me 
more time to find them.
