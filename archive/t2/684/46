Subject: How to install Emergency Brake Seal and Front Tire Carrier?

I just recieved via post a spare tire mount for the front of our 74 and an
emergency brake boot.  Of course, there were no instructions.  I could
stumble through and do both, but, I am sure that others here have
installed both items and can tell me the best way to go about doing it. 
It will save me time working in the snow!!

Thanks for the help!
