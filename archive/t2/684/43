Subject: accel cables

I have noticed that there seems to be a difference with a 74 bus accel cable for
Cailifornia models.

How can I determine if my bus  requires a 74 california only cable?

211721555N is a accel cable listed for 74 Cal only
211721555T is for 73-74 NOT Cal

Any one know the difference with the cables?

Thanks
Jamie Rivers
