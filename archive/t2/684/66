Subject: Re: [T2] How to install Emergency Brake Seal and Front Tire

Can't help with the e-brake seal, but I just did my front tire mount on my 73.

Did your mount come with any hardware? There are supposed to be some
compression nuts since it's pretty much impossible to access the nose
holes. They kind of act like drywall anchors.

Also, which brand of mount did you get? The holes are slightly
different between the 3 that Richard Atwell found.

If you haven't yet, check out Richard's site: http://www.ratwell.com
He's got pics and a writeup on the nose mount there.
