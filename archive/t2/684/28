Subject: Help with starting problem

Hello all,
    It has been a very long time since I have been a member on this list. To
make a long story short, I am trying to get back on track and take care of
my buses the way I once used to. (poor health always seems to get the better
of me but I am vowing this year to try even harder!!!!)
    I have spent the past several days scouring the archives and files to
find information to put me on the right track, but I would love any extra
info you guys can share with me as electrical issues have always stumped me.
Here is my problem:
    1970 bus, stock as far as I can tell, ran fine when we bought it, drove
it home couple hundred miles just fine, parked it and it has never wanted to
start right since. The coil has been replaced, as have the plugs, wires, and
battery. It will turn over but will not catch. We ran a starter bypass
switch and it still will not catch. Fuel is moving into the fuel filter. How
do I find where the fire stops? Any advice will be GREATLY appreciated....

Thanks so much!!!!
Joy
