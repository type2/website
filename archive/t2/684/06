there is a "Green book" (that is what it is called) similar to the
infamous "Blue book" that insurance agents use more often. I have found
copies at my local library and it is for "older and historic collectors
cars"  in the blue book my bus is worth about 200-500 dollars in the green
book it is worth $8,500  big diffference.  when they tried to total my bus
after a minor accident some years ago it was the green book that saved my
bus from being totaled.  As soon as I opened my mouth and said that "I
have checked the green book" they started working out the settlement, so
they know about it but the blue book must be the insurance settlement
folks and used car dealers book.

you NEVER have to accept a settlement "offer" but the prochedure is quite
complicated to contest it, as Doc Tim would say, records records records,
record everything you do to your bus, every cent spent etc

wow what are you doing to it,.???? those "High" numbers are the show
winners and trailer queens.

my bus has an "assigned value" insurance policy.  unfortunaately someone
on the list said the company I have my policy with is no longer offering
it to new customers....??
