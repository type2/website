We have an ADC-216 at work. It's pretty awesome but too pricey for the hobby mechanic (at least I decided it was). Even if you only bought one current probe, the seconday ignition pickup, the 20:1 attenuator and the ADC-212/3 unit you'd still be into it about $750 instead of the $1300 for the whole kit. If I was fixing VWs fully time I'd probably get it and setup a laptop in the garage.
