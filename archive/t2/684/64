 I came across a TSB from VW #13-93-03 dated July 31,1993 that stated the
flywheel bolts should be torqued to 44 ft. lbs. then another 90 deg. turn.
It also makes mention of bolts coated with locking compound but gives no
part number.

I would NEVER do a 90 degree turn on a solid bolt with a hex head. You will probably
break it or pull the threads.

ONLY stretch bolts get a 90 degree turn. Stretch bolts can be recognized by the head of
the bolt. It will either be a Torx or a 12 point Allen. Almost all have a blank spot between the head and the
threads. This is the 'stretch' section.

I have never seen strecth bolts on a type 4 flywheel.
