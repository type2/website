There's one in my '73 Riviera. On a mount above the battery. I've been
trying to figure out what the heck that darn sensor was for. Had all kinds
of guesses when I asked a while back.

I've got pictures somewhere (if I haven't deleted them). If I find them
I'll stick them back on the web for you to see (or I'll take more later
today and put them up for you).
