From: Jason Thorpe:

Indeed.  I just made a set for my '76 Westy before Christmas.  It was 
easy, but time consuming and tedious to get all the seams right, etc.  
Lots of standing over a hot iron.  And I still spent  over $200 for my 
fabric (which was itself a compromise).

Darn.... you should have asked..... I have at least 2 complete sets of factory green
Westy curtains.... including the front curtain.

I have most of the yellow set.

I have a complete set of 80-83 Westy brown curtains, includes the rare front curtain.
[Harder to find then the bay front curtain!]
