HI Steve,

The body of the westfakia is a 79 model type2 that came to me with no 
engine or transmission. I did not change the trans support, and the 
socket for the tube was in the correct location when Dennis Jolliffe 
swapped in the 1700 engine and 3-rib tranny in the spring of 1999. When 
I converted to FI last spring I simply moved the cable to a new 
position without disrupting the tranny support. Perhaps VW put two 
sockets in the later support, seeing as how they continued to use dual 
carbs in other markets well into the vanagon era.

I ordered my FI throttle cable last spring from GermanSupply, and I'm 
sure that it is too short to use with dual carbs. But the way it's 
installed now the set screw on the throttle body connects to the braid 
on the wire rather than the solid steel fitting at the end. I figure 
that the throttle cable tube is the most likely culprit capable of 
creating a difference in the slack available.

Happy trails,
