Greg,

When I transplated the '78 engine into the '73, I transplated *everything*
even vaguely FI related, including the transmission support, the throttle
cable and that tube.  I had no problems.  Since you are getting the cable
tru the front tin, you must have transplanted the trans support... the
throttle cable tube comes out in a different place on the FI. I am
thinking either the tube changed (likely, but should not make a much of a
difference) or you still have the dual-carb throttle cable, which will be
too short.
