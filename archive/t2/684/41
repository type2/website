Clifford,

I'd have to go out and look, and right now it's 15 degrees out there,
so... no ;-)

I think you are on the right track.  If the 19mm stock does not interfere
with anything then that is lovely!  I was worried about interference with
the intake manifold but if you have a prototype installed then it can be
done and that's great.

Have you used an O2 sensor to check the mixture at operating temperature,
both with and without the stand-off? My concern is that even a small
amount of heat radiation off the stand-off will lower the sensed
temperature during operation and lean the mix.  Not a lot, just a little,
but I would worry until I knew.  Of course insering a low-value resister
would probably make up for the temperature loss but then you are back to
square one on the starting.  The whole subject of heat transmission,
transfer, and radiation within and between different metals and alloys
gets very complicated very fast.

OOK!
