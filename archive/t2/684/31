In the absence of being able to properly inspect it to determine how
successful the cleaning was, surely there must be a function test. If
it is a PCV valve, can't it be checked with generic PCV valve function
tests? It's been a long time, but it seems like the last suggestion
was correct: should be able to blow through it from the crankcase
side, but not from the manifold side. Is Bentley silent on this?
