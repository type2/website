I subscribe to the other philosophy, that which says that any part that
has been serving for two decades is less likely to fail than an unknown
new part.  Having had new clutch cables fail in the first few days of
service, I don't change one that is working well!

Changing a clutch cable on the road isn't all that tough, as long as you
have the correct part!
