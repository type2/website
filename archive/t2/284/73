Requeries- jack stand points-given a choice (drivable bus) use ramps-
safer. Use the stands balanced on each side along the front torsion bar
tube is easiest- the longitudinal frame rails on each side is OK also.  
To level a later bus, I have placed a wood block and a single stand
under the center of the front bumper mounting "tube), but this is not
for working under there.
     In the rear, the main side frame rails, and the rear axle tube, is
typical-  Be aware that when you jack up the rear from one side, you are
also lifting the front a bit.  Use four legged stands, not the tripod
style.  Use plywood pieces under them if working on blacktop.
Re pics-the "pipes" next to your heater boxes are diverter pipes for the
air being blown into the boxes when the heat is OFF.  They direct the
air behind the engine.  The generic flapper box (that which opens when
you pull the cable to turn on the heat) does not have the connector to
this diverter pipe- if so, remove these pipes (as I did)-they make
removing/replacing the valve covers more difficult.
   The round thing under the driver side front end, behind the torsion
tube is the vacuum assist to the master brake cylinder- make sure it has
the vacuum line attached.
