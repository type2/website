Lever connects to an adjustable control rod (should be about horizontal to 
help you find it) and it may need a tweak to make it shorter.

More likely is the idea that the foam on the inside of the flaps has gone 
to pieces.

Remove the cowl vent out front, remove the flappers, and remove old foam. 
Replace with new foam. I use 1/8" thick self adhesive foam used for 
wrapping pipes from Lowe's. There may be a better solution.

I also like the piece of  magnetic material sourced from a sign shop to 
cover the cowl vent outside.
