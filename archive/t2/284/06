Benoit,

Every other year, I take a month off from work and drive one of my buses
"around the block."  Starting in Virginia, I go to Seattle Washington and
Los Angeles California then home.  I usually turn at least 10K miles on
these trips.  The first time I did this, in my '78, it was a winter trip
and I wound up going thru the Dakotas in late December... it was 40 below
in Rapid City SD.  Since then I have done it in June :-)  The bus will
handle a winter trip, but you may not :-)

I am certain that with reasonable expectations as to speed and frequent
checks of the valves that your bus will make the trip. I am as certain it
will break at some point during the trip, but I think that that is part of
the adventure andyou set out ready to deal with the breakdown, whatever it
may be.  On a bay, my fave is the clutch cable and I have strung new
clutch cables in some of the most beautiful places on earth!  There is
nothing like the view of the sun rising over the Rockies at 6 in the
morning from under a bus, covered in grease :-)
