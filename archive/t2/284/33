> Here's the short list or works/doesn't work:

To add to Chris' excellent list, I use a Coleman PowerCat:

Between the front seats. The PowerCat is a catalytic (no open flame) propane
heater. It has a nice wide base and has always stayed exactly where I put it.
I use a pair of rechargeable D batteries in it to run the fan but probably
should use a cigarette lighter adapter. It heats the bus quite nicely. The
canisters cost $1.80 at Wal-Mart and provide 8 hours of heat. It also works
great when camping!
