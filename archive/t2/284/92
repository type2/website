Subject: Spare: used or new? Was: Is it feasible with my bus! 

To continue this topic, I am about to install either one or both new CV 
joints on my '78 Westy. One side is in desperate need of replacing (making 
lots of clunking noise), while the other has its boots intact and is not 
(yet) giving me any trouble. I have ordered two *new* axles with CV joints 
already installed. Should I swap both axles out or just replace the offending 
side (and carry the new one as a spare)? I'm interested to hear the responses 
on this one...
