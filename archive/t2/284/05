Subject: Getting engine started

I recently purchased a 81 2.0 FI aircooled westy and towed it home a few days
ago. Not sure how long ago it been running.  Any advice how to get the engine
running??   I just bought a new battery and it turns over with no problems.
There was a broken fuel line which I replaced.   The P.O. said he put 5
gallons of gas in recently and I threw some gas dryer in. He only had it for
about a month and before that it had been sitting for some time.  I'm getting
fuel to the engine and just replaced the points and condenser. I'm getting
spark.  I sprayed starting fluid down the throttle body and the engine just
won't catch.  Any ideas???

Thanks,

Mike
