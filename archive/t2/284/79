Subject: [T2] Bus sighting [It's Friday] 

another nice splitty sighting: the movie called Girl:Interrupted starring 
Winona Rider (recently indigted on shoplifting charges). if i recall 
correctly it is a two-tone (orange/brown?), her and her friend bum a ride 
from some cats who smoke them up and drop them off 'further on down the 
line'. good flick.
