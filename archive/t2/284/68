Subject: Re: [T2] Bus sighting [It's Friday]

Alright, I was watching that movie, Almost Famous the other day. Now there 
were alot of busses, and the movie was supposed to take place in 1973. The 
kid was is school still, so it couldn't have been any later than April of 
'73. .....Yeah, well, I saw a Bay with the turn signals above the headlights, 
and no gas flap, just a cap....hence 74-79. How do you like those apples?:)

I told my old lady the whole story, and she just looked at me like I have a 
mental problem. hahaha.

Have a great weekend everyone.
