And a personal thanks to Mr. Dolan, for that gem about the clutch cable. 
Mine is 26 years old. I'm going to get a new one, put it in place as a 
preventive measure, and carry the old one as a spare. That way, I don't 
have to risk having the sun in my eyes at 6am......nice warm shop, lift, 
etc.   And maybe the old cable will even acquire antique value among 
collectors, as the years go by.

Benoit,
Every other year, I take a month off ..........On a bay, my fave is the 
clutch cable and I have strung new clutch cables in some of the most 
beautiful places .....
