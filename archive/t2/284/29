Subject: RE: [T2] JC Whitney heater in bus

Its not that easy. The heater that your looking at is for a water cooled
engine. The heater core that is mentioned in the description is a water
coil.

There are a couple of different ways to get heat into your bus. You can
investigate most of them here http://www.type2.com/library/heating.htm#1

The first and most conventional is to use and improve the current heating
system. This website has a pretty good description on how to improve the
current system http://www.bulley-hewlett.com/VWindex/ 

Another way is to install a gasoline fired heater. Check the classifieds at
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/index.mv to see if anyone is selling one.
Companies make brand new ones also.

The only was to make that JC Whitney heater to work is to supply it with a
source for hot water. Its possible to do, but its a bit involved. It
involves using your hot engine oil to heat water and then circulate that
water through the heater coil. Its the most involved way to heat your bus.
