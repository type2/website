Subject: Dropping T4 engine, without tranny questions.

Ok, my clutch is screwed up, so I am dropping the engine. 

I have done it a couple of times before, but not without my buddy's help.

I got the carbs off, the tins off. disconnected the fuel line, accelerator 
cable, alternator cables, starter, removed the coil,etc... I rolled the back 
wheels up on some sturdy ramps, and got the front wheels blocked off.

here we go..

1) Do I need to support the tranny in some way, or will it stay in place when 
I unbolt the engine from the bell housing?

2) Do I need to remove the oil filler neck from the case?

3 Does it sound like I should get someone who knows what is going on here, or 
does it sound like I am doing ok so far! (lil' joke)

Thanks all,
