given the choice, I'd go single port.

my dual port runs hot despite a million things I've done to
try to fix this condition.   My next step may indeed be
to pull the 34-Pict-3 and try a 30-Pict and see if that
actually makes a difference, but I'm not holding my breath.
This, in comparison to folks with sp's I know who cruise
at 60 and have never had a temp gauge, and never blown
an engine, even when driving in the desert.

Also, when discussing having a 1600dp built, Jake Raby
said he'd rather build me a 1600sp than a dp because
he felt they were bomb-proof.
