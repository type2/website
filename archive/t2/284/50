Doyt,

On the one hand, I am with George. I am very much of the " If it ain't
broke, don't fix it!" school of thought.  On the other, tho...  I tend to
spend a lot of time doing minor repairs as they happen, like in the Dixie
National Forest at 6AM :-)  I would not argue strongly either way, just so
that you have a working cable under the back seat, just in case.  The
thing that scares me worst about the Vanagon is the hydraulic clutch.  I
did replace all parts of it when I was setting out last time, but it still
scares me!  I imagine pushing the clutch pedal down 40 miles up a dirt
road in Nevada and having it flop to the floor.  Stringing a new clutch
cable is a doddle compared to bleeding a clutch by yourself in the desert.
I have a mity vac with me at all times (ask anyone... I travel a lot like
Alice's white knight :-), but I still fear that breakdown!
