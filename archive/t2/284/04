I just wanted to thank you, Ian, for sharing your extensive experience 
related to winter camping in a bus.  The adaptations are incredibly 
creative and do-able, in my opinion. Your suggestions deserve the widest 
circulation and recognition.

Have fun on your trip. Looks like you've prepared better than I would, and
I've done more winter touring than this trip indicates.

Hope some of this helps.
