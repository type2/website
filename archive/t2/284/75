Subject: RE: [T2] customer service by Bus Depot - a long posting

I know nothing about this situation, however I just ordered something from
the bus company, and while I was there picking it up, forgot one thing and
left it behind.  Ken was nice enough to mail it to me, no charge.  So I have
high praises for the bus company.
