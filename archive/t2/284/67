more recently, there was a show about a monkey who was in some kind of 
government experiment and was super-smart and loved to use computers... a 
small group of people was out to save the monkey and set him free and they 
travelled around in an early bay, they had all kinds of computers and stuff 
set up in there, and at one point the monkey tried to drive it!! can't 
remember if this was a movie or a short series, but i remember watching it a 
couple of years ago. 
FWIW,
