Subject: New trick for replacing bottom generator brush

OK, after having eyeballed the gen in my 70 bug and deciding that I DID NOT
want to remove the manifold and carb and assorted things to get to the 4
bolts that hold the generator to the shroud, I devised the following
shortcut that worked just great. The carbon brushes have a copper woven
pigtail on them that terminates in a square piece of metal with a hole
drilled through it's centre, just like those square dimestore nuts that come
with cheap nuts and bolts. In order to replace the bottom brush you have to
unscrew the connector screw completely to put on the square pigtail end. Now
I'm not sure about you, but I just KNEW that little bitty screw would not
only fail to EVER go back in that dinky hole I got it out of with a
flatblade, but I also knew that I didn't have 7 fingers on each hand with
built in mirror and light to see the *(&*!!! little hole it came out of in
the first place! (And all this while standing on my head cause it's
underneath the generator in a small slotted cut out. SO, let's cut to the
chase - First, I pulled the old carbon brush outta it's spring holder and
let it hang there. Next I clipped the pigrtail off right at the end where it
terminates in the square metal piece. On the new carbon brush I just nipped
off the end piece of that square little terminal so it was now not a hole in
the middle but a slot. I then carefully undid the screw a few turns while
standing on my head with a mirror and light and flatblade, and slid the new
piece UNDER the screw and tightened it down, leaving the old endpiece in
there too. What looked like a couple of hours of fun removing pieces and
carbs and swearing and generally being bad tempered turned into a 1/2 hr. of
not too bad work.
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. :-)
