Subject: Fw: [T2] Heater questions (replacement of ducting)

Not that it's a cheap option, but I have replaced all the foil/paper ducting
under my '77 deluxe bus with rubber fuel delivery hose. As we use it at work I
got it for the right price :-). The rubber hose is quite thick (~5mm), so I
didn't use any further insulation on it, and being rubber it will stand up to
water/sand/rocks etc better than the original stuff. I thought it would dampen
out some of the engine noise that travels up the tube though, but I noticed no
change there. For the two short tubes that feed the rear seats and have sharp
bends in them I used ducting hose, which has a light wire coiled in it to stop
it collapsing, and is made from material impregnated with rubber.
From memory the closest sizes were 90mm under the cargo area, 70mm under the
front cab and 60mm feeding the rear seats. Some good SS hose clamps squeezed
the hose down onto the steel tubes at the joins. I can confirm these sizes if
anyone needs them.
They seem to stand up to the heat so far, and only had a real rubbery smell
for a week or so.
