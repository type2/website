Modern fuel injection with a better flowing intake. Check out TMW induction 
and Megasquirt.

Also you could fit a modern VW or GM or whoever you want.

There is a list member that put CIS injection (VW mechanical injection from 
the 80's) on his bus engine and had positive results in the power and 
mileage departments.
