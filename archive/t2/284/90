Subject: customer service by Bus Depot, oh well

Ron,

We live in America - thank God.  That means you don't have to like me 
and you don't have to sell to me either.  The same for me I don't have 
to buy from you (but I don't dislike you).  There are many customers out 
there and several VW parts suppliers - enough that we can both get by 
without having to deal with each other.

Guess Thumper's mom was right.  I have little kids and we watch Bambi, a 
lot.

Best wishes and future success,
