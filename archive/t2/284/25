Subject: JC Whitney heater in bus

Of course, now that I have a bus (or will have, when I go to pick him up on
Saturday), I have some more questions.  
My new bus has had his heater flaps wired shut- and I've heard that even if
I get them open, the heat is not very good.  So I want to add an additional
heat source.  One of the items I have found that seems plausible is a JC
Whitney heater (see link below). Has anyone had experience with this sort of
heater? Is it reliable and safe?  Easy or hard to install?  or does anyone
know of any other (relatively) inexpensive options I should look into?

Thanks!

Kelly
