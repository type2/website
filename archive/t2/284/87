Subject: [T2] bus sighting

I was out in my driveway doing the final hook-ups on the new Ghia engine,
when I saw, sitting just ten feet away, an early loaf westy.  With a tarp 
over it.
As soon as I get the Ghia done, I'm gonna' pull the bus engine, for its 1,000
mile make-over.

I think the problem all you TeeVee-viewing Listees have, is that you don't own
nearly enough volkswagens.
