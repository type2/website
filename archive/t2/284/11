Subject: Source for Retractable Awning?

I am interested in getting one of those retractable awning do hick-ees. You 
know, the one that rolls up into a bazooka tube that hangs out along the roof 
line of the bus?

Anyone know a good brand, a good source to check, or have any experience with 
these?

Thanks,
