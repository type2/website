Yup, from the description, they are indeed shot.

There are two ways to deal with this, the right way and the quick way.

The right way:  find and install a 10x1.0 helicoil (good luck!) or have
the hole filled with weld, redrilled, and tapped.

The quick way: unless you have an original engine, check the mirror
location at the rear of cylinder #4.  Many rebuiders drill and tap that
hole for a CHT sender, since they cannot be sure which side a replacement
head will be used on.  If it is drilled and tapped, you can put the CHT
sender there.  It's not as good as putting it on #3, but it will work.

If it were me, I'd go with the quick way if it were available.  Check your
head.  You will also need a slight extension on the sire to it from the
harness, I believe.

If you want to take a bit more time, there is a second tin screw
location to the rear of the original location, but still near #3.  You can
also drill and tap that hole for the sender.  A better solution, but more
time/effort.

Altho it sounds like your major problem is lack of contact, any used
sender is pretty much guaranteed to be bad.  For some reason, these seem
to go bad every couple years, at least for me.  Since we need to get
emissions checked here in VA every other year, I just replace mine before
I bring it in.  I would *not* recommend using other than a new sender.

Yup!  You need good contact and epoxy is a plastic.  *NOT* a good
conducter.  The symptoims you describe are classic for a bad sender *or*
bad contact.

If you want to know, take the sender inside, heat up a pan of oil with a
candy theromometer in it and conduct your tests in a valid environment.
Iffy ground and maybe temps are making a hash of your readings, I am sorry
to say, and I can't tell you what is going on, tho I will stand by my
"Toss it, buy a new one" advice above.
