I agree with this whole heartedly! 
Brings 2 things to mind,, 
1] when selling parts at swap meets,, I like to get a fair price for a part. So,
take a 30 year old OG side view mirror for example, in great shape..like NEW.
what is it worth?,,,  Look at todays BRAND NEW mirror price, and it is worth AT
LEAST that much, maybe more!
WHY?  because that OG mirror has years of life left in the chrome,,, and the
BRAND NEW mirror will have rust on it the next time the dog pee's on the tires.

Same goes for NOS alternator belts, as the new ones seem to shred,,, or a 2
liter camshaft, original is much better lately,.......sigh

2] I do have a warning,  when buying a "just in case" spare,, such as throttle
or  clutch cable, or alternator belt,,, Triple check it the EXACT same as what
you need! ,, it is always a bugger to find out you have been carrying a spare ,
and it is NOT going to fit.

For this reason,, I am more tempted to recommend to buy a new part, install it,
and carry the used one for a back up.  That way you are certain you have the
correct part
