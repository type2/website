Subject: Re: [T2] online parts shops

Highly recommended online parts shops, in no particular order:
http://www.aircooled.net/
http://www.bus-boys.com/
http://www.bustedbus.com/
http://www.type2parts.com/
http://www.busdepot.com/

All of these regularly post on this list, have used a few myself, been
pleased with results, value vs. cost.  But, opinions vary!  I hope this
thread doesn't turn into a bash-fest.

Also, check the type2 archives for the previous conversations on this
subject...


Have fun,
