Well, you might check with the shipping dept of Solar Turbines.
They surely have big trucks going to Houston on frequent occasions.

The drivers would be independent contractors, or they would work for 
independent hauling companies.

It would probably be possible to have the seat loaded up and hauled as 
"extra baggage" on one of their regular run shipments.

I used to have this done when I was in business for myself. I used a 
shipper in the midwest that made regular runs to Houston. He would load up 
my stuff and charge me just a few extra dollars to get my stuff down to me. 
He made the run each week, and it was extra money for him, at no additional 
cost to himself.
