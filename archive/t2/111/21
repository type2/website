Subject: partial brake job?

My master cylinder is leaking on my '68, but the rest
of the system seems fine and the shoe linings are fat.

Would any of the list's gray beards object to my
replacing just the master cylinder, adjusting the
brakes and bleeding, without doing any other brake
work?

I'll admit it--I have a morbid fear of pulling those
rear hubs.
