Rustin,
You sure are an adventuring-type!  If you know a little about your new
bus, that helps.  If not, no biggie.

Perform a proper tune-up!  Plugs, cap,rotor, check your plug wires for
wear, change the oil and pickup screen, check for bad leaks, adjust your
valves, etc.  Better safe than sorry.
Personally, I like to carry spares.  Always have:
2 spare sets of points, caps and rotors
1 set of spark plugs, gapped.
1 coil
1 distributor (if you have one)
2 throttle cables
5 or 6 barrel nuts(they hold the throttle cable and heater box cables)
2 clutch cables 2 clevis pins (they hold the clutch cable at the pedal
end)
2 front bearings, greased (in a Zip Loc bag)
2 rear bearingsm greased (in a Zip Loc bag)
Cotter pins
1 bouden tube
Decent tool kit (assorted metric wrenches, etc.)
Good flashlight
Flares
Fix A Flat
4 quarts of oil
The A.I.R.S. list, printed out
Bentley Manual

These are some of the things I take with me on road trips, off the top
of my head.  I guess the Marine Corps made me a little anal about preparation.
 It's good to be prepared.  I might not be able to limp home the whole
way, but I should eb able to get myself off the road and somewhere I
can fix it right.  Also, remember some places won't have the parts you
need, so ya gotta bring your own.

Listen to the other listees as well.  There are some seasoned travelers
on this list.  I'm still a novice.

Check out the vwtrends website http://www.vwtrendsweb.com/ .  They have
along article, in pdf format, on road trip preparation.

Good luck,
