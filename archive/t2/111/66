Tubeless tires on a wheelchair?  Progress marches on!

I can see your point, but I've found that the Slime brand stuff is water
soluble.  I've never had any problem cleaning it up, but I've always had
running water to work with.

I worked for 15 years with a fellow who used a wheelchair and
as the handy guy in the department fixed quite a few of his flats.  I
would have suggested Slime to him, but he went to non-pneumatic tubes and
his flat problem went away.  Seemed as though the non-pneumatics were a
bit "slower" and heavier than the pneumatics, but he loved them.

Vehicular use is considerably different than low-speed use, which is
probably why your results are poor.  I agree that Slime makes patching
impossible, which is why I don't use it on tubeless tires.  With tubes,
the stuff has worked very well for me.  I dislike patching motorcycle
tires on the way to work as much as you dislike patching wheelchair tires,
and Slime has sealed several punctures so that I could fix them (by
replacing the tube) in the comfort of my garage rather than at the side of
the freeway.
