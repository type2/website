The two pipe/peashooter muffler is indeed a bug muffler.

It has been said on this list that one should not use the bug muffler on a
bus due to bus aerodynamics resulting in exhaust being sucked into the
engine compartment by the tailwash of the bus.  This can cause fumes to
enter the heating system.  The bus muffler/pipe assembly routes the exhaust
to the side and thus out of the tailwash.

That said, I have been using bug mufflers on my 71 Westy for many years, and
have not noticed any fumes in the heat other than when I have had problems
with the muffler to heat exchanger connections.

One advantage of the bug 2 pipe muffler is supposedly more horespower due to
less backpressure, but I doubt the difference is significant.

OK folks, while my engine is out for the gas tank repair, I am also going to
replace my muffer on the 71 westy (1600 DP).  The current muffler on it is
the one with 2 exhaust outlets (pea shooter?).  Looking through parts
catalogs, I see that all the bus mufflers for a 71 have just the 1 exhaust
outlet.  So, do I currently have a Bug muffler? If so, are there any reasons
I should NOT replace it with a new Bug muffler of the same style or would I
be much better off going with the proper single exhaust bus muffler.  The
version I currently have seems to be considerably cheaper, so that's one
advantage of the 2 exhaust version.  All opinions appreciated!
