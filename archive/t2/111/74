Hi Suzanna,

Bus values are hugely impacted by two factors; condition and location. You
already told us the condition; how about telling us where the bus is.

Also, how much rust is minimal? Are we talking about small patches breaking
through the third coat of bondo and large holes in the frame (like my last
bus, a 73 camper) , or just a few brown smudges in the seams where things
haven't gotten started yet? (like my Dad's 80 Vanagon westy).


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
