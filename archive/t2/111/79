I have an 82 Camper with Type 4 engine.  Do the hydraulic lifters ever =
need adjustment on this motor or should I leave well alone?  They work =
well except 1 of them, (don't know which), is noisy when first started =
up after a few days sitting idle.

All advice from you wise men of VWs gratefully accepted.

Thanks,

Dave
