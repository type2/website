Volks,
Working on a 1970 here.  I am having a hard time getting the horn to =
work let me see if I understand the ground circuit on this model, for I =
think it changed a few years later.

The ground comes from the horn , and goes into the bottom of the =
steering column and attaches to a male "tang' near the base (floor ) of =
the column....a second ground is a attached to  a bolt in the steering =
bushing (the rubber flange with 4 bolts in it..above the steering box) =
AND goes up the column and attaches to the horn ring.  So now when you =
press the horn button, the two grounds meet and complete the circuit..is =
this right?

The PO had this thing all rigged up and I am certain it has not worked =
in years!
