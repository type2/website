They have a lot of stuff (go-westy), but their prices are waay to high. Bus
Depot has always had what I needed and at the best price. Just my   $.02

I just want to share a little online shopping experience I went through
today which relates to this original post.

I have a new 2 liter I am putting in my bus so I am going with the bigger
clutch. I also needed the flywheel. I need to have it this weekend so I can
drive again!!

I have used many of the online stores, probably all of them. Nobody
mentioned GoWesty in this thread but they are the only ones who had what I
needed in house and could ship it today. I have found lots of places say
they have to get it in and it would be at least 2 days before they could
ship it. GoWesty is a shop too so they have a lot of stuff right there.

Synopsis..I am calling GoWesty first from now on.
Here is the link to shop online at GoWesty:
www.gowesty.com
They have more than their catalog shows, so call them if you can't find it.
