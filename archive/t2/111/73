Subject: Re:[T2] Horn question

Adam,
   You've got the horn curcuit figued out just right.  At least that's how 
it is on my '71.  A lot of people have trouble with the fact that the outer 
tube of the steering column is actually part of the circuit.
   When I bought my bus the Previous Owner had done the same thing as yours. 
  It was just crying out "fix me right" and so that was the first of a never 
ending list of maintenance tasks.
