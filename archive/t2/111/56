Well, tell us your experience, don't just slam the product!  How can Slime
damage a tire?  The only negatives that I've found about Slime in over a
decade of use are:

1. It only seals punctures in the tread area.
2. You cannot patch a slime-treated tire or tube.  the patches don't
stick, and it removes existing patches.
3. If you let a Slime-sealed puncture sit for a few weeks without driving,
the seal tends to dry out and start a slow leak.  Daily-driven vehicles
don't have this problem, and if it happens you just spin the wheel and it
is sealed again.

Now, there are various brands of tire sealants, and I'm only talking about
the brand-name "Slime" product.  Others may be worse or better.
