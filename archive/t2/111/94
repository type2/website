It wouldn't hurt to adjust them but it probably wont solve the problem. Sounds like you have a lifter that isn't holding it's prime. Not a problem as long as it pumps up quickly, say within a minute or two. Some folks try things like MMO to clean out
the lifters but I think if they don't pump up quick enough they should be removed and properly cleaned and primed before reinstallation.
