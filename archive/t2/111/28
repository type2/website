I am referring to the Type 4 engine

This is the way things used to be.  Since the early 90's VW has done this a
different way.  You use only a barrel shim on the bottom of the
cylinder...and se no head gasket or sealing ring in the head itself. None.
VW found that this gasket did not help seal the chamber at all, but it
warped when heads got hot and caused leaks.
