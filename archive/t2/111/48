Get rid of the bug muffler. Your bus rolls along at the astonishing rate of
55mph(ask me how I know), with a vacuum formed behind that loaf like body.
The vacuum sucks in the exhaust from the bug muffler. Any leaks in any seal,
guess what? You are breathing carbon monoxide. Not worth it. I learned this
on the list from others smarter than I used to be!  There is a good reason
why the bus muffler pipe exhausts to the side, believe me.

I just ordered a stainless steel stock muffler setup from Bus Depot for $99.
Last muffler you'll ever have to buy. Tom

> OK folks, while my engine is out for the gas tank repair, I am also going
to replace my muffer on the 71 westy (1600 DP).  The current muffler on it
is the one with 2 exhaust outlets (pea shooter?).  Looking through parts
catalogs, I see that all the bus mufflers for a 71 have just the 1 exhaust
outlet.  So, do I currently have a Bug muffler? If so, are there any reasons
I should NOT replace it with a new Bug muffler of the same style or would I
be much better off going with the proper single exhaust bus muffler.  The
version I currently have seems to be considerably cheaper, so that's one
advantage of the 2 exhaust version.  All opinions appreciated!
