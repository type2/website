I can see why!  90 degrees dwell means the points never open at all!

I've experienced a set of "rapid wear" points.  Don't know why, but they
just wore out fast.  Other points I've used ran fine for 15000+ miles.
I've had the same problem with generator brushes.  One brush goes away in
a few hundred miles, while its mate barely shows any wear.  I suppose it's
just shoddy quality control.
