Subject: 70 bus and 68 singlecab , Parting out.

Hello all,
 I am parting out my wrecked 68 singlecab and wrecked 70 microbus, both are
complete , motors are spoken for but the transmissions are good.
The bus is very solid , the truck is rusty on the lower portions but the bed
is in good shape. its gates are "ok" as well
Located in Charlotte NC
704-788-4481

Thanks,
Bryan
