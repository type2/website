Matty, the consumate masters of off-road buses are on http://www.baja.com/kombi & the following address is their tech page:
http://www.baja.com/kombi/bustech.htm
Although he would advise tou against using the coilovers as a raising solution mail VanMan(-at-)baja.com & although this is an Australian site, he may be able to give you some hints as to some manufacturers or suppliers or at least bus owners in Australia who use them so you can find out what they are using.
Anyhow, let me know how you go because I'm putting a single cab back on the road & want to raise it a little without spending too much since I live in the country & it would look pretty cool ;-)
Best of luck.
:-)
Cheers
