As I said in the first post I wrote, I just purchased a 70 van. What should I 
look for in the motor before I leave for the 1000 mile trip? What tricks 
should I perfrom to make sure the engine is up to par? How often should I 
stop and check the oil, or anything on the engine?

Thanks for the help....

Rustin,
(70) van....first VW
