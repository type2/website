Subject: Since my engine's out anyway...

Since my engine is already out of my 71 for a fuel tank replacement, I have decided to go ahead and replace all the clutch components.  In the clutch kits I have found, most include a "pilot bearing".  Question: Is this the same animal as the needle bearings found inside the gland nut, or is it alltogether different?  If different, how do you R&R (remove & replace) this pilot bearing.  If the same, should I just get a new gland nut with the pilot bearing already installed?  BTW, 71 bus with 1600 DP engine.
