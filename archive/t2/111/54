Subject: lotsa smoke

I took my bus down to the shop today as I dont have
time to pull it apart.
Blowing lotsa smoke... came on pretty quickly with no
nasty noises. The Tailpipe is wet with oil.
Those are the symptoms. I will pass on the diagnosis
as soon as I get... I get to go down and help some as
time permits... good learning experience.

As a side note the mech./owner has a type3 engine
completly
rebuilt. Plug and drive.. as it has everything on it..
carbs... etc etc. $500.oo.
  If you are in the SEATTLE area look up
Friedel's in RENTON, Wa. in the yellow pages if
interested. He probably wont ship it.
  I have known this guy for 20 years...factory trained
German mech... good people.
