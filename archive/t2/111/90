Subject: Engine bearing sets, Wich brand?

Hello list,

Lately I have been seeing quite a few different brands
of "German" engine bearing sets on a certain auction
site. The ending prices of these bearings is usually
way lower than German bearing sets found from
retailers. What german brand should I go with when
looking for bearing sets for my bus? I am just trying
to cut costs with out cutting quality. Using auction
sights is risky at best but I am just keeping my eyes
open. Thanks so much for any information about the
subject that you can give!

Have a great day!
