Well as many people on the list know, I use a wheelchair, my chair has
high presure tires on all wheels.  I have to go no matter what, get an
occasional flat.  sitting on the curb in my suit fixing a flat is a
bummer, so I have tried just about everything, and I have seen the inside
of the tires and tubes....it sticks to everything I have had to throw away
good tires and once a rim because that stuff would not come off so that a
new tire could seal on the rim..
