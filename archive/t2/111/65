Subject: '72 Westie cracked engine block

Hello there~

Does anybody have any idea how much I should sell my bus for?  It is a 1972 Westfalia in pretty good condition.  Walk-through, pop-top, all original interior (working sink, refrigerator, fold-down bed, etc.)  Minimal rust on body but a lot underneath.  The engine block is *cracked*.  =(  I broke it while tightening the bolt too hard on the oil screen.  From what I understand the interior parts of the engine need to be taken out and put into a new block.

I have no clue what it's worth now that the engine is screwed up.  It's a very nice bus, but needs a new block.

Thanks,
Suzanna
