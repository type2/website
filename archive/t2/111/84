purge the oil? i can't imagine how. If this guy wasn't smart enough to
assume that VW knew what they were doing w/ the engine seal I wouldn't
trust his diagnosis. You could try and drain the oil (if any) that's
in there now & then fill it up again. disconnect the coil & see if it
turns over & any oil comes gushing from somewhere. I would start
there. If that worked great & no problem, might want to try and see if
it starts.

If this guy ran the motor w/out oil for any length of time I imagine a
quick start to see if it runs wouldn't hurt it anymore than it is
already. good luck.
