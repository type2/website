Sage advise, ladies and gents.  I kept the stuff to prevent roadside
tire repair, or replacement.  No fun bangin' lugnuts on the side of the
road!  My usual MO was to use fix-a-flat to get off the highway, replace
the tire with a spare in a friendly parking lot, air out the fix-a-flat
tire, and keep on truckin'.  I knew tire busters had a severe aversion
(for good reason) to repairing tires with the stuff inside, hence the
airdown on my part.  

Looks like I'll be taking a look at my battle plan again, minus the fix-a-flat!
 Pre-slimed tires might be the ticket, to prevent the flat all together.
 I use Slime on all of the family bikes and bike trailer.  Of course,
they don't see freeway speeds ('cept on the bike rack).

Thanks,
