Nope, the only reason people use bug mufflers is to cheap out, not for fit
or performance. The type 2 muffler exhausts to the side to put nasty
combustion byproducts in the slipstream and away from the inside of your
car. Bus =shaped like brick
+bug muffler=co thru leaky hatch seals. Also depending on year, to make em
fit finds you bending either the muffler or rear apron. Or worse, cutting
the apron and being cursed for all eternity , joining the DPO league. If you
must cheap out, at least throw on a QP extractor.
