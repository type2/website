Subject: [T2] Gaskets on the head of a VW motor (was: Should I buy?)

As far as I know, there are three different gaskets on the head of a VW
motor...

Intake manifold gasket - T1 SP motors have a copper ring
                         T1 DP motors have a thin sheet-metal gasket,
                            probably mild steel sheet
                         T4 carb engines have a thin sheet-metal gasket,
                            probably also mild steel sheet
                         T4 FI engines have a fiber/bakelite-looking
                            sandwich

"head" gasket -          T1 motors did not have any gasket for the longest
                            time, then acquired one with the 1600DP
                            (sometimes, Bentley says... I ain't seen it)
                         T4 motors *always* have a thin metal gasket
                            (aluminum or mild sheet steel) (tho I have
                            seen motors assembled w/o) (always in junkyards)

Exhaust gasket -         T1 had a sheet metal/asbestos sandwich
                         T4 '72-78 (oval port) have an oval copper gasket
                         T4 '79-83 (square port) goes back to the sheet
                           metal/asbestos sandwich

On T4 head gaskets, when you get a set of rebuilt heads, you will usually
get two sets of gaskets that are different diameters.  One pair is to seal
the head to the cylinder, the other is a shim that goes between the base
of the cylinder and the case to make up for material that was removed from
the inside of the head during flycutting.
