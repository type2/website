I am not a snake oil kind of guy, but the dealer recomended Chevron Techron injector cleaner for my Acura's rough idle. Seemed to do the trick, so I figured what the hey, through a bottle in the bus too. Well, preliminary numbers show a 20-25% increase in fuel economy after one bottle. I was pretty surprised...
