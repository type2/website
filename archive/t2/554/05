A brand new rebuild should NOT be leaking anything.

OTOH: With a brand new rebuild, the first several hundred miles can show gas
passing the rings until the rings seat in the cylinders. Particularly when
the engine is choked/cold. There was a great writeup by a motorcycle engine
builder that said to run the engine hard immediately after a rebuild - The
exact opposite of most new engine break-in instructions. Something about the
high cylinder pressure forcing the rings out of the piston notches and
against the cylinders. And since a properly built engine will not have any
metal-to-metal contact points on the bearings, this kind of makes sense.

I'd immediately change the oil and see if new leaks have that smell. Also
pull the dipstick and see if the crankcase smells of gas.

As for the leak, I'd talk to the rebuilder.
