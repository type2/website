Very good advice! And now I tell what was wrong when my 76 Westfalia did 
something very much the same. I considered the condition to be very 
dangerous and I stopped driving the bus until it had been evaluated and fixed.

I suggest that you browse to http://www.bustedbus.com/  and pull down the 
menu under the word SHOP, which is in the upper left corner of the home 
page. Click on category FRONT AXLE-STEERING.  Then sequentially click on 
all the sub-categories that are offered, starting with FRONT AXLE BEAM. 
Look at all the diagrams, study them, and then look for similar parts under 
your bus. My problem was mainly in the STEERING BOX.

I replaced the entire front axle during the next year, because rust had 
also damaged the axle shoulders that allow it to be bolted to the chassis. 
I suspect that the same parts should be carefully examined on your bus, 
along with the others mentioned by other writers.
