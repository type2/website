Subject: RE: [T2] Coil connection mixup 

Phil, [and all who responded] thanks for this hint: "I would think that 
rusty valves seats and rings are your biggest problem after inspecting the 
ignition system and replacing the bad parts."

OK, the rings and valves.  I can go with that. Should I use some of the 
Marvel Mystery Oil in the spark plug holes?? There was a fresh, new bottle 
in the VW.

I should start making a list of things that go bump in the night, or could 
be the source of my power loss!!  This is definitely a list topper.

*** compression check

I set the dwell to 50 degrees, and the timing came in at a perfect 7.5 BTDC. 
  the vacuum read 15" after I changed out all the 3.5mm vacuum hose 
connections.  I thought I was good to go.  (The previous owner, who got it 
from the owner who had it in 15 years storage said he replaced the points 
and condenser.  I believe him.  He could not get it started because of a bad 
FI fuel pump.)

"We" replaced all the fuel lines and fuel injectors, along with the fuel 
pump and filter.   It started up pretty much in 60 seconds.  (Of course the 
oil was removed/replaced with a mixture, and the gas was replaced with 2 
gals of fresh gas).  . Fuel pressure reached 32 psi and leveled off, then 
went down and leveled off at 20 psi after engine was turned off.  We drove 
it 5 feet forward, and then that was it.

We replaced the fuel injectors, and I have had some experience with a fuel 
injector slipping out of its seat and causing a noticeable vacuum leak.  So, 
even with 14" of vacuum,

*** Check for vacuum leaks. -loss of power

*** Check that I am getting an adequate timing advance with RPM  increase

*** Check vacuum readings as RPMs accelerate, make sure needle is solid.

The points and condenser are OK, but I cannot vouch for the spark plugs.  I 
did get a set of Bosch W8CO plugs in the pile of goodies, along with the 
original wires and distributor, so I expect those were replaced.

*** I will check the plugs as we do the compression check.

*** Check the spark plug spark for properly ignition going to the spark 
plugs.

*** Replace the coil with a known good one.  Or, slap it in my daily driver 
and see how that hound hunts!! [test coil resistance between 1 and 15, 1 and 
4, 15 and 4 - like I know what I'm talking about!!]

*** Check valves [there should be eight, right??  << humor]

*** Make sure the condenser and points are new

***  [[[make sure the emergency brake is off!!]]]  << this was my 
co-worker's comment, but it really could be something just as obscure.

Gosh, everything seems to be just a simple test, and I/we should find the 
problem in just  an hour or two, right?!?!?
