Folks(Terry?),

How do you tell the difference between "regular" paint and 
the basecoat/clearcoat type paint.

Let's say you have a bus that you want to "polish" and you need to pick 
the correct polish depending on whether it is "regular" paint or 
clearcoat/basecoat.

Why is clearcoated paint supposed to be so much better?

If it's clearcoat, why do you need to polish it?...obvious answer, but I 
am looking for the "scientific" reason.


Cheers, dave
