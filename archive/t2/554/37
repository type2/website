Subject: Moday Quiz (Camshaft)

Fellow Listees I propose a quiz.

I have split two 2.0L engines to build my very own Frankenengine. In the 
midst I have found something confusing and would like to know what I have 
here.

Given:

     Engine A '79, history unknown, basically a short block w/ Pistons & 
Cyls., "Hydraulic Lifters" Camshaft Gear reads Replaces 021.109.111.

     Engine B '78, history unknown, long block, Pushrods for Solid Lifters, 
"Solid Lifters", and the Cam Gear reads 021.109.111.

     Both Cams side by side look identical I have not put a Mic. to them so 
actual measurements can not be stated.

QUIZ:

1. What the F(-at-)##?!!!!

2. Could the numbers associated be for replacement gears? Is there such a 
thing?

3. Are the differences in Hyd. and Solid Lifter Cams able to be seen by the 
naked eye?

4. Is there a tell tale sign to go by to determine what Camshafts I have?

5. Anyone out there have pics of the two or either one so I can see the 
shape of the lobes?

Thanks for participating,
