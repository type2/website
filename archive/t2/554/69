Tough question to answer Dave--and if you don't know--you won't.

I can say this---most all vehicles for the last 15--20 years are base
coat / clear coated from the factory
( depends on who's Vehicle it is too--my 86 BMW is )
But, for an untrained eye this is how I would suggest determining what
you have.

Take some rubbing compound--a little bit on a rag with your index finger
doing the rubbing.

On the bottom of the vehicle--or in some obscure place do a little
rubbing.
If color comes off on the rag--it's straight paint--if it's clear--you
are dealing with a base coat finish.

Polish and wax are two different animals too--
Polish removes a small amount of oxidation--and leaves no protective
barrier--

Wax does.

The best laboratory for a waxes durability is on the front fiberglass
deck of my boat.

I have cases of all kinds of miracles in a can--and most of them pooped
out in a weeks time.
I could tell this by simply washing the boat when I get there on the
weekend.
No beading--junk wax.
And this was in a weeks time.

I found this stuff called Liquid Crystal, which beaded up on the
fiberglass for 2--3 months--I was happy.

It is no longer available.

The stuff I'm using now--and it gives me the same performance is Rain -X
wax.

Easy on--easy off--and beads up for the same amount of time.

Polish is polish--wax is wax.

It all has petroleum distillates in it--(mineral sprits) and either some
carnuba, some cleaner's, or wax.

The pigmented paint and the clear coat won't know the difference,
( this is where the propagada thing came from )

Tell me about this "Show Car" stuff

Adios,

TK




Terry, 
It looks 3 feet deep cause the surface is smooth, smoother, smoothest! 
Ok, propaganda maybe....but! 
This polish is *not* what you see on the store shelf, but "show car
polish" and it looks....well...10 feet deep after putting just one coat
on. I try and look at the actual paint, and can't get my eyes to focus
on it...all I can see is whatever is being reflected. It is also the
easiest stuff to put on and polish off that I have *ever* encountered(40
yrs of polishing cars). :-)) 
The deal is, they sell(for the exact same price) a bottle for clearcoat
and a bottle for "regular" paint. 
So, my question remains, how can I walk up to one of my cars and
say...oh, this is "clearcoat"...or oh, that is "regular" paint for the
ones that I didn't have painted myself. 
Cheers, dave

Dave, 
The polish / wax propaganda " made for Clear coat finish" is just
that--propaganda. 
<snip> 
Clear also gives the paint finish--"Depth" 
So the paint looks 3 ft. deep when wet sanded and rubbed out. 
Why ?
