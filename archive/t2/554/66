Terry,

It looks 3 feet deep cause the surface is snooth, smoother, smoothest!

Ok, propaganda maybe....but!  

This polish is *not* what you see on the store shelf, but "show car 
polish" and it looks....well...10 feet deep after putting just one coat 
on.  I try and look at the actual paint, and can't get my eyes to focus on 
it...all I can see is whatever is being reflected.  It is also the easiest
stuff to put on and polish off that I have *ever* encountered(40 yrs of 
polishing cars).  :-))

The deal is, they sell(for the exact same price) a bottle for clearcoat 
and a bottle for "regular" paint.

So, my question remains, how can I walk up to one of my  cars and 
say...oh, this is "clearcoat"...or oh, that is  "regular" paint for the 
ones that I didn't have painted myself.


Cheers, dave
