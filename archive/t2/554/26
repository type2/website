Hi Jamey,

I have a 2.0L 76 Westy with a Weber DFEV 32/36 two barrel progressive 
carburetor (compliments of the previous owner).  It is not known as a 
very fuel efficient carburetor so 17.3 is on the high side of my 
mileage.  It sounds like you're doing pretty well.  We bus drivers 
sometime forget that we are pushing a vehicle shaped like a Kleneex box 
through the air.
