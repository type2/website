Michael,

I'm not sure that there is such a book as these were installed(usually) at 
the port of entry by mechanics who did almost nothing else.

Basically, you have a compressor with two hoses coming from the front 
ofthe bus.

The compressor is mounted to a metal "frame" which is then mounted onto
the fan shroud.  

You should be able to unbolt the compressor(4? bolts on the bottom) and 
then twist it enough to "unhook" it from the fan belt to get it off off 
the metal mount.  Carefull when it comes off at it is very heavy.

What happens next depends on whether it is a total uninstall(and destroy)
or you intend to keep it.

Fan belt goes to a pulley behind the fan inside the fan shroud.  You 
can just cut the belt and remove it without touching anything else if it 
is a remove and destroy mission.

You *will* need to fab up some body metal that was cut out, and replace 
some sheet metal tin if you are removing it forever.

More info if necesary...

Cheers, dave
