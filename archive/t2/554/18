As you know, these engines originally came from the factory with paper seals
at the bottom of the cylinder and head shims between the top of the cylinder
and the head.  VW changed this configuration - you have the URL - to
eliminate the top shim and put all shims below the cylinder.  I'd assume the
rebuilder supplied you with top shims so the engine wouldn't have to be torn
down too far to fix the issue at hand.  My GUESS - based on my own
experience - is that using top shims isn't the end of the world and many
engines served out their useful lives with these shims in place.  Probably
the later setup is somehow "better", I'm just not sure how much better.

Shims in a variety of thicknesses are available from the online vendors and
VWFLAPS.  Seal the shims with Permatex or something similar, no paper
gaskets.

It depends on what you find in there when you pull the engine apart.  The
safest route is to get a compression cut on both sealing surfaces, with the
amount of material removed measured and compensated for with shims.

Given the fact that there's no published specifications that I've ever found
that definitively set forth important dimensions on these engines such as
deck height and combustion chamber volume, and given that things get even
murkier when you're using remanufactured components, and since you're
committed to tearing down the engine to the extent of removing the
cylinders, I'd suggest cc'ing the heads and carefully measuring deck height
(no shims) and *calculating* what shims are needed to make the CR correct.
