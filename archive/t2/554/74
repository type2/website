Like other that have commented, replace coil if needed and I would run a
compression check on the engine to get a better idea on what condition it's
in.
Sitting that long, your rings are more then likely not seated anymore and
valve springs could be compressed and not working properly.
Other gremlins could have eaten the bearings depending on how it was put to
sleep for 15 years. (old oil left in the engine).
I would think that rusty valves seats and rings are your biggest problem
after inspecting the ignition system and replacing the bad parts.

Good luck & Have Fun!

Hello.  On a '76 FI 2000 Calif model w/standard trans and w/air conditioning

-

What would be the implications if the coil was connected back-a$$ward.  That

is, the wires that should go to the + were connected to the -, and the wires

that were connected to the - were connected to the +.

This conditioned only existed for a short while, like 5 minutes of 
unsuccessful cranking, and 5 minutes of idle.

The VW runs now, but verl sluggish, with a max speed on the level of 42 mph.

  It has not run for the past 15 years, so I am kind of happy to get this 42

mph (on the level ground).

Thanks
