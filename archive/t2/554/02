Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Shipping a bus

I bought my bus on Ebay 3 years ago and had it shipped from there shipping
station in Az. to my house in Virginia for $800. The company was affiliated
with Ebay, I cannot remember the name. I was very happy with the service and I
was able to track it online as it came across the US. It did not take long
either.
