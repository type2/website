Seemed to do the trick, so I figured what the hey, through a bottle in the bus too. Well, preliminary numbers show a 20-25% increase in fuel economy after one bottle. I was pretty surprised...

What before and after numbers do you have to report?

The techron in the concentrate is 10x the concentration that goes into their gasoline. According to Chevron it's also a mild octane booster which gives you that vroom feeling of satifaction that $6 was well spent. When my wife's Acura starts to ping at high rpms a bottle of concentrate cures it as soon as I leave the gas station with a bottle poured in the tank before the fill up. The symptoms don't return for many oil changes down to road. This engine has 70k miles.

With the bus, I haven't notice a much of a difference. My engine was in excellent running order that last time I used it.
