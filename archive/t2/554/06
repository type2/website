well i am not sure about the simliarities between a motorcycle engine and a vw air cooled......? i am not a rebuilder and havent ever had the privaledge of learning such material..... but i do however believe that there is something wrong here,...~!~ No matter my knowledge i would not think there should be anything leaking from a new engine either..
exspecially oily gas smell light covered liquid substance,...? checked dipstick and well smells pretty stout of gas to me...? let wife smell it and she said "is that gas " without me telling her what was on the dipstick.... told her smell this oil... see what it smells like..... there is no rise on the dipstick either,... when i first crank it though there seems to be a slight height to the dipstick of maybe a 1/4 of a qaurt but after she gets runnning and you check it throughout the day it is right on the line.....of level on the dipstick....
sometime the oil on the dipstick is real dark and other times it is real light??????????
 
 
only seems to be dripping while sitting..? making a v pattern across the carport floor from under the pushrod tubes tin just off and around the bottom of the case ;
 after a overnight or extended sit...? this is only a recent thing....? like maybe past day or 2... started noticing it..
 
having problems getting the engine to start now also when i first crank it for the day....~!~
 
as far as the fan pulley it shouldnt have a warped look to its revolutions should it....?
any other i have seen were spinning with a even spin to them i thought..?
 
Also something is killing my batteries it seems.. i am switching off 2 diffrent batteries that now both seem to have bad cells in them...? one was brand new..
where should i start looking for whats killing them...? checked alternator and its running 14 amps looks like i think it was~!~
 
 
thanks for your help...
peace

A brand new rebuild should NOT be leaking anything.

OTOH: With a brand new rebuild, the first several hundred miles can show gas
passing the rings until the rings seat in the cylinders. Particularly when
the engine is choked/cold. There was a great writeup by a motorcycle engine
builder that said to run the engine hard immediately after a rebuild - The
exact opposite of most new engine break-in instructions. Something about the
high cylinder pressure forcing the rings out of the piston notches and
against the cylinders. And since a properly built engine will not have any
metal-to-metal contact points on the bearings, this kind of makes sense.

I'd immediately change the oil and see if new leaks have that smell. Also
pull the dipstick and see if the crankcase smells of gas.

As for the leak, I'd talk to the rebuilder.
