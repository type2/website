Here is what one of my heads on my 79 looked like.

you can make out the lighter band where the mating surface is. It's
not completely round. It is supposed to be :) That elipse is where the
head ring had managed to move to. I'm pretty sure that any of the list
vendors carry them. There was a VW tech bulletin that talks about
removing the gaskets and making up the difference below the barrels. I
can't put my hands on it right now, perhaps someone else has the url

I have had good results with this method.
