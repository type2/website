Wow, that's a Deluxe (fridge + stove + sink).  I'd say it's worth it 
just for the interior and a rebuild'able/core'able engine.  Even with 
the bad 4th gear, the transmission might be core'able (or at least 
partially), too.

I'm a little concerned looking at the engine photo ... looks like there 
is some sheet metal missing.

Too bad the FI is missing.

Still, could be a fantastic parts bus opportunity for someone.
