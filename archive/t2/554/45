the numbers cast into the gear are not the camshaft part numbers. all the
cams use the same gear, although i seem to recall there being more than one
part number for the gear (not speaking here of the -/+ number stamped into
the edge of the gear) the stock cams have no numbers anywhere except for
casting numbers which are not all that helpful, as they just indicate info
about the blank, nothing about how it was ground.

yes:

you can see the difference clearly, the hydro cam has a more curved lobe -
more shallow ramp angle.

the only thing you can easily see is if the cam was meant for auto trans, it
has a ring cast around the center. i seem to recall there being cams with
two rings and ones with one ring, but i might be mistaken.
