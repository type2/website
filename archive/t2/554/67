Subject: Re: [T2] compression ratios and making engines last

Hoover recommends not higher than 7.3:1
Berg recommends 6.6:1 for 87 octane, 6.9:1 for 91 octane and higher.


Doesn't Raby get relatively HUGE compression ratios in his engines? 9's and 10's? 

Just curious. I'd like to reach the 100 HP mark in my Beetle with a Type IV.
