Subject: Front brush guard

Is there anything like a brush guard (sort of a crash bar) for '77 bays?

I've been casually looking at some designed for pickups, but wasn't too sure
that any of them would bolt onto the existing frame.

We should be getting Giacomo back from the mechanic this week (whahoohoo!),
and I've been thinking about beefing up the front to help in low speed
impacts (broken legs not appreciated...)

Thanks.
