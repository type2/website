Subject: TheSamba & Everett B get some recognition

I am surprised this has not come up yet, but did
everyone see that theSamba.com was highlighted in the
latest VW Trends magazine and awarded "Best VW-Related
Web Site" at their Annual awards ceremony.  I know
there are mixed feelings about VW Trends, but whether
you like the mag or not, you can't argue that they
finally got something right!! Kudos, Everett! It is
some well-deserved recognition for a GREAT VW site.
