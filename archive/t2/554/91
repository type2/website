"Michael, are you talking about under the front pedals?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No I was talking about the Middle between Front and Rear Tires. I did not 
even look at the front to see if there was one there. Most of the time I 
have looked or worked on this bus has been the AssEnd. Should there be one 
on the front? I will have to check it out when I get home.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
