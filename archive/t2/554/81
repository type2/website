"The most important part is to change out the "dryer" and make sure that
you get all of the system "vacuumed" before recharging it."

Would this be a new dryer of the same or change out with a different type of 
dryer? Is the one you are getting the "rotary" type or more like a NOS?

Also a bit off the path same topic:

My bus does not have a Belly Pan. Is this because of the Dryer?

Thanks,
