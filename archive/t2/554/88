Subject: Molding for roof panel

Hello all,



I am looking for the molding that goes around the hole in the roof of a
1970 Westfalia.  Ya know the stuff that helps holds the wood paneling up
above the rear seat.  The paneling and/or the molding have shrunken over
the years and no longer make contact so that the panel is sagging badly.
Can I get something that'll work at the local hardware store?



Thanks- Asaph
