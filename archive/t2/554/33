Subject: 68-71 mustache bar holes

Question: What to do about a stripped hanger(mustache) bar mount?

Bus: 1971

Apparently the threads are stripped on one of the three holes where the 
mustache bar bolts to the case on my friend's 1971 bus. (I am not sure 
which hole)

As I'll be pulling the engine to help him fix some problems on his bus, I 
am entertaining ideas on what to do about this.  I'm considering placing a 
thread insert in the stripped hole.  Does this sound like a reasonable 
solution?  Do I just go one size up?

Thanks,
	Tom
