Michael,

The dryer is the cylindr(most likely in the driver's side front wheel 
well.  Should be availabel from almost any FLAPS.  You probably have a 
hole in the body righ over where it is mounted as there is a glass "view 
port" in the top of it so that the installer could watch for when all of 
the "air" bubbles where out of the system.

You need some basic background first...like here

Dryer=accumulator in the above site.

Condenser is what is under the bus(and gets hot).
Evaporator is what is inside the bus and gets cold(hopefully).

Compressor pumps the freon around the loop.

Standard buses did not come with a belly pan to my knowledge unless they 
had a heater installed or were sunroof's.

Cheers, dave
