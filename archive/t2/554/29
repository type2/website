Subject: Stuck slider '79

Well, I've removed the inner panel and all hardware I can get to,
tweaked, pried, tried various combinations and nothing is giving...

Thought I could remove the striker plate, but the bottom bolt is too
long, Won't unscrew all the way without bottoming out against the lock
assembly.

Bently is no help - they assume you have the door open - mine is stuck
shut.

Any magic formula to get this puppy open so I can remove the lock/latch
assembly?

Grrr!
