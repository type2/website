Dave,
The polish / wax propaganda " made for Clear coat finish" is just
that--propaganda.

Here's the deal.

Base coat is the color---
And the clear goes over that.

Why?

Simple.

The sun cooks the pigment's color outa the paint if it's getting a
direct blast from the sun after a period of time--

Now--if you have a barrier coat of clear over the color--the sun's UV
rays can't get to the pigment, or at least slow the degenerating process
down.

Clear also gives the paint finish--"Depth"

So the paint looks 3 ft. deep when wet sanded and rubbed out.

Why ?
