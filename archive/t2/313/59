Folks,

A buddy of mine in the local club is going to look at a "bus" that the guy 
claims is the last year for an aircooled(83 vanagon?).  He is not well 
versed in buses, and I am not a vanagon kinda guy.  The price is right and 
the engine and trans are claimed to be good.

Any of the engine and trans parts good for 79 and earlier?

I can't imagine that any of the body parts except maybe for the front 
seats would be anywhere close, but I haven't really looked at a Vanagon in 
a looooong time.


Cheers, dave
