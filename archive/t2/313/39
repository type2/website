Hi Eric,

Indeed, welcome to the list!

On your second trip to the FLAPS (Friendly Local Auto Parts Supplier) 
you may want to check out some tires. If your bus isn't already running 
with Load C or D rated 185/14's with dual-ply sidewalls you will 
sincerely appreciate this upgrade, it makes a huge improvement in 
handling. Ray Nemo wrote a great tire FAQ following a long thread here 
on tires, it's available at: 
http://www.geocities.com/nemobuscaptain/tires.html

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
