Subject: PCV Valve Check?

My 1979 CA Westy has been having problems with a uneven idle (both cold and 
warm).  I've been going around the engine and replacing vacuum lines.  Right 
now, everything looks pretty good (FIs are properly seated in their holes, 
etc.).  One thing I'm looking at now is the positive crankcase ventilation 
(PCV) valve.  I've searched the archives and could not find anything solid 
about the PCV valves.

Does anyone have any information on the reliability of these valves or know 
of a way to check the valve to see if it's leaking unmetered air from the 
outside?  My plan is to disconnect and plug the vacuum line between the 
s-duct and valve to see if the problem goes away.

Thanks,

Bob
