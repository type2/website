Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter Access

Changing the fuel filter is easy and you definitely don't have to drop the
engine to do it. You should actually get the proper 5mm metric fuel hose and
replace all your fuel hoses immediately, they are an extreme fire hazard.
You must verify that there is a grommet around the steel fuel pipe that goes
throught the front engine tin. If no grommet, replace the fuel pipe and
grommet.
The engine stumbled and died? Possibly your points rubbing block has worn
down and the point gap has closed up. Time for a general tuneup, including:
New fuel hoses front to back.
New fuel filter.
New spark plugs
New Plug wires
New distributor cap
New Rotor
New Points
New Condenser
(All electrical parts should be Bosch)
Attention to the carb if necessary.
Adjust your valves- this is extremely important!!
Oil change to 20W50, or 15W40(subject to debate and opinion).Clean the
screen.
