Keep an eye on those new brushes.  If they wear fast you might have to
turn the commutator.  That was my experence after running about 100 miles
on bad brushes.  The arcing roughed up the commutator rather badly.  I
ended up converting to an alternator, but if you turn the commutator the
generator will be good as new.
