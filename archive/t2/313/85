Subject: Source for Vacuum hoses/tubing?????

Hi all:

I understand the two elements making up the vacuum distribution system in
the engine compartment of the air-cooled Vanagons are:

N 020 353 5 which is the fabric-covered sleeve and
N 020 139 1 which is the plastic tubing.

Anybody know of a source for this stuff?  None of the usual on-line vendors
seem to carry these items, or at least I'm not finding it.

Also, when I read "3,5x2" next to the plastic tubing and "4x1" next to the
fabric-covered hose, what are these numbers referring to?

TIA.
