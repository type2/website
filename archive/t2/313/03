Well, thanks for the link Paul! That is the kind of info i was looking 
for!!!
So does this theory:
http://www.frostalarm.com/cat/dp52.html
aply to my/our VDO Sender probe?

That could explain my high reading those pass few days (-22C / -5F)

At which temperature the VDO sender is calibrated? 70F, 59F (15C). 15C 
is the international calibration for airplane stuff!

If i retract 30 to 40F to my 410-420F i would be in range at 380F

Cheers, Ben
