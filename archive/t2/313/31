Craig,

7.0 sounds a little low(depends on what you built it for), but should be 
ok.

From the text on the web site, sounds like the geometry on the valve
train was slightly off.  90.5 pistons?  I believe that aircooled.net will 
sell you individual p&c.

When I rebuilt my T1 some years ago with 90.5's, I had to really work on 
the valve train geometry to get it right.

Cheers, dave
