The family and I took our 67Sundial down to BBBVII
from Reno NV (1216 miles round trip) with the only
problem being the generator brushes going out at our
first gas stop on the way down. I managed to get them
working off and on until somewhere around Beatty. We
drove the Bus the last 300 miles to Lake Havasu City
on batteries. I did get a set of new brushes in and
that solved that problem!

Just by chance, there were three other Sundial campers
parked next to mine! We had ourselves a mini Sundial
gathering. So cool!

I think this was the best BBB yet! Thanks to all of
the Havasu people who have put in so much time and
effort into making this event one that any Bus driver
should not miss.
