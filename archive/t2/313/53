Subject: RE:Hockey stick bushing

Hey all, I browsed bus depot's online catalog and found the following in the 
transmission parts section.
Front gearshift bushing 001 301 209 $2.95
Rear gearshift bushing  001 301 207 $2.49

Would these by any chance be the hockey stick bushings that we've all been 
reading about lately?
