The curb weight of the camper is more but the carrying weight of the
commercial vehicles is higher.  As was noted, the passenger Busses
(including the campers) got radial tires as standard equipment around
that time.  This is also covered in Without Guesswork, the pocket
reference for VW mechanics.

While we're on the subject I'd like to note that the recommended bias
tires have a different diameter (larger) than the recommended radials. 
When I was tire shopping for my Adventurewagen I set my sites on finding
tires with this larger diameter (26.1 inches) and ended up buying 205/75
14 light truck tires from Firestone.  The difference at highway speeds
is remarkable.  My Bus is more stable on windy days.  The slightly lower
rpms seem to me to be comparable with my other VWs so I don't feel like
its winding out at 65.  And, I think my speedo is now more accurate so
when it says 65 mph only 3/4 of the people are passing me instead of the
95 percent that I was previously used to.  A friend of mine with a split
window Bus got similar tires and has noted the same benefits.  Now, I
have not driven much in Busses with Type 4 engines so there may be
differences in perceptions with those newer Busses.  But I strongly
recommend the 205s on '71 and earlier Busses.
