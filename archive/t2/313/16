Subject: DONT FORTGET THE SIMPLE THINGS

Hi people,

I am responding to some of my own problems that seem to have been solved.I
have a 72 van.
For the last while I have been having some backfiring at deceleration and my
van
wouldn't idle fast enough when I was waiting at lights and the engine would
die.
I was looking at the engine last week and decided to check the tightness of
the bolts that hold
the carberators down (I have the dual carbs). Upon inspection the bolts were
loose, I could tighten them a
couple of turns! After this there was no backfiring and it even has a nice
steady idle when I'm waiting at lights.
This was quite a big vacuum leak and I would never have guessed it could be
something so simple.
My advise: dont forget the simple things. I would still like to adjust the
idle screw slightly.
Thanks for all the help.
Darren
