Greetings all --

This weekend I put a bilge fan in to boost the cfm of my heating..works great, but a little noisy.  Anyway, during the installation, I had pulled away the fuse panel to get at the rear, and I noticed a spade connector that had broken.  From the bend in the wire, I deduced that it connected to the shiny relay (1 of 2) that connect to the bottom of the fuse panel.  I clamped on a new spade connector and reinstalled the wire.  I connected my bilge fan to fuse #9, which is from the battery (doesn't need ignition on).  So...when I take the bus for a spin around the block, I notice the alternator light is glowing faintly.  The next morning...the engine will turn over, but doesn't start.  I charge the battery overnight.  Starts right up, but the alt light still glows.  When I rev the engine, the alt light flickers brightly.  The belt is tight.  I test voltage at the regulator and get 12.2.  I test voltage at the coil and get 6.5 to 7.3.  Additionally, the right turn signal blinks very quickly.  The left blinks normally.  I think the voltage regulator is faulty.  What do you think?

Thanks,

Charles
