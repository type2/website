Subject: Last Transporters by the Tunnel?

Hi all.

I was just looking at the flyer for Transporters by the Tunnel on the LIMBO
website.
It stated that this year is the last one! Anybody know why? I have attended
this event
 for the past two years (That's how long I've had a bus that runs) and it is
great!
