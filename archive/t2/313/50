Siping is not always an add on,, it is available from the factory on specific
tires,, 
http://www.1010tires.com/tire.asp?tirebrand=Yokohama&tiremodel=S401

it is outlawed for some classes of ice racers as it increases the traction
tremendously,

as the tires that are available for our buses are not available sipped,, then if
you so chose to drive in the ice,, then this is very worthwhile , and these
tires are not generally used on dry pavement,  a lot like chains , when the
weather changes, you change the tires. 

I used to race with BF Goodrich as a sponsor,, and they siped the tires they
gave me,, I never got into the physics of heat, and longevity though,, siping
did make a difference 
that is the way I see it being done here in Ontario Canada ,,,
