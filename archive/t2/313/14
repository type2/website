Subject: Value of good slider?

Hi all,
    I have the opportunity to sell a really good sliding door that has been 
in my parts stash for years. Wondering if anyone can help me out as to a 
value of a good slider.  This door has no rust, no dents, and has good glass, 
handles, rollers, etc. (Everything except inside panel).  Even has a key to 
go with the lock cylinder.  
       Was taken off of a low mile bus and has been stored indoors ever 
since. 
      Seeing as how we don't have any buses in local yards here, wondering if 
anyone can share what their local yards are getting?  I don't want to rip the 
guy off.

    Thanks
   Brian
