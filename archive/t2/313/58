Volks,

The BFG tires are HUGE! I mean physically large. I have a set of these exact
tires  which are going on a vw thing, but I am not sure about putting them
on a bus. They will fit I suppose, but they will really make your bus look a
bit like a mini monster truck. Maybe that's good! In fact the set I have
were sold to me by a fellow in my local club who refused to put them on his
bus because he felt they were just too big. They are roughly 1" bigger on
the diameter than stock, which doesn't sound like much, but it is.

I would suggest the yokohama 370 LT is a good snow tire, and close to the
original size, but a quick look on tirerack.com and this tire seems to be
NLA. I know we can still get them in canada.
