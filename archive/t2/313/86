Subject: Gennie Eats Brushes WAS Re: [T2] BBBVII

	Gen'l-men:

	Sorry to 'jack the thread (and BBBVII certainly was a treat!), but
when I hear stories of gennies that eat brushes, it makes me hearken back to
the days of mis-spent yout' and salad days (when green in judgment, don't
ya' know!).

	Way back then I was a great fan of things Type 3, and would
periodically find myself replacing brushes.  In one early instance, the
gennie promptly ate the new brushes, and I do mean with in a day or three.
Went grumbling back to the parts house, spewing vitriol, p*ss and vinegar,
clacked at the parts man about how the brushes had worn out in hours.  He
asked me if I had polarized the gennie/brushes on the reinstall.  "Nope,
never did, WTF is that?", replied the yout'.

	He proceeds to tell me about the long and hard way, or the shorter
and easier way - so being the mad,  impetuous yout' I was and may still be,
natcherally I used short 'n easy.  In a nutshell, and assuming the
commutator clean and devoid of booger-osities, good VR and all, you simply
started up the car with a load on freshly installed gennie, courtesy of
having the headlights on.  Never lost a set of brushes to SDS after that...
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

	I KNOW George can probably explain the exact principles involved,
but I always likened it to breaking in the rings - if'n they don't get a
load on them early on in life, they will take forever (and sometimes never)
to seat...  Everything I own these days comes from the factory with an
alternator, so this recollection may well have a dust bunny or two attached
to it.  YMMV!
