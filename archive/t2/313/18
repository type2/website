You can get it done in many tire stores in the northern tier states.
Seems to me that if it was a good idea the manufacturers would do it at
the factory.  I have a feeling that there is a downside in tire wear
(either faster or uneven)

I know that my Bridgestone RD603s are pretty slippary in snow.  My
solution is to avoid snow when I can!  I have a pair of Uniroyal Laredo
all-season that I carry just in case.  I don't recommend them for normal
use, though, as they are too small.
