Subject: "hockey stick transmission bushing"

All this recent talk about shifting problems and how the "hockey stick
transmission bushing" fixed the problem made me start to think that I
should replace mine.  So I put in the keyword of hockey stick
transmission bushing in several online venders and guess what, nothing
comes back as being found to that description.  I'm guessing Volkswagen
had another name or description for it.  If someone could be so kind to
let me know what VW calls it I would appreciate it.
