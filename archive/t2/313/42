Subject: Re: Oil Pressure Light question

Just so everyone knows.  On a 73 ish bus ( forgot to mention that in
original post) the oil pressure sending wire does go to the voltage
regulator.  My problem ended up being a loose wire at the sensor.  Replaced
the connector and all is well..

Day Light helps tremendously when looking for electrical problems..  :)

Thanks for all the replies..

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
