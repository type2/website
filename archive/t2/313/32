Adjust your throttle stops 1/2 turn out (each).  That should decrease the idle, then you can open up the big idle screw to bring the idle speed back up.

While the above is true, the reason for your lack of adjustment range with the big idle screw is that your throttle stops are set too far in, not because of the type of distributor you are running.

Nope, but you're not utilizing the central idling system that way.
