And this is only a part of the story going on right now.  Very reliable
word (please don't ask how I know) is that RMMW is "scheduled" to be out of
Chapter 11 by next Wednesday (Jan 29th) and are in semi-serious talks with
Mid-America Direct (Real Source) about being bought out, closed and
whatever inventory is left (there's some, but not much) is moved to their
place in Effingham, Indiana.  Potential sticking point may be the RMMW
building in Woodland Park, which is for sale at an asking price of $3.8 mil
and Mid-America won't want the property.  So the deal may or may not go.
If it goes, the Bus crowd can forget about this source for parts.

In a separate discussion with those in the know a couple of months back
indicate that Mid-America has NO desire or interest in branching into
Buses/Vanagons within their product line.  MA added K Ghia stuff to their
line-up about year and a half ago with lackluster results, not surprising,
considering their pricing is a bit higher than RMMW, CIP, WCM, etc., so
they're not enthusiastic about expanding to another model (never know, that
could change).  And there's no way Mis America can break into Type 2 parts
with the sort of pricing attitude they have usually had, considering we're
cheep (excuse me, THRIFTY) about maintaining our rides, much more so than
the Corvette, Porsche, New Beetle, Old Beetle, Ghia crowd they currently
cater to .  Hey, we want more "bang" for our buck, right?  Nothin' wrong
with that.

Just passin' along some info..................
