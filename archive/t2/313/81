Subject: I need a bug Help ne1?

Hey everyone,

I know this is a type 2 site but i need some help finding an old Bug.  I am 
looking for 1969 bug that is not restored has a running engin and won't be 
that hard to restore.  I would perfer if it was in Ontario but i will go out 
of the province as far west as Manitoba and as far east as Quebec.  I'd go 
to the U.S but then i'd be getting into the border tax's and stuff and i 
really  don't want to.  I'll have a week in May where i can pick it up and 
pay (i know its far from now but i have to start looking now) it is as a 
gift for someone and they will be away at that time.  So if anyone has a 
friend of family member selling one for cheep but in good condition please 
let me know. Thanks angain everyone.
