Subject: Trip to the Shop

Pumpkin II went to the shop today...usually this only happens at smog time,
but I wanted to verify that my newly cleaned AFM was setup right (It was,
thanks Eric). A couple other things got taken care of while I was there that
might be informative to the less experienced:

1) I needed a new double relay...I've been fighting intermittent high idle
when cold or cool since I've owned the bus. I finally gave up hunting vacuum
leaks and just decided to live with it. Turns out my double relay was doing
everything it was supposed to EXCEPT providing juice to the thermo-time
switch (which I had actually replaced at some point). It's nice to hear the
engine not racing at stoplights now.

2) After my recent rear brake job, the drums ran very hot on the highway.
Several re-adjustments and teardowns didn't help. Turns out this was caused
by my having installed the wrong adjuster screws. I ordered them based on
year model from one of our usual vendors, and they sent me the wrong ones.
There is a slight difference in the angle of the slot; enough to misalign
the pads and cause them to rub on the drum and cook themselves. You wouldn't
notice it unless you knew what to look for though. So compare them to your
old ones, make sure they have the same slot. And check for hot wheels after
doing brake/bearing work; probably saved me a meltdown.
