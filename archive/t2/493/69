Does anyone know where to get replacement plastic inserts ( or whatever their
called) that fit between the main front bumper bar and the two over-riders on
a '69 bus. I've scoured almost all of the junk yards in Southern California
and find that these parts are either missing or badly cut up from collisions.
I have posted notes on several link sites but have not received any responses.
They must be out there somewhere as I see them in mint condition on restored
buses.

Thanks.

Peter.
