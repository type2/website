Subject: RE: [T2] Stub axle

I noticed the same thing when I stripped a dum in a 62 beetle I had due to
my not getting the torque to the requisit 270 foot-lbs.

I have stripped 2 pair of drums on my '69 baja in the woods or on trails.
Each time
I was amazed to see that the axle splines appear to be perfect.  I did have
to knock the remaining metal from the drums out of the splines to get the
new set of drums on...Amazingly hard material those axles are....
