IIRC, buses up to my '71, and perhaps beyond, were equipped with the same
battery as bugs, which is logical considering that the engine and starter
were the same.  It's common to put a group 24 battery in though, as they
fit fine, are much easier to find (and probably fresher) and have a bit
more capacity.

Just about any battery will spin a VW engine just fine.  Group 24s
commonly start 7.4 liter Chevys.  I tend to go on the price per month
ratio, which for Pep Boys seems to max out with their 72 month batteries.
Pep Boys is also pretty good about warranty adjustments,  If the battery
doesn't work, you get an adjustment, no "charging system test" required.
