very simple,  I have one battery in the normal spot, the other battery is
on the other side.  the batteries are wired in parallel using #4 guage
wire across the top of the engine compartment, the regular alterantor does
not seem to have a problem keeping things charged although when I am
starting it alot when hard and not driving far I will put it on charge to
keep it topped up
