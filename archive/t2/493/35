Subject: RE: [T2] battery terminal 

Thanks, Dave, and to all who responded.

Last week my battery in my '78 died.  I had a spare battery from the '72, 
and put that in the '78.  Then I got a replacement battery from Sears.  The 
replacement battery was a type 24.  It had more CCA than a size 42,  and I 
was fat, dumb, and happy.  Emphasis on the DUMB!!

The type 24 battery posts are the reverse of the type 42 battery, at least 
in the basic issue.  I could have gotten a type 24F, which would have the 
reverse posts,and then the same electrical orientation as the type 42.


OK, here is the DUMB part:

I was trying to hook the new battery, type 24 with the opposite electrical 
orientation, to my '72 engine / starter which are out of the '72 and sitting 
in the middle of the garage floor.  Lots of room.


First, I tried using a wire from a home extension cord as a ground wire with 
the type 24. That wire smoked and melted in very short order.

Then I got 'too soon old, and too late smart' amd went to the basic jumper 
cables.

Darn, why am I getting such a strong sparking when I connect the ground 
cable to the bell housing??  It must be because I have such a strong battery 
!!

OK, now why am I getting smoke when I try to start the engine.  Isn't the 
jumper cable heavy enough !?!?!?



Time for a reality check.  I look at the battery, and the '+' mark is where 
the '-' mark should be, and vice versa.

So, that was why I started asking about the electrical orientation of the 
battery posts.  I didn't know if the battery I had in the '78 was the 
correct battery, or this newer type 24.  Obviously, the type 24 was / is 
wrong.

I went back to Sears, and got the correct [smaller] type 42 battery.

Thanks to all.

Keep reading for more 'dumb and dumber' reporting.  I hope my other dumb 
actions will be as benign as this one.
