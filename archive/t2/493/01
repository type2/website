Subject: Re: [T2] battery terminal

Barry,

Original on the ground that way.  The original was also very short and
was constructed the way that most new battery terminals(new cars) are 
constructed.

I think the closest replacement I could find was for one of the Honda 
cars, but it *two* ground connections on it...believe me, I used them both 
in different locations.

I will never buy another battery strap, either positive or negative that 
is made out of the "old" "lead" type stuff.  The new connectors are far 
superior in that way and I recomend the highly.

Cheers, dave
