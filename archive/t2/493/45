I have the twin 950CCA batteries in my bus for three major reasons

.  it is an automatic, you don't push start it!
.  I like to ski and use the bus to get there so I have to crank that baby
up early on bitter cold mornings to get to the slopes on time...plenty of
reserve cranking makes me feel much more secure
.  I can't hike out to get help.
