Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid? New question!!!

There's only one guy to be asking this question --Karl Von Salzen.
He lined me out with the right stuff 3 years ago, and my 74 wth the
hydraulic set up has operated flawlessly--and once the valve adjustment
was dialed in --no more screwing around wih the adjustment
baloney--Done.

The face of the lobes on the cam are covered with stellite--and the
profile between the solid lifter set up and the hydraulic are the same--
If the stellite is still there and in good shape you'd have one hell of
a time tearing that up--regardless of what kind of lifer that's riding
on it--

The push rods are of a different length To compensate for the lifter
construction.

The rocker shafts are different too--so what?
A liitte swap time, and the valve adjustment Mambo is a thing of the
past--Morto--Finito--Arriva Derchi-Hasta Lavista Baby--one less thing to
be thinking about--  

I'm not sure who filled your heads with the hydraulic's won't work
theory---but it's a Witches Brew Gruel tale--

It works just ducky--

Later,

Now that everyone is wound up over the valves, now comes a question. Why
are there a camshaft for hyd lifters when they will work on the solid
lifter camshaft? why are the pushrods a different size? Last can hyd
lifters be put into a case without changing anything? Seems what the
list has said is that hyd lifters can be put into a case without any
problem, I just took it for granted that something was different on the
engines because the camshafts were different, let me know the
truth...Phil
