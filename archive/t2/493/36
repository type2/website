My opinion is that the heads are not trouble prone (the valve seat issue has been largely solved now) but they appear that way to some because of problems created by out-of-adjustment solid lifter valvetrains.

How many people with hydraulics have burnt or broken a valve because it overheated from being too tight?  Anyone?  I ran a set of GEX (GEX!) heads for 45k miles with hydraulics and although the heads were poorly rebuilt they did not fail.  I replaced them with Mark Stephens heads which now have 60k miles on them with no problems.  Trouble-prone?  You won't convince me.
