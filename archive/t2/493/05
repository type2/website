My own experience recently causes me to disagree.

When the stub axles from my passenger side RGB's (splitbus only) ground the inside of my drum velvety smooth it made noises that I assumed could only come from a transmission. Thor's hammer pounding sounds, one after another as each spline in the brake drum was permanently removed. No traces were found.

While begining the teardown, I found the actual culprit as described above. Stub axle splines? 

Beautiful.

They must be harder than hell.
