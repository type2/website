only two things ever really bugged me about owning a VW and that was
constantly having to adjust the valves and points.   I have never had any
real problems with my adjusters bleeding down, but mine is a daily
driver,  so I lovee my hyd and when I rebuilt the engine there was no
discussion, it was hyd for sure and have not regretted it, oh and I also
have a pertronix points eliminator too.  so it's good to go
