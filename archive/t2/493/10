Subject: AIRS camping spot needed in South Dakota, Iowa

I'm pretty sure Amanda stayed with us about 2 years ago heading from Montana to L.A.

Unless there's another girl in a beat '66 camper with 2 dogs making that run!

She travels with some pretty big dogs (yes I know Kristen did too) and she's got quite a bit of mileage logged.

That said, words of wisdom are meritted, and best wishes & safety to all of you this season.

Billy
