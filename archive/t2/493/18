Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

I'm not busting on anyone who has hydraulic lifters and likes 'em, just
pointing out that my solid lifters seem easy to maintain and foolproof,
while some folks have obviously had difficulties with the hydraulics. My
opinion only, not the definitive answer for anyone else. My bus is more of a
hobby anyway, so I don't mind an excuse to go poke around the motor on a
regular basis.

Strange... I can't speak for other people but mine have been pretty much
zero-maintenance since I installed them.  Occasionally when the bus has been
sitting for a LONG time (couple of weeks) I get some clatter at startup but
it always goes away once the motor is warmed up.  Definately not a PITA for
me, compared to the... 35-odd valve adjustments I would have had to do if I
had not had hydraulics.  I prefer driving my bus to lying underneath it.
