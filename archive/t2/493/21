Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

I am rebuilding an engine right now and it was a hydro engine.  After
seeing the flattened lobes and damaged lifters, I decided to switch to
solid lifters/cam.  My thinking is that yes, it requires constant
adjustment, however (due to my lazy nature) it forces me to check my
valves regularly with helps me to quickly identify if there are any
irregularities if adjustments go out of whack.  Plus, the less chance of
having lifters slap against the cam lobes because of drained lifters,
the better (for me, at least).
