*I didnt know who to send this e-mail to, so you're the lucky man. If you 
dont have any advice or know someone else who is more knowledgable on the 
subject, please forward this to them*

I was referred to type2.com by the tech departmen at pelican parts because 
im having trouble with the L-jet fuel injection on my 1974 Porsche 914 1.8, 
and they said you guys would be mor knowledgeable on the subject.

So anyways, here is the problem. Me engine will start with the air intake 
sensor (in front/on top of the air cleaner) UNplugged, but when i plug it 
in, it will not run. Usually if i try to start the engine with the AIS 
plugged in, it will fire a couple times and quit. One time the engine 
actually started but the engine started revving up, and, fearing for the 
life of my newly rebuilt engine, i cut it off. The guys at Pelican suggested 
a massive vaccum leak, and i was wondering if you guys could give me some 
help.

One thing that i am not clear on is whether the air filter must make an 
air-tight seal in the airbox. Mine isnt, so if so this could probably be 
whats causing the problem, in which case i'll just permatex it in place on 
something.

I apologize for the length of my email, but any help would be very much 
appreciated.

Thank you very much
