Same here, dave. I have 40,000 miles on my hydraulics with no trouble at
all. I think maybe 2 or 3 times i have had some clatter on startup, and I
think it always happened when I was parked on a steep angle for a period of
time. Anyway, I have only adjusted them once and that was just to see if
they needed it. (They didn't). Sitting in the driver's seat beats lying
under the engine any day.
