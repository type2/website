Paul,

If the bale is as hard to get pushed back up over the cover as
the side that is not leaking, then something else is wrong.

Try switching bails from side to side and see if the leak stops
or follows the bail.  Are you *really* sure it is the valve cover?

I know you said head and cover are in good shape, but *feel* the
head mating surface again.  I finally had to use 300 grit wet/dry 
sandpaper on my T4 head to get the old valve cover gasket material
off enough to get it to seal correctly.  Smooth surfaces are the answer!

I use 3m weather seal(the yellow stuf) and glue my gaskets to the
valve cover....not a lot, just a thin bead.  I generally use
them this way for over 10,000 miles at a time with *no* leaks(on T1's).

Cheers, dave
