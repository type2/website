I picked up a Bosh fuel injection systems book put out
by HP Books written by Forbes Aird (intersting name).
I dont run fuel injection in my bus but in my other
Vee Dubs there it is.. I would say get it if you want
to have a reasonable understanding of the Jetronic and
motronic systems.. cleared up a few questions for me
at least...
Happy holidays!
