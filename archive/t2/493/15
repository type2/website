Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Question

I always called it the Positive battery cable and the other is the Negative
battery cable.  The ground strap goes between the tranny and the body of
the vehicle

I am having a blonde moment about the battery terminals.

The strap that goes from the negative post and terminates on the body of
the bus is called the ground strap. Right? The thing that goes from the
positive post on the battery to the Bus Innards is called the what? My son
says mine is old and should be replaced. And where do I find whatever that
thing is called? Thanks all!
