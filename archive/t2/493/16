Interesting. I was speaking based on seeing all the parts during R&R, I've
never seen a torn up a drum; at least not that way lol.

My own experience recently causes me to disagree.

When the stub axles from my passenger side RGB's (splitbus only) ground the
inside of my drum velvety smooth it made noises that I assumed could only
come from a transmission. Thor's hammer pounding sounds, one after another
as each spline in the brake drum was permanently removed. No traces were
found.

While begining the teardown, I found the actual culprit as described above.
Stub axle splines?

Beautiful.

They must be harder than hell.
