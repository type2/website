Subject: Toronto Area Christmas/Seasonal gathering

Hi Volks,

Just a  word to let those interested know that we're having a small 
gathering of bus owners at Shoeless Joes restaurant Tuesday, December 
23rd, at 3200 Dufferin Street. Just take the dufferin St Exit from the 
401 and head south.

Leo and Kim are coming through town from Tulsa OK, and that seemed as 
good a reason to gather as was necessary. Otherwise I might not see 
another foreign bus until it's time for EveryBus in April, and that 
just wouldn't do. If you're interested, come on out and join us.

I actually saw 6 aircooled buses in my travels today, and only 2 of 
them were projects... the other 4 were plated and running.

Sorry about the late notice, I had a little problem with a domain 
registration that knocked my mail server offline for a while.

Happy trails,
