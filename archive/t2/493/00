Subject: RE: [T2] mechanical oil pressure gauge

My oil pressure is 60 psi at idle on startup in sunny SOCAL. I'd go with the
100 psi, unless you know the 60 psi gauge can take 60+ psi without being
damaged (or relieving excess pressure onto your shag carpet or something).

I's also throw out the comment that 20' is a long way to run the supply line
for that. The wires from an electric sender are much less likely to spring a
leak.

When looking for a mechanical oil pressure gauge, is 60 psi enough or is 100
psi better?
