Subject: FREE middle seat in central NC

i am giving away FREE to the first person who comes to my house & picks 
it up a middle seat from a 72 passenger bus.

it is in excellent condition.  i do *not* have the mounting hardware, 
though.

i will not have access to my email from 12/24-1/4, so please call

happy holidays,
