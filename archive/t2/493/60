Folks,

Can we back up on this one just a minute.

It may be the Jake Raby doesn't like them, but he is building engines
that have to stand up to much more horsepowere and abuse by their owners
without failing.

I agree, that if you want to wring the last microhorsepower out of an
*air cooled* vw engine, then, you want solids....if you are down in the
range of power that they were designed for, then hydraulics are fine.

Even the great Gene Berg had trouble with cam's and cam followers at one 
time and he admits that almost no one in the business knew why he was 
having a problem....this was *solid* lift cams, not hydraulic....

As Mike's sig line shows below, he's got 224,000 miles on hydraulics, so
they can't be as bad as all that.  

There are also millions of other engines on the road that are running
hydraulics, they just don't happen to be VW's...if hydraulics were the
horrible failure prone bane of the automotive world, then all of those 
millions of engines would be in *big* trouble and no automotive 
manufacturer would use them.

Think of all of those hydraulic engines that the factory pumped out in 
Mexico that went into T1 engines that the Mexican taxi drivers abused to 
the max....anyone know of the return rate on those factory engines in 
Mexico?????

SO what's the difference here....

"Standard" horsepower...then hydraulics are ok.
"High performance, high rev" horsepower, then you want solids..

Cheers, dave
