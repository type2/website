Hello Richard   I would say the Owner  if he had been checking these he would 
have seen or felt the worn ends  but             We don't know if these were 
real vw or aftermarket  I had a set of berg adjusters that would break when 
you tightened the set nut.  I also agree with you on the use of hly. lifters  I 
use them all the time without problems. later and have fun mark dearing  salem
