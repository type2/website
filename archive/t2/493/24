I ran a mechanical oil pressure gauge oil line on a bug a long time ago.

I worked real hard to run the delicate oil pressure line where it would
never get crushed or bent or hit by road debris and cut open. I didn't want
any oil leaks and I didn't want to run my engine out of oil.

The setup was worthless in the winter . When it got down to 20' F, the gauge
would not show any oil pressure for 30 minutes after an overnight cold
start.

I left the oil line in, and changed over to an electrical oil pressure guage
with no problems .

I always wanted to find a good alternate use for that oil line to make up
for my wasted time, but I never did.  Go with an electric oil pressure gauge
and on the engine oil pressure sender.
