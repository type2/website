There are 2 possibilities here. Either your gasket is sagging (or
otherwise coming off its mating surface as you mount the valve cover) or
your bale is too loose. The bale should require some force to get it on
and off. To tighten the bale stand on one end and pull up on the other
end. This will make it bend in the middle making a tighter fit.
