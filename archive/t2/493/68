Subject: fuel vapor hoses

Quick question. I'm smelling fuel through my heat system recently. All hoses
have been replaced except for the fuel vapor hose behind the spare tire well
so that is my main suspect. Does this hose need to be fuel line or can it be
replaced with vacuum hose since no liquid fuel runs through these lines?

Thanks all
