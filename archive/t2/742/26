Hi Tom -

I originally drew this image as shown on Bus Boys' site and did the
part number(s) layout around 10 years ago.  As noted by other posts,
this hose (14mm ID) is still available under a different part number
(can't remember for sure), so keep trying.  If you can't find it,
pmail me - I think I have a 10 foot roll of it stashed somewhere
(spare for my Westy, etc.).  Originally called for a 3 inch piece on
either Bay or Vanagon, but your description of what you really need is
around 6 inches long, perhaps more.  I'll ask $5 for the 6 inch piece
or $7.50 for a foot long piece plus postage, if anyone's interested.
