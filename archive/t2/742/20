Subject: Re: [T2] Murphy and I did battle!

me and Murphy are gonna have at it.

  my engine is running on from 2 to 4 cyl randomly and only at low RPMs
get it on the interstate and it cruises effortlessly at 60-65 mph, for
hours.   today for example, starts and runs very rough, has almost no
power, drive about 2 miles to entry ramp of I-95. maybe a quarter of the
time it seems to run normally, the rest of the time the engine is rough.
  get on the interstate and cruise at 65mph for 70 miles.  get off and
drive 5-6 more miles effortlessly.   return and it runs fine, about a mile
from home, it runs rough for a little bit, then smooths out.

  I have checked everything I can think of, swapped out dizzy cap for new
one.  wonder what else to check, pretty sure it is electrical because it
smells flooded when it is rough. heck can't even figure out which cyl(s)
are missing, pull the plug wires none of them makes a difference.???

  have Pertronix points replacement, most everything else is stock...when
it runs right it is smooth and has normal power, gas mileage normal.

hate intermittent problems
