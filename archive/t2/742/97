From: "john d":

 I tried to make a small donation to the type 2 list via pay pal - I just
 received the following message:

 "The funds have been returned to your account.

 This payment was returned for the following reason(s):

 donate(-at-)type2.com did not sign up for a PayPal account or did not complete
 the registration process.


 Please contact donate(-at-)type2.com to arrange an alternate payment method.


 If you have any further questions, please log in to your PayPal account and
 go to the History subtab. Locate this transaction and click the word
 "Cancelled" in the Details column.

 Sincerely,
 PayPal"

 I thought we could donate via paypal - am I wrong?

At the bottom of this post and all other posts to the list are four links. The 4th one is about donations. If
you click on it, this is what it says:

                                   Donating to Type2.com
Since 1996, Type2.com has been kept alive by the generous donations of mailing list subscribers. In spring
2001, both lists responded wonderfully to a request for funds for purchasing the server we are now running on
and for paying several months' worth of our Internet connection charges. We still have enough funds to cover
the next few months, but we always gladly accept additional donations.
If you'd like to send a check, make it payable to "Type2 Fundraiser" and mail it to our treasurer, Ted
Finesman:

Ted has also set up a PayPal account. Use account tedebare(-at-)type2.com , or click below..........
