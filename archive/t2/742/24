A collapsing lifter usually reveals itself by sound. If one of your lifters 
is not pumped up you should hear that dreaded TAP TAP TAP racket they 
typically make after en engine with decent lifters has sat for too long 
between startups.

Could be several things causing the trouble. I don't remember what year your 
bus is but if you have fuel injection, next time it happens try pulling the 
leads off the injectors just like you tried the spark plugs. This will rule 
in/out the fuel system. If this reveals nothing I would try putting a set of 
good points in the dizzy. I don't know about Pertronix but I had a hall 
sensor in a Puik (oops, Buik) cause similar symptoms before failing 
entirely. A Sun engine analizer showed that the electronic ignition was 
failing to spark random cylinders at random times. Hard to diagnose without 
a scope that's capable of tracing the spark for all cylinders at the same 
time. Points are cheaper than a scope and will prove the point. Um, was that 
a pun? :~)
Good Luck
