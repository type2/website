I bought one of these same parts from gowesty about 3 years ago and I had
the same experience. The sink lid hits the spout when the lid is closed. I
am pretty sure I have the old faucet unit still, so I may try your
modification.

Any idea how to stop the bloody thing from pissing water everywhere? Mine
leaks pretty bad (from the hole where the faucet piece emerges from the base
plate) when you turn the water on.
