Subject: still not running well and black smoke

list,


   In my continual efforts to get my 1974 bus up and
running by the weekend to hopefully make a 100 mile
trip home, I am still running into problems.

I followed the carb adjustment procedure for 34
pdist-3 found at 

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/DualCarbs.html. 

 I was able to do most things however,  when I adjust
the volume control screws on the throttle bodies I am
not sure exactly where to put them.  I know the car is
running rich, black smoke comes from the tailpipe, so
should I turn these in more?  They are at about 2.5
turns out.  Also, when I pull the wire off the cuttoff
solenoids for each carb they RPM drop doesn't match. 
The right carb drops about 75 RPMs and the left
doesn't seem to drop at all.  Both are getting 12v
though.
I think i need a carb rebuild because i noticed that
if i spray carb cleaner on the outside of the right
carb it bogs down. 

The car isn't running properly, although the valves
were set, dwell set, timing set.  There is black smoke
especially if i bump the rpms up to around 2000. 
There is conitnual pop pop pop from the exhaust.

I am not exactly sure how to go about "leaning" out
the mixture.  I also noticed that the small screw on
top of the left carb, the mixture screw, doesn't
really do anhting if its messed with.  

I don't need it perfect just good enough to drive a
few hours.  

If anyone has any suggestions for things i can try in
the morning, i would appreciate it.  

Thanks,
