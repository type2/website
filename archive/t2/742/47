That sounds about right IF you take the values in Bentley and average them.

It depends on the specific distributor and the engine. In the case of the
distributor it will be close to the Bentley spec + initial static advance.
For example:

021-905-205P timed at 7.5 BTDC:

Bentley says 8-13 deg (-at-) 1600rpm and 20.5-24.5 deg at 3400rpm. When I
actually test the distributor I get:

7 deg at 1600rpm and 24 deg at 3400rpm.

7.5 BTDC + 24 = 31.5 deg at maximum RPM. This slightly exceeds Dolan's
recommendation and my bus would loose a little bit of oomph if I followed
his directions exactly.

Where this gets tricky is the vacuum advance (and retard if you have it).
The advance is based on the level of ported vacuum:

- none at idle
- some at partial throttle
- non near WOT

The actually timing is going to vary according to the way the engine
breathes. You can't rev the engine at idle and watch the advance because
this is not the same as pressing the gas pedal under load.

Figuring there will be times where the vac advance is maximum you have to
add it the max advance:

7.5 BTDC + 31.5 + 11 = 42.5 deg max.

I would still test the can in the shop anyway. The simplest way is to set
the timing to 5 ATDC, lower the rpms below the mechanical advance range
accounting for the can, Wiith the retard disabled (if present), use a
mityvac to pump up the can 1" of vacuum at a time and recording how much the
timing advances.

Retard works the opposite, as the vacuum level decreases the timing
increases. According to Bosch, the advance half of the can always overcomes
the retard half because one diaphragm is a disc and the other a ring and I
possibly because the two springs inside have different spring rates.

All of the retard should go away just off idle but you have to test this to
be sure.

If you are seeing that in the shop I would say it's too much. On the highway
you'd see those figures because of the vacuum can.

You want to know how much advance will causing pinking? I've always been
afraid to find out but I'll take a guess at 48 degrees. With a safety margin
of 4 degrees I would guess 44.
