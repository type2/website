Correct.

Where the bruck part number came from, who knows. If there is no retard function on the vacuum can the engine should be timed BTDC.

Yes.

Yes.

Depends on your skill. I rely on the timing light.

Use a helper and graph the advance curve. Unscrew the dashpot on the carb linkage to keep the idle steady while you read the advance with a timing light and tach.
