Subject: Murphy and I did battle!

And I won this round... Sort of.

I had mentioned before how my 73 kept stalling at lights. Someone had
mentioned to check the brake booster. I was trying to ignore that.

Well, it turns out the booster wasn't bad. Whew.

I had 4 vacuum leaks!

#1: Left booster elbow
#2: Right booster elbow
#3: Left emissions diaphragm
#4: Right emissions diaphragm

I had replaced my cracked elbows with some spark plug wire boots. But
at the booster (pipe) end they were too loose. So I yanked both of
them and capped off the manifold connections. Now I'm back to working
my leg muscles. :(

The two diapgragm doohickeys (too tired to remember what they're for)
on the intake manifolds were leaking when I got the bus. I had
slathered them with silicone. But it seems the silicone had developed
leaks. So I slathered them again with fresh silicone. Sigh.

So, I need elbows and bolts to plug those diaphragm holes, or good
working diaphragms. Anybody know off the top of their head what
size/thread fits in there?

Another skirmish with Murphy, and he's winning that one for the
moment: My top quality Empi mufflers are leaking. The seams at the
bottoms on both mufflers are separating. Sigh. Payday gets those
pieces of crap cut off and new mufflers welded on. Unless someone has
a header for sale cheap?
