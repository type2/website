Maybe it was just the number on the part that was
supplied to the Chinese from which they made the
copy of the distributor.  Maybe the single vacuum
cans added later?  

I remember Ron saying that the Chinese often
copied even the most minute details, including
the logo of other companies.  

I've also heard that you cannot rely on the model
numbers on rebuild dizzies also.  I check my
dizzies with the strobe and my vacuum gauge/brake
bleeder that allows me to pull vacuum also.  I
sue them to check total centrifugal advance,
total vacuum advance, and could check retard if I
had that style dizzy.  

This eliminates any problems with respect to
mislabelled products.   

For the few dollars extra, I for one would stay
with a new Mexican 034 dizzy (or the
034--reworked?-- by ac.net as the "SVDA") before
I'd try this Chinese thing at least until they
are proven reliable.  



Happy bussin'
