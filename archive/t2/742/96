Bad vacuum leaks can cause the poppoppop too. And that would help nail
down the idle too.

I still think you have the vaccum can hooked up wrong.

Try this: Disconnect both (or the one) vacuum lines from your
distributor. Plug them at the carbs. Make sure there are no ports left
open on the carbs while at it. NOW time the engine.

See if it still needs to be at 10 ATDC.
