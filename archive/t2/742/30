Subject: RE: [T2] tire brand

Hi there:

There is the same thread going on in the wet westies email list.  Hence I
thought that I would post a reply (one of numerous) but the link given has a
really good explanation on tires.

Subject: RE: [WetWesties] What kind of tires are you using?

For the last 8 years or so I have used Hankook RA08's on my own Westy. Due
to my long-term experience and satisfaction with this tire, I started
carrying it last year. IMHO these are the best value in a 14" tire for a Bus
or Vanagon.  Hankook is an OEM supplier to VW. These tires will hold their
own against much more expensive tires (including the Michelin Agilis, which
they outperformed in a recent German road test comparison), and unlike the
Yoko's they are all-season.
