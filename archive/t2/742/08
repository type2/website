Is this hose the same as the baywindow version (c shaped with braided covering) ? The last time I was at the junkyard looking at a Vanagon I saw a slightly smaller rubber hose in that shape with no braid (part number clearly stamped on the outside so no braid from the beginning).

I forgot the part number and didn't take a photo. Does anyone know that original part number?
