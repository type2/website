Thanks for the clarification, Mike. Yes, there is only one supplier of this
faucet, and he was actually the original supplier to Westfalia way back in
the 70's. Unfortunately he doesn't bend the spigot quite as tightly as he
once did, resulting in little or no clearance between the spigot and the
cabinet lid. (Mike's solution for making it fit better makes sense.)
Frankly it's not that he _can't_ get a tighter bend so much as that he
forgets how important it is to us Westy owners. I try to remind him about it
whenever he does a new run but sometimes he forgets anyway. Basically it
just isn't at the top of his mind anymore, having been so many years since
he made this item in any quantity. These days the faucet is hardly even
worth it to him to make, compared to other non-VW items that he now makes
his living on. I suppose we should just be glad that he's still willing to
make it at all, as if he stopped making it nobody else would bother tooling
up for it at this point.
