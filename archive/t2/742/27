Boiling water (212 degrees) will not trigger a properly calibrated GB
227 oil temp dipstick.

I am a little scared of trying to get oil at 227 degrees on the gas
stove in the kitchen. (smell, fire, wife ...)

What I did was stick the turkey thermometer in the dipstick hole when
GB 227 was turning light on.
