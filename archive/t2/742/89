Hi Jason,

For the pop, ensure your exhaust stud nuts are tight at the heads.

On the carb, you need to follow full procedure because the master idle
adjust screw won't get you in the ball park unless you are correct at
idle volume screws and throttle plate opening.

 I am also still hearing the pop pop pop sound that
 continually comes out of the exhaust.
