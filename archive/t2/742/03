I find that installing swivel foot valve adjuster screws really makes
solid valve adjustments quick and easy.  Especially if you are going
from stock adjuster screws that have lots of flat spots worn into
them!

I too remember my first valve adjustment... took way too long and my
neck was sore the next day!
