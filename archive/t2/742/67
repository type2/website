I have a tranny out of a 79. Bus had below 80,000 on it before it was smashed in the front. $100.00 picked up please.

I also have two tank to filler pipe hoses for sale. These are repros from England. Easier to install than the NAPA hose.(Not knocking the napa hose,I have done it myself) $25.00 ea. shipped to the 48 states. I also don't mind shipping it to Canada for actual shipping costs. Drop me an email and well talk about it.

I also have a bunch of JL vw buses. Stars and Moon bus and Hippy bus. $12.00 a pair including priority shipping.
