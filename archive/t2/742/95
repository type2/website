Subject: Type 2 and pay pal

I tried to make a small donation to the type 2 list via pay pal - I just 
received the following message:

"The funds have been returned to your account.

This payment was returned for the following reason(s):

donate(-at-)type2.com did not sign up for a PayPal account or did not complete
the registration process.


Please contact donate(-at-)type2.com to arrange an alternate payment method.


If you have any further questions, please log in to your PayPal account and
go to the History subtab. Locate this transaction and click the word
"Cancelled" in the Details column.

Sincerely,
PayPal"

I thought we could donate via paypal - am I wrong?
