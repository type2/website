I did a solid valve adjustment on another bus last weekend. Coming from the land of hydraulics and the fact it's someone else's bus I usually detest having to do it but somehow this one was really easy. I didn't even remove the tires or jack up the bus.

I had the pulley marked 180 degrees from the notch for cylinders 2/4 and I used a 22mm box wrench on the alternator nut to rotate the engine. I squeeze the belts together so they don't slip on either pulley and rotate the engine backwards for each valve. When I'm done, I jam a large screwdriver in the alternator and make sure the nut on the pulley is properly torqued.

I remember my first adjustment. It took so long to get a feel for the correct clearance I had fatigued by the time I needed to work on the 3/4 side.
