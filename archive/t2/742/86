I'm using it in my wheel bearings but I use the cv grease in my cv joints as
packaged by Lobro. I thought cv joints required a specific type of grease.

Mobil make many greases. Their Mobilith greases are formulated for a variety
of applications but I don't know of any recommend for cv joints. I haven't
made an extensive study of them to know for sure.

I heard that their generic grease at the flaps uses clay as a thickener but
the data sheet says other wise:

They don't specifically recommend it for use in cv joints.
