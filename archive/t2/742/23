Subject: VDO Oil Temp Sender

So, which is the correct sender for installing in the sump plate?
I see both VDO 323-888 and 323-055 listed at various vendors.
Both Bus-Boys and BusDepot list 323-888, so I'm more inclined to
believe them. How does this install? I know the plate has to be
drilled 9/16. Do I have to located a properly threaded nut to
install it on the plate? Does the sender come with instructions
for installing on the plate?
