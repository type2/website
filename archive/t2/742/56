There's nothing wrong with 45 degrees of timing, under the right
circumstances. The "limit" of 30 degrees is WOT, which is done with no vac
advance since you don't get vac advance over 1/2 throttle in the first
place.

Under anything less then WOT conditions the engine NEEDS more advance, which
is why 009s can't compare to SVDAs on the road.
