Karl,

The part number I provided (00113905205AN) was stamped into the body
of the Bruck distributor. I went out to my bus and copied the part
numbers directly from there.

It is now obvious to me that this cannot be used as a reference
number, as the 113-905-205AN has listing for both Advance and Retard
range:

" Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 5-8deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; Centrifugal:
6-12deg (-at-) 1500rpm, 22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm"

The Bruck distributor has single vacuum advance.

I will use the "Beetle 1974 * 1600 Federal Manual Trans" reference you
provided. Thanks!

peace
Jules
