Subject: RE: [T2] VDO Oil Temp Sender

I was just about to post a related question ... A guy at a local VW shop
suggested to mount the sender in the "unused" sump plate (held by two hex
screws, next to the oil filler tube). What is the general list wisdom on
mounting the oil temp sender in this location?

So, which is the correct sender for installing in the sump plate? I see both
VDO 323-888 and 323-055 listed at various vendors. Both Bus-Boys and
BusDepot list 323-888, so I'm more inclined to believe them. How does this
install? I know the plate has to be drilled 9/16. Do I have to located a
properly threaded nut to install it on the plate? Does the sender come with
instructions for installing on the plate?
