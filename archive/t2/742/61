Your vacuum can sounds broken.

You need a vacuum pump and timing light and vacuum gauge.
 
With the engine running, block the advance port on your carbs/TB. Connect the gauge and pump up the can. Increase the vacuum level to 12" or so and watch the gauge. If the vacuum level doesn't hold then the can is broken.

You can check the advance with a timing light as you pump (slightly harder to coordinate if the can leaks).
