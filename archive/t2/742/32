Arnaud,

I rebuilt the engine in my 70 bay last year. New case, balanced
crank/flywheel, new SP heads, full flow, new P&C's, factory doghouse with
Hoover bit, foam seal. All original tin, thermostats, flaps and seals in
place. Just drove from San Jose to Los Gatos, about 10 miles; air
temperature 62 degrees, 10:30 PM. Drove at 67 mph for 7 miles at which time
the VDO dipstick oil temp gage moved past 210 degrees. Slowed down to 60,
then 55 and exited freeway. Drove the few blocks to my house at which time
the temperature had settled back to 210. If I do not slow down when the temp
hits 210 I will and have seen 230. I believe this is what you can expect if
you go with your last option.

This is the 3rd engine in the bus. Several cracked heads and one cracked
block from pedal to the floor operation before the VDO oil temp gage was
installed. Previous to the doghouse I ran many years on a single set of SP
heads and just an after-market Rapid Cool cooler mounted at the fan intake.
I believe the heads and engine survived this set-up only by adjusting the
engine speed downwards to keep the oil temperature in the 210 - 220 range.

As for additional coolers, there is still possible damage from high cylinder
head temperatures. I melted a head and piston in a four cylinder air cooled
engine when the oil temperature was not much over 210 degrees. Too much
advance and/or intake air leak.
