Subject: Total advance 3500rpm

Good day gentlemen....can someone clarify some points on the total 
timing advance...
I have a VW shop (mostly Vanagon lately) and always timed the pancake 
engine around 28-30deg at -+ 2500rpm, i had a great explanation from 
Steeve Dolan 2 years ago that i kept with me.... on most 1.7 -1.8 with 
dual vaccum port (no retard hooked)  i get about a MAXIMUM of 30-34 deg 
at 3400rpm... i perfectly understand that the mechanical and vacum 
advance have a maximum # of deg,  my question is:
1)- in average, at what RPM both advance reach their maximum...
2)- what is the safe maximum total advance?????

We all know that we ride at around 3200 to 3400 rpm on freeway...

The reason for my question i that i have customers and friend that are 
having 40deg at 3500rpm... too much advance???...
those guys are equiped with the 2.0l engine and the 021-905-205P with 
single vaqccum port..are are injected engine.. engines look pretty stock 
to me
