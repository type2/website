Go to google and enter      garage floor oil cleaner

My personal favorite is 409 sprayed and wiped....Dawn has some
new stuff that I bought, but haven't tried on my floor yet, but their
commercials for it on greasy cookware are incredible.

Anything that will emulsify or absorb(like kitty litter)the oil/grease is 
good.

Cheers, dave
