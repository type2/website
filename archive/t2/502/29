Subject: BBB  Auction To help replace Burned Bus

  I talked with Jim Bell of the London Bridge Bullis and he has authorized
that we can hold an auction on Saturday evening to help Chris G. ( the
single mom who's bus burned on the way to BBB) replace her bus. I've found
that the Bus community is a wonderful bunch of people and come to the aid of
others. If you have anything that you'd like to donate to this auction
please toss it into the bus and bring it to the stage and let someone know
its for the "Auction to Replace the Burned Bus".
 Chris's bus is her sole means of transportation and with her 2 kids in the
middle of winter I'd really like to help her out. If anyone wants more
information I'll be in Roadcow near the stage, feel free to stop by.
Thank you and please forward this to other lists.

Britt
