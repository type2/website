Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor

Hi Volks,

Another reason not to use kitty litter is if you own a cat. A confused 
and fully laden feline looking to make a deposit might greet that pile 
of litter differently than you intended when you put it down.... 
Yuck!!! (I hope no-one reads this during their lunch break!)

I do use oil absorbant litter in my garage from time to time. I 
suggested the paint thinner approach to Barry as it sounded like he had 
already absorbed the bulk of the mess and was just looking to remove 
the stain from the floor. Which is how I deal with the marks once the 
litter is swept up.

Happy trails,
