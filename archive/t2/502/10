Subject: Buskatier Bus Burns on way to BBB !!!!

Chris Graue and her 2 children are OK. But her bus is a total right off!
She's stuck in A Motel 6 but her father will be picking them up tomorrow.
  I'll ask the London Bridge Bullies if we can take up a collection to help
Chris replace her 1970 Westy at Busses By The Bridge. It's sad that a single
mom had to have this happen.

Please forward this to the Buskatiers and Vintage lists.

Respectfully,
Britt Grannis
