Allow me to agree and expand.  You will experience carburetor icing
anywhere between 32 and 60 degrees fahrenheit if the relative humidity is
high enough.  Where and when you experience this will depend on local
conditions.  In dry climates this will not be a problem and in very cold
or hot climates this will not be a problem but at cool to moderate
temperatures with moderate to high humidities it will very definitely be a
problem.  The cures on a type4 engine are either dual carburetors or move
to a desert.

                             OOK!
