Steve,
     I worked in a glass shop for a about a year, the best way to keep glass is upright like Dave has said.  The best way to do this is get an old piece of wood and glue some carpet to it place the glass on it and lean it against a wall, where nobody is going to run into it.  Glass shops have stands for auto glass, the glass sits upright with 4 polls keeping it falling either way.
