Subject: Re: [T2] Things I LOVE About Driving a Bus!

Hi Folks,

I'd have to put my favorite on the list:

Passing people on the highway.

Going downhill at 70 when the rest of traffic is going 60, I love passing 
people.  They get a puzzled (and sometimes annoyed) look like: "Is that VW 
Bus actually passing me?"  It's even better if they maintain their speed and 
don't speed up so I can't get back into the travel lane...

I agree with the snow driving, the handbrake turns, and coming close to 
anything with the front end.  These sure are fun vehicles!
