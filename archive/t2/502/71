Subject: Re: OEM Fog Lamps?

Hey Steve, I see what you're saying. It makes sense now. While the A/C
"installs" looked pretty decent on most of the busses I've seen, they
just didn't seem to be of the same quality as the rest of the bus, so
they always did look out of place to me. I guess that explains it.

Well, I think I may end up installing fog lamps on there, but I'll have
to see what I can find, I'm really weird about doing something that
doesn't LOOK stock. I'm really particular about that. I just blew like 2
grand on a performance engine rebuild for one of my cars, but made
absolutely sure that you couldn't tell the difference in the before and
after pictures. I'm a "Stock Nazi", as they call them. (not to be
confused with an actual Nazi). 

Thanks for the info!


Todd
