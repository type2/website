Subject: removing fridge

Someone told me that thier fridge didn't work and they took it out and 
turned it upside down for 24 hours and now it works. I think they said it 
moves the gases around. I want to try it, but can't figure out how to take 
out the fridge in my 79. Searced the library and the archives. Seems like 
someone must have asked this before, but all I can find is about the earlier 
behind the passenger seat type. So sorry if this has been asked before, but 
I could use some direction.
Thanks,
Kyle
