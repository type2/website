Subject: Vin identification help.what month made?

I am having problem with my FI on my 76 bus, and i totally suspect the
AFM........unfortunately the AFM on it was rebuilt, and the bosch number is
scratched off.   It is a CA bus with the egr.(but that is disabled) .

VIN is 2262017263

If before 1/76, i  have to have AFM ending in 012....

If after 1/76 I need one ending in 018..................so you can
understand my dilemna.
