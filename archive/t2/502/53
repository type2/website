Check 'em for guide slop, valve length, etc then install and put them to work.

I've had GREAT results with used parts. Just make sure they are clean.

I am R&R'ing a Corvair 110 HP for my bus. Took it down to the long block 
and cleaned, cleaned, cleaned and threw new seals and paint at it and I 
hope this will work well. I did this for several cars over the years with 
excellent results.
