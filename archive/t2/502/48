Subject: Low-mileage heads: to rebuild or not to rebuild?

Volks,

Another topic in my engine rebuild saga.

The scenario is that I'm building a cheap engine that I'm expecting to
last 30,000+ miles while I set aside the $$$ to build my "dream engine"
(whatever that is).

I'm considering what to do about cylinder heads.  I have a pair of
low-mileage single-port (~4-5,000 miles) heads that I'm considering using
on said engine.  My other options are to have a valve job done on them
($120/pair) and/or just to pick up some rebuilt heads.

I'm leaning towards using them "as is" and just planning on having them
rebuilt or doing a valve job at the 30,000 mile mark (all other things
being equal).  That said, I haven't verified the compression on them yet,
which I guess I should do before I disassemble the engine, but they looked
great ~2,000 miles ago when I last had them off the engine.

Assuming the compression looks good, what are your thoughts on the pros
and cons of going with these versus dropping some money on a valve job or
rebuilds?  Money is not a critical issue, but it is important.

Thanks again!
