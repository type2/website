Subject: Re: [T2] gap in exhaust joints

I had the same problem on my 77 when I was working on the exhaust.  I
tried grinding (good if you have time on your hands), multiple gaskets
(didn't work very long) and finally got desperate.  I took a medium
size ball peen hammer and gave each corner of the flange a good whack.
Not an elegant solution but it flattened them right out.  Now I have
good sealed exhaust joints.

Just my .02
