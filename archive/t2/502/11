Subject: engine tin numbers

Richard,
I have no idea, but have seen a variety of similar print numbers on a variety
of tinware pieces.
Never paid any attention to them though.
If I find some I will send pics for you.
Richard,
Brisbane Australia,
Soon to be road tripping round Oz in Andy the 77 bus :-)
