Subject: 77 Automatic - Selector Cable needed !

Hey folks,

I'm searching for a selector cable for my 77 automatic
westy.

The bentley manual has a decent diagram though not
exact for my model year, on page 43 of Automatic
Transmission, it'd be part 12 in the diagram.

The cable peice that attaches the wire cable to the
selector cable is pulled right out. 

I've tried BFY and several know junk yards, but I'm
not sure of the validity of putting another old part
on there, but if it's in decent shape I might try.

I'll look into seeing if I can somehow have the wire
pressed back in or welded or something.

Anybody that can help with the part or suggestions is
appreciated.

thanks
Bob
