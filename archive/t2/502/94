I agree!  I smile at both of those two.  Here's a couple more that I always 
enjoy:

Loading 12' siding, prehung doors, twin mattresses and full sized arcade 
games into my bus, then closing the door.
Accelerating away from other vehicles at stoplights... in the snow.

Yesterday I was at Lowes buying a prehung door.  As I was leaving I noticed 
a guy in a late model Honda minivan cranking his engine, and cranking, and 
cranking... but it didn't start.  Strange for a Honda, I thought.  My bus 
didn't let me down though - never does.

No snow here in Dallas, but there is a chance for next week.  I'm crossing 
my fingers.  Love it!  I put a 12V heated seat pad underneath the drivers 
side seatcover and it keeps me comfortable down to about 40 degrees with no 
other heat.  Below 40 I have to take a jacket.  :-)
