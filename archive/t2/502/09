Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Paint Color

Reading this thread backwards, from newest to oldest, I was prepared to 
write a rant about masculine colors and how-insecure-can-we-men-get? -- 
until I got to the original query about pink. Well, okay. Pink is 
beyond the pale for a man's bus.

The coolest bus colors were a combination found on splitties. Since the 
point here is to find a color, any color, I vote for a grey/white top 
and sealing wax red.
