Hello Mike   Take one of those big syringe things and fill it with the POR 
and squirt it into a small hole at one end then take an air blower and blow into 
the hole till the POR comes out the other end. I did this on my 64 356C 
porsche by drilling a small hole at each end in the wheel housing then putting a 
large amount POr inside ,then blowing it thur with air, . Be sure to wear face 
protection . If it starts to come out of any holes cover them with a piece of 
duct tape, Seal the ends with chalking or body sealer. Later and have fun  Mark
