Sprinkle on some of that cat-litter type stuff, I
think the Product brand name is "Absorb-All". Dump
some on the spill and step on top of it to really
smash it into the concrete. Let it sit for a couple of
days, and sweep it up with a broom.  Before my dad
retired, he repaired electrical transformers, which
are oil cooled and filled with nasty oil. I have seen
this absorb-all work wonders on some really hefty spills.
