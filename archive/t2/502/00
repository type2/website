Hi Tom,

I painted my Polar White 1972 westy with Tremclad Black enamel back in 
1986. It had gold headlight trim, gold vinyl upholstery, gold curtains, 
and cheap gold plastic hubcaps. I envisioned it as a "John Player 
Special"  for a guy who likes to camp a lot.

It had a 914 motor in it that was hell-on-wheels, up until I put a 
con-rod through the top of the case. But it was a great year, let me 
tell you.

Happy trails,
