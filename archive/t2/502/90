Subject: 3 Things I Really LOVE About Driving a Bus!

Three things I really love about driving a bus:

1.  Speed bumps.  Really big ones.  The nastier the better!  I love watching
all the $30,000 SUV drivers slow down to a crawl to go over them while I hit
them at 20 MPH and barely notice them.

2.  Pulling up to a brick wall or an overhang with a front-seat passenger
who's not used to being in a bus.  If you haven't done this, I highly
recommend it!

3.  Fish-tailing in a snowy parking lot.  There's no other vehicle on the
road that feels quite like a bus when you get the backend hung out good.
Must have to do with sitting right over the front wheels, but it makes for a
really unique sensation.

Hey, it's friday!
