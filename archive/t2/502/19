Robert,
It is quite easy to remove the window and put in a jalousie.  You just use a
razor and cut the rubber off the old window you don't want anymore and pull
out the window.  Clean up any rust or paint chips now, while window is out.

To remove the jalousie from old door (DO NOT CUT RUBBER) The aftermarket
rubber does not fit (my experience) Unscrew all the screws holding the
window in.  Now you will need to drill holes in the new door to put those
screws back in. Then just screw them in.  Takes an hour or so tops.... (once
you have tools out)

As for the interchangeability??  I know the 73 and 78 have different places
for where the key goes in.  I am fairly sure I have seen an early bay door
on a late bus so I would hope it can go the other way also.  (but sometimes
you just can't)

Hope this helps,
Peace Brother,
Snoopy
