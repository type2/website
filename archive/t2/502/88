Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor

The stuff Advance sells is called "fuller's earth" works very well.  I had
some in house but tried using some surplus kitty litter last week.  Some
(not all) kitty litter is anthracite clay and turns very mushy/gooey and
sticks to everything.  I'll never do that again!  (I guess  you could use
kitty litter if you sweep it up right away and don't let it get wet).
