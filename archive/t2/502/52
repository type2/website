Exactly. Many places will do them CHEAP if you'll let them work on them 
when they get time, rather than a rush job.

Also check with your powdercoater, they may work with hourly rates. Locally 
it costs $40 per hour and 5 wheels (don't forget the spare) was the same 
price as 16 wheels (I had 3 sets plus a spare done at once).
