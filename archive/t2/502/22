Subject: Re:discovered rocker rust (was cold weather painting)

Your post re rust treatment with POR was timely:
---What do you do in cavities like the rocker zone under the sliding
door, where in a 75 NJ bus sandblasting has shown a few holes as large
as 1/8" showing through, suggesting rusting through from the inside? 
The rest of the bus is good (floors, beams, -original rust seen was due
to mouse nests in door and engine access crossbeam). This will be a
utility bus for a college bound student,  not a showroom bus (she plans
to paint anime over the base white it is getting).  Here in the east
there is a "crossover point" where the cost of extra work would be
better spent on buying a rustfree bus out west somewhere.   This bus
came cheap and most of the available money went into insuring safe
mechanicals and sound engine.
-Since we are more interested in it not getting worse and not spending
the time/bucks on keeping it beyond 4 yrs, we don't want to do more than
drill a hole here and there, treat it with something that actually works
to stabilize it, and perhaps fill the cavity with sealer foam so no
water/air can readily reach the area.  An acid treatment I read will
"stabilize" for years, yet you must wash it off and add water??????  The
car you saw in the shop for 10 years -was it ever washed or just left
that way?
