Hi,

First, never fill it with sealing foam. That just makes things worse, as
many others here will tell you. I learned that from personal exp back in
the 70's, before the real restoration in 94-95. Other than that, if you
just wish to forstall the rust, I'd recommend making sure it was
absolutely dry in the channel, then drilling access holes, 1/2" into the
channel, and going in there with a professional spray end running on an
air compressor, and with the bottle attachment to hold the POR, and
twisting and twirling the spray end in there in all directions to attempt
to seal it up inside. This will not hinder someone in the future from
restoring the channel, replacing the entire rocker area, as I did
eventually. That is how I sprayed the insides of all channels during my
resto. I made many access holes, sprayed and then sealed them up with
POR-soaked 1" squares of fiberglas sheet, for possible future access
again. Some holes were left open for drainage.

The Porsche was left coated with the blue phosphate, and never washed
until the paint went on. When I visited the shop a year later, the Porsche
had finally been painted, but was still there, as the owner couldn't
afford yet to take it. Seven years later, on another visit to the shop,
the Porsche was there under tarps. Don't even ask!

I would spray in the channel as I described, and seal up those larger
holes afterwards, with POR-soaked patches of fiberglas. You use the POR as
an adhesive by applying some around the hole, then applying a soaked patch
to the hole. The surrounding POR will seal and hold the patch on
indefinitely. All my patches of my access holes are fine nine years later.
