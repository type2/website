Subject: Storing glass

Although the precautions about storing on edge, sagging, and so forth 
are sensible -- and the reasoning behind them is sound -- it's far more 
important to make sure that nothing can fall on the glass or wedge up 
against it. If you take a windshield and lock it in a completely empty 
closet (except for the glass, of course) and hide the key, the glass 
will be just fine when you retrieve it six months from now or six years 
from now.

All things being equal, I prefer to store windshield glass convex side 
down, supported by padding about 1/5 of the width of the glass from 
both ends -- and away from everything that might possibly get at it.

Glass shops store glass on end because that's an efficient use of space 
as much as because they are concerned about sagging.
