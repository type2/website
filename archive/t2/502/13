Subject: new sliding door

Hello Listees:

The sliding door on my 78 Campmobile has quite a bit of rot and I have 
been thinking about replacing it. A sliding door from a '73 has become 
available.

Two questions:  Will a sliding door from a '73 fit my '78 Campmobile? 
Also, Is it possible (and not unreasonably difficult) to remove the 
standard bus window from the '73 sliding door and replace it with the 
jalousie window from my '79.

Thanks.

Rob Mead
