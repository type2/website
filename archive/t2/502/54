Subject: 72 VAN MUFFLER

Hello,

I am planning on having a muffler manufacturer make a muffler
for my 72 van 1800 engine, (my work deals with mufflers for generators
and I can get a good deal.)The muffler is the type that has 2 inlets
coming into the side and the outlet coming out of the end.
I am wondering if anyone out there has the dimensions of the inlet
flanges and the spacing of the inlets. Maybe someone that has
the muffler removed from the van?
Thanks,
Darren
