Subject: Anyone want to Buy my 79 Westy?

I've decided to put my 1979 VW Westy up for sale. It's a project that I
just haven't been able to get the time to finish. I've put all the
pictures and information on my company's website:
http://www.aomc.com/buspage.htm The short of it, lots of great parts,
body pretty solid but needs painting, engine rebuilt but not finished.
It's in CT, near Hartford.

Thanks!
Chris
