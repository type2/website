One other lesson learned. Don't explicitly trust the PO.

The PO had installed some gas filled shocks that were longer than the
stock shock size. So, when I took off the old shock and compared them
to the new ones I just assumed the long ones went on the front. Well,
we know what they say about making assumptions. In my haste to try out
the new front shocks I didn't even look at the rear shocks - silly me.
