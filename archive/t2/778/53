If there's any compression left in that cylinder, I don't think
loosening the plug will be sufficient to relieve pressure.

  BTW about the spark plug hole, you could actually leave the spark plug
 loose in the threads, (just in case it needed to release some pressure)
 because if the valves aren't moving, and the spark plug wire is not
 attached, the spark plug has no functionality....but that is just my .2
 cents.
