Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

First, check your crankshaft end play. When you grasp the lower pulley(with 
the bus not running of course), can you pull it in and out enough to feel it 
move or hear a clunk? If so, that is enough reason to create a leak on the 
front main seal. If it isn't moving much, you still will need to drop your 
engine, remove the flywheel, and replace the seal with a quality Elring or 
similar seal. Also a good time to check your pilot bearing and consider 
replacing your clutch, throwout bearing and the o-ring in your flywheel.

<Thanks for all of the responses in regards to my oil leak. I went on the
trip regardless of the leak and had a great time. On the trip, I did
locate the leak. The leak is dripping from the crankcase seam at the
front where the bolt mates the case halves together. I did an archive
search and pulled up a couple of results of another who had a similar
problem. The consensus seemed to be that the main seal was blown and the
leak was just coming out at the seam. Does this make sense? If so, what
parts do I need to repair this?

Thanks,
