what did the shop mean by unleaded fuel? From what I have always read
and been told, ALL Vw aircooled heads are good for unleaded fuel.
Since the hardened valve seats are insterted into the soft head they
do not need the lubrication leaded oil added to the mix. I was not
even aware anyone made valve seats that were not hardened. That's not
to say the heads were not any good, just sounds like a stretch of an
explination.
