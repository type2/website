I'm on Buskatiers and know Richard and Dawn. She spends a month with
family every year in Washington after the Seattle Vintage Meet. It's
unfortunate she did not give an ETA on the order, or let you know she
was not able to get it out before leaving on her trip. PLFVW is not
really a company. She sews everything herself.

 I see at the Buskatier's website that Richard Kimbrough also lives in
Mesa, AZ. I bet he nows what's up with Dawn.

 If that fails, join the buskatier's listserv and see if you can't
