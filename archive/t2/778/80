How true!  And it's a comment I hear oft repeated among various vendors whom
I meet within the Bus community. The common element among most of them
(myself included) is that they started out as bus enthusiasts and the
business came later.  There are certainly easier and more lucrative ways to
earn a living, but then there are the intangibles. The people you meet, the
community as a whole, the overall reward and enjoyment of your hobby being
your vocation...you just can't put a price on these things.  When your work
is a labor of love, it just doesn't feel like work (at least most of the
time :-).
