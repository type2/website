Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

I think this might stop you from leaving right after work, if not it might
stop you half way there! There are many places you could be leaking from try
to locate what area(right left front back) one you do that you can narrow
down the issue it could be an easy fix(valve cover gasket) or a harder(main
seal). For me on the weekend of the forth it was the main seal and I was
150mls from home and 140 mls from the campout.

Good luck

I got off the freeway exit my oil light flickered. I revved the engine a bit
and away it went. I parked at my work and walked around the bus and I
noticed that there was a large spot of oil under the bus. The oil kept
dripping  and I went into work and came back out 10 minutes later and it had
stopped. The temperature outside is only about 85 so I don't think that it
is my oil breaking down. My oil drain plug looks dry so I am not sure where
the drip is coming from. This is a 1600dp in a 71 Westfalia. The entire
engine is stock. I am headed camping right after work and I don't want this
to stop me.
