Subject: Westy needs rescue in Cookeville, TN - price unknown

I have very little info about whether this Westy could even be rescued (or purchased) but I think it deserves a good home. Has been sitting behind an industrial business and in fair condition (restorable easily) but someone came through a couple weeks ago and broke out some of the windows. As we all know that REALLY accelerates the death of the vehicle. 

Vehicle in question is a '78 Westy I think. Last time I looked at it the bus looked complete including the fridge/stove and top bed. It is not a Champagne Edition but it does have VW a/c under the dash. Engine and tranny is there with fuel injection. It has the full length bed up top like my bus. The bus is unaltered as far as I could tell. 

Bad: needs some glass, needs paint and general R&R. It also needs the front steps (rusted away) however the rest of the bus looks solid. I saw it once last summer but it was a quick look. 

I'm not calling the guy or going by or anything b/c if I bring one more "treasure" home I'm going to be living in one of them.... <grin!> 

This deal is up to you. 

Bus is located for now - until the city gets tired of it and forces the owner to get rid of it (scrap metal I'm sure but it far better than that) - on the corner of 15th Street E and Brown Ave. Located behind Industrial Tool and Die at 797 E 15th Street. Phone is 931-528-2272. 

Don't bother telling 'em you heard about it from me b/c they don't even known who I am. 

Just want a good old bus to have another start of "life".
