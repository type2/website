Wayne,

All T1 engines(before 72) have the oil pressure switch just below the 
distributor, to the left.

Karl or someone will probably catch me on something there, but it would 
have been *really* old.

I have a 78 with a T4(type 4) engine.  As far as I know, all of them are 
exactly where yours is...later vanagon's might be different.

The point being, it is either close to the oil pump or close the the oil 
cooler...they are on the oil cooler in Type 3's(T3).

Cheers, dave
