well if you are adamant about driving it home, I would agree to use a roll
back, but if you have no other choice.  I would
. remove the spark plug,
. remove the fuel injector wires
. remove the push rods
. remove all excess weight from the bus

removing the push rods is probably the most important,

drive at very slow RPM even if it was SLIGHTLY lugging.

stop at the first indication that ANYTHING was amiss.
