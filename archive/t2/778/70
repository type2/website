Steering box removal.

I decided to replace the steering box on my 1969 in an attempt to 
correct the front end issues I have been having.

Before I cough up the 300 for a rebuilt unit I figured I would try the 
one from the 69 in the field.

Long story short: I can not get it off. The drop arm is off. The top is 
loose from the connection to the coupling flange, and the four bolts 
shown in the Bentley are out, but the thing will not budge, I can not 
find another bolt anywhere that is holding this thing in. I have  pried 
at the thing and even resorted to the BFH (all that did is make the 
wasps mad) but nothing will move.

Any help??
