Long ago I met Dawn. She still lived in Seattle and wasnt as well
known.. I remember just siting for a while and talking with her about
her work and profit margines and such.. after a while she just looked
at me an said "Its not so much about the money I can make as it is the
people I get to meet".. not an exact quote but close. I see her now
and then at shows around here and she seems the same as when I met
her... must be over ten years ago now..

I hope she feels the same now about the people she meets as she did
then.

I have seen this thread come up now and the over the years.. sometimes
when you are a one person operation.. sh*t happens that you have to
deal with and the other stuff has to slide. When you deal with Dawn you
are
dealing with an old skool style operation.. she doesnt rip anyone off..
she makes a high quality product.. most importantly she lives in the
bus community all the time. Anyone on the left coast that doesnt know
Dawn
must not get out much.

The person who says it cannot be done.... 
should not interrupt the person doing it.
