I had one of those moments yesterday as well.  I took the kids to sonic
last night and the place was crawling with old muscle cars and so on like
it usually is on Friday nights.  Way off on the other end of the place in
the adjoining parking lot was an early 70's / late 60's bay window bus.
The kids weren't really interested in the muscle cars, but they had to
check out the bus.  I took them to see it.  As we were pulling out of
the stall later the owners came up and made me stop so they could look
at my 78 bay window bus.  We exchanged "I like your bus" and so ons and
were on our way.  Those moments are all too rare.
