From Jules:

>  VW put that spring between the drive gear and the
distributor shaft to pretension the shaft at the top of its travel and
keep the cam in the same position relative to the points.  If it is
missing then dwell will wander all over the place.  Replace that spring!
 
Hmm. I'm having trouble picturing or locating this spring. Is it on
the inside of the distributor body?

The key word above is 'between'.  
Between the drive gear and the distributor shaft.

The drive gear is in the case and is turned by the crank.
The dist shaft is in the distributor and the dog on the bottom is driven by 
the drive gear. 'between' is on top of the drive gear and below the dog.
