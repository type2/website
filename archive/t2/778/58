Subject: VW Type 181's (Thing) for sale?

Volks,

We're rebuilding the original 1600 motor from our 1969 Westy, and wish 
to use it in a VW Thing in need of a new home.

If anyone knows of one for sale, in pretty much any condition, please 
let us know.

Hope this isn't too off-topic.

Danke,
Anton
