I have a stock '71 1600 DP with 34PICT carb. Also I have a rotary electric fuel pump with ignition triggered relay.

When I shut of the engine for a while, several minutes to several hours, and
try to restart the engine is badly flooded (several minutes of cranking with
the throttle wide open before it slowly sputters to life). It only happens
on warm or hot days and after the engine is hot. I know it's definitely
flooded and not vapor locked. (snip)

Hi Ray,

I have the same engine as yours except with the stock mechanical pump. I have the same symptoms on hot days after the engine is hot. I have learned to anticipate when it will probably be hard to start and before turning the engine over I press the throttle about 3/4ths and then turn the key. It usually starts within about 7 seconds (for comparison, when the engine is cold it usually starts in about 1 second). I have found it important to absolutely not vary the position of the throttle once I have pressed it to the 3/4 point until the engine starts. 
I think my reasoning to go to the 3/4 point rather than full throttle is to minimize any accelerator pump squirt compounding an already possibly flooded situation. Also so that when the engine does fire up, it doesn't roar immediately to full throttle.
Also, after about an hour (or less), mine starts like it normally would when cold and i don't have to press the throttle in advance. So if you still have sypmtoms after several hours, the electric fuel pumps might be causing additional flooding over what is encountered in the mechanical system.
