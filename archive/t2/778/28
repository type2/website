Well after 2.5 months, 2 emails, and trying to call Dawn (-at-) her # posted 
on the website 602-315-0952 (it's disconnected) I have no other 
recourse but to contact my CC and try to recoup my $$. Maybe she hasn't 
run for the border but I want to warn the list not to do business with 
PLF as she has apparently disappeared. If anyone knows of another 
source for a poptop canvas for a early bay  please let me know.
Cheers
KC
