Subject: RE: Carb Flooding

I floor the throttle because it can take several minutes to unflood the
engine and I'm trying to give it all the air I can. The extra fuel from the
accelerator pump I don't think compares with the massive flood of fuel
already in the engine. As for it roaring to a high rpm after starting that
is not a problem as it sputters for several seconds on one or two cylinders
before the others pick up. Today I'm going to try to look down the carb to
see if I can see where it is leaking from.

Your problems sound similar to mine but not as bad. I was hoping there was
somebody out there that knew a cure for this. I will probably just end up
throwing a new carb at the problem as that seems to fix it for a few months.
And my new engine is fully balanced so maybe the wear and tear on the carb
will be less and hopefully last longer.

Thanks for the input,
