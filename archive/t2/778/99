Bus Boys sells a curtain rod set that is not OEM. It comes with plans
for making curtains.Those white buttons are coat hooks.

 Anyone know where I can order a full set of curtain rods for a 73 bay
 window? It's not a camper......but it does have some big white 'button
 lookin' things near the windows that may or may not be for curtain
 mounting. I checked busdepot and busted bus....but nothing jumped out
 at me. Will these (http://www.type2.com/library/camper/sliders.htm) do
 the trick?

 Also....does anyone have a pattern for making curtains for these rods?
 I wanted to at LEAST do that part myself and wondered if anyone
 already had something cobbled together.
