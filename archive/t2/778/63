If you want a new head and valve job and be $1000 out of pocket  
you've probably bought some insurance against failure. The risk is in  
choosing another budget rebuilder if you can't afford more and the  
comparison between the two is another discussion all together.

I've noticed there are two kinds of rebuilders: head and engine  
builders. If you get your head from an engine builder is will always  
cost you more because he's found a combination that prevent him from  
losing the investment in time and money in the rest of the engine.  
The head-only rebuilder just wants to compete on price and sell you a  
head. The volume offsets the loss of reputation.
