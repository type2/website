Subject: Re: [T2] Shocking Question

Well I feel like a dope. I did indeed have the shocks reversed - with
the rear shocks mounted in the front. Note that at least I didn't also
have the front shocks on the rear.

Result. Probably two damaged shocks, one slightly bent top shock mount
bolt and one seriously wrong ride. A visual inspection revealed no
other serious (visable) damage.

The ride now is fantastic. The $17 BusDepot shock special was worth
it. At least I didn't blow 2 adjustable Koni's.

All I can say is D'oh! and lesson learned.

 peace
