Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

Thanks for all of the responses in regards to my oil leak. I went on the
trip regardless of the leak and had a great time. On the trip, I did
locate the leak. The leak is dripping from the crankcase seam at the
front where the bolt mates the case halves together. I did an archive
search and pulled up a couple of results of another who had a similar
problem. The consensus seemed to be that the main seal was blown and the
leak was just coming out at the seam. Does this make sense? If so, what
parts do I need to repair this?

Thanks,
