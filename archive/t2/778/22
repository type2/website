Subject: Oil Leak - Larger than normal

Hi fellow list members,
 
I drove my bus into work this morning, thirty five miles - 55mph, and when I got off the freeway exit my oil light flickered. I revved the engine a bit and away it went. I parked at my work and walked around the bus and I noticed that there was a large spot of oil under the bus. The oil kept dripping  and I went into work and came back out 10 minutes later and it had stopped. The temperature outside is only about 85 so I don't think that it is my oil breaking down. My oil drain plug looks dry so I am not sure where the drip is coming from. This is a 1600dp in a 71 Westfalia. The entire engine is stock. I am headed camping right after work and I don't want this to stop me.
 
Thanks for the help!
