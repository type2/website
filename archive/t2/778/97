Subject: Re: Shifter bushing

My engine is in.

My big problem is with the front bushing.  I'm not coping with the rear
bushing(s) - I think there are three - just the rear shift coupler, which I
got off OK with the engine in so I don't see why I couldn't put a new one in
with the engine in as well.

Of course, if I can't, that will be just my luck...

the parts store gave me is clear plastic, split so you can get it around the
rod.  My problem is, the front shift rod will NOT clear the opening the
bushing goes in!  The shifter cup doesn't clear the space, so I can't pull
the rod back.  I am going crazy trying to get the bushing in around the rod,
and have concluded it's impossible.  I've tried hammering the metal that's
trapping the shifter cup, to bend it, but that hasn't done anything either.
Any ideas?

Thanks!
