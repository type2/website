Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

Hi Max,

My main seal leaked like that once.  The weather was hot, and I was 
pushing too fast, and when I stopped at a rest stop, I came back out to 
find a puddle of oil under the bus.  This was the beginning of a 
3000-mile trip, so I was discouraged.  I stopped at a parts store and 
got a case of oil and continued on at a more sane pace.  After camping 
out in the desert that night, I checked the ground in the morning, and 
no leak.  Never came back.  I'm not saying this is reassuring, but if 
it were me, I'd go camping.  I'd replace the valve cover gasket and 
then take off, drive 55 and carry oil and see what happens next.

Good luck to you.
