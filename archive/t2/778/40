Sorry to hear you are still having problems with PLF.  As someone already
mentioned, some years ago Dawn supplied the Bus Depot with our poptop canvas
(which was very nice quality, incidentally), but even back then she had
trouble meeting deadlines and ultimately this forced me to seek out a
different source. I can certainly relate to her predicament, as I started
off as a one-man operation myself. When things get busy and you're trying to
do it all yourself, the workload can quickly overwhelm you.

Every North American supplier besides us (and Dawn) sells the exact same
canvas from the same factory in the United States. Their standard version is
made of a somewhat course cotton which, while relatively good quality, does
not particularly resemble the original in either look or texture.

The ones I sell are completely different. I offer two different choices,
both of which I import from Europe myself.  One is a genuine OEM Westfalia
canvas from Germany, the other a very good repro.  Both are three-window
canvases that look MUCH closer to the original than the U.S. made one sold
elsewhere.  You will not find this quality anywhere else for anywhere near
this price.
