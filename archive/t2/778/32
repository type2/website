Well after 2.5 months, 2 emails, and trying to call Dawn (-at-) her # posted

on the website 602-315-0952 (it's disconnected) I have no other

recourse but to contact my CC and try to recoup my $$. Maybe she hasn't

run for the border but I want to warn the list not to do business with

PLF as she has apparently disappeared. If anyone knows of another

source for a poptop canvas for a early bay please let me know.

Cheers

KC
