It's all relative and doesn't really matter. Your final choice will
affect where the vacuum can is, which affects whether or not you can
physically turn the dizzie to get the timing correct.

 Id prefer to get it right, but its got me wondering if 2-8 or
4-10 are OK, that when timing the dist, the range of adjustment will
allow all to work out OK.
 If so, is one better than the other (2-8 or 4-10)?
