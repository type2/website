Kevin,

I just talked to Dawn yesterday.  She has been away from home, but is
headed home soon.  I can assure you she WILL send you what you
ordered.  I know it is frustrating when people don't respond (and they
have your money), but she is a very small operation and I think she
has been dealing with some things lately.
