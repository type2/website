Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

Hi again everyone. I have been ducking out of the office and cleaned up the underside of the engine. My driver side valve cover is messy. It looks like it is leaking. I have not done an oil change recently so I guess the gasket could have just gone bye bye. The problem with it just being a valve cover leak is that the leak is coming from right underneath the center of the engine. Can a valve cover leak do that? Another oily spot was where the transmission mates to the engine. I am guessing that is the main seal. I am going to check my oil level and run the bus at idle for a bit to hopefully see where the leak is actually coming from. Other checks I should do while I am at it to help diagnose the leak.

 

Thanks again,
