Subject: Shocking Question

Hi,

Happy Friday. I have some new shocks to install. Since the PO had some
aftermarket shocks on which don't appear stock (both shocks - front
and back - are the same length, spring over shocks in the rear) i have
a simple question. Do the short shocks go on the front or the rear
wheels? I think I might have it backwards with the longer shocks on
the front.

This is for a '71.

Thanks in advance
peace
jules
