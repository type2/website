Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell Creep

Still haven't solved the dwell creep. Had some time to do some
examination of the distributor. This distributor is a relatively new
Bruck SVDA (aprox 2000 miles)

The distributor shat does not appear worn. I also tried to move the
shaft up or down and it has no play in those directions.

Bearings seem OK.

There is a very slight side to side movement.

Hmm. I'm having trouble picturing or locating this spring. Is it on
the inside of the distributor body?

I did notice some play in the movement of the plate which holds the
points. There is some unexplained movement around the horizontal
plane. For example, if I grab the points assembly and move it back and
forth while mounted to the points plate, I can make the plate wobble
about millimeter up and down. Doesn't seem desirable. I don't have a
good vacuum distributor around so I can't verify if this is actually a
problem.

When I have the money the solution is obvious - Bosch SVDA distributor
with pertronix. 009 until then? - I'd rather not.
