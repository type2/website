Subject: Found the harness- thanks

Hey all, 

Thanks to everyone who wrote to help me make my own wiring harness.  Next
time I will - but this time (and I'm strapped for time) I found the part!
At Way Out Salvage in the Ozarks, wayoutsalvage.com.  The owner was super
nice, too.

Now onto the repairs... Yikes! :)
