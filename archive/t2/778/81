Subject: Height of VW uncool.

I was driving my Scooby Doo bus the other day West bound from Duvall to 
Woodinville and saw a nice two tone brown Van heading east on the road 
so I did the wave.  The driver in the two tone turned his hand palm 
side up and flipped me off.

This is the first time I've EVER been flipped off by another VW driver. 
  I put the whole incident down to the other driver just having a bad 
day, but I couldn't believe that another VW driver could be so uncool.

I say we take away his bus and give him a more suitable vehicle to his 
attitude that morning.
