is this front of engine (like front of bus) at the flywheel side? if
so it sure coule be the main seal. If you meant the front of the
"engine" but back of the bus, then there is most likely no seal there.
It's open with only a sling washer in there to keep oil in.

if the main seal is gone. it's an easy, but a bit time consuming fix.
Requires the engine to be pulled, flywheel off. then just replace the
seal, check endplay and back in the engine goes.
