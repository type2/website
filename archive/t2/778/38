If you did add to much oil it would have looked for anyway out. So you maybe
OK I would de an oil change add the correct amount of oil and watch for any

the leaks happening anymore. Which I find very odd. Also, the oil level on
the dipstick is full. Could I have to much oil in the crankcase and such it
was running out of the blowby tube?
