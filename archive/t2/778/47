Subject: Lower right corner body metal

Hi all.....I've finally come to the time I am fitting the new lower 
right rear corner and battery tray into Freebird before I install the 
motor and trans (thinking it might be easier to do with unlimited access 
to the inside as well as the outside).  Freebird is a 74 Kombi.  The 
metal lower right rear corner that I bought is variously labelled 
"Klokkerholm 95 56 70 2" and also "Hubert Schlieckmann 411102".
The problem is that the stock rear light assembly bolt anchor points 
which stick out into the rectangular hole on the van, don't appear on 
the new lower corner.  It's only the lower 2 bolt anchors that are a 
problem but cutting the van to keep the existing lower anchor points for 
the light assembly while getting the rusty parts out would make for a 
mighty complicated cut!  I also don't relish welding new anchor points 
on to the new metal because that would entail pinpoint precision that I 
am not confident in being able to accomplish.  Does anyone out there 
have experience with this problem and, if so how did you solve it?
