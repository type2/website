That's the way Paypal operates. I must admit that the same thought
about no recourse did pass across my mind once, but quickly dismissed
it because of the kind of person Dawn is. Apparently from other
responses you've gotten from other vendors this kind of slow order
fulfilment is common in the hand made, one person operation industry.

The only thing thing that bothers me is that she is not up front about
it. For example, one friend has a Kelmark VW kit car. He enquired, I
think to Gene Berg, about a special shifter it uses. He was told up
front there is only one man who makes these for the company, and he
has x number of customers ahead of you, so if you want one, it will be
two years before you get it.

I don't know if Dawn doesn't let people know of the potential for
delays because she is afraid of losing an order, or if she assumes
everyone who knows about her found her by word of mouth and should
already know, or what. But with a web site, she will draw people who
do not know her and have not heard about her track record on delays.

I have to second Jim's post and let you chalk this up to a learning
experience. Likewise, I am sure you have not been ripped off and you
will get your product, if not in time to met your production schedule.

      I was notified by PayPal that I can't get my money back because the
 time for a dispute has lapsed. Pretty smart of Dawn to make the date of
 delivery after the date when I could get my money back. IMHO PLF VW is
 a bad deal for anyone who is considering buying from them YMMV but my
 experience has been a bad one. 345.00 down the drain. Sorry for the
 rant. But I'm pretty disappointed, since my only recourse is to
 "contact the seller" and dawn won't answer my e-mails and her # is
 disconnected.
