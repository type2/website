Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Leak - Larger than normal

I went out and let the engine idle and also put loads on it. I don't see the leaks happening anymore. Which I find very odd. Also, the oil level on the dipstick is full. Could I have to much oil in the crankcase and such it was running out of the blowby tube?
 
Thanks,
