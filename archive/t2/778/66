Subject: Re: [T2] BAP Heads?

Our local machine shop, Foreign Engine, in Redding helped me with the
machine work on my type 1 build for the 62 panel. When I needed to
repair the bad head on the porsche 914 engine I was given, which is
now in my 72, he offered me an attractive price to repair the bad
head. Since my head was in such bad shape, I chose instead a new or
rebuilt from a shop's going out of business sale on that auction site.
But perhaps I should talk to Foreign Engine about some of these issues
and see if his shop is a good way to go.

 If you want a new head and valve job and be $1000 out of pocket
 you've probably bought some insurance against failure. The risk is in
 choosing another budget rebuilder if you can't afford more and the
 comparison between the two is another discussion all together.

 I've noticed there are two kinds of rebuilders: head and engine
 builders. If you get your head from an engine builder is will always
 cost you more because he's found a combination that prevent him from
 losing the investment in time and money in the rest of the engine.
 The head-only rebuilder just wants to compete on price and sell you a
 head. The volume offsets the loss of reputation.
