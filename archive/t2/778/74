You haven't said exactly what it was you bought other than it was  
dual port but I thought it was obvious. You said, "I'm a little  
pissed since it's well passed the warrantee but in fact they were  
never right. I wonder if anyone else is having this problem or if I'm  
the only fool that buys heads from BAP".

Castings are generally indistinguishable from one another. When I say  
rebuilder I mean BAP or whomever they paid to install the seats in  
the head (perhaps the head mfgr).

I'm missing your point. Are you saying they are good heads?

I agree.

Unleaded isn't the issue. One type of seat costs pennies and one  
costs dollars and the speed inatwhich the head was rebuilt is passed  
onto the consumer.
