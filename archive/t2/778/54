Subject: Re: [T2] ?SO-69 conversion?

> Hello VW People,

 I recently purchased a 69 vw camper for my pottery studio which I believe to be a Westi w/ a SO-69 
conversion.  My camper is the same layout pictured on the westi section but w/out the bench seat.  However, I 
do not have the 'head banger' cabinet mentioned in some of the earlier post.

 How do I figure out just what I have & how rare it may or may not be?  I purchased this camper for the model 
year (same as me!) & due to the fact that it DID have a sink/stove/fridge.  Where can I get info on these 
components? (i.e. how they work, what i need to make them work ect.)

You still have the bench seat/bed, correct?

If yes, look at the base for the silver/black plate. Probably on the right.
Along the bottom it should have a string of letters and numbers. Should start with Campmobile 68 and then the 
number. After that will be a single
stamped in number, like 9 and then a period, then 5 or 6 numbers.
The single number is the year. 9 for 1969
