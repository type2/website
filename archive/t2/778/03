Hi all,

Just a reminder that about a month from now we will host the 20th BNNTA 
VW family camping weekend at the group campground at Indian Creek 
Recreational Area located on the north shore of Mark Twain Lake about 35 
miles from Hannibal, MO.  For all the details about the upcoming VW Bus 
festivities, just hop on over to:  http://www.bnnta.com   If you want to 
camp with friends and wake up in the morning to a campground full of 
nothing but VW's, and ONLY VW's, then this is the event for you!

See you soon!

Bill Bowman
