Subject: vw bonding moment

Had another of those VW bonding moments yesterday. 
Pulled up to a traffic light beside an elderly black
woman in an old bug with a mismatched hood and a BIG
german shepherd in the back.  I rolled the window down
and hollered out that I sure liked her VW.  She smiled
ear to ear and said "I sho do like yours too!" 
Another of the small VW pleasures in life.  Cheers...KR
