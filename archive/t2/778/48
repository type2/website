Subject: ?SO-69 conversion?

Hello VW People,
 
I recently purchased a 69 vw camper for my pottery studio which I believe to be a Westi w/ a SO-69 conversion.  My camper is the same layout pictured on the westi section but w/out the bench seat.  However, I do not have the 'head banger' cabinet mentioned in some of the earlier post.
 
How do I figure out just what I have & how rare it may or may not be?  I purchased this camper for the model year (same as me!) & due to the fact that it DID have a sink/stove/fridge.  Where can I get info on these components? (i.e. how they work, what i need to make them work ect.)
 
Thanks for all the info!  I've learned so much just looking at past post.
