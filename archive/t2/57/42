Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Thermostat

it's not "Rube Goldberg". The VW thermostat from a T-1 works fine, and costs
1/2 the price of a T-4, and has OPTIONS on what temp you want it to open at.
It's a minor modification, and is completely reversable.

is Rube Goldberg the proper description for this? if you can find a T-4
Tstat, go ahead.
