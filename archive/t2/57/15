Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Utility

With reference to the piano ad- I've hauled an upright piano in my '62 crew cab with no problem. The heaviest load I've ever had was in a 74 Westy- 40+ cases of bottled water for a music festival. She was a bit sluggish, but never a problem.
The biggest people load was my friend's entire wedding party of 11 people in my old '67.


>     My bus outperformed my N*ssan p/u every winter on firewood detail.  The p/u could only hold a quarter of a rick at a time lest the front end get squirrly.  The bus could easily haul a full rick with the midddle seat removed and a tarp laid down to protect the carpet.  Guess which vehicle I sold??  My bus has always been a hauler of heavy stuff.  I like it because the weight is distributed between the wheel base, unlike trucks that center it over the rear axle.  I remember seeing a vintage ad for the the 69 bus that had an upright piano in the cargo section.  Haven't tried that one yet....
