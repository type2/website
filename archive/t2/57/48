What John describes is hardly baling wire and duct tape. I'm glad your
dealer has them, mine does not. John is offering a simple replacement for
those of us not as blessed as you. Lighten up, unless it a concours
restoration who would care about the conversion. I hope you don't get stuck
out in the middle of nowhere, you might have to use duct tape and wire
sometime unless your dealer delivers to ButtHead Montana on a Sunday night
at 10:00 PM.
