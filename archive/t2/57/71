I believe this is correct, on my 2.0L air-cooled (80 vanagon) there is the
FI harness. This harness almost operates independently from the rest of the
wiring in the van. Just a few wires go into the FI wiring as Al said below.
6 wires do not go to the fuse block anywhere that I have noticed.

BTW, when I picked up my van the PO had buggered the wiring so he had the
"cold start valve" wired to a switch under the steering column.
