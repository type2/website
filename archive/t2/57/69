John,

There was zero criticism at all.

There are two ways of doing things---the right and the wrong----

I prefer the correct.

It is not only cost effective, but problem eliminating----

I never noticed anything in your posting about the remote possibility of
carrying spares----- and this would be the correct way of motoring about
with an antique vehicle----

Oh one more thing---not having an additional parts inventory  on board
would be just as ridiculous as not carrying tools, or a spare tire.

Different sense of values I guess.

And yes, you have summated the correct analogy of Rube-----

Go around the block to get next door.
