Subject: Gear Box Lever Connection

I just bought my first bus ! :)

It's a '67 splitty.

Problem:
The gear box lever it's loose, and the engine it's
stuck in first gear. Checked under the bus and
discovered that the connection right near the gear box
is somehow broken. Took two pictures, the light it's
not very good :(

What's missing here?

Thanks
