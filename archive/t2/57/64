Troy:
Maybe this is a senior moment for me... but I am pretty sure there are NO
FI specific wires in the fuse panel (under the dash). And I don't have a
FI bay to look at right now, just an 80 Vanagon.
The ONLY wires that have to do with the engine are the black wire that
goes to the coil, the oil pressure lite, and the alternator light (blue?).

The very best would be if someone could send you a digital pic of the fuse
panel with wires attached.
Or if anyone could just write the colors down in order. The damn current
flow diagram in the Bentley is very little help for fixing re-engineered
(boogered) wiring. I like the diagrams for the 72 and earlier for that,
but very much different than the 78!
