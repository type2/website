Subject: Putting in the engine, best method?

Now that I have the engine ready to mount back in my 1980 2.0l Vanagon, I am
wondering if I can save a step?

My tranny is out too (also the axels) and I want to bolt them both up
together then mount them both back into the van as one unit. Can I do this
or will I run into some weird axel problem (not being able to put them in
unless I mount the tranny 1st) ????

It looks to me like I can do it but would like some advice of anyone who's
done it before ???
