    My bus outperformed my N*ssan p/u every winter on firewood detail.  =
The p/u could only hold a quarter of a rick at a time lest the front end =
get squirrly.  The bus could easily haul a full rick with the midddle =
seat removed and a tarp laid down to protect the carpet.  Guess which =
vehicle I sold??  My bus has always been a hauler of heavy stuff.  I =
like it because the weight is distributed between the wheel base, unlike =
trucks that center it over the rear axle.  I remember seeing a vintage =
ad for the the 69 bus that had an upright piano in the cargo section.  =
Haven't tried that one yet....
