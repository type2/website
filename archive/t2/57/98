now you guys have got me worrying, about 6-8 months ago I was having a
strange problem and finally found that one of my lifters had colapsed,
never had this problem before.... but I just ordered a new hyd  lifter
from Ron and after bleeding it, dropped it in and put the pushrod and
rockers back in and have been driving it ever since...

is this now a potential time bomb waiting to trash my cam (which is less
than two years old)????

haven't noticed anything in the 12k or so miles since then
