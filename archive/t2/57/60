what makes sense if making do with what's available.

BTW, my recollection of "rube goldberg" is making a device to accomplish a
desired task, in as roundabout and nonsensical way as possible. Also, your
remark of "duct tape and bailing wire" is where the "ghetto engineering"
definition of your in context reference came from.

Go ahead and criticize the rest of us all you want for our mis-use of your
terminology, and different values on keeping our cars on the road.
