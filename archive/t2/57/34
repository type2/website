Scott,

Why do it the Rube Goldberg way?

Buy the right part and be done with it !!!

Adapting the type I thermostat is like putting hyraulic lifter's into a
solid lifer engine !!:>)

E-mail message From scott=A0lyons

i found one on ebay: they are getting difficult to impossible from
regular suppliers. the type 1 will work with a fairly simple
modification. aircooled.net has a written up procedure for the mod on
their page that lists the type 1 thermostat.
