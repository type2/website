My next Type 1 engine is costing me around $12,000. That's OK by me, but
ludicrous for most, it's just what floats my boat'.

I have a friend with a $300 car, and a $6500 bicycle. :-)
and I quote him, "some people buy a new car every 2 years, I buy a new bike
every 2 years".

:-)

Any more examples to lighten this up?
