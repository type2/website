Subject: bus utility


We are talking about (over) loading our busses here and i have a tale that 
is going to raise people's blood pressure.
5 years ago i enrolled in graduate school in Berkeley CA. I was living in 
seattle at the time and had a 77 camper (still do) with a nearly new motor 
and trans. well, it was so strong, compared to my previous '71, that i 
decided to put a uhaul trailer on the back and tow it to CA. I rented the 8 
footer and filled it with a couch, a desk, a recliner, two wooden chairs, a 
stereo, tv, clothes, snowboarding gear and all of my scuba gear. i grabbed 
my faithful roadtrip buddy and we hit the highway. we were able to hold 
about 45 mph on the flat spots, but quickly learned that the hills were 
about 20 mph max. it took us about 26 hours to do the 14 hour drive, and we 
took the "less steep" way. The motor held out and when i finally unloaded 
the bus and returned the trailer, it felt like a go kart to drive again. the 
thing weighs in at 4050 unloaded! Needless to say, i will NEVER try this 
again. All i can say is that my bus is very, very forgiving. last week when 
my brother asked if i could tow a 22 foot sailboat from tacoma to portland, 
i said "uh, no."
Anyways, that's my story!
Please do not follow in my shoes....
