Subject: CDI and Rotor mods

Apparently the resistor in rotors has a tendency to breakdown and cause
performance probs. I havent detected a problem with the rotor in my 009
but have modded a rotor with a vac dizzy that I wanted to use anyway
and will see if I notice any difference.
Here is the link to the mod website

John Connolly sells modded rotors if you dont feel like doing it yourself
but it was very easy and quick.
You can pretty much dremel at will as the epoxy is much softer than the
ceramic of the rotor or the brass at the ends.
