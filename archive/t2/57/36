Not without modding the doghouse shroud. This is a mod that some folk have
done which gives a little better cooling but requires some cutting and
welding on the fan shroud.
It wouldnt be practical for a non-doghouse shroud.
If you dont need the cooling I would recommend a NEW cooler. it should be
60-75 or so dollars.
