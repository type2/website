Subject: Looking for a Cleveland, OH-area repair shop

Hello,

I'm trying to find a repair shop with loads of bus knowledge (especially
engine work) in or near Cleveland, OH. My '78 is currently broken down in
Lakewood, but I can have it towed by the good folks at AAA anywhere nearby.
Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

Steve
