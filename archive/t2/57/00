I'm probably a bit less charitable than you.  Seems to me that the BMEP
stuff is BS to impress the reader.  It is impressive if you don't know
anything about BMEP and how it is used, but the whole premise falls apart
if you've ever studied it.  I try to resist the urge to do this sort of
thing, as there always seems to be one or two people around who can see
through this approach.  As Robin Williams said in one of his routines:
"That's not writing, that's just typing!"
