We have had alot of Hondas and currently own one we bought new. Hate to 
tell you this but Honda has been doing the same thing that VW has been 
doing to after market suppliers and web site owners.

A corporation has to control the use of their trademark or face losing 
control of that trademark completely - it becomes public domain and VW Inc. 
no longer makes money on products with their name.

It happens in every part of the market I'm sure - remember NAPSTER?

And yes the corporations are just getting richer.

I don't like it but hard to blame them defending their trademark. The rude 
tactics they use are probably less harmful and cheaper than court. And 
don't forget the lawyers that are getting rich off of prodding these 
corporations into action.
