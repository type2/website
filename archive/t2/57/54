Rube Goldberg, is anything but "Getto Engineering".

But in reality he took the long way around to arrive at the correct end
result.

So in retrospect what I was attempting to imlicate was do it right, with
the right stuff, and eliminate all the BS to get to the place you wanted
to be in the first place.

I received two of the wrong thermostats, from un-named list vendor's,
and for the money I was saving, it would have taken longer to "Rube" up
a perfectly good thermostat for my application.

I prefer to do it right the first time, regarless of the cost factor

My Choice.    

Later,

Terry


E-mail message From John=A0Connolly; 


well, we disagree a bit on the definition of "rube goldberg"; to me (and
some others) it implies Ghetto Engineering, which using a T-1 stat is
not. If I had suggested to use a Honda thermostat, or Ford, then flail
away.

John, 
Rube is a conglomerate of the hokey pokey concept------ 
If it ain't made for it, I suppose bailing wire and duct tape will
do----- 
I have the correct one, got it in two day's from VW, and it fit without
any Polish inginuity, and when I inquired about a type IV thermostat
shortage, the parts manager replied---" How many do you want?" 
With this in mind, why screw around with an incorrect part? 
I live north of the Mason Dixon line---- 
No Rube for me, thanks anyway.:>)
