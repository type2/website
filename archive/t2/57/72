Another Finding-----

Upon receiving two of the incorrect early thermostat's, I also noted
that they were not of the correct temperature rating---

Better check this out prior to installation.

The mod to use a type 1 thermo in a type 4 is so simple, it would be
inaccurate to characterize it is substandard, by whatever term you might
choose. 
T1 thermos are still being manuafactured, so you are usually getting a
fresh one, instead of one that has been sitting for 20 years slowly
losing its volatile fluid. 
I have one. It works great.
