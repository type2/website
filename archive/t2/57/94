Subject: Trans Ratios/HP Curves

Volks:

Can anyone point me to a reference (preferably on-line) that relates HP
and Torque curves to transaxle ratios?  I'm looking for a semi-desktop
dyno-kinda-thingy.  I'm trying to determine how my bus will perform with
the Corvair conversion.  

Thanks

P.S. I can't believe I haven't received any responses to the Transvair
engine swap post.  I'd love to hear experiences, opinions or general
prognostication.
