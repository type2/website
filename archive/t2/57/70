Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Thermostat

The mod to use a type 1 thermo in a type 4 is so simple, it would be
inaccurate to characterize it is substandard, by whatever term you might
choose.

T1 thermos are still being manuafactured, so you are usually getting a fresh
one, instead of one that has been sitting for 20 years slowly losing its
volatile fluid.

I have one.  It works great.
