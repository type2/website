Subject: RE:Finishing Interior

I have a '72 camper with the white 'birch' paneling.

I would like to re:finish the paneling.  Any suggestions?

I can use Acetone to strip the heavy covering, but I just cannot, for the 
life of me, get an oil based 'white' {pickled oak} stain to take; on a test 
piece, it just soaks in and does not change color.

At the suggestion of a Home Depot sales rep, I tried some water based white 
stain, and it seems to just lay on top of the wood, pretty much like the 
original stuff.

I guess I am searching for a stain that will soak in and change the color to 
a white'ish color.
