Subject: Re: [T2] Re replacing old hyd lifters with new(the 231K bus)

It is not uncommon to resurface lifters when an engine is rebuilt and run
them on an old camshaft. However the cam should be examined for wear
prior to running the resurfaced lifters. In all repair manuals it tells
us to return the same lifter to the same lobe in a situation where the
lifters are removed. This has little importance if the lifters have been
resurfaced or new lifters have been installed.
In your situation I'd say that new lifters have done you no harm but I
fail to see that new lifters are any better than the old lifters since
the lifters lay on their side and some of them always bleed down
overnight.

Perhaps you had the Air Lock experience with your lifters, I've never had
it but I believe that it is more than fantasy.
