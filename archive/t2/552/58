Subject: RE: [T2] Composite Drum on '71 rear?

Hi Eric,

If you have the 2 10mm bolts on your drum, you have the 2-piece drum.  
Bentley tells you to remove the bolts, then the drum, but they don't say 
anything about rust or brake shoes.  If your drum has never been off, it's 
probably pretty rusty and will be reluctant to come off.  More importantly, 
if your brake shoes are adjusted way out, they will still hold the drum on 
even if the 10mm bolts are removed.  In this case, you need to adjust your 
brakes so the shoes are away from the drum to allow for its removal.  If 
you've never adjusted your brakes, hit your adjusting stars with Liquid 
Wrench and be careful not to destroy them as you adjust.  They are brass, so 
a steel screwdriver will break them if too much force is applied.  Check the 
Muir book (if you have one), as it has a pretty good procedure for adjusting 
rear brakes.

Good Luck!
