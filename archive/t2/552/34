I recently picked up another bus diagnostic tool: it's a VAG tach/dwell meter made by Grundig that has an inductive pickup that reads the flywheel position.

At first I only thought it was going to work with Vanagons but I found a picture of it in a 79 European bus brochure and sure enough it has an adapter cable for hooking up to the baywindow flywheel sensor:
