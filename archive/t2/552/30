Look for vacuum leaks because EVERY VW engine I have tuned had vaccum leaks.

brake booster hose/s

vaccum from dizzy to carb

manifold gaskets/carb boots (for manifold to carb)

cant think of anything else..?

have fun vaccum leaks can be a pain in the arse....

i found one finally after replaceing everything... 

guess where it was?? on the one thing that i didnt replace(one of my small 1 ft servo hoses..)

peace and good luck

try to close off one side of the hose to check for leaks as you apply air source to other side... maybe a partner can listen under the bus for you..?
