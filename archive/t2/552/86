Hey,

Whenever i had my van towed they lift the back tires off
the ground and tie a rope around the steering wheel.
so this does not affect the engine or transmission.

good luck with your van.
my van just had those same symptoms of losing power
and then a week later it died on the side of the road.
...squashed bearings.
now i am re-assembling.
be very gentle on that baby.

Darren
