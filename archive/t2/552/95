Subject: Purchasing bus internationally

Greetings volks,
      I'm looking at purchasing a bus from South Africa. So far, the 
seller looks legit (I've gotten a lot of warnings about SA scams). I've 
got a question for those of you who have purchased a bus and had it 
imported into the states. I asked the seller if he was willing to use an 
escrow service. He said he prefers using an "International Letter of 
Credit" and that this would give me sufficient protections against 
damage or fraud.
      Can anybody explain to me what this means exactly? Anybody done this?
      Second--I've been quoted $4,000 US for shipping from South Africa 
to the east coast of the United States. This seems high. Has anybody 
ever shipped a bus from South Africa, and if so how and how much? I 
noticed that shipping a bus to the UK from South Africa is only around 
$1,000 US, and from the UK to the states is around $1,500. It seems like 
I could save some money by making that multiple hop shipment--but I 
don't know if this is legal or possible.
      Can anybody recommend some companies to use for shipping?

Thanks again for all of your time and wisdom,
John Tracy
