Subject: Starter Question

Unusually warm weather has hit and we're in the hihg 80's already, (no
complaining from the SoCal folks please). Well after driving for about
30 min today, my starter was turning real slow. Am I a candidate for the
Starter Realy deal I've heard about? How do I find out if that's what I
need, or if my starter just bites.
 
Thanks
