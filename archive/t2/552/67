Subject: Rounded oil plug

Anyone have to deal with a stripped oil plug bolt head?  Mine is rounded
(thanks to who knows who) and I can9t get a grip on it.  With 9 lbs of
torque on a rounded bolt I9m not sure how I9m going to get it off -with a
tap??  Also, I9m not sure if a replacement will be available?  Is it a
problem to drain the oil through the screen plug as an alternative?

Thanks, Nik
