Subject: out of gas problems...

Ok.  So I ran out of gas.  At least I thought that was the problem. 
Put two gallons in and the problem went away.  After 10 or so miles,
the same symptoms came back.  "Surely I'm not out of gas now!"  Filled
up (13 gals to be exact) and the symptoms persisted.  So, my question
is this, did running out of gas cause some other complications??  e.g.
burnt out fuel pump, bad fuel filter???

What are the symptoms, you ask?  It feels like the clutch is skipping,
but it and the flywheel only have 35k miles, and I don't have any
trouble shifting gears.

Any thoughts, suggestions?

13 gal + (( 2 gal - ( 10 gal * (15 mpg)^-1 )) IS NOT EQUAL 15.4 gal
