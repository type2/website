* by tow or something.

Ok, Ill try and get a deck to tow it on. It's an automatic so im guessing it
can't be pulled without damaging the tranny. It has to go about 90 kms
to get home.

* Go to a local bookstore and buy the muir idiot guide. Order the Bentley 
for your particular year from one..

I have both the bently and the muir guide. Ive been reading and rereading :)


*As far as timing you need a strobe light and dwell/tach meter to do it
correctly. You can get tools sutible to use from a local FLAPS. The
quality of these tools isn't gonna be the greatest, but it will work
just fine. When you report back in for more help, I can tell you the
list will need at the very least the model number of distributor
(stamped on the side of it).

Im tempted to get ahold of an electronic ignition for this baby. The on
in my other bus works good.

*You mentioned it has a 2.0L FI engine? this sure wasn't stock for 74,

Yah, it's a 2 fi very similar to the one I have in my 78' (which is 
currently getting
the sliding door lower rail replaced. We weld this morning.

*On a last note, didn't you say the oil was boiling, or something to
that effect. what makes you say that? That is HOT!!!

Yah it was bubbling.. or the air in it was.
Almost tempted to drive it 10 minutes, cool it. Drive it cool it. And see if
I can nurse it home. I was in a rush last nite so I hitched a ride.
