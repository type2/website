Hello All, and THANK YOU for your assistance.
I have somewhat solved my issue, I say somewhat.

Thank you to Access Bob and his assistance.

I had to place, what I would call, a real "Airs" call, over the airwaves of
the telephone.

Thank you to my friend Mr. Mark Dearing, and his patience of telling me what
to troubleshoot next.

I took the wheel off, check brakes and connections, I took the hub off,
isolated the "click" by removing the axle from the wheel...no click.  I took
the axle from the trans....no click.  No axle, no click.

I reinstalled the old axle, no click.  Hmmmm, must be the new axle.  I
thought maybe I had a bind or something, so I reinstall the new axle.  CLICK
CLICK CLICK... As Access Bob mentioned, I must have an axle too long!!!

Reinstall the old with a little fresh grease, no click!!!!

So I am running (I think).

This list ROCKS!!

Thank you ALL!>
