They are telling you about concrete backer board. Heavy stuff. Would be fine execpt it is heavy and will probably rub through the paint on the floor promoting rust. 

They've got masonite at the home improvement stores. Sometimes I think it was my grand father's favorite project material... 

Ask for press board or masonite. It is about the same stuff as the peg board material. 

See ya.
