Subject: Listees in Phoenix area

Hello Generous list,

The bus search is raging on.  Thanks to Chris Slaymaker in
Knoxville for offering to look at a bus down there for me.

OK, to the latest possibility:  are there any listees who are
available to check out a bus in Phoenix area, specifically, Mesa
Az?  As always, I will more than gladly pay for your time and
expertise.

P-Mail me off list:

Thanks,

James
