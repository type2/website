Hi Greg,
Im a little intimidated by checking the timing.. i haven't done it before 
and I don't think i have the tools to do it. Any advice you can suggest for 
my upcoming ontheroadside tuneup?




Hi James,

First, do a valve adjustment while the engine is cold. Then verify dwell and 
timing. It's not uncommon for the points to close up, which would cause the 
bus to lose power. Or it could be the coil, wires, etc. Then check the 
throttle linkage, I have seen situations where the throttle cable stretched 
out and the bus lost power because the linkage wasn't moving properly.
