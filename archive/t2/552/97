John,

$4,000 seems like a lot.  Do you really like the bus that much?

Seems like that $4,000 you could get one from Europe someplace.
If I remember correctly, you wanted RHD rather than U.S. style.

For $4,000 you could buy a bus here and then a RHD front beam from the
UK someplace and make the bus a RHD vehicle.

Last of all, if you are certain that you want to *really* do the shipping 
thing, you need an agent/broker that will arange everything....someone who 
does this sort of thing for a living and knows all of the ins and outs of 
doing it correctly.

I have a personal friend that does this sort of thing for a living...pmail 
me if you are really serious.....because it is *not* cheap.

Cheers, dave
