Subject: A Bus Ball?

Having just resently joined the list I have been reading everything intently
and enjoying the conversations. But today I found an interesting webpage
that I just had to share with everyone. I did a quick search of the 
archives and
could find no mention of this unusual "vehicle", so if it has been 
mentioned before
just enjoy seeing it again.
