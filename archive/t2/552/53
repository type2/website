Subject: Composite Drum on '71 rear?

Good Friday to All!  I'm trying to get the drums off of the rear of my '71.  I
believe it to be an early '71.  Could someone tell me if ALL '71s have
composite drums, or if maybe the early ones still require the removal of the
axel nut?  It has the two little bolts that have been removed, but the drum
does NOT seem like it's coming off the center for anything!  It's soaking in
Liquid Wrench now and I've been smacking it with a rubber mallet.    Any other
suggestions?  Bentley simply says "remove two bolts and remove drum" or
something to that effect.  THANKS!!

Have a good one,
Eric Shook
