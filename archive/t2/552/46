I would suspect you got rebuilt MANUAL tranny axles,.  an auto tranny has
different Length axles than a manual and they are different left and
right.

make sure you get the right length axles on the right side, it is in
Bentley,   but the long side will pull the axle right out of the CV joint
and the short side will cause major damage to either the CV, Tranny or
stub axle if you try to use the Manual tranny axle

DO NOT DRIVE THE VAN at all with the incorrect axles
