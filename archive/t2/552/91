James,

I am sorry to belabor this point, but Richard is right...about 600 degrees 
before oil "boils".

I doubt if it was that hot, that there would even be enough left on the 
dipstick to look at....it would have all dripped off by the time
you got it pulled out.

Your oven in your house doesn't even get to 600 degrees.
600 degree oil would have meant that a lot of parts on that engine would 
have probably melted already.


Were you holding the dipstick with a rag or something?

Could you touch the fan housing at all?...any other part of the engine?

Something else has *got* to be going on here.

Cheers, dave
