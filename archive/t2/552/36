Subject: overheated bad

So Im driving my van.. a little windy.
Ive already done 150km total and it was good. Return
trip.. and my power drops.  I stop and check and the motor
is hot, oil is bubbling.  I let it cool, drive it slow, pull over to let
it cool etc etc. Then when I can I park it at a gas station
halfway to home and hitch a ride back.

Tomorrow Im going to try and find a trailer and bring it home.

Any ideas?  2 liter fi automatic.
I checked to make sure the wires were ok and getting spark
to all 4 cylinders. Not sure what all to check.
There wasn't any noises... just heat.  Top speed is 50 mph.

Help me!! :)

James
