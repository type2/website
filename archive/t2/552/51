Ok.  So I ran out of gas.  

So it is bogging down or cutting out or loosing power? 

What are the symptoms, you ask?  It feels like the clutch is skipping,
but it and the flywheel only have 35k miles, and I don't have any
trouble shifting gears.

Clutch is skipping or slipping? Maybe your clutch needs adjustment? 

I'd guess you had junk in the bottom of the tank that got picked up by the fule filter. Try that first. Check adjustment of the clutch while your under there.
