Sugar in your gas tank would be very bad. If you even suspect it, drain your tank and the entire fuel system, flush it out once and refill with good fuel. Maybe try some fuel injector cleaner. White smoke would normally be excess fuel, I don't know if sugar would caues that. You couldn't have actual steam from an aircooled engine. This happens on water-coolers when the head gasket leaks allowing radiator water to leak into the cylinders.
