You don't have to remove the shift linkage or the battery strap.  And I 
believe the axles end up supporting the tranny anyways.  It probably 
isn't the best thing for the CVs, but I'd venture to guess that they get 
a lot more strain on them than 60 pounds of static weight on them for a 
couple hours.  Every time I do the job I just lower the tranny with the 
engine, pull the engine, work on it, put it back in, jack the whole 
thing up.

If you do plan on taking out for a length period of time, yes, it would 
probably be a good idea to support the tranny, either by lifting it back 
up to it's hanger or supporting it with something else (chain/jack).

good luck.
