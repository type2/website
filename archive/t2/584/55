Subject: Tank Rust

Thanks to everyone that answered my questions. I guess I will go on safari 
for the ospho and leave the naval jelly in it's hiding place. Next time I 
pull the engine I will be prepared to clean it again and seal it. No need 
for a new one yet this tank is actually in great shape. I did som fishing 
around in there and what I though was mostly rust was a light film of rust 
and dirt so it might be an easier clean up than expected.
