>Dumb question but...... have you checked the fuse in the transformer??

Yep, checked the fuse first thing.  I am an electrical
inspector/engineer so I have access to the equipment to test the little
transformer in the converter.  The transformer is definitely bad.  I
checked into getting a transformer custom wound and it would cost over
80 bucks to have one made.  That might be my only option if I can't find
a good stock setup....

Off to the pick and pull tomorrow!
