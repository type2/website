Chris,

Type 1 and type 4 engines have almost *no* interchangeable parts.
In other words, headers and mufflers for a t1 will *not* fit a t4.


You will never be able to generate enough electric heat to keep warm 
with a battery...this has been discussed on the list endlessssssssly.

Hot jet coating headers *is* supposed to reduce radiated heat from the 
headers quite a bit.  From 750 to 300 degrees.

If your heat exchangers  are in good shape, leave them on...you won't 
regret it, and you will stay warmer in the long run....

Cheers, dave
