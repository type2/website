Subject: New Rings on Old Pistons?

Hi Folks,

The heads are off my Type 4 engine for replacement, and I'm pulling other 
things apart to clean and re-seal.  Since I'm pulling the cylinders off to 
clean the outside, deck volume, and piston tops, I was curious what the 
conventional wisdom is about using the old rings vs. replacing them with new 
ones.  The old ones only have 25,000 miles on them -- do they really need to 
be replaced?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.  Happy 4th of July!
