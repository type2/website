Subject: Re: Bus for sale

Correction: The ball joints need replacing. I did the tie rods... 

Greg sent a nice message encouraging me to keep the bus. I love the
bus community!!! Any other group would be "so?"

Here's my response to him:
"I really don't *WANT* to. But the bus coming down made me stop and
look at the big picture.

"I bought the bus to enhance my life. So far, all it's done is suck the
life out of me. Nearly every day off is spent tinkering with the bus.
Rarely accomplishing anything. I thought of all those days I could
have spent with my family instead of with the bus. I then realized I
needed to cut my losses and get back to what's important."
