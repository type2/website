Hogan,

 From recent experience... If the vapor system is truly sealed including 
linking the lines that one hooked to the missing charcoal canister, 
you've got another problem developing. 

The day after I found and replaced all of the leaky hoses linking the 
lines (I already had linked the two canister hoses together as it was 
missing) I filled up and went on a small 15 mile trip.  10 miles down 
the line the engine started dying like the fuel pump quit.  About that 
time cylinder head temp started rising fast.

I pulled off the road and the engine idled smooth and temp started 
dropping.  As soon as I got back on the road it started dying again.

I did a lot of poking around but the figurative light came on when I 
pulled the gas cap and heard a whoosh-thunk as air sucked in and the gas 
tank popped back into shape.  I finished the trip with a vent line 
opened but loosely wrapped in case of fuel spillage.  The next day a 
charcoal can was found and installed.  No problem since.
