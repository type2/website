I bought a '73 (I think it was a 73) from a guy cheap, it wouldn't start 
(it had seats for 9 and a good bit of rust). He was getting ready to pull 
the engine and ran out of enthusiasm. He & a friend had disconnected 
everything they could find on the engine & stopped when I bought it.
After I figured out where everything went I tried to start it, cranked but 
no start.
I checked the condenser... as I recall with the points closed, power on use 
something to push the points apart. A weak little spark is good a bright 
heavy spark is bad.
It had a bad condenser, put a new one on & it fired up and ran well.
