Don,

Our local VW club does "techie" days where they take some club member's VW
(bug or bus) and everyone works on some aspect of it.  Sort of a "get greasy
and learn" thing.  The driver's payment for services rendered is usually
food, drink and the parts.

Maybe there's a local club that could help you out with the bus.
