Subject: Driveshaft Problem

Hello

I'm hoping someone can help, i was traveling to a local VW event yesterday
when i sudenly heard a noise like a piece of cardboard in the wheel of a
bike, this quickly turned into a loud thumping noise.  I pulled to the side
of the road to find the driveshaft had come away from the wheel side.  On
closer inspection i found that one of the bolts had completly sheered off,
My first problem is trying to remove the the sheered bolt.  The second and
what i am posting this e-mail about is what can possibly have caused these?
Is it just possible i have clipped a kerp sheering one bolt and over time
the rest have worked free, or is it likely to be something much more
serious?

Any tips/advise on checking & inspecting as i don't want to fix it back up
for the same to happen again?

Many thanks
