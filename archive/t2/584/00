Subject: What's wrong with it now.

My '78 campmobile won't start.

The engine turns over. If I push open the flap in the airflow meter, 
fuel circulates. All fuses in the fuse box are intact.

After turning over the engine my coil was pretty warm to the touch, so 
I checked the spark from the coil. It appears I have no spark. I 
thought the coil must be the problem so I installed a new one. 
Evidently the coil wasn't the problem. Still no spark.

Any ideas? Thanks.
