Subject: RE: [T2] Tank Rust after firewall pull.

I was going to do the Muriatic acid, but I don't want to now if I will have 
to seal it right away, too. I was wondering about putting some type of 
lubricant or something in there until I replace it and fill it up with fuel. 
ie WD-40, marvel Mystery Oil, Sea Foam, Snake Oil.
