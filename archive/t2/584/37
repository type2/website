Subject: RE: [T2] Tank Rust after firewall pull.

I was wondering about that. See I would clean it coat it with some thing 
that would mix with the gas and not contaminate it like Marvel Mystery Oil. 
Just for a couple of days until I reinstall it. I will have access to 
pulling it again in the near future when I build the replacement for the 
GEX. Little rust little worrie but I would like to clean it out of there for 
now and clean and seal it later when I have the time and the cash. I 
exhausting the rest of my budget to get the bus running/driving before I 
move.

Any suggestions?
