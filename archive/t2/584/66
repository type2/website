There's something wrong here. You should get little or
no change when you pull the vacuum line at idle. I
suspect the dist is idling at full advance for some
reason. Did you check the max advance? In the picture
it looks like you attached the vacuum line at the
correct place but your symptoms sound like it's
getting manifold vacuum.
