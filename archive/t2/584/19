Subject: bus sightings

Several buses were sighted today in Jonesboro, Arkansas.
The first was a sage green westy heading north on 63.
Another, a light blue and white westy deluxe was parked at the Parker Rd.
Wal-Mart, and next door at KFC was an orange westy.  Would any of these
happen to be list members?
