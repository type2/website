Yes. The bolts all worked free and then you sheared off the last one.
You should check the cv bolt torque a few times after you work on them and
then probably good to have a look when you adjust the brakes and change
the oil.

You may have munged up the threads a little.
You should be able back the sheared off bolt without too much trouble.
You may want to remove the stub axle to work on it. I think its easier
that way and you will be able to chase the threads with a tap if they need
it.
