Subject: Westfakia Gauge install

Hi Volks,

Just thought I'd brag a bit about my afternoon's entertainment... I 
took a hole-saw to my dashboard and put in three VDO cockpit gauges.  
The CHT gauge I bought from GermanSupply.com was moved from the clock 
pod to the left side of the trio, and was complemented by an oil 
pressure gauge and voltmeter sent to me by Mike Visket. I may 
eventually swap out the voltmeter for an oil temp gauge, but since I 
don't have a sender for it the oil temp gauge it will have to wait. And 
besides, the voltmeter will help to keep track of the draw coming off 
the dual battery system.

Here are the pics:

Question: the gauges that Mike sent me need new light bulbs. Are these 
available at a typical FLAPS or will I need to order them special?

Also: Mike, can you send me a p-mail, thanks!

Happy trails,
