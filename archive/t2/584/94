Subject: RE: [T2] Mild Backfires. 

Oh, btw. It sounds like a domestic car. Nice and low and kinda loudish.
It idles REALLY smooth, and doesn't sound bad at all. Idling at 900rpm
nice and steady, no fluxuating at all. Oh, and it only
backfires/sputters when you START accelerating/decelerating. Once your
really into it, it's fine. Backed out my steep drive no probs (well,
spun the tires becouse I couldn't get traction in the dirt, but. . . .)

Well, it was KINDA a prob, 'couse for those of you who've followed know,
I don't have a gas pedal, but I found out that I DO have the cable, and
the thingie it connects to, so I had to shove a stick down the hole to
apply gas! Lol! It wasn't the smoothest back-up job I've ever pulled,
but it was the FIRST time I've seen it drive on it's own power! Backing
down the road to straighten out, and re-parking it on the parking strip
went good. Didn't need to apply gas. Just slipped the clutch a bit. That
kinda relieves me of the worries I had about the low power output. I
think I'm gonna like the amount of power it has. :) 

Cheers again, 
Chris
