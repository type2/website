Yuppers, those were the buggers that got me the first time I tried to
remove the firewall.  :)

Yeah, I had hose left over from when I replaced the fuel return line on
my diesel truck.  Richard's site is the one that helped me find the
hidden on by the (former) spare tire well.  In all I think I replaced 8
pieces of hose.  4 by the tank, 1 by the tire well, 3 by rear access
door.  I felt all along the vapor hard lines and replaced any rubber I
found.

though.  I'll just go by mileage or keep it more than half full.  ;)
