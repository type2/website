Subject: Killing mold?

Some of you may remember when I bought my 73. I complained that it
stunk from seal leaks and someone living in it for a long time.

Generous amounts of Meguiar's version of FeBreeze and leaving the
windows open had reduced the smell to tolerable levels (and removing
the curtains and carpet helped as well).

Yesterday I finally decided to start reupholstering things. I started
with the jumpseat cushions, since I had 2" foam I could use on those
(I want solid 5&6" foam for the bed).

Cushion before messing with it:

After cutting off both layers of upholstery (the original gold stuff
was under there) I found the foam had turned to dust:

Now the mold:

I soaked the board in bleach overnight. I plan on sanding it today and
painting it. Is this worth my time? Or is the mold just gonna keep
coming back if I don't replace the wood?

Also, if anybody has a line on CHEAP 5" & 6" foam for the bed, I'd
greatly appreciate it. I found soft foam on eBay for around $100 +
shipping (lots of shipping!), but am hoping for even cheaper. I can't
help but wonder if we couldn't do a group buy of good firm foam and
get it cheap enough...
