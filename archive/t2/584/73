Subject: RE: [T2] Extreme Exhaust Leak!

Exhaust problems can almost always be fixed by the owner:
 
1) You probably need to replace the copper gaskets.
2) Check the exhaust ports for smooth surfaces where the gaskets go. Are these new/rebuilt or previously used heads?
3) Any pipes which were disconnected must have new gaskets. You can get these from the usual online vendors.
4) Make sure all the hanging brackets are attached.
5) Make all the nuts are tightened up. Be VERY careful of the nuts on the exhaust studs, you can pull the studs out of the heads with only a little extra torque.
 
Good Luck,
