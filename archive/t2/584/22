Subject: Re: [T2] Re: CHT Gauge Accuracy

Hi Bob,

I am running a new sensor in the gauge on my bus and am getting similar 
readings... a lot higher than the last 2 sensors I've had. I don't yet 
have an oil temp gauge, but oil temps respond much slower than head 
temps.

BUT... At the same time I changed the CHT sensor I also changed over to 
FI. So there are a few other issues I'm going to look into before I 
blame the gauge. It might be a clogged injector, or an intake leak on 
the runner or the gasket between it and the plenum.

Happy trails,
