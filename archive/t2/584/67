Did you try We-R-Fabrics in Mission Viejo?

I don't think that anyone should replace foam from campers with 
identical pieces of same-weight foam. Instead, build up three or four 
layers. The bottom layer, about 1/2-3/4 inch, should be the kind of 
dense foam sold as cheap sleeping foam for backpacking. On top of that, 
a foam (1-1/2" to 2-1/2" depending on year and make of camper) slightly 
softer than was found in original campers. On top of that, put two or 
more layers of batting. Or. if you have the money, memory foam.

Layering the foams will lead to a more harmonious outcome.
