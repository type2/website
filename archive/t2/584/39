Subject: RE: [T2] Tank Rust after firewall pull.

Ahh, if it's just for a couple days it's no biggie. Just wash it with
whatever your going to wash it with, rince it with water, and use a heat
gun to dry it. Or just rince it with Acetone or Laquer Thinner or
something that evaps super fast. Then just keep it indoors. Shouldn't
rust a bit as long as it's inside and dried thoroghly (man, I need a
spell checker). Not in a few days anyhows. :) Or if your REALLY worried
about it, get a package of Dececant (sp?) at G.I. Joes or something.
They make these bigs bags of it for RV's. You can just cut it open and
pour the beads inside, then seal it up tight. It's stay SUPER dry in
their then, witch will make the rusting STUPIDLY slow, if it happens at
all. Just make sure no kids or animals get near the stuff. I believe
it's fairly toxic. 

Yeah, now that I think of it, I'd go the dececant route. Wal-Mart
probably carries the stuff too. I don't think they cost much either.
Like $10 - $20 I think. That or just leave it bare.
