Subject: FW: Shifter problem  -- FIXED

Thanks to those who responded
I started at the front and worked to the rear as suggested. I removed the
shift rod and idnt see anything broken/missing or anything like that. So I
cleaned those parts off and gave them some fresh grease and reinstalled. My
wife then helped by moving the shift rod while I was under the bus checking
everything. She made sure to crack a few 'floppy rod' jokes. Anyway, turned
out to be a bushing at the rear. it had twisted slightly and was prevented
my getting into 1st or 3rd. I moved it back into place until I can locate a
new one. Quick spin around the block and its all better. Thanks!
