Subject: Re: [T2] Crazy Rays' burns

I was at both locations today. Only the two water leaker Vanagons around
that have been in Jessup for a few weeks now. The fire was actually not at
Crazy Ray's but at the used parts place next door. However, the fire knocked
out their phone service and electricity. Still, they are open for business.
But the only air cooled vehicle I saw today was a bug at the Jessup
location.
