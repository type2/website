Subject: Rusty tank

You know, I messed around with a rusty tank on a
vanagon.  Did the phosphoric acid, the acid and
gravel, then gave up and bought a NEW tank from a
vendor.... and each time, even after the new
tank, the rust came back.  

Finally, a friend said he had a friend who could
fix it.... GUARANTEED.  He fixed up old bikes,
from Harley's to Motoguzzi's and replacing the
tank on some of these isn't an option.  Anyway, I
paid the dude something like $30 and he pours
some something in it that looked like a red
shellac.  Never had another problem. 

I would definitely seal any tank that I had out
of one of my buses.  Unfortunately, I don't know
the product.  I think it was homebrewed.  Maybe
checking around with your local motorcycle guys
will net good results.  

If you have no luck, email me offlist.  I will
try to contact the guy (I'm no 2000 miles from
him) and get some insight on what it was he used
to seal the tank.
