Subject: Source for fuel tank vent tube elbow ('72 Bus)

Hi all,
     While my engine and tranny were out I decided to poke around the 
fuel tank area (behind the firewall)    Upon looking into this area I 
have found the rubber vent tube elbow completely destroyed.(See Item #8 
on the following Microfiche 
http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/Microfiche/t202110.gif )

I think that the part number is 211 201 157 A
	
	Anyone know of a source for this item or equivilant? It basically needs 
to be a molded rubber elbow that will fit over approx .520" tube. If 
anyone has any ideas, please chime in as I am desperate.

-Jeff
