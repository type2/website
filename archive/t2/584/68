While looking for a source of "VW Brake Cylinder paste,"
it occurred to me that anything suitable for lubricating
the internal brake hydraulic rubber seals might also
be usable for other rubber seals without chemically
damaging rubber.   In any case, I haven't found any clues
regarding a suitable substitute for  "VW Brake Cylinder paste"
other than a brief mention of  "PBR rubber grease" on a
webstore.  I'm wondering if a bit of Dot 5 silicone brake fluid
may be usable on rubber.  . . .don't know.
