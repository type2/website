you might find the bolt is actually not in there very tight now that
the head of the bolt is sheared off. sometimes those things are not
that tight after failure of this sort. if it is I'd try to soak it in
a penetrating oil first and see if it's possible to grab what's left
with vice-grips.

I don't think this would be the problem. the shaft only transfers
power to the wheels, while the wheel assembly is held by the torsion
plates. IIRC there are several different combinations of
bolt/retainers out there for the CV joins. Some have bend up tabs.
Some (like the ones on mine) have lock washers. You might have just
been unlucky this time.
