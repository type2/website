Subject: What's wrong with it now?

Thanks to every one who responded to my inquiry.

Faster-Laster suggested I check to see if the points had collapsed. 
Turns out they had. The little plastic bit on the points that rides on 
the cam and pushes them open and shut had melted away almost 
completely! Also, the contacts were very badly pitted.

I suspect I may possibly have had the wrong coil installed.  The points 
only had a couple of hundred miles on them. There's no way to identify 
the old coil (no label or other manufacturer ID) but it sure doesn't 
look at all like the new one. I just had this engine rebuilt by a local 
guy, and I am now discovering that he may not have been too particular 
about his work.

I'll get a new set of points next week, and hopefully the problem will 
be solved.
