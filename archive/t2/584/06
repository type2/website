Then Gary Akers spewed forth voluminously:
I salvaged a white-on-blue sticker off my 1971 Westfalia Brake servo which
says:
v
Bremsgerat T 51           (the a has 2 dots over it)
3.6142-1202.4
ALFRED TEVES GMBH FRANKFURT/M.
v
I found this OE part# 211 612 103 A in catalog (-at-)  www.ate.de
Is this the new one or the old one?  Was the original 73-79 servo
10 inches in diameter or 9 inches?  Is this replacement ATE
part suitable for any type II, both or neither. Source of confusion
is that from archives, I would have expected an 8inch ATE for
early and a 10inch Bendix servo for late busses.  What will
9inch T52 part below fit? Will pushrod clearance be close enough?
*Iff* it bolts on right on a '71 and a *little* rubbing on the handbrake
cable is the *only* problem, I'm thinking of using it on a '71.

If I'm wrong, I'm [ouch] out close to $400 and a rebuilt unit goes
on instead;  If I'm right I get a factory new servo on my '71
