Subject: RE: [T2] Re: CHT Gauge Accuracy

I have recently found these gauges for aircraft, and think they may benefit
us.

VDO gauges are also sold here, but I am considering the fact that these
approved gauges especailly might work well.
One could also monitor 2 or more cyls with the dual models, and one reads as
a four?
