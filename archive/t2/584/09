Subject: How to find TDC- Update!!

Hi Everyone,

I wanted to sincerely thank you for the advice regarding my '74 non-starting
problem.  It is now up and roaring!!!

Andy wrote a great e-mail which finally made everything clear to me.... I
want to quote Andy here for the archives as his letter, along with all the
great advice from you guys, helped me solve the problem.

Andy says:

"beware. all distributors are not the same. some are 180 degrees backward
(using the 'notch' as a reference)
also you cant trust that the drive gear is in right.

find tdc. if you cant do it with the marks then pull the plug on #1,
stick a pencil or stick in there and rotate the engine until you find the
top.
#1 firing position is at TDC when both valves on #1 are closed. The rotor
will need to point to the wire for #1 then. Regardless of notches or
position of the distibutor.
The wires go round the cap clockwise 1432.
that should get you close enough to set the timing."

My distributor is 180 degrees off.  So after finding TDC using the both
valves closed on #1 method,
I adjusted the wires accordingly and it started right up!!

To my dismay though, I didn't realize there were crush seals between the
heat exchangers and the heads, I now have huge exhaust leaks from underneath
the engine!

Oh well, at least it's running now and I can replace the seals after the
holiday...

Thanks again guys!

-Tom
