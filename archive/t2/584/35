Ospho, available at H-D or Lowes.  The active ingredient: phosphoric acid,
reacts with rust to convert it to iron phosphate.  Will also react with iron
to make iron phosphate, but much slower.  Phosphoric acid is also the active
ingredient in naval jelly.

Fe2O3 = rust
H3PO4 = phosphoric acid
Fe = iron
H2O = water
H2 = hydrogen (gas)

Fe2O3 + H3PO4 ---> Fe2PO4 + H2O

2Fe + H3PO4 ---> Fe2PO4 + H2 (bubbles)

The iron phosphate will form a hard intact black colored film that stays
bonded to the iron, better than iron oxide, which flakes off.

Byproducts are environmentally safe (basically water and fertilizer).
Phosphoric acid is an ingredient in many beverages.  Fumes will cause
irritation.
