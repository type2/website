Don,

Sorry to hear about your problem, but I'm glad to see that you were 
able to type the message in person.

Take a deep breath, and let the moment pass. Savour the invigoration of 
a near brush with mortality.

Now take stock of what you have invested, and what you've learned 
already.

Take another deep breath, and let the moment pass. Re-read some bus 
haiku.

Don't sell it yet, is all I'm saying.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
