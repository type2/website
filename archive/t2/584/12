You did undo the screws from underneath the car, right?  That always 
helps.  I believe it does help to lower the engine a hair first.

Make sure that's fuel rated hose!  You don't want it deteriorating on 
you.  I used FI hose with fresh clamps just to be safe.  Also, don't 
forget to get the hose on the left side of the engine bay.  You might 
also have one by your computer on the right side, but I don't remember 
seeing one there.  Check Richard's site because he's got pix of all the 
hose connections.  Replace them all while you're at it.

Your sender is probably dying.  Heck, fix that while you've got the 
firewall off.
