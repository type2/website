Subject: Anyone change Ball-joints recently?

Anyone change ball-joints recently and safe a 20mm nut from the old ones?  My
new ones I swapped for didn't come with two of the nuts.  I found one in my
box but still need another nut.  I've been every where looking for a 20mm1.5
pitch and no one has them.
