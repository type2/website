Fill an appropriate (aquarium to 55 gal. drum) container with water and
Washing Soda (Arm and Hammer in the laundry aisle at the A&P...)
Connect the negative cable of a battery charger to the object to be
derusted...
Connect the positive cable to a sacrificial scrap of steel...
Dip both objects into the solution...
Switch on!
Watch the rust dissolve!!
One more point...When the object is removed from the solution,
it will re-rust quickly...So drying and immediately priming is in 
order... :-)
