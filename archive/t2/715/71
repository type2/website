Subject: Re: [T2] lighter size?

Dino
This lighter socket you have,, is it smaller than a north american vehicle's
lighter?  Is the socket Silver in colour? Is it located under the glove box ,,
center of the right side of the dash?

If so,, there is tons of info in the archive about the "silver socket"  .. it
was used for the accessories like the chandelier, and the air pump,  etc

I don't think they made a lighter element for that socket.. could be wrong tho..
