I've been mostly taking 10 to 20 mile runs up and down old Rt66, between 
Flagstaff Az & Walnut Canyon. The speed limit is 55 mph most of the way with 
some gentle and a few short steep hills. I've been varying speeds between 35 
and 55 on this nearly abandoned stretch of highway. You're right, this is 
probably only slightly more than babying it.

I'm not sure I have enough confidence to get above 55 yet, too many unproven 
parts for my liking to put them under load without some more break in miles. 
Haven't even gone through the brake system yet, although they seem to work 
ok. Maybe by the time I get another 100 to 200 miles I'll trust it enough to 
push it a little and see how the plugs look.

Thanks for the advise,
