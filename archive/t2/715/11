Subject: Oil cooler condition?

Hello listers,

How do I check the condition of my oil cooler ('83 air-cooled 2.0
liter)? The manual said to look for metal shavings in the oil... there
were none. The cooler just looks old and decrepit, though, and along
with the rest of the engine is coated in orange clay-like mud. That
engine dropped a valve, presumably from overheating...?

Can I test it in any way while I have the engine out?

Cheers!
Mike.
