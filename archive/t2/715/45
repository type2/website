<Or if you happen to be in the pacific north west, there is a well known tire
chain called Les Schwab.  If you ever find yourself with a set of their
tires, they will patch them for free, for the life of the tire.  They also
remove their tires, install their tires, and balance their tires free of
charge.>

Sam's Wholesale does this too. Service at any Walmart.
