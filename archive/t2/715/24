Subject: Re: [T2] electrolytic rust removal

If there's any rust at all between the rim and the tire you WILL
weaken the seating of the bead and make the tires unsafe.

Put your bus on jacks, toss the wheel/tire combos in somebody's Honduh
and have WalMart remove them. Treat and paint your wheels then have
the tires remounted. Just make sure you don't paint where the bead of
the tire goes. You want rubber to metal there for safety. You can
treat it with oil or WD40 if it will be more than a day before you get
to have the tires remounted. Don't forget to wipe them off or have the
shop clean the rim there so there's no oils to cause trouble.
