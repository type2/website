Subject: westy interior moulding

Does anyone know where to get the black moulding that goes around all 
the cabinetry.  Mine has cracked and shrunk and it would be nice to redo 
it.  If I remember correctly, there are two types, the black moulding 
that goes around parts like the sink top and on the edges of some of the 
cabinets and the other type that is on the inside of the cubby holes and 
the inside of doors.  any help would be appreciated!

thanks,
Mike
