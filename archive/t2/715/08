Subject: Re: [T2] what happens if you don't change your oil in 10,000

An old guy gave me some advice: change your oil whenever you can't read the writing or hatch marks on the dipstick or 3000 miles - whichever came first. Of course my VW's don't have bit one mark on the dipstick - only a full mark. <grin!> 

Anyhow this guy got major miles out a Corvair engine (160K+) without lower end rebuilds back when other folks were dumping cars with 100K miles because they were "worn out". He had to rebuild the heads twice per lower end of course just like alot of VW folks. 

Not real scientific but one I've taken to heart. When I buy a car/van/motorcycle I service it and change the oil and filter again once it gets dirty no matter what the mileage. I've tried alot of the additives and have no scientific proof but all seemed to hasten the end of my engine. But then again I added them to engines that were beginning to show evidence of problems... Take THAT with a grain of salt. <grin!>
