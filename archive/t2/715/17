Suggestions, if you don't get offers of free nuts:

Used:
I'd try Ken Madson, sales(-at-)thebusco.com -- he keeps a very impressive inventory
of used Bus parts, including the kinds of things that most vendors seem to
consider too small to be worth keeping track of.

New:
Tacoma Screw, 1-800-562-8192.  They're reputed to have more oddball nuts and
bolts than just about anyone else.
