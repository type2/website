Subject: lighter size?

Hello,  I was wondering if someone might know of a replacement for a lost 
lighter (72 bus).  I was going to the scrap/junk yard soon and was wondering if 
someone might know another vehicle that has the same lighter size.  Mine has 
been missing for sometime. I just can never seem to find the right size lighter.
Thanks
