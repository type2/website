Subject: Tires factory balance - myth?

At our local Corvair club meeting last night two of the veterans told me that tires come with a colored dot added at the factory which indicates the lightest spot. This is supposed to be lined up with the valve stem to give the owner the best balanced tires with the minimum weights. One of the fellows said he's got a set of tires (cheap ones too) that didn't even require ANY weights using this method...

Myth? Urban Legend? Anyone?
