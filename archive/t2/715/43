Or if you happen to be in the pacific north west, there is a well known tire
chain called Les Schwab.  If you ever find yourself with a set of their
tires, they will patch them for free, for the life of the tire.  They also
remove their tires, install their tires, and balance their tires free of
charge.  The catch of course,.. is that you buy their tires.

  Similar shops with service like this would make the treatment of bus rims
(rust removal, surface prep/paint, i.e. conditioning) professional, quick,
and exacting for anything that rolls.  Especially convenient if you are
mixing and matching rims between your commuter bus and your parts bus(es).
