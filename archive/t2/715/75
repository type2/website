Subject: Re: [T2] Why lean destroys ?

Somebody go ahead and correct me... <grin!> This is how I answered the question for myself.

Imagine an oxy-acetylene torch. When the torch is lean on oxygen and rich on acetylene fuel it smokes and is "cold". Too cold to do much with. Add oxygen, lean the fuel and it turns blue (or several other colors) and becomes hot enough to melt with, cut with, and weld with (controlled melting!). You don't want to melt the pistons, valves, etc. Of course there is a narrow range where the gasoline burns with max efficiency which more or less equals the max power range (actually slightly rich is the max power area), etc. 

So you've got to pick a temperature that your engine can handle, your wallet can handle (cost of fuel), and one that won't pollute it's oil or our air too badly.
