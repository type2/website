Subject: Re: [T2] Fiberglass hightop

Being a lover of my hightop and hightops in general I have a few thoughts...

I really like the 4 screened windows in my hightop, but I wish there was one 
in the back like some of the Safare tops. The way the windows in my top are 
assembled a metal channel sits on the inside and the windows essentially 
sandwich the fiberglass. You might want to consider what windows you could 
graft into the top, possibly you could use a sliding window from a truck bed 
cap. You could probably also do an aftermarket sunroof too, that would be 
real neat.

The idea of skis, etc. up top sounds like a good idea, but as I heard from 
other listees years ago, in the event of an accident anything that isn't 
strapped down becomes a missle. I would stray from open shelving, unless 
just used while camping. The thing I like about the hightop the best, aside 
from being able to stand up in the bus at any time, is when we are camping I 
can toss all my bedding and clothes up top during the day while we are 
sitting in the bus. I think you should keep it pretty open so you can stuff 
things up there. On the other hand a nice flat cabinet grafted into the roof 
would be nice.

I could go on probably but won't. I think there would be a market for a good 
hightop. There are a couple of guys on the Full Moon list that are looking 
for tops right now.

Keep us posted!!
