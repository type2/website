Subject: 1977 Bus, metal sunroof, camper interior...what's it worth?

Hello list,

I need to sell my 1977 Bus and am trying to find out what it's value is.  It's in the southern
California (Los Angeles area) and  has a low milleage rebuilt engine, good body, and has a
Westphalia interior from a 1978 bus that I bought and installed.  I never hooked up the camper
electric parts and thus never used the refrigerator, but everything is there as far as I know.
Because you can't buy new sunroof cables I took them out and put a large handle and rubber latches
on the inside of the sunroof, and use it manually.  I've owned this car for more than 10 years but
only drove it regularly the first 2 years...then I bought a Vanagon and used the 1977 only
sporatically.  It's one of those cars that always starts, no matter how long it's been sitting.

I think that the sunroof and camper combination is pretty rare, but I'm not sure how much to ask for
this bus.  Can someone point me in the right direction.

Regards,   John
