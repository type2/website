Jason,

I skipped taking my bus to a show because I thought my dwell numbers were 
way off...and I had a problem that I didn't have time to fix.

Pertronix and the other folks will tell you to ignore any dwell numbers 
you see.....so I quit looking at mine!

I installed one of Ron's optical points and the numbers are even more 
different than the differences between the pertronix's...I have several 
installed and they all say different things!

The cars(and buses) run great tho.


Cheers, dave
