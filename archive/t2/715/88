Subject: [T2] Engine install update, 100miles

According to Tom Wilson in his book How To Rebuild Your Air Cooled VW; The
proper method for running a newly rebuilt engine in is to run it in your
drive for 20 minutes at 2000 rpms. (The purpose of this is to break in the
cam, lifters, rings properly at a constant heat and stress.)
Ignore the thrashing, smoking etc. If you need to  kill the engine and
adjust the timing, carbs, FI then start the 20 minute run over again.
After the initial run in, change the oil, filter and clean the strainer.
I also use a big magnet on the strainer plate to catch iron powder from the
rings, cylinder walls, cams and lifters. It catches lots of magnetic stuff
in the strainer plate area during the break in period.
Once the 20 minute and the first oil change you should just drive it
normally around town trying to keep the rpms up in the 2000 rpm range by
stretching the gears through your common speed ranges.
After several hundred miles change the oil and filter again.
After 1000 miles change the oil and filter again and then move on to your 3K
/ 4K regular routine changes.
The most critical thing in a new engine is try not to overheat it. Keeping
the RPMS up to  about 2000 at stop lights seems to get enough air flow to
everything to make the engine run cool.
