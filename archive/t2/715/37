Todd,

I have done it on bug wheels with excellent results.

Lots of short pieces of masking tape and newspapers will mask the tire off 
pretty well....or....you can pick up some thin aluminum flashing at the 
hardware store and use it around the edge of the steel rim as a "mask".

Masking tape on the stem too.

Wheel must be clean, clean, clean....roughed up with sandpaper or wire 
wheel.  Use good spray paint and if you want it to *really* stay, a good 
primer first.

Cheers, dave

Do I want to have the tires removed before I paint the wheels? Or can I just leave them on and mask them?
