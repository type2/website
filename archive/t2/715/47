Todd,


I know someone is going to chew me out for this, but if they get that hot, 
you have a more serious(probably brake dragging or wheel bearing problem).

I have never seen my wheels get anywhere near that hot and I live in the 
Ozarks...plenty of hills on occasion.

Todd, if they get that hot, you probably are going to have tire problems 
as well!

I would skip taking them down to the metal, and I usually use MEK or paint 
prep to wipe them off before I paint them....as long as there is no grease
or tar type stuff, you will be fine.  Probably the biggest wear on them 
will be from washing them when you wash your bus!


Cheers, dave

My question is, do these wheels ever get really hot? I mean, I won't be racing 
my VW Bus.. hehe.. but if I decide to take it on a long trip to say the 
keys or something, do I have to worry about wheel temperatures damaing 
the paint? Or will what I've described above work well?
