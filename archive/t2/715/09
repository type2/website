Subject: Junkyards in PNW/Seattle area?

Do any of the Western WA folks on the list have favorite junkyards?  I need to
start looking for a used steering box for my '71, as the prices* I've been
quoted -- $550 (Wolfgang) or $455 (Bus Boys) for a rebuilt one -- are more
than I can afford.  I really don't even know where to begin to look.  I've
stopped into one or two junkyards in the past, just on a whim to see what they
had, but have never seen any Buses at all.

Many thanks!

* yes, that's including the core charge, but Wolfgang specifically said that
80% of the cores he gets back are worthless...
