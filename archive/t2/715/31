OC-28 is the 72-79 bus and early Vanagon filter.

I believe Mahle OC-47 maps to Mann W719/5 or Bosch 72211. If so, then you
are looking for a 80's VW inline 4-cyl gasoline engine filter. Ask for a 84
Scirocco or Rabbit filter and see if it matches.

You might also find one at the dealer as I belive Mann W719/5 maps to
056-115-561G. Read this compatibility description that leads me to belive
this is exactly the filter you need:
