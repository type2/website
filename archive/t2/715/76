Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Wheels

Here is what I did:

I took a large garbage bag for each wheel and wrapped each up in it, tie the 
string. Then I gently tore the center of the bag and deflated the tire 
somewhat. With a flat head screwdriver I wedged the torn edges of the bag 
between the tire and rim. This is super cheap to do and let's you paint the 
edge of the rim too. Once they have dried overnight deflate the tire even 
more and as you push the tire the bag will slip out again.

I found that duct tape leaves residue if left overnight and anything else 
won't stick good to a tire. Also after I had the bag wedged in the rim I 
taped the excess bag to itself so it didn't blow on my fresh paint.

You will have to paint the weights and that is cheesy but what I did for a 
quick spruce up. I also sandblasted my wheels first.

Good luck,
