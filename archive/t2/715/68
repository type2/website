Tom,

Give it some time!  Sooty black from what kind of driving?....around 
town...low rpm's...babying it?

Take it out and let it run at some high rpm's for a while...well maybe not 
high, but something reasonable.  Get it nice and warmed up/hot.  Then take 
it home and look at the plugs.

You might have a look at fuel pressure, just to make sure...

In my 78(then at 1200 miles on engine) after a 4 hour run at 75+, mine 
look textbook perfect.....maybe just a hair on the lean side.

Cheers, dave
