I second the rope lights, and I would go with some gunwale-type storage,
big enough to hold my snowboards, or skis and poles, or fishing rods,
etc.  A nice effect would be to put the rope lighting in the gunwales...

What else...  I would glass-in plenty of brackets in the ceiling - not
for anything specific, but just for miscellaneous mountings.  Like, I
think it would be cool to have brackets to use for an overhead surfboard
rack, maybe a mount for a swing-down LCD TV, speakers, stuff like that.
I say glass them in because it would look better than bolts sticking
through to the outside, plus be water-tight and rust-free.

Be sure to post pictures of the process and the finished product -
sounds like a lot of fun!  Maybe next you can build an actual boat-top
for it - engine mount and all!

So here is the question ... if you could design your OWN hightop (or
low-top, mid-top) are there any specific features that would be a MUST
in your eyes ?

Recessed indirect lighting via LED or rope lights. Basically movie
lighting. Enough light to eat or change clothes, not enough to read by.
Advantage: easy on the battery.
