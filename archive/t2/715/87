Having weights on both sides is dynamic balancing. The
best way to balance a wheel/tire is by spilting the
plane. A lot better than just putting weights on one
side. One side is nothing more than static bubble
balancing.

 Thanks Rob, actually... this brings up a REALLY
 REALLY good point. I have a
 few weights on my tires in a few places, and I was
 wondering... do I HAVE to
 have those weights on the outer part of the wheel?
 Is there any reason why
 they can't be mounted on the inside? I think it
 would make the wheels look
 soooo much nicer. I hate ugly wheel weights...
