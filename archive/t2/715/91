Subject: Anyone have any experience with Autohaus VW in Orchard Park,

Anyone have any experience with Autohaus VW in Orchard
Park, NY?  I am taking my 1975 bus their for a fuel
injection issue, and some other minor stuff.  I am
wondering if anyone has anything to say positive or
negative.  I could not find any other solution for my
bus's problems in that area, and I am a little
hesitant to have the work done by a VW stealership.  

And for the guy who always comes back and ask me if I
ditch the FI for carbs can he get my FI parts for his
daughter's 1975.  The answer is yes, if this does not
fix the FI its gone and I'm sure we can work it out

Thanks,
