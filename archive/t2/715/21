Subject: Westy insulation

During the reconstruction process of my 79 Westy, I've
been pondering the function of the fiberglass
insulation found in the sliding door, wall opposite,
rear hatch and roof of cab.

With all the single pane uninsulated glass and other
areas of bare metal that are not insulated, I'm
wondering what function this insulation really serves
and whether or not I should install it.

Currently I've installed a 1/8 inch sound deadening
product in the voids where the insulation would
normally go but I'd like to hear some folks' thoughts
about the fiberglass insulation and whether or not it
adds measurable protection against temperature
extremes.  Many thanks, Greg
