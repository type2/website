Subject: vanagon propane tank on 78 westy

I'm thinking of purchasing the vanagon propane tank from BusDepot and I 
wanted to know if anyone has done a similar swap on their late 
baywindow.  If so, did it work ok?  I figure I'll need to make a 
mounting bracket, but that shouldn't be too tough.  I'm more curious if 
it's any taller than the original tank.

Thanks,
Mike
