My top is coming off soon as well. I need to do some refurb on it. I
like the idea of glassing in the window holes and putting in whatever
I want. Those windows in there now leak horribly.

I'm going to put a temporary top on the bus when I take the high top
off. I've been batting around the idea of glassing a custom top that
can be swapped back and forth. One low top for daily driving, keeping
the high top for camping trips. Plus it will fit in my garage without
the high top. Bonus!
