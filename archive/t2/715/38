Then why create the bare space to tire? They would rust and rust would be 
bad right? If you oil it to protect it then the tire shops could use oil to 
install the tires right? But they don't and I can't begine to tell you how 
many painted wheels are out there. How did the VW wheels come from the 
factory?
