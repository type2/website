Subject: Re: [T2] Why lean destroys ?

Thanks for the answers.

The question is more chemistry than engines oriented. Question is :
why does a lean mixture burn hotter than a rich one ?

After some google'ing : the perfect mixture for air/fuel combustion is
achieved when the mixture is stoechiometric, that is the combustion
happens perfectly: no unburnt "air" or fuel remains after the
combustion. The stoechiometric ratio is about 14:1 for air:fuel.

When running rich (say 13:1) a fraction of the fuel does not burn.
Maybe this unburnt fuel grabs some heat from the burnt gases and
therefore we say that the engine "burns cooler". Any chemist here to
help us ?
