Subject: Re: [T2] Paint and/or process advice for westy pop-top?

I used that on my Safare top Don,

It was so easy to use I was toying with the idea of "modding" the 
Safare, glass over the window holes and mount different windows etc ... 
but my motivation ran out with winter.

Worked a treat. You'd be surprised at how easy it is to get that top 
off your bus, the hardest part was the screws were rather manky, but 
the sealant beneath was pretty much dust so she popped right off.

After a summer and a hard winter the top is still crack and pockmark 
free,  the patches and paint held up great.
