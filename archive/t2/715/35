Karl,

The Vanagon list is back up again.



Monkeyboy,

There is plenty of discussion about alternative fuels, engine 
conversions and energy policy on the Vanagon list.

I know that Snoopy is converting a 74 bus to diesel, you can see pics 
of the conversion online at www.fullmoonbusclub.com.

Happy trails,
