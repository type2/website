Subject: Sink Drawer Landyard

Hello,

Has any one ever seen a site that sells the plastic lanyard that keeps the 
sink drawer from flopping down (keeps it at a 90)?  I would like to get a new 
one that isn't brittle.  My son has broken two already. I have since made a 
little metal one.  I just thought it would be cool to have the original cheap 
plastic one.
Thanks,
