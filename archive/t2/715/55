Goodness, don't do that!  Keep the electronic ignition.  And, by all  
means, keep the vacuum advance distributor.

The only change in maintenance schedule when you have an electronic  
ignition is "don't have to replace points and condenser, don't have  
to gap points".  It saves you work, pure and simple, and your engine  
runs better in the long run because there are fewer moving parts to  
wear out (i.e. you dwell remains rock-solid).

I have a Pertronix in my Bus, and I see a constant dwell of roughly  
54 degrees.  Please double-check your dwell and follow up to the  
list.  (It certainly could be the case that different Hall effect  
ignition triggers have different dwell readings ... anyone have a  
Compufire that can share their dwell numbers for comparison?)
