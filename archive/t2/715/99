Subject: looking for intake elbow

Hi,
Would anyone have a spare intake boot, the fat S-shaped rubber elbow
that links the airflow meter to the throttle housing? Part number is
022-129-967AC, if that helps.

I'm also looking for a stock '75-'78 exhaust system (the parts after the
heat exchangers). (Doesn't hurt to ask...)

I'm in the US.  Thanks,

Sami
