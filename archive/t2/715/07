Have you considered using a fiberglass patch ala surfboard ding repair?


Yeah that is what i am going to have to do. I fixed it witht he heavy primer and though because I didn't use it, it might look good long term. However the next fix (paint the pop-top and from the beltline down) I'll fix it right. Yeah fiberglass will probably be a good fix here. Will take alot of work to patch it and then maintain the right contours to make the fix invisible.
