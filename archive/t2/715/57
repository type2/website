Subject: Engine install Update, 100 miles

My 80 vanagon is up to 100 miles on the odometer now. Checked the valves and
tune up yesterday with acceptable results. I think the rebuilder was maybe a
little conservative on the valve adjustment, but that's ok. Better too loose
than too tight. I have set them to 1 turn past contact. Timing and dwell are
still at spec. but things are running rich. Spark plugs look sooty black.

A few days ago I checked the c.o. levels and found them to be quite high. I
thought this might be the normal adjustment of a newly rebuilt AFM,
considering the rebuilder would be better off selling a unit that is adjusted
rich rather than lean, in case the buyer doesn't follow instructions and have
the unit adjusted for his particular engine. The best I could do with the
adjustment screw on the AFM was to decrease C.O. from 8.9 to 6.5. I had a
spare cold start valve so I checked the one that was in the intake and found
it to be leaking. The spare tested ok. After changing this out the c.o. is now
down to 5.9.

The injectors were all cleaned by CruzinPerformance and I tested them for
leaks and spray pattern before install, no problems there. Fuel tank and lines
were flushed and new filter installed as well as hoses replaced. I have
ordered a new temp sensor for the cylinder head and will try that as soon as I
get it. Haven't checked fuel pressure yet but intend to today.

Is there anything else I should be looking at? With the thieving prices of
gas, I realy don't want to be running this rich.
