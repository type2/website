It'll cost you an extra $20 or so per tire to have the tire removed and then reinstalled and balanced. I'd do it so I could inspect for rust... 

Otherwise deflate the tire, pull the valve stem off (rip it off), remove the weights, and then using your body weight and or a friend's jump up and down to push the tire off the rim (towards the center of the wheel). That way you can get paint all the way around the back of the lip. All to dry and take back to the tire shop to have a new stem, new weights, etc. installed. 

I have painted without doing any of this but the older I get, the picky-er I get...
