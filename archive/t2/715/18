Subject: Re: [T2] electrolytic rust removal 

Alright, let's say I want to use this method to remove rust from my bus
wheels (I do!), but I don't want to take off the tires (I don't!).  I
have all of the equipment needed to set up the system, including a
50-gallon plastic drum, and submersing the wheel/tire will be no problem
- I have a solution for that...

Is there any reason not to do this?  Could the cleaning-soda solution do
any damage to my tires in the few hours required to remove the rust?  I
would be painting the wheels as soon as the rust was gone, so no need to
worry about recurring rust.  Any other worries I'm not thinking of?
