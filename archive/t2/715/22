If you don't want to dismount rhe tires, are you planning to
at least dismount the wheels? :)
Just considering the relative ease of removing the tire and
the better job that would result from proper refinish of the
lip adjacent to the tire bead.
Otherwise, what is your rationale for not removing the tire?
Losing the original German air? :)
