The VWOA accessory lighters back then came with a
matching knob. The newer lighters are a slightly
different size inside and won't interchange. I've
tried to adapt the old knobs to the newer lighters and
have never found an easy way to do it. The old lighter
knobs screwed to the element using a little stud and
the new ones seem to be made together.
