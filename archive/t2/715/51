The VWOA accessory lighters back then came with a
matching knob. The newer lighters are a slightly
different size inside and won't interchange. I've
tried to adapt the old knobs to the newer lighters and
have never found an easy way to do it. The old lighter
knobs screwed to the element using a little stud and
the new ones seem to be made together.

I don't suppose you happen to have a web pic of what the original looked
like? Does anyone happen to have one?  What did the picture on the knob look
like?  Was it colored? (i.e. red variant for hazards, green variant for
defrost) or was it just black?  A lot of North American lighter assemblies
from the 70's had a lit cigarette picture on them, no guarantee that VW did
the same however.  I would love to see a pic if anybody has one.
Thankyou for the info Karl and Steve.
