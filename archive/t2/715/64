Subject: Fiberglass hightop: Was: Paint Poptop

As things are warming up and some time off is on the horizon I am 
thinking more and more about getting my act together to fab a cutom 
hightop for my bus, as a 2nd top to swap back and forth with my Safare. 
 From what I've been reading in my boat building book (common a hightop 
looks just like a boat) Its not really that hard and If I go that next 
step and actually make a foam mold on the bus I think I could even get 
creative with the fiberglass inside.

I've got some work winding down with presentation in LA at the end of 
April but after that I am going to take a month off and along with my 
engine work I think I will have a crack at some fiberglass mayhem.

By then it autta be warm enough here in Calgary to at least take the 
Safare off, again, and play.

So here is the question ... if you could design your OWN hightop (or 
low-top, mid-top) are there any specific features that would be a MUST 
in your eyes ?
