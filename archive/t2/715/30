Subject: Re: [T2] Biodiesel Anyone?

From: MonkeyBoy

 Hey hey, just wondering if anyone is running Biodiesel in their Diesel
busses. Or better yet, Straight Veggie Oil or SVO.

Well, not sure how many replies you will get to this question.  This is the type II
list for air cooled buses and early aircooled Vanagons. 

Not too many air cooled diesels out there :)

You will be better off asking at www.vanagon.com but I hear that gerry, the list server 
is down.
