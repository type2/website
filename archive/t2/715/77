Subject: Re: [T2] lighter size?

Hello Jamie,
No, it is not the socket under the glove box. I did seee the article on 
Ratwell's page (great web page). 
You are right, mine is abit smaller than the normal US models.  I always get 
a few from various cars. Never had any luck.  
I did once see a bus with a lighter that had the lit cigarette on the knob as 
someone had stated.  The placement is to the left of the ash tray (where the 
aux heater switch is located in the manual).  
I did take a whole unit from a newer VW.  It has the lit bezel.  It just 
doesn't look like it belongs.  I just wanted to note that I saw a complete 
stainless unit at a boat store which also had a map light in the knob (very heavy 
duty).  It was only about $10.  It looked old even though it was new.  
Thanks for the input,

This lighter socket you have,, is it smaller than a north american vehicle's
lighter?  Is the socket Silver in colour? Is it located under the glove box ,,
center of the right side of the dash?

If so,, there is tons of info in the archive about the "silver socket"  .. it
was used for the accessories like the chandelier, and the air pump,  etc

I don't think they made a lighter element for that socket.. could be wrong 
tho..
