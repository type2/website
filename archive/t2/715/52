Subject: Re: [T2] lighter size?

Casco Products was the original supplier to VOA for lighters installed
on US and Canadian Models, usually installed at the dealership at the
time of sale or optionally installed later.  Casco still offers
replacement elements and some assemblies that will fit most model VWs
thru 1979.  However, this is not the case with Vanagons and most
Watercooled VWs which use a slightly larger assembly (and larger hole
in the dash) which makes using the current aftermarket variety almost
impossible (or without some sort of modifying).

From my ye olde Dealer Accessories Book (all 12 volt):
ZVW 171 108 = Std Bug to 77, Super Btl 71-72
(Note:  This style was made to accomodate the padded dash)

ZVW 171 109 = Super Btl 73-79, Type 2 67-79, K Ghia 67-74, Type 3
67-73, Thing All
----------------------
ZVW 171 507 = Element, 12v All the above (I don't have the Casco #
handy at the moment).

Although a replacement knob isn't indicated in the book, experience
has shown that the head light knob from a Bug is usually the one to
use (VW 113 941 541 B), which as noted in a separate post is used with
a stud to rather uniquely attach it to the element.  VWG now makes the
knob cap with the "Zippo" Lighter Symbol to use with this knob.

I have found Casco Lighter Products in bubble pack hangin' around at
Pep Boys, but I'm sure it's at the other "fast food" parts stores like
Autozone, Kragen, Checker, Shucks, etc.  Thing to do is take your bad
element there and match it to the right one in the package.
