Subject: Fwd:Red Cup Ale Extension

Hi Volks,

Word from my buddy Adam is that the deadline for Everybus "Red Cup Ale" 
T-Shirts has been extended.

Here's the email he posted to the local bus list:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The good news: I am extending the deadline for the Red Cup Ale EB05
shirts. Seems my buyer wasn't on the ball this time, and the order
didn't get in yet...which means more time!

Better news: spaghetti tanks for the ladies are available!

Even better news: I will not be wearing a spaghetti tank.

Not-so-good news: The deadline is extended only until 12 midnight.
TONIGHT! (Tuesday, Mar 29)

The really-not-so-good news: I need more orders before I can break
even. As most of you are aware, I do this for "fun", so I don't have a
profit margin. Unfortunately this also means I end up losing my shirt
(literally) from time to time.

If you are interested in ordering, please visit
http://www.busesofthecorn.com/suburban for the pic. Orders must be
emailed to suburban(-at-)busesofthecorn.com with RED CUP in the subject
line.
Shirts are $12 s-XL, XXL & up are $15. girlie tanks are similarily
priced.

These are on a pre-order basis. I can't guarantee I will have any
shirts at the event. So please pre-order.

To those who have already ordered, you will recieve a confirmation
after the pre-order closes.

Thanks everyone for your continued support,
Adoom.
