Subject: Painting Wheels

Hey guys,

      I'm going to be re-painting my wheels white to match the top of my Bus. The wheels themselves are actually in pretty good shape, but I have almost new tires on them. Do I want to have the tires removed before I paint the wheels? Or can I just leave them on and mask them?


Thanks!

Todd
