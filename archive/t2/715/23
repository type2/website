Subject: Generic equivalent for a Mahle OC-47 filter?

I recently bought a new (at least to me) '71 Bus with an exterior oil cooler
and oil filter setup.  The existing filter is a Mahle\Knecht OC-47 which
doesn't seem to exist in the world as envisioned by the counter guy at my
FLAPS.  Cross-references for the filters my FLAPS carries don't include
obscure Austrian manufacturers and obviously I can't use the little "enter
your vehicle make, model, and year" gizmo that seems to be replacing catalogs
at parts stores these days.  I suspect that Mahle filters are used on some 72
and later VW engines so maybe one of you folks might have a clue as to a
reasonably available equivalent from a US manufacturer.   

Thanks,


Nick
