While I'm sure you'll get plenty of different suggestions, mine would be
"Anything But Fram", and also avoid Pennzoil and Quaker State (made 
by Fram).  Filters to look for (in no particular order) would be Mahle, Mann, 
Purolator, Wix, Hastings, K&N, Bosch  .. if all else fails, NAPA Gold is 
re-labeled WIX and easy to get.
