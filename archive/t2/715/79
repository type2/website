Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Wheels

Thanks Rob, actually... this brings up a REALLY REALLY good point. I have a
few weights on my tires in a few places, and I was wondering... do I HAVE to
have those weights on the outer part of the wheel? Is there any reason why
they can't be mounted on the inside? I think it would make the wheels look
soooo much nicer. I hate ugly wheel weights...


Just curious...

thanks for the advice!!

Todd
