Subject: UPDATE -  KONI Shock **NEW** Group Buy

It looks like the 2nd Koni group buy is now confirmed - and closed to any
additonal orders.

Koni has agreed to produce a second run for us, but only enough to cover
orders received by this morning's deadline.  Later today I will send an
individual email to each person whose order I received, to confirm receipt
of your order. If you are one of the few who are offered one of the few sets
currently on hand, your email will indicate that as well.  If you have not
received a confirming email from me by the end of the day, please e-mail me
with your website order confirmation number.

I cannot take any new orders at this point. I had hoped Koni could make some
extra sets for last-minute stragglers, but apparantly they have a limited
number of parts on hand to build fronts and are uninclined to order more.
(I'll bug them again just in case they change their minds, but I'm not
hopeful.)  I may be able to get some extra rears mid-summer, which I'll
offer at that time, but it looks like this will be it for fronts.

Unlike last time, when Koni sent me all 4 shocks at the same time, this time
I'm told I'll probably get them at least a month apart. They are estimating
somewhere around 8-10 weeks for the fronts, and about a month or so later
for the rears. Therefore I will probably ship the fronts and rears
separately as they arrive.
