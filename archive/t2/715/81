Subject: Why lean destroys ?

Burning rich will build carbon spots and often raise compression in
cylinders if run rich for a long time. Rich will also foul your spark plugs
and fill your ring lands with carbon, sludge and can blow by and contaminate
your oil with fuel.
Running lean on the other hand causes overheating of the cylinder head,
piston, it causes a clean burn on your spark plugs that is so hot it
prematurely fires your fuel and causes that pinging noise common to lean
burn. Sometimes the piston gets so hot it starts to seize in the cylinder
before it breaks the ring. It may sound like a wrist pin, grunion pin knock
but it's often the piston seizing. The seizing can ruin rod bearing because
it overloads them severely along with the main bearing most immediate to the
seizing piston rod assembly.
-----------------------
It is always best to address lean burn as quickly as possible by setting the
timing, cleaning the spark plugs, adjusting the AFM or setting the carb
jetting to the proper jets and float levels.
