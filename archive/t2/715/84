Subject: Help for 73 Westy stock carbs

My right carb lost a jet. It is the one that looks like a round brass
disk just above the arm that holds the main gas cone in the center of
the throat.

I have some donor carbs, but I have not been able to remove the piece
I need. Any ideas how to get it out?
