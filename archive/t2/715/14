Aside from the fact that I'd love to have it but have no $$? 

Uncommon models are hard to valuate because there are few to compare to.

Just give it to me. I promise to give it a good home! ;)

Seriously, you may have to eBay it to get a semi-accurate value.
Especially since there was one Westy that just went for $17k on eBay.
