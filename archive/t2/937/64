I had very similar problems and it turned out to be both a worn dizzy and a tired coil. Spark was weak. If you say the dizzy is new and in good order I would try the coil. What color is the spark? Do you have a spare coil that you know to be good to try? I would also check for vacuum leaks and manifold pressure. I run the SVDA from Aircooled.net and love it. I time my engine with the vacuum advance connected however...
