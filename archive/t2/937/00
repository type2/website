Subject: WInter Camping-VA-MD-DC Area

Hey Folks,
     Don't winterize that Westy! Is anyone interested in doing a winter camp out in the DC Metro area? One campground I have found is in Winchester, a place called Candy Hill. They are open year round-it's not easy finding a campground around here that is. All sites have water and electric. There is also a game room and lots of stuff close by. I was thinking the weekend of Feb. 17-18, since Monday the 19th is Presidents Day. The nightly rate is $35.00, steep I know but seems to be the norm is this area anymore for camping. Here is the link to their site http://www.geocities.com/~candy_hill/

If anyone is interested, please email me. C'mon, the Canadians do it, so can we!     Jeff
