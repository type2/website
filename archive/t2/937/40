Subject: Glue

My speedometer gear developed a crack and the odometer / trip meter does not
work.  The gear is slipping.

Is there any glue that will effectively glue the gear to the shaft so that
it will not slip??  Crazy Glue says it will NOT work on polyprop.. type
plastic, but will on PCV.  Should I be looking at an epoxy instead of glue??

TIA
