Not my bus...

Notice the pool of burning fuel under the bus.  Starts with a leak 
spraying back on the hot engine, burns the lines and the fire 
intensifies until the fuel runs out. That fuel is gravity feeding the fire.

Add a valve to the bottom of the gas tank that you can operate 
mechanically remotely (!) and you'll save the bus. Close the valve and 
you can put out the fire likely with a hand held fire extinguisher.
