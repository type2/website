Subject: Compufire SVDA update: 

Update:

This morning I pulled off the Pict 34 , pulled the jets, cleaned them with
cleaner and compressed air.... reinstalled , crank the engine, let it warm
up, got in it, drove it around the blocks a few times, stopping at 6 or 7
stop signs and it didn't die.
Might have been some water in the carb, I'm guessing.

Will drive it more tonight when I get home.

Thanks to everyone for their suggestions....
