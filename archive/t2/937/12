Subject: Help with push rod lengths

Greetings from the Great white North!  I am putting my 1.8L together, and
installed hydraulic cam and lifters.  Now as I am installing the lifters and
push rods and rockers, I have a problem.  The hydraulic pushrods are 11 inches
long, and the stock ones are 10 5/8.  It is a '75 block, with '75 heads, with
oval exhaust ports.  The rockers push rods and hyd lifetrs are all '78.  But
there is no way I can get the rocker shaft to sit down far enough to even see
thread on head stud for rocker shafts.  Was there two lengths of pushrods for
the hydraulic cams, or what am I missing here?  The push rods are centered in
the lifters.  This has halted my work, and I need whatever info to keep going.
Thanks
Sid
