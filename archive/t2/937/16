Subject: Need a sliding door bracket

 I am installing a new right side inner/middle w/ door slider channel/outer rocker on my daughter's '77 7 passenger Bus.  To make a long and frustrating story short, I broke the lower front aluminum bracket. I am going to try to TIG it back together, but I doubt that it will work as there isn't much meat there to weld to.  I need to get it fixed soon 'cause now I can't do anything more on thew rocker until I can be sure that the door is lined up OK.
If anyone is parting a bus or has a bracket on a shelf and can part with it reasonable, let me know.  I'd like to get that rocker welded in soon.
My rollers are in good shape so I can reuse them.
Thanks, 
Greg
