Subject: GREENWOOD 100TH ANNIVERARY SATURDAY DECEMBER 1ST PHOENIX,

What delightful day weather wise.  Unfortunately I was the only VW to attend
the show.  I was surrounded by some 15 Model A's.  There were some beauties
there, an original 1928 Model A Truck , with 21000 miles and still in the
family. Another beauty was a 1928 Studebaker all original with some 12,000
miles!! I did get a ride in these beauties.  Not often that some one who is
almost 71 years old is surrounded by cars all older then me. 

Greenwood was the perfect Host, Free hot coffee in the morning, hot lunch,
cold drinks, rides on a horse drawn cart, Wild West Show with lots of
shot-ups, They even provided tables and chairs for us and rides around the
grounds.

Hopefully they will do this again next year as an annual event. Start up
your VW and Drive it. Hope to see you soon.
