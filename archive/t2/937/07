Subject: Friday-TV bus sighting

I caught The Gumball Rally on Speed channe; earlier tonight. In thier animation for Lost Drive in there is a splitty that's rocking to and for ;-). In one of the scenes in the movie the mecahinc driving the Rolls Royce causes and accident that sends cars crashing into a VW. More than once a green westy can be seen. I think it was an early one. The bus was not harmed, though a couple of the bugs were:-(.
