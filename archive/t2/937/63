Jules,

I have had the same problem before.  I have what I always considered a 
pretty good timing light.

I borrowed a $150 one and it worked fine.  My problem was I was running
a *big* high output CD unit and anything electronic or digital that I 
brought close to the engine was just overloaded....my timing light and my 
sunpro just went bonkers....on the other hand, my radio was fine....no 
static or anything.

This was *not* on a T4, but I have had simlilar problems on my bus with 
the same timing light on some of my other cars....notably the ones ith 
electronic points.


An interesting point tho....I have a crane xr700 on one of the cars, 
and don't remember having jitter problems like that.

Jules, see if you can borrow a really good timing light someplace tho and 
double check.

Cheers, dave
