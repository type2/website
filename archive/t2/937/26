Subject: BA4 heater

Hi List
I'm cleaning out my storage and found a BA 4 Eberspacher heater I bought for my 83 Westy.  I was advised that it could be fitted to the van even though it came from a 411/412.  It is in excellent condition with all the parts, switches, relays, controls and a repro of the BA 4 411/412 installation manual and a BA 6 manual.  $150 plus shipping from Northern CA.  If folks can direct me to appropriate 411/412 list(s) I would appreciate that too.
