There are several companies supplying these.  Great Plains Aircraft is 
one good supplier.
The Evans  VP-1  is one of the older designs; a simple single seat 
plywood aircraft which uses a 1600 VW.  http://www.evansair.com/  Plans 
are available.   There are several other aircraft: Sonerai, Cygnet, 
Dragonfly, Kitfox, Hummelbird......
