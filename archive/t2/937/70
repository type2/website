Hi All, 

Wow.  I would expect the thrust bearings in the crank to beat themselves
into oblivion in short order.  Then again, the T4 is about as tough as
boiled owl.  

Does the VW engine have any oiling problems under negative gee
situations?  Are they using fuel injection or carbs?  Anything special
they're doing to the carbs to prevent icing?  What about compression
ratio, hp/torque output?  

What fuel is being used, and what's the consumption rate?  What's the
overhaul schedule?

Thanks!

Shad H.
