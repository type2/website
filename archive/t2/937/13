Tygon is a brand name but there are many lower-quality knock-offs coming
out of China.  If you can use Tygon, I'd recommend Tygon brand tubing
from someplace like http://www.usplastic.com.  It's not very expensive.
Neoprene is supposed to be compatible with brake fluid.  Might be worth

It's worse than that!  Legitmate Tygon comes in a lot of varieties, such

I have a suspicion that Chemfluor varieties would laugh at brake fluid!
