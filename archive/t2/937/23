Subject: Air Conditioning, to keep, or not to keep?

Hello Lists, I am trying to get things figured out on
my new '75 Riviera. It has the underdash air
conditioning unit, plus the condensor under the middle
belly. But everything attached to the motor is gone. 

I was thinking of removing everything else except keep
the blowers under the dash to move air around in the
bus. What is your thoughts?

I figured getting this system back into shape would be
quite costly, Having to find compressor, brackets
pully, and replacing lines? I don't have air in my
other 2 bus's, so why should I have it in this one.

Also does anyone have a manual on this air
conditioning unit? Also a wiring diagram? I want to be
able to see how to remove and or repair this unit, and
also be able to track down the extra wiring for this.

Thanks, and I will have more questions coming up for
this bus.
