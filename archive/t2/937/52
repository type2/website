Trey,

Does it make any difference if you lights are on or off? Strange as it
may sound my electronic ignition module (HotSpark) won't run correctly
unless my headlights or reverse lights are on.

Have you tried swapping your points back in to see if that fixes the problem?

How does your brake booster vacuum line look? Before I replaced the
line on my '71 I had a similar problem, RPMs would drop dramatically
on stops.
