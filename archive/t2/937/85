Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic-horn sound

As Phineas Freak (of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brother Comix, again) drove his
VW Beetle through the ghetto, the little ghetto rat kids laughed at his
pip-sqeak yeep-yeep horn. So, Phineas fixed 'em: He mounted a giant bullhorn
on the roof of the Beetle and mounted a huge amplifier inside. Next time they
laughed at him, he played, at full volume, a tape of an atomic bomb being
detonated.

My hippie brother-in-law in Austin mounted big diesel truck airhorns on top of
his old splitty bus and powered them with an air tank. He called them "Horns
of Death."
