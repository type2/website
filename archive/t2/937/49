Subject: Compufire Question w/ SVDA

Running an SVDA with the compufire kit in my 71 Westy (1600 DP w/Pict 34) all
stock... Having idling problems.

My question concerns the compufire unit.

When they go bad is it an all or nothing thing ? I'm thinking if the Compufire
is going bad, it goes bad and the bus wouldn't start at all. Correct? or can
they slowly die?

It starts, just dies when coming up to a Stop Sign or Red Light.

Trying to get to the Root Cause........

Thanks,
