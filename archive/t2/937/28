That's a nice piece of custom cabinetry you have there :-) I've run my amp
from my auxiliary deep cycle battery for years - no problems. I also ran
heavy-gauge wiring (both +ve and -ve) directly from the battery terminals to
the amp.

I also share the same water leak as you, but since I live in CA, it
doesn't happen sufficiently often to make me track it down and do anything
about it (not the right attitude, I know :-) I always assumed it was the
driver's door rubber, since mine's a bit ratty at the top rear edge.

Happy
listening!
