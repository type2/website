Subject: 72 tranny options

the reverse gear in Maude (72 riviera Type II)
doesn't';t like to stay-put and is getting worst and
worst. I am afraid i will be stuck w/o Reverse pretty
soon!

i have a few good 091 vanagon trannies. Can i take a
vanagon tranny and change the bell housing and nose
cone and get it to work or do i need a full rebuild of
my 6-rib type-2 tranny?

Thanks
-Matthew
