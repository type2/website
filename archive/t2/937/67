The January 2007 edition of Air & Space magazine has a great article on home
built Tplanes (under$10,000) with VW engines.  One has a 1.9 that can cruise
400 miles at 130 mph.  Cool pics of the engine with the heads and pushrod
tubes visible.

The editor of "Contact" magazine is quoted:  "..the VW conversion engine
seems to be the best bang for the buck, mostly because it can go direct
drive."  -the propeller is bolted directly to the crankshaft at turns at the
engines RPM.
