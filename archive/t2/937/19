 Need to find the dimension for the dog house coolerr pedestal, the one that bolts into the case itself...

I mentioned that the other day. Did you miss it? I sent it on 12/01

"If you are using an early case, the 3rd holddown hole will be 6mm. The doghouse adaptor hole is 8mm. I use a
stepped stud: 6 to 8mm and screw it into the case.

You will also need the correct stepped seals that go between the case and the adaptor:
