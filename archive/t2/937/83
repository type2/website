Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic-horn sound

Have to disagree with you on this point.  When my horn doesn't work it drives me crazy.  And I really think it's an important safety feature.  I don't know how many times my vehicles have been saved from someone backing into them in a parking lot by the horn.  And they can help reduce collisions at intersections.  And you can just lightly tap it a couple of times to alert pedestrians as to where you are.  And many other uses.  But unfortunately like everything else, horns get abused and in wrong situations.  Their oughta be a law.  Now if I can find a horn for my Jaguar that doesn't have one.  Cheers....KR

in my case, it is the sound of silence.... hasn't worked in years, and has
probably saved my life.... it seemed to annoy people every time I used
it...
