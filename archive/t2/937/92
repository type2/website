Subject: Re: [T2] [Friday] Fastest bus ever

I HAD NO IDEA that anyone cut tune the bus suspension to behave like 
that. Mine approaches rollover at 30 mph... <grin!>  Maybe he has no 
bodyroll but it's still on the edge of rolling over... Sort of like our 
no suspension red wagons when we were kids - no um, body roll but they 
did rollover... <grin!>

WOW... Thanks to the original poster.
