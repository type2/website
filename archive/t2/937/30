I don't think so. Usually in that situation when you put it in reverse
it dies. In my case, when I put it in reverse it runs well, when I
take it out of reverse it dies.

The reverse lights are definitely hooked up to terminal 15 (+) as
indicated in Bentley.

I even tried a spare Bosch Blue Coil (German) with the same results.
