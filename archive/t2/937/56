Could be, woundn't account for the 009 timing being more stable though.

Nope. Then again, I am timing the SVDA with the vacuum line disconnected.

Maybe my timing light is second rate combined with a weak spark is
causing the timing to "appear" to be jumpy. Maybe the spark is arcing
in the cap? Distributor/condenser grounded poorly? Any other ideas?
