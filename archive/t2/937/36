Subject: so42 icebox height/depth Q??

Hi all, I am rebuilding an icebox that was damaged and missing parts from a 69? to fit my 67. Can someone with an OG icebox (67 & earlier) measure the depth of the side(s) as well as the height from floor to the top of the counter? I have a good idea but would like the exact dimensions from the factory if possible. Also, does anyone know if the sticker "Campmobile" is on the early models or just the bays? 
   
  Thanks for your time,
   
  Ken
