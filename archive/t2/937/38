Subject: Re: [T2] Strange Ignition Issue

Chris,

Thanks for the suggestion. I was just outside doing exactly that. I
replaced the battery to ground cable then cleaned up the body where
the ground cable meets it until it was nice and shiny. I also left my
battery on the charger all afternoon. Unfortunately that didn't do it.
With my tail between my legs I went and reinstalled my points. Timing
is jumpy again, which is one of the reason I wanted to go electronic,
I noticed the Hot Spark unit really smoothed that out a lot. If its
not a ground issue I'd figure I'm losing voltage somewhere on the
battery->fuse box->ignition switch->terminal 15 (+) run. Didn't check
the transmission ground strap, just too darn cold out.

Never figured out what makes the timing jumpy...

Guess I'l wait for a warmer day and head out with a voltmeter and try
track the issue down and then give the unit another shot. Bummer.

peace
