To make a long and frustrating story short, I broke the lower front aluminum bracket. I am going to try to TIG it back together, but I doubt that it will work as there isn't much meat there to weld to.  I need to get it fixed soon 'cause now I can't do anything more on thew rocker until I can be sure that the door is lined up OK.

pretty sure I've got one lying in the garage, I just put a new door on and
haave a custom lower braket for the dropfloor so don't need the original,
no wheels but you have those so it works out,

send me an address will try to get to the garage tommorrow and throw it in
a box, I know exactly where I laid it.
