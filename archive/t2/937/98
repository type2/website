Subject: [T2]vaccum brakes

i would just like to let know that the resovoir cap must have a clean hole through it or it will cause you all sorts of problems....
   
  no one and i mean no one suggested this to me and i overlooked it through everything else that was going on and now have the problem fixed and have BRAKES...
   
  the little hole was not clear enough so that made the back lines keep sucking air....
   
  sometimes it is just the littlest things that can make the world of diffrence..
   
  btw this isnt in the bentley.... it is something the author from the bentley must have assumed.... we all know assumptions can be the mother of alll mess up's.........
   
   
  thanks for any that helped with a reply to my brake issues...
   
  took a friend driving up 45 minutes and 10 minutes to figure out what was the problem....
   
  for the record i should have known to make sure that little hole was clear....but throughout everything i knew i was doing right and did right that little hole was the only stumbling block...
   
  yeah yeah just imagine how i felt yesterday.... words cant describe it...
   
  still no one offered that up as a possibily and was not in the bentley.... but the good thing is my brake fluid running through my system shouldbe cleaner now than any other bus on the road.... ;)  
   
  now laugh but remember this was never offered as a suggestion to what my problem might of been... and the only reason i post this now in my embarcement was so others can learn from this that it can be the simplest things sometimes..
   
  happy trails to you...
