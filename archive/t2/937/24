Maybe not everything... What about the pulley forward (front is front)
of the cooling fan? Mounting brackets on the fan shroud?

I think it may be worth it to have that air a bit cooler. Especially
if you curtain in the front cabin to keep the cooling air on the front
seats.

Again, check for those bits. You might be surprised. A compressor
isn't terribly expensive from Bus Depot and it's reportedly an order
of magnitude more efficient.

Why should you care? Cooler driving, jealous bus owners.

I've seen 'em floating around the net. Someone here will probably be
able to point you in the right direction...

I have a kit pulled from a 79 that's still setting here gathering
dust. With the overhead vents. I was going to put it in the GWB, but
when I got rid of that and bought the Guac, I've been agonizing over
whether to cut the necessary holes in the Guac for the AC.
