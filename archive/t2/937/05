Subject: Re: [T2] plastic brake hose 76 bus

thanks karl i wont have time next week to work on the brakes is why i am pushing for this weekend and safety concerns cause i have no choice but to drive my vehicle right now.
  thanks for your generosity...
   
  heres what i been thinking over since i can get the blue braided hose up the road at the local flaps which is advance only. nothing else around... unless i go into the city..
   
  ok how about this....
  i get a piece of blue braided hose long enough for the job.
going from the bottom of the (fill) top resovoir to the length of the other resovoir connection....
  cut the flare part off the old plastic tubing that i have hanging that actually fits the MC resovoir tit.
  and cut the flare off the other end of plastic tubing that fits the bottom of (fill resovoir) 
  now how to attach the blue braided hose to the plastic tubing safely without leaks ....
  the blue braided hose should fit right inside the plastic hose but can you just put a clamp there and it be ok.....? 
  surely not right?
  what would make that connection with the plastic flares and the blue braided hose good.....?

locally tomorrow I cannot get you them by Saturday.
