	The Rat is spot on as usual.  I would only add: the strap and 
its fastenings do not have to look at all toasted while actually 
offering a high resistance.
	On my honeymoon in 1968 my near-new [deleted] English car 
refused to start, way out in the N. M. quasi-desert.  The warning 
lights still worked but the  starter would not turn.  {No, it was not 
particularly near Roswell, N.M.}  I somehow divined that the bolt 
holding the earth strap from the battery onto the frame had developed 
a high resistance.  It all looked clean & new from the outside, but 
undoing it revealed some corrosion.  Cleaning this metal and 
replacing the bolt   -  a couple min work  -  allowed the large 
current for the starter to pass again, and we pressed on to the Grand 
Canyon  ...
