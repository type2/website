I'm guessing that your distributor might be worn out - does the distributor
shaft have side-to-side (radial) play? Up-and-down (axial) play can usually be
adjusted with shims added to the shaft. Does the vacuum advance operate freely
when you suck hard on the vacuum port? Are the centrifugal advance weights
lubricated and swinging freely in the bottom of the distributor?

Chris,

Thanks for the suggestion. I was just outside doing exactly that. I
replaced the battery to ground cable then cleaned up the body where
the ground cable meets it until it was nice and shiny. I also left my
battery on the charger all afternoon. Unfortunately that didn't do it.
With my tail between my legs I went and reinstalled my points. Timing
is jumpy again, which is one of the reason I wanted to go electronic,
I noticed the Hot Spark unit really smoothed that out a lot. If its
not a ground issue I'd figure I'm losing voltage somewhere on the
battery->fuse box->ignition switch->terminal 15 (+) run. Didn't check
the transmission ground strap, just too darn cold out.

Never figured out what makes the timing jumpy...

Guess I'l wait for a warmer day and head out with a voltmeter and try
track the issue down and then give the unit another shot. Bummer.

peace
