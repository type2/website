OK, so you want an upper and lower reservoir and the
plastic [VW] tube from a 74-79?  Unless you find one
locally tomorrow I cannot get you them by Saturday.

 ok guys these were my findings today....
   i called several hydraulic hose places today in my
 area and around and they all told me that there is
 not a teflon hose or hydraulic hose that is made for
 brake fluid and/or will not work for brake fluid....
 the hydraulic oil is not based as the same as brake
 fluid....
   they told me the only one they had(hose) still did
 not have the inside tubing that would handle brake
 fluids only hydraulic oils....
