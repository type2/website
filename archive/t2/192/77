Please help me. Thieves broke into my 75 bus this weekend and stole my =
Blaupuntk cd player. In the process they wrecked the dash and the =
triangle vent window that's in the passenger door. So the problem is =
that I am trying to find NOS or "perfect used parts to replace the =
damaged parts. Needed are; one dash, NOS or perfect condition, and one =
vent window assembly complete with chrome frame, also in perfect =
condition. If a used window assembly is found, the rubber and chrome =
must be in new condition.

I tried the dealer here in Winnipeg MB, but they said these parts were =
discontinued.

Any help locating these parts would be VERY appriciated.

I know this sounds impossible, but I am trying to get these parts =
(mostly the window assembly) in my hands by the middle of next week!

Thank You
John Gollub
