Subject: Tires/towbar

List,
A couple quick questions:
New Tires: 185/SR14. Load rating: D. Max pressure: 50
PSI. At $65 per tire. Should I get a set? Am I getting
gyped? Are they correct for my '73? Will they last?
Towbar: Where can I get a towbar or dolly that could
tow a beetle behind my bus from New Jersey to
Tennessee? It IS possible, right? Where can I get the
trailer hitch that would hold the towbar, or does it
attach some other way?                        
                                  Thanks!
                                  Paul Deatherage
