Maybe not always, everywhere, in all seasons. In our Ohio winter, tires in 
the snow/salt belt work better if they have a thinner profiles rather than 
a wide flat footprint. The thinner contact seems to bite into the slippery 
surface better and provides some traction, where the broad flat footprint 
does on snow and slush what that same footprint does on very wet 
roads.....it sort of hydroplanes.
