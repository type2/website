I'd trust the GPS over the mechanical speedo.  VW speedos can vary from
dead on to wildly optomistic.  I wouldn't worry so much about getting the
speedo right as with getting the tire diameter right for the bus.  The
tires are your final gearing and you don't want to be spinning things too
fast or too slow.
