That's common actually.  Lemme guess, about 1/2" band worn all the way 
around the pushrod?  That happens when the retaining wire is not installed 
correctly and drags on the pushrods.

Bingo.

Lots of 1700's are rebuilt as 1800's because it is virtually a no-cost upgrade.

Probably re-used the original 1700 head on the first rebuild and had to 
replace the other head for some reason and gave you an 1800 head.  Or it 
could have just been pieced together from spare parts.  Shame on them, the 
valve sizes are not the same!

What did the bearings look like, or have you gotten that far yet?  Are the 
cylinder walls worn?
