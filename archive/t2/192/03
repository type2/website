Thanks, Dave.  I will try all your suggestions
this evening.  

I'm concerned about cam problems.  I'm going to
take the valve covers off and check for the
valves opening and closing properly.  

Already tried the diesel fuel thing.  Lotsa
smoke.  I mean LOTSA SMOKE, but no real change. 
However, I noticed that at high rpm (I adjusted
the carb up--big screw-- and also held the
throttle open most of the time to run the diesel
through) that removing #4's wire did make a
difference, though it was less perceptible than
the others.  

Verified dwell and timing today.  (Adjusted
timing a little.)  

I've double checked everything I could with
respect to plugs wires and plugs.  Switching
plugs and wires did not change the fact that #4
was dead.  I cannot reorient the dizzy because
the vac pot interferes if I try to make it face
the left.  

Thanks,
Ray
