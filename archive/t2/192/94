Don't be tempted to increase the wire size going from + to + when the
batteries are connected usung a relay when the ignition is on, as this
can increase the current draw and is likely why my stock relay burnt out
years ago (contacts will not handle it). .  The apparent small sizing is
intentional, so the charge rate will not be too quick and drain or
"dilute" the primary battery upon starting.
