Subject: Re: rebuild 205 t

Yes it is possible to rebuild a 205 t distributor.  I am going to 
assume (!) it is from a 69-70 bus.  I believe hot vws did an excellent 
tech article about 2 years ago regarding this subject.  As far as the 
basics, cap, rotor, points and condensor order from RMMW or Wolfsburg 
West (if they still sell newer stuff).  Good luck.
