Yes, it's a one-year only part, at least on busses.  It sits lower than the 
paper air filter box and uses different brackets that are curved instead of 
rectangular (to match the curved shape of the oil bath air cleaner).  If 
you got the brackets with it, it would bolt to the engine.  The remaining 
problem is that the intake manifolds were shorter in '72 so the carb covers 
won't fit right.  This could possibly be remedied by putting spacers under 
the brackets, but I haven't tried it.  One more thing, the throats of the 
carbs have a different seal for the oil bath cleaner.  It is a traditional 
round rubber seal whereas the later carbs have a squared-off rubber piece 
that covers the lip of the carb as well.  This isn't such a big problem but 
you would be better off with the round seals.  Finally I don't know how or 
if you could adapt the warm air flapper valve to the oil bath cleaner.  I 
can't remember what the mechanism is like on a '72.

So make sure you get the correct brackets and the rubber seals along with 
the filter box and carb covers and you will probably be able to make it 
work.  You will probably need some longer bolts (M6 I believe, like the tin 
screws) with which to fasten down the brackets using spacers.
