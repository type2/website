Subject: Re: [T2] Single Vac Dual Advance Dizzy

I just received one from John (-at-) Aircooled.net last week.  It was a 205s 
(093). Which was great because that is what went out in my 76 bus...kinda 
wierd, the centrifical advance went out but the vacuum advance worked (nothin 
like 10 deg of total ofadvance)
Anyway, I cant believe anyone is running anything in their bus other than a 
SVDA Distributor.  It's easy to experiance the fact that this dizzy and the 
1800 to 2 ltr engine are "made for each other"...It's a good investment in 
power, economy and longivity for the engine. BUY ONE.
