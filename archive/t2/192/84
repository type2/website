I also use the local VW parts store to get numbers.  I have access to 
commercial desk and he knows i am only looking for the part number in 
his system.  According to VW about 50 percent of the inventory of 
busdepot, aircooled.net, gowesty, RMMW, etc..... is NLA.  When the 
aftermarket suppliers say NLA then it is probably NLA in normal retail 
and head for the salvage specialist or start asking  lists like this one.
