Subject: Re: [T2] 185/195 Size question

I put vredesteins on my westy  a few weeks back.  LOVE EM...  BTW I put 
the 75 profile on as they were what was available at the time.  Just had 
the speedo checked by a couple of friendly Aurora cops against a 
stationary radar sign and  a gun.  Both with fresh calibration.  I was 
slightly high at 45.(about 46)
tested at 25 35 and 45.  They ticketing speeds in this area.
