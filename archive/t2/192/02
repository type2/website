Subject: Fwd: BREAKING NEWS - Kill This Thread

Folks,
This thread is killed.

From the list charter:

--Do not EVER post virus warnings, or messages about important issues
that you think should concern everybody in the world. Do not post
messages unless they have legitimate bus content. If you think the
message you're sending is so important that the "bus content" rule does
not apply to you, that means that you should ==NOT== post it.
