Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA part numbers

here's a good link for part #s
http://type2.com/library/identifi/numsys.htm

comparing these guidelines to the (albeit type3 related) list it kinda
looks like this might be some dealer number although the "100" in the
middle does relate to code 100 which is replacement engines. Other
than that I'm not much help. One thing that will be different on the
79 verses the rest of the 2.0L engines is the vanagon heads (these are
the type w/ square exhaust ports). Who knows mabey they sold the
engine 1/2 case at a time :)

Here is what I would do.

1. check engine:
	a. give engine tune-up w/ new parts.
	b. check compression/vacuum.
	c. track down leaks when a & b are done.
	d. check/set valves

2. check brakes:
	a. might as well just get new pads/shoes all around for the trip
	b. check for leaks.
	c. check rest of system (switch/wires/booster/vacuum lines)
	d. replace any obviously bad brake parts. (good to have in mtns)

3. if any more problems
	a. follow Bentley to fix & ask list :)

Unless the engine is giving you any trouble I wouldn't sweat it too
much, but would at least make sure it's as ready to go as possible.
After you confirm the engine is in good shape start collecting the
stuff you should bring with you.

Don't forget to make a copy of the AIRS list & bring some extra parts
along. the archives should have good lists of this. but some of ones I
remember are:

plugs/cap/rotor/points
coil
couple of barrel nuts
accel cable & clutch cable
bentley (& muir)
patient new wife :)
rubber gloves (just to keep those hands clean away from home)

I'm not sure mine is well past 210k :) but I would check the valves &
make sure all are in fine fashion. Never leave anything to guess what
the PO did.

Also I would take a weekend trip somewhere just to see what you are
missing. Someone suggested at one time to practice setting up camp &
breaking down to help w/ the "we don't need this" or "shoot, wish we
brought this" scenerio. Good luck.
