Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Isolator Problem

VW went with the relay for specific reasons.  The same as many of the RV 
setup out there have.  Many alternators are not compatible with 
isolators.  Looking at the instructions for the isolators says the same 
thing.
The work arounds are not safe for the alternator.
