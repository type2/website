I agree.

I prefer my Craftsman non-clicking torque wrench for VW engine 
applications.  It's the old style that moves a needle when the bar flexes - 
can't remember the technical name for it.  It does something like 0-90 
lb/ft.  I am comfortable with the accuracy of the wrench and I have seen 
the click-type malfunction (even good quality ones).  I torque my cylinder 
heads in stages with this wrench and have never had a problem.  Call me 
old-fashioned, cheap or whatever - it works for me and I stay with what works.
