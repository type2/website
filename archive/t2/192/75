That's basically the same as the Hella Dual Battery Kit I sell for $18.95
(part # 1738).  It's a kit consisting of an appropriately rated relay (with
integrated fuse and holder), wiring, and instructions.  Pretty much the same
setup that was used on Westfalia campers that were factory equipped with
dual batteries.  Simple yet effective.
