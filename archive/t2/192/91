There is an article somewhere - Type 2 library? - called Journeys under 
Difficult Conditions. It is a VW factory document that tells you how to 
prepare your vehicle for a difficult journey.

I would at least add some steel bars under the engine. I added a home built 
by me trailer hitch (tm) a few years ago. It had a bar that ran left to 
right under the muffler and then had two bars that ran forward from the 
cross bar to meet at the front tranny mount.

Was very good at protecting the engine and several times it saved my bacon 
when I was offroad and rolled slowly off of stone steps. The hitch took the 
banging and no damage ever.
