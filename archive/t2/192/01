Subject:   Air cooled Vanagon Camper, FREE

    Being nobody seems to want a nice complete Vanagon ASI camper complete,
that needs minor engine work for 750 dollars, obo, I have a NEW DEAL,
FREEEEEEE, no engine or trans ( I am going to pull those) and swap out the
near new YOKOHAMA tires for a set of rollers unless somebody jumps on it
right away. I have way to many buses and don't need this one. Did I mention
RUST FREE Cal bus. If not claimed soon it's off to the scrap yard with all
thise good Vanagon and camper parts. This bus was driving fine till they got
to Havasu, then the engine developed some problem. I think FI related
