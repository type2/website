Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Rebuild

Bosch makes(or made, I'm not too sure anymore) a rebuild kit for their 
dizzys, that included screws, washers, shims, and other assorted goodies.  I 
have one somewhere...I'll try and find it and see what the part number is.  
Anyone else out there know what I'm referring to with access to the part#?  
I was looking to rebuild my 205T as well.  Turned out all she needed was a 
good cleaning and lube.  Still have the kit.
