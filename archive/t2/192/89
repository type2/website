Download a copy of EKTA. It;s out there.

You can do the same thing as the parts desk.

There is a certain online auction place where some Canadian is selling 
copies for $10. Dunno why he hasn't been busted though.

There is also a Russian site that hosts an on-line copy of EKTA. The site 
is in Russian. The part numbers and diagrams are in English.
