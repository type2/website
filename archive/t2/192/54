Hi All

I am writing about my Bessie-Lou again.  I bought her less than a month a=
go and have her engine out already.  Seems she broke between her old home=
 and mine, with the PO driving and " not having a clue" that anything bro=
ke (RIGHT!)  =20

Anyhow, amongst many other problems, her main one which caused me to pull=
 her engine was the exhaust value seat on Cylinder 1 went bye-bye. SO, as=
 I have slowly taken her apart I have found many things wrong... (Without=
 going into unconnected lines, hoses, missing and wrong nuts/bolts...) Fi=
rst her pushrods were worn funny on the head side on where the tubes rece=
ss's down.  Puzzling.... But you know, the retaining spring wire was brok=
en in two I found AFTER I took the rockers off.   Next discovery, she isn=
't a 1700, but a 1800. Okay, Cool!  but now the funny stuff... they did p=
ut a 1800 head (p/n 022 101 371 H) on the 1 & 2 side, but on the 3 & 4 si=
de, they put a 1700 head.. (p/n 021 101 371 J) Oil with les than 500 mile=
s on it WA a real pretty iridescent sight!  pretty but brought tears to m=
y eyes, that is for sure! No wonder the poor ol' gal had no power...   =20

Has anyone ever heard of this?  I checked, the 1700 was not bored out and=
 the 1800 had previous seat damage to the #2 cylinder...

Anyhow, any input would be GREAT!

Thanks
D
