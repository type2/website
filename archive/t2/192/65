Subject: Re: [T2] Bracket for a/c compressor

You gotta find out if the compressor is cracked, the fan shroud it is 
bolted to is broke or if the steel mount is broken.

You can replace any one part of the system and they can Heli-arc or TIG 
weld any broken aluminum parts if you have the missing part (or you might 
find somebody that can "recreate" the missing piece and weld it on).

You may have the last working aircooled a/c system in the US! <grin>

Be sure all of the engine tin is there and the oil cooler is clean as is 
the fins on the pistons and cylinders. I'd hate to hear that you burned it 
up with the a/c on.
