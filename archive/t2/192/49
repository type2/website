Maybe. Depends on what you want to rebuild.  It also depends on the
distributor.  If the dist has too much up-down play, it can be reshimmed
at home in your spare time.  If it has side-to-side wobble in the shaft,
AFAIK, then is no rebuild kit, tho a pro can proibably come up with the
correct bushings.

Yes!  Anyplace that carries Bosch parts can order part # 1 237 010 007
Wich is the shim set.  If your problem is too much vertical play in the
shaft, this will clear it right up.

Yes!  There are several.  If you go to Olympic Auto parts
(www.forparts.com) and get their number, they can get and mail you a
rebuilt distributor for many VW distributors.  Others may be able to do th
same (I've been pushing at least one vendor on the list to carry these :-)
