Well, friends, I went to look at the 77 bus this evening. The owner didn't
lie, it IS nearly rust free. Some surface rust on the floors but nothing
serious. The body, including doglegs, wheel wells, and areas under the
windows appear to be free of rust. Even the battery trays look good. The
transmission is gone, baby, including the drive shafts, clutch cable, and
CVs. The interior is stripped except for the front seats, both of which are
in poor condition. It has been repainted a dark green but appears to have
been some funky shade of blue originally.

The engine.....what can I say? It's sitting on the floor and appears to be
complete, including the FI stuff. Comes with a new clutch disc and pressure
plate. All the tin is intact and looks to be in good condition. The owner
says he has 'heard it run' but never driven it so I don't actually know much
about it. I saw one thng that bothered me....the dreaded TRIANGULAR EXHAUST
FLANGES!! Isn't this the one year only, NLA, never to be found again on this
planet exhaust system? On the bright side, doesn't another system
interchange with this one? ( I know there have been posts about this but I
never paid attention.)

Last thing: does anyone have suggestions on where to get an appropriate
transmission for this model?

Thanks in advance,
Dave
