Subject: Single Vac Dual Advance Dizzy

Thanx every one.
I have received about a dozen replies to the previous question.  Now I have
aircooled.net down pat.

Next question....anyone have any experience with this seemingly one of a
kind dizzy?

Received a note from John at air-cooled, said they are available only one
place.  Hmmmm, are these special tricked up configurations that have proven
to work?

Anybody?

Bob recommends replacing my vacuum canister first.

I am not afraid to spend the money, $150 seems like a bargain to protect my
new engine.

Appreciate any thoughts here.
