Subject: Re: [T2] Air Shock/Tortion bar advice

Get rid of that sump. It'll get you in trouble. Nice on road but a big 
liability off road. They usually don't help the oil stay much cooler but 
they do give you a little more thermal reserve - take longer to get the oil 
hot as there is more to get hot. Once at temp, it takes longer to get 6 
quarts of oil 30 degrees hotter than it does to get 4 quarts hotter. I can 
also take longer to get the oil cooler - logic tells me. I ran one of these 
on my Type4 powered Beetle before I pulled it off the road and stored it. 
It did not hurt anything and I plan to put it back on when the car is 
restored. It did eat up some clearance. I did add a Pep Boys/CB Performance 
cooler with an electric fan as my engine swap eliminated the stock oil 
cooler which normally got supplied with air by the engine fan. Never had 
any heat problems and I even towed a Hyundai from VA to TN in July.

Reset those torsion bars a notch or two.

If you have to run a cooler then run an external radiator type cooler. Add 
a thermostat to control it's cooling effect so your oil gets to the 
operating temp and stays there. The list can advise on it's installation. 
Pep Boys carries the same one I bought from CB Performance.

Any air shock that you can fit would give you some clearance but also would 
make the ride harsh. I'd be inclined to set the bars higher and leave it. I 
have heard - and take this with a grain of salt - that air shocks and 
helper springs can crack the frame where they mount under the right 
conditions - I assume extended wash board or rocky road conditions.
