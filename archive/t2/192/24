Subject: JCS heads?

Has anyone had any experience with JCS in LA, particularly with their
rebuilt heads?  I had planned on getting heads through AVP, but it seems
they have some sort of backlog and can't ship heads for another 2 weeks
(I was hoping to do my rebuilt work during the July 4th holiday, when I
have 2 days off work!)  Someone at AVP mentioned I might try JCS, but she
didn't specifically recommend them.  I had heard some rumors about former
GEX workers at JCS... (!)

Also, in my recent research... a shop in Daly City, CA (Tassi's) said they
can get new (?) heads.  Apparently not AMC, but Mexican made.  Huh?
Anyone heard of these?  They cost somewhere between typical rebuilts and
new AMC heads (which are $$$).
