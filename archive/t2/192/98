I use 2ga (starter cable) wire and a relay that is capable of 500 amps 
sustained.  15 bucks for the relay at Camping World.  I'm sure the relay 
kit from Bus Depot is fine and worth the money, but I wanted to be able to 
flip a switch and jumpstart my starting battery if necessary.  The 
high-power relay will allow me to do this, plus I never have to worry about 
blown relays or overheated wiring.  This system came with my bus as part of 
the Safare conversion, and we also used it on my dad's camper (60's Dodge 
pickup with cabover) when I was growing up.  In addition, while cranking 
the starter, your battery's voltage will likely be pulled down to the 
voltage of the dead aux battery and thus little or no current will flow to 
the dead aux battery during cranking.  Many, many years of drained aux 
batteries with this setup and I have never been left stranded because of 
it.  I Suffice it to say that I am convinced this system is best, at least 
for me.

By the way, you do not want small-gauge wire to be what limits the current 
flowing through your relay - it's a good way to fry the wire.  The wire and 
relay need to be sized for the load or you risk burning up one or the 
other, or both.  We have enough bus fires as it is.
