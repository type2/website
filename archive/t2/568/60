Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

I think it is just for selling more. I poured like 1/4 cup of POR-15
into a clean jar for a friend. He just wanted to cover a tiny area. He's
kept it in a fridge for the past six months or so, and we take it out
every now and then to do up some odd-job or another, and NONE of it is
cured. With the plastic wrap I tend to get dried layers between uses. 


<<I believe Restomotive Lab's advice is that once the can is opened the
air contact will start to activate the paint and you should buy more
rather than using what you've stored back in the can. Marketing? I don't
know how true this is but it has inclined me to buy what I need rather
than larger quantities to get a discount on volume.
