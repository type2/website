I remember reading a Hoover sermon about the Type I engine and the lack of a
seal behind the pulley that purposefully let air into the crankcase (and
other contaminants).

He also mentioned in his Blowing Oil sermon that the Type IV having this
seal standard had the breathing location relocated to the valve oil
galleries.

Does anybody understand this and how water may have come in this way?
