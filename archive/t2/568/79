Subject: Re: [VB] Our K?ln Side tent arrived from BusDepot today

Those tents must be much better than the red,white, and blue ones Ron 
was selling last year.  As soon as I got it I sent it back - very poor 
seam quality, although the design appears identical.

I settled on one of the self supporting sunshades from 
http://www.shadyboy.com/vans/

We like it a lot.  I then just bought a Coleman freestanding tent for 
the teenager to sleep in.
