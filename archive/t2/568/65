Guys,

I have successfully saved quart amounts by pouring them into a glass quart
pickling jar and then using several layers of cling wrap over the top 
before I put the original top back on.

It was winter time...worked till spring when I used it.

Cheers, dave

I don't know how true this is but it has inclined me 
to buy what I need rather than larger quantities to get a discount on volume.
