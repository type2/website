Subject: Headflow Masters?

My friendly local mom and pop VW parts dealer has recommended Headflow 
Masters, in Vista, California, for machine shop work. Now I am looking 
for a second opinion.

I need to have my 2.0L case measured and align bored, if needed. And I 
need to have my rotating mass balanced.

Anyone familiar with Headflow Masters?
