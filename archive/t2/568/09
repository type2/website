Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

I will say this---

After I brushed a coat of this stuff on the flor--the little bit I got
on my hands and arms wouldn't come off with laquer thinner--this may be
an indication of it's durability--but I ain't giving in yet--:>)

I've used this stuff for years, and can vouch for the fact that it won't come
off your skin until it wears off. FWIW, I used it on a '76 Westy, cab floor
and on the chassis, and 3 years later no rust had returned. Would it have been
better to cut out the rusted metal and weld in new? Of course, but time and $$
didn't allow for that. I'm a believer in POR 15.      Jeff
