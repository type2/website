Subject: Distributor drive gear backwards...NOW WHAT??

Ok, so we have been having problems getting my friends
"new" unknown 1700 engine to run. Ran tests and found
that we had spark, fuel and compression..So why would
the d*mn thing still not run?? So i adjusted the
valves, all were VERY tight. Tried to start it again,
still nothing. So on a whim I reversed the order of
the iginition wires, put 1 where 3 should be and vice
versa. Then tried it again and the engine roared to
life! Sounded pretty good in fact. Anyway, this mans
that the distributor drive gear was put in 180 degrees
off, right?  So is it OK to live with it like this for
a while, will it run with the plug wires in this order
without problems or damage? OR is this a situation
(the dizzy drive gear) that needs to be corrected
right now? If the latter, exactly what is involved in
making the dizzy drive gear right? What special
tools\skills does one need to accomplish this task??
Can it be done without tearing into the engine??
