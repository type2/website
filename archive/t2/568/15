John,

Probably ok with it like it is as long as you can adjust the timing 
properly.

Lots of vw's have been run that way for many years...confusing for a new 
buyer...then you *are* the "evil p.o.".

Otherwise, you buy the tool to pull the dist drive gear out and put it 
back in where it is supposed to be...biggest danger is dropping the bottom 
washers down in the engine someplace.

Cheers, dave
