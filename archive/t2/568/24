Subject: Re: [T2]child seats and child comfort

'04 Ford Mustang has it only at the top corner of the seat in the front. My 
shoulders are at or slightly above that level.

84 Volvo 244GL (mine) shoulder straps attach at the top of the seat back 
which is lower than even my wife's shoulder.

Keep in mind also that guidelines for infants in car seats is to have the 
straps slightly below the shoulder level. I haven't reasearched older 
children/adults but I'll bet it's ok.
