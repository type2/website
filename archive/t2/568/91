Subject: Low mileage tire con't

Hi,

I checked my DOT serial # for the manufacture date of my tires it is
stamped (477). So that means 47th week of 1997 right? The tires look
great plenty of tread look almost new. Is this a concern being 8 years
old?

The tires are Continental Contact 185R/14 94R tires on my '77 Westy.
Just thought I would see what others thought of safety of 8 year old
tires since the subject came up.

Meg
