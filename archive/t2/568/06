Paul, Scott,

"M6" does actually have a meaning more than the simple pair of characters.
It is an abreviation for M(etric)6(mm).  The 6mm nut you were offered at
Ace was the correct nut in all probability.  The only chance that it was
not has to do with thread pitch which is part of the complete
specification.  You should have been asking for an M6x1.25 nut, where 1.25
is the thread pitch in milimeters

                             OOK!
