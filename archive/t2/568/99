Subject: RE: [T2] Weber carb Vac line placement....

I have this carb at my house, but it is not hooked up. I will try to look
tonight and see, but from what I remember it does not have the retard port.
Only the advance port. At least that is the way mine was set up. I am
installing duals now so I will use both ports now.

I will verify what small port the distributor was hooked up to. The 1/4 inch
was for the brakes.

The dual will work on this setup, it just needs to be timed differently. Mine
ran great, except in the winter.
