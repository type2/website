Robert,
Thanks for the warning---

However--after painting Macks for 30 years my hands have had worse on
them, and all my finger's, and palms are still in tact.

I'll get it off today with some 180 sandpaper--not to worry.

As far as prepping the metal on the end loader--Friday late I pressure
washed the thing inside and out with 3500 psi of hot water, and
yesterday wire brushed the cab floor--that is more than adequate, to
promote adhesion.

Today I sand blast the front fender's ladder, platform, and the battery
box cover's, and throw some more of this stuff on them.

Tomorrow the bed liner--on all.

I'm not using the spray can bed liner on this thing--I'm rolling and
brushing it on--

I want some build up of the product--it's going to be on a piece of
heavy equipment--and I want it on thick--and bullet proof.

This should be the acid test for both of these products.

( except for the bed liner, as I mentioned before, I have used in leu of
a floor mat on different machines and is still there on all of them  no
POR anything just fresh paint )
 
This is the absolute first time I have short cutted the job on
anything--it makes me cringe--time will tell if all the accolades I've
been listening to for several years is worth a tinkers damn---:>)



Adios,
