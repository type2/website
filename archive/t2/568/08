I have already done the wheel barrow test.  Going on 4 years now and I
didn't use the metal prep or top coat it.  (for a real test)

After 4 years of sitting in the sun and rain, no signs of continued rusting
(and this thing was so rusty, it was left behind when I bought my house)

I'll post more in a few more years!!!

As for bus use, I have used the metal prep, por and top coated with no signs
of renewed rust or more damage.  Probably 3 years.
