I painted the floor of my trunk in an old Mercedes with it once. I was
amazed at how the floor seemed to get stronger. This was made further
evident a year later when I hit a speed bump a little too fast and the
floor stayed together but dropped out of the trunk. My lesson there was
to paint even where you don't see the rust, and to do the opposite side.
