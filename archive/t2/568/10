there is some pics of the rear 3 point seat belts... useing a booster seat as i was decribing i need to install into my bus,...... and to my understanding can be purchased from places like http://oeveedub.com/t2.html
 
thanks robert for the photos....
,,.
even though my seat belt will have to go on my right hand side and these pics are for the left hand side of the rear of the bus you get a better understanding how they hook..in....
 
by the looks of the pics looks like that the seat belt will go right across her shoulders and across her chest like it suppose to...
course i built my own seat with the help from buddah so maybe i may have to make a few adjustments to mine maybe not ....? not sure if my seat height is the same as most bus folks.... or the ones from the dealers..?
i did however find my screw hole on the right rear of the bus...~!~
 
thanks you all for your concerns and help on this now i know what i got to do and how it needs to be done...
 
the price they want for them belts is pretty high though~!~
anyone got one of these they arent useing and need to part with...?
 
safety the #1 concern,....
peace and love

just curious on all those that have children and how you accomidate them in the back seats with car seats? 

i know it is diffrent for each state on the laws of how many pounds for certain seats and such to booster seats and all..?

ok my thing is my child is big enough for a booster seat which is just the bottom part of a child seat but is suppose to get a arm belt pulled over and snapped...~!~(like the front seat belts)

being the back seat it is not able to use the booster cause there is only lap belts...
being only lap belts she is haveing to ride in the car seat which runs the lap belt in behind the seat always keeping the car seat strapped in .....
the car seat it's self has buckles for her to buckle with....

surely the other bus parents can help me figure out how to get her booster seat in there....
will i need to install somehow the front kind of belts in back ?????? wouldnt know where to start or is there another way you all have done this legally and safe..?

Safety is my number one concern here of course... ~!~
thanks for all or any help..
peace
Cha
