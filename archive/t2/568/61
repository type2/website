Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

Regarding putting a bit in a baby food jar and putting the jar in the 
refrig: I thought it was the AIR in the half empty POR 15 can that caused 
the skim to form.

So if you put a big stone in the can to make up for the POR 15 that was 
removed, you could store it in its original can for a longer time.  [I am 
sure this was brought up before].

It makes sense that the baby food jars would not skim out if they were 
filled to the rim, without regard to the refrigerator's effect.
