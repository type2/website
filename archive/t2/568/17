John,

First remove the distributor and get a hold of one of these. I think Larry's 
Offroad in Ohio is where i got mine reasonable.

Really easy to do. Drop in the tool after you pull the little spring out. 
Then tighten, pull and twist it is out. Be careful not loose the two washers 
at the bottom of the drive. Hopefully they will stay seated in the case. 
After it is out line it up they way it should be and drop it back in. I 
always turn it counterclockwise about 10 degrees or so so that as it rotates 
renengagine with the gear, it will result in spinning into place. Try it a 
couple of times until you get it where you want it.

Other than that I had a bug I ran for a year and a half like that. No see 
through distributor though.

TravelOn,
