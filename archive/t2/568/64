This one is a typical ID-plate for the US-Westy saying
'Campmobile 70' (on the European buses it still had
the 'SO'-number on it in those days):

So the serial numbe rof your interior is:

   3.06060

The '3' says it is from 1973.
The plate was fixed on the lowerpart of the benchseat
on the passenger side. So you can easily read it from
outside when the sliding door is open.

The other plate I have never seen before :-(
