Hi Volks,

This afternoon I got a nice parcel from the postman... Our Kvln side
tent finally arrived from BusDepot.

I am really happy with this tent, it's easily one of the nicest-built
tents I've ever owned, and I've been camping for a long time. It
definitely holds its own against anything I've had from Woods, Coleman
or Eureka, it packs away in a small and lightweight package that iss
huge when set up.  It's really a great addition to our camper, and
can't wait for our next camping trip.

I took a few pics as my wife and I put it up in our side yard. We
couldn't put it up on the bus yet because there's no room in my front
yard to set it up.

Here's the web address:

Happy trails,
