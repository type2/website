Chris,
92 hours recommended curing time prior to top coating--

I've got 3 days worth of work to do on the machine prior to even getting
close to thinking of laying the bed liner on the cab floor--

No problemo--:>)

I'm not spraying the bedliner---I'm rolling it on for big time
coverage--

Take Care,

 
<<As for waiting untill it's dry man, make sure you give it a good LONG
time to dry. Like several days if not a week. It feels dry and is hard
after 12 hours or so, but it gets stronger and stronger untill it's
fully cured. If you cut off the moisture supply (yeah, it cures faster
with higher humidity, go figure) by spraying in bedliner too soon, you
may prevent it from fully curing.>> 
<< I applied a coat of the POR product--and when it is dry--I'm laying a
heavy coat of urethane bed liner in leauof replacing the rubber matt. 
Just my two cents
Chris
