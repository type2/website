Okay, you've got me there. I was thinking in terms of VW-specific parts,
as opposed to generic hardware that fits lots of makes. We don't do much
in the way of generic hardware (other than a selection of metric
fasteners etc. that we buy from a well-regarded import supply house), so
that goes beyond my area of expertise.
