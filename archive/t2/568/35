Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

As for waiting untill it's dry man, make sure you give it a good LONG
time to dry. Like several days if not a week. It feels dry and is hard
after 12  hours or so, but it gets stronger and stronger untill it's
fully cured. If you cut off the moisture supply (yeah, it cures faster
with higher humidity, go figure) by spraying in bedliner too soon, you
may prevent it from fully curing. 

<< I applied a coat of the POR product--and when it is dry--I'm laying a
heavy coat of urethane bed liner in leauof replacing the rubber matt.

Just my two cents
Chris
