Hi, All.

Something we may be forgetting is that we're talking about fluids here. Keep
in mind that air is also fluid.  Anybody remember the old Dodge slant 6's
with the great intake runners? Produced massive amounts of HP (at very
narrow rpm ranges). The pulses of air mass literally forced themselves into
the cylinders, much like a blower. Same thing is done with "headers" on the
suction side (does lower pressure exist without suction? Why do we have
"vacuum pumps" if they don't pump anything? What does Teflon tape stick
to?).

Is the fuel pump a vane type? Does it create pulsations? Hamsters have a
little space between them all.... fluid does not (with very miniscule
exceptions). The entire column of moving fuel in the line is a mass that
resists change in direction and speed. Moving mass has energy, and that
energy could momentarily overcome the energy that is imparted by the fuel
pump in the first place (harmonics and wave theory). Depending on the
orientation of the tee, it is conceivable that the pulsations of fuel
exiting the return line could carry with it the fuel that is trying to exit
the fuel tank on its way to the pump. For example a tee that is oriented
thusly:

                         (tank)
			|	    	      |
			|_______  ^ ______|
				  | | |
			   _____| ^ |
	 (to pump)     _____  | |
                          | ^ |
                          | | |
                          | ^ |
                            |
                        (return)

would most certainly create negative pressure on the pump side of the tee,
especially in low fuel draw (high return) situations. Next time you're at
the coffee shop with Orientations ninety degrees clockwise could amplify the
energy applied by the fuel pump.

Larger diameter tubing/hoses will negate this effect to degrees.

I've gotta fall back to the old axiom "if VW didn't have to have it, they
wouldn't have spent the extra three cents to put it on." It only cost VW
three cents to add that return tube to the tank. It may cost you three-fifty
for a bigger tee and adapters, and you can probably make it work for less
than you can buy a later model tank for. VW did it that way 'cause it was
WAY cheaper.

I sincerely apologise for the bad ASCII art. I'm working on a rendition of
"Whistlers Mother"... stay tuned.
