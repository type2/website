Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder base spacers

I am in mid rebuild as well but have not got to the stage of measuring 
deck height so I don't know which I need.

I did get 4 X .010 spacers in the gasket kit from the busdepot, however. 
I would ship 'em to you but I may need them myself.  I will know after 
the weekend.

Aircooled.net has them listed but for $20 each !! i.e $80/set

EMPI lists them in their catalogue, this place seems to have them 
www.doghouserepair.com but any VW flaps probably carries EMPI and can 
get them.

Shame if Ron is out of them; what about other thicknesses including the 
.060?

I'll email you if I find they are not needed after the weekend; hope it 
won't be too late.
