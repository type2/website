Schwarzie, come on.  It looks like the same
heighth as the ones that my neighbor-- known
around here as the car seat nazi and some sort of
trained car seat technician that does consulting
for insurance companies-- has in her Jetta
wagon... and lotsa other wagons.   It's also
about the level that is used for racing
harnesses, at least the ones we trained on when I
used to cut people out of car wrecks for a
living.  High is for comfort, not for safety.  

How these old wives tales get started I'll never
know....
