Subject: RE: [T2] Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

My mom bought a new 71 beetle in 72 (end of the year clearance). That
first week, the family went for a drive in the mountains. While driving
across a very high bridge, the driver's side front tire blew. The front
end went through the concrete guardrail and stopped with its front tires
hanging off the bridge. The police took 40 minutes to get there.
Typically when they got a call concerning an accident on that bridge,
the car had gone over and there was no rush since the occupants were
dead.

The PO of my 69 bus shod it with underrated passenger tires. Needless to
say, I get nervous going over bridges.
