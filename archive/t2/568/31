Subject: Re: [T2] Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

Hi Bob,

And the other side of that argument is about new "car" tires. In 1997 I 
bought a set of Dayton P75/195R14 "Car Tires" that were on my westy 
until spring 2002. They held up fine for over 5 years, except that the 
bus swayed like a drunken sailor in the slightest crosswind and it had 
a terrible tendency to understeer. A set of Continental RT-735's 
installed in spring 2002 made an incredible improvement to handling.  
After about 45000 miles I took the Dayton's off the westfakia and they 
lasted through another full two years of hard use on an aggressively 
driven  3L V6 Ford tempo.

Having the correct tires on a bus is very important. A lot of people 
will replace the PO's car tires with another set of car tires there 
FLAPS has in stock and never know the difference. But there is an 
unquestionably  HUGE difference in handling and safety when running the 
right tire for a bus.

Having tires that are not too old is ALSO important.

Is a new "Car Tire" better than an old "Bus Tire"?? No. In my opinion 
they both suck. It's still a compromise in safety. This spring I found 
spiderweb cracks in three of my Continental RT-735's, and now I am 
watching them like a hawk as I hunt for a replacement tire. A pair of 
Vanco-8's will do for the short term, and another pair later in the 
summer as funds allow.

Having tires that are old AND under-rated.... that is a recipe to hurt 
someone.

Happy trails,
