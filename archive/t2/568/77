I recently upgraded my battery cable. There was heavy corrosion at the cable ends, the original terminal had broken and the temporary lead terminal I bought at the parts store a couple of years back never clamped the cable well and left it exposed to more corrosion.

I sourced the best parts I could locate to repair my cable once and for all:

- tin plated copper terminal with solder slug design
- quality copper ring terminal with solder slug with 8mm opening for starter

I've since found a tin plated copper lug for even better protection.

Basically, you take your original 25mm2 (4 AWG) cable and strip back the corroded cable to reveal fresh stands, insert the solder slug with some optional flux into the terminal. You heat up the terminal with any small torch and the cable slides in for a perfect battery connection as the melted solder bonds the strands to each other and to the terminal. You complete the job by heating some adhesive lined heatshrink to permanently seal the cable from the elements.

Anyone interested can pm me and I will sell you the 6 parts (2 terminal, 2 slugs, 2 heatshink tubes) at cost for $10 + ship. I have a few of these kits left and then I'm going to put them on eBay.
