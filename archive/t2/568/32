Subject: Re: [OVT] Distributor drive gear backwards...NOW WHAT??

John, Be sure to re-adjust the valves, is this the bus
that was pulled into BB&B, if so it had more than one
strike against it to start with.. It would not be too
hard to pull the dist drive gear and set it right, I
use inside grabbing pliers(inside snap ring pliers),
Make sure that you are on #1 TDC,remove the
distributor and spring, reach in grab the shaft and
let it turn as it comes out, reposition it at the
correct angle(12degrees)per picture in Bently book,
drop it back in, should work.  Phil
