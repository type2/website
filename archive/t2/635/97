Subject: Table in with bed down

Has anyone experimented with cutting a notch in their z bed so there is room
to have the rear table installed with the bed down in a late bay camper?
It looks like about a 1/2" half circle would allow this.  Just pull a couple
staples, peel back fabric, cut, restaple  fabric.
Looks like it would work, but I thought I'd check to see if anyone else has
considered this before I cut something on the bus.
Thanks,
Mike
