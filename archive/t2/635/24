All of this wiring talk and today's first rainfall in months got me
interested in the replacement switch I've been sitting on. This is the
original switch:

This is the SWF replacement:

Noticing too many wires? So did I. I can't find red/black and brown in the
wiring diagram and look...there's an extra contact:

I'm at a bit of a loss to explain this change but it would appear to be a
contact to turn on the wipers automatically when you activate the washer. I
need to check the connector in the steering column to see if it still fits
but I suspect the extra wiring to the wiper motor will be missing unless it
was jumpered at the column connector.

What's exciting about this is that the switch could easily to used to power
a pump to wash the windshield.
