Subject: starter motor bushing

This is such a great list (and my first post). Thanks to everyone who posts.
I've just had to replace the starter motor on my 76 kombi and was advised to
replace the bushing in the bell housing. It looked like it was going to be a
pain but it was much easier than I expected. Here's what I did, if anybody is
interested...
With the starter motor out (!) I used a M12x1.75 tap to cut a thread in the
bushing. Access was a bit trcky, using my backyard workshop (lying under the
beast on the drive). I used a screwdriver-bit holder and a half inch extension
to start the tap and then my half-inch rachet (couldn't fit the tap wrench
onto the tap). After cutting the thread and removing the tap, I screwed a long
M12 bolt into the bushing, kept turning (by hand) and the bushing came out
with no problems. If you live in Perth and you want your bushing removed, let
me know.
