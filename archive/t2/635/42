In on the recent post on wiper came this statement "Get thee to a FLAPS and
get a tube of dielectric grease...Wonderful stuff especially on those
hard-to-reach spots..."

What does FLAPS stand for?  My guess is the local car parts place i.e. NAPA.

I've always been confused about dielectric grease... is it an insulator or a
conductor and why is it "wonderful stuff especially on those hard-to-reach
spots"?

Thanks for info
