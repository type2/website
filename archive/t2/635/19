Subject: Quick help needed with wipers

I thought I was in for a new wiper motor when my wipers started slowing down 
and finally stopped. Turned out all I had to do was lubricate shafts where 
they come through the body and all the joints on the mechanism. Works like 
new now!

it to the motor, but everything "looks" like it's good. Can a motor
just sieze up?
