Subject: proper way to tow type 2s

Hey,

On occassion I happen to see both Beetles and Buses being towed behind RV's 
and other big vehicles.  All four wheels are on the ground and rolling at 
highways speeds.

I was always told you want to keep the drive from spinning in neutral because 
the transmission would heat up over a long distances. Is this true or false?
