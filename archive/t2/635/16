Don, In all my years working on vans I've never seen a motor fail, and
here in Hawaii they get used a lot! A lot more likely is the shafts
going through the body getting stuck due to corrosion or lack of
lubricant or the contacts inside get dirty,  crusty or burnt  due to
shafts being sticky. They are not that hard to service , clean + lube,
once you get them out. Get your glove box out of the way, one  screw
holds the strap to the dash, one 10mm bolt holds the bottom of the motor
and you need to take off the wiper arms/caps/nuts to pull the shafts
back out of the body. On later vans there's some plastic defroster
ductwork you'll need to get out of the way,too. The motor can be
unscrewed from the gearbox to gain access to the contacts, use a
scotchbrite pad, not sandpaper, to clean them.Disconnect the arms and
remove the clips to pull out the shafts to clean and lube them. On some
vans, the motor will run , but the arms don't move or slowly. This
indicates that the shaft inside the gearbox has sheared its connection
to the nylon gear. I know of no way to fix that other than to replace
it.  Good luck, Tim
