Don,

Go to:
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-73-75.jpg
and look at current tracks 16-18.  This describes the wiring for your
wiper motor.

With the switch in the off position there should be 12V at terminal 53a.
With the switch in the low position there should be 12V at 53a and 53.
With the switch in the high position there should be 12V at 53a and 53b.
After the switch is off until the wipers reach the "park" position there
will be 12V at terminals 53a and 53e.

If all of these check then the problem lies in the wires to the motor or
the motor.

Yes.  The ills to which the wiper motor is subject are:

The wire connections to the motor can corrode,[1]
the motor can rust to a solid block inside,[1]
the nylon drive gears inside the housing can split, especially if
the shafts that the wiper arms mount on sieze to their guide tubes.

If possible I would suggest that you visit a yard with a bus and remove
the wiper motor.  This has numerous advantages over removing your own as a
primary effort.  First, if you muck it up, then you can move on to the
next bus and try again.  Second, it gives you a spare and a spare set of
mounting hardware.  This is good because it is very easy to drop a bit
into the front well and very difficult to find that bit.

To remove the motor you need to remve any radio gear that you have in the
dash, you need to remove the single mounting nut from the stud near the
motor (this one's a bit trick to find and get a wrench on). Then you
remove the electrical wires or plug from the motor.  Then you need to
remove arms[2] and the escutcheons from outside the bus. Push the stubs
through the body and remove the motor and frame to the glovebox side of
the bus.  Removing the glovebox can help but is not necessary.

Before reinstalling the motor assembly be sure to lubricate all points of
motion, especially the shafts and sleeves that the arms attach to with a
waterproof grease.

[1] These are far more likely in a bus with serious leaks under the
windshield, which you describe in the previous post.

[2] The arms are pressed onto a conical spline by a nut on the shaft.
Remove the nut, fold the arm up and rock the arm at 90 degrees to the axis
of fold to loosen the splines.

OOK!
