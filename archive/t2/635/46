Subject: Bosch vs. Beru

I have several coil to distributor ignition wires of varying resistance values.

The Bosch ones are new and read 10-18k ohms depending on the length. The Beru ones and used and read almost zero ohms.

Does anyone know the reason why? Is this on purpose?

The last time I diagnosed a faulty ignition problem it turned out to be a coil wire that read zero ohms and I'm wondering if these Beru wires are otherwise ok.
