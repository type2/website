Hmmm...another "discovery" on our new '78 bus.  I don't think there's a 
thermostat.  I removed the p-side lower engine tin and don't see signs 
of anything--no bracket, no cable, no thermostat, oh boy.  What started 
as a check of the thermo's operation is turning into a big job.  The 
good news, I guess, is that the rod spring is present and holding the 
flaps full open.

Does anyone have a link to a photo of what everything should look like? 
  And/or a really good description?  I have a Bentley on order, 
hopefully it will help.  Finally, does this list from busdepot.com look 
like I'll have everything I need to install?

Thermostat Cable
Thermostat Cable Pulley
Thermostat Cable Sealing Washer

Thermostat Cable Union Nut

Thermostat Assy Screw

Thanks, I'd guess this is pretty critical as winter approaches in 
Montana.

thanks,
