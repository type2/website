Check the Bentley, I just did this a couple of months ago. Ask Ken at
theBusCo for a driver's side regulator. He's in Seattle, and he'll
charge you less than $25 for it. I don't believe you can replace just
the gear, but you have to do the removal/install anyway, and this takes
like an hour if you include the celebratory beer afterwards.
For removal (IIRC): take off the strap thingy, handle and window crank
from the inside of the door. Take off the cardboardy panel. If you
still have the plastic sheet / vapor barrier, remove that. Unless your
bus is like mine, there's a bolt the holds the ventwing. I think you
need to take that out too. Take out the bolts holding the regulator to
the window first, then push the window to the top of the doorframe with
your hands. Then, remove the bolts that connect the regulator to the
door. There are 2 at the bottom, 2 at the top and 2 by the window
crank. Now for the fun part - removing the regulator. It's not
connected to anything anymore, so now it comes down to wriggling it
out. Do the reverse for installation. I found getting the regulator
into the door and lined up properly was the hardest part. Oh, before I
installed the new-to-me part, I smeared axle grease into the sliding
channel that the gear works - made the window operation very nice.
Skill required: low
Patience required: high

Good luck, and say hi to Ken for me :)
