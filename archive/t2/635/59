Subject: Bosch vs. Beru

In my very limited knowledge, I have found you need to keep them as a set,
that is coil, HT lead and rotor. All have varying resistance, but all together
should be similar.
That being said I have interchanged Bosch rotor's with 5000 and 1000 ohms and
not noticed a difference.
All a little baffling I guess.
