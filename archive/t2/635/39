Jason,

Hmmmmm  the line below where you say

at low idle,
> ignition timing reads 4*.  Total advance is 40* in all cases.


...something wrong here.  ign timing should never read less than where you 
set it in the beginning....something is retarding your timing?

And at "full throttle" can go to 44+ degrees.  Pull the vac advance line
and plug it and see what your timing is.  Set it to ~7.5 at that point and 
then set the idle.  Then attach the vac line again...if the timing 
changes, then something else is wrong.

All of the above is predicated on you having the same dist that a stock 
78 would have...otherwise all bets are off.

Cheers, dave
