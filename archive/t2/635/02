I did some research on the old Radio Shack numbers and
came up with these.. 01. Bar graph array- # 276-081 
($2.79), 02. 20 Pin IC Socket- # 276-1991 ($.69), 03.
Printboard(Box & Board)- # 270-283 ($3.99), 04.
Capacitor 0.047 MF- # 272-1068 ($1.29), 05. Display
Driver LM3914- # 276-2892 ($1.49), 06. 18 Pin IC
Socket- # 276-1992 ($.59), 07. Resistor 2.2K Ohm- #
271-1325 ($.99), 08. Resistor 5600K Ohm- 271-1125
($.99)on this last one, I could not find a 1/4W one,
could only find a 1/2W, will it make a difference?
Radio Shack would give no help on crossing these
numbers to the correct ones from the old list, just
said we don't have them..I'm going monday and see if I
can get the parts to do this project, would be nice to
get the Fuel/Air right for a change on my old
bus/van's.  Phil
