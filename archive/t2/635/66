Subject: RE: [T2] proper way to tow type 2s

George said, ...  Auto gearboxes generally are pump-lubricated from the
engine side (most of
them, anyway) so they don't like to be towed.

	Yup,  That is the assumption I made.  Car makers give limits on
speed and distance, however, why chance it?  I removed the CV joints so that
the transaxle and automatic transmission would not spin at all.  This choice
was easier because one CV had a torn boot and all the other boots are sad
looking and cracked.

	If you barrow a tow bar and try to back up the driveway, your friend
will get a new tow bar when you bend the barrowed tow bar.  Can anyone
suggest a good place to get a replacement for the older VW bug tow bar?  It
was one of the kind that slip up onto the front beam and has two locking
pins that slide in to U shaped parts of the tow bar to pin it in place.
