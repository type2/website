Subject: Missing Item from '72?

I recently bought one of those pre-cut carpet sets for my 1972 bus.  As
I was installing the piece in the back cargo area, I noticed a notch cut
out on the right side, as though the carpet should go around something.
This is across the bus from where the spare tire sits.  After further
investigation, it appears that something was indeed once attached over
there, but is no longer there.  Does anyone know what this was?  A fire
extinguisher, a tool set, a jack?  Just curious.  My carpet looks
strange now with a notch cut out of it, but nothing there.
