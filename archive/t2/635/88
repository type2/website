Subject: Idle question

First this is a t1 motor with 009(yeah, I know).  It has been sitting for 
a few weeks/months.

It starts and idles fast until it warms up and then it dies.  It is 
undriveable once this happens. Fuel and spark don't seem to be a problem.  
I can keep it running as long as the rpms are up.

I have some theories. 
1) The timeing is Timing off.
2) The 009 is sticking.

This is a car I am trying to buy but don't want to until I see it running.  
So any suggestions would be helpful.

Thanks
Steve
