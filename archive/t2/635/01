Subject: Re: [T2] CHT sender follow-up redux

We have an aircraft mechanic that builds T4 for aircraft. I asked him about 
the accuracy problems in CHT for VW. He said accurate instruments that are 
aircraft certified are hundreds of dollars.

temperature gradient curve is logarithmic instead of linear.  What this
means is if you test your sender with boiling water and it reads a
little bit off, it will read WAY off by the time the temperature gets
up into the 400 degree neighborhood.
