Subject: John Brown's Buses 2004 Comes to a Close!

    It's all over.  John Brown's Buses 2004 came to a close today.  I said good bye to the Canadian carabus that was five strong
around 12:30.  The turn out exceeded my wildest dreams for this year.  Including day trippers coming locally, there were 50 buses
total. I feel like we spent an entire year together (according to the weather) We saw sunshine, overcast skies, gushing winds, rain,
temperatures ranging from moderate to bone chilling.
    I want to thank everyone who came because you are what makes an event special and a success.  I want to thank all our sponsors
who donated some very generous door prizes.  I will have pictures on the web site shortly.  I look forward to JBB 2005 October 14th
-16th.
 
Joy thru air,
