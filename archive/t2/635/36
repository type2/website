Subject: FS: Bosch distrib curving machine

Hi gang...

Cruising home from John Browns Busses I had a bunch of time to think 
about "priorities", and a number of things came to mind...most important 
is some upcoming surgery that dictates a lifestyle change, but that's 
another story...

1) I'm not getting any younger, and the chances of my locating the 
fountain of youth before I retire are slim at best...

2) What I want to do after retirement is less intense than what I've 
done for the last 40 years, so I need to sell some things I'm not using, 
and buy/trade the ones I need to carry on...

3) One of the neatest things I have in machines is a distributor curving 
machine that came out of the R&D center for Bosch North America..what I 
want is a Snap-on or equivalent valve and seat grinding capability...

If anyone would be interested in a buy/trade, please contact me off 
list...I have pictures.

Thanks, Den.
