Subject: Delays shipping parts to Canada via Postal mail

There are "serious delays" with inbound international postal mail 
into western Canada.

There is currently a delay at customs up to five weeks.

If you live in Canada, especially western Canada, ask your foreign 
vendors to ship UPS or Fedex etc.
DO NOT USE POSTAL MAIL.

Vendors that ship to Canada SHOULD NOT use postal mail for the next 
few weeks...
