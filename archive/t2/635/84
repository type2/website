	Thanks, I have been reading for months and learning from you all a
lot. 

	I also marked the inner side and outer side.  I still don't know why
I had six mm cap screws in the CV's.  Must have been the PO.  The washer
plates (locking plates) were still there.

DON'T FORGET to mark left and right, on an auto tranny the CV shafts are
different length
