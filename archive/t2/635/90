Subject: Starting problem

Newbie type question...

77 2.0L FI

Im having problems starting. Its turning over, just not catching. When/If I
can get it started, it tries to die very soon after. If I manage to get it
going and drive for a while, it runs ok and doesnt try to stall.
The battery is has a good reading on the meter. The headlights dim (almost
go out) when trying to start.

Thanks in advance...Eric
