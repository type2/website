Subject: shift ball replacement

Greetings!

I've been having a bit of a problem shifting my '79 into 3rd and 4th these 
days.  I've checked all the easy fixes and everything from the transmission 
forward seems fine.  So, I'm thinking it's that little ball inside the nose 
cone.  Is it necessary to repair this as soon as possible (i.e. as soon as I 
can motivate myself to remove the engine AGAIN) or can I keep relying on 
jiggling the shifter at the proper RPM to get it into 3rd?  There usually is 
a bit of a verbal disagreement from the transmission when I do this.

I guess what I'd really like to hear is, "Oh yeah, I've been driving my bus 
like that for years - no worries".

Hopefully,
mike
