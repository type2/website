The Bosch and Beru plug wires (1-2-3-4) both have 1kohm or 1.4kohm leads.
The observed value depends on the length (the two leads for the rear are
shorter because the tin is closer to the top of the plug).

Certainly the resistance in the system can change by that amount and the
engine will still fire.

That's when a continuity checker that beeps is handy to confirm.
