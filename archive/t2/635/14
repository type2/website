Subject: Quick help needed with wipers

Stupid Bentley.

I'm trying to get my wipers to work. They never have, but now that
it's raining, I've got to make 'em work.

Fuse good.
Pulled switch apart: 12v to the 53's, ground to 31. Good. 
Visible inspection of wiring to harness then to motor good. 

Bentley says that the motor should run if the switch is on and ground
to 31 and 12v to 30. But 30 is the interior light! Nothing to do with
wipers.

I can't get my arms up under the dashboard to see if the 12v is making
it to the motor, but everything "looks" like it's good. Can a motor
just sieze up?
