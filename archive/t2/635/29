Subject: Re: [T2] Quick help needed with wipers

Guys,

78 Champagne edition with intermittent wipers.

Just went thru this last Saturday.  Turns out that my wipers just got 
slower and slower and then just stopped.  When i restored the bus, I spent 
a lot of time on the wipers, relubing, checking the motor and contacts and 
testing...

When the wipers got really slow, the intermittent relay started buzzing as 
well....

Turns out, all I had to do was pull the connector off of the motor and 
then put it back on...worked like a champ then.  Next time I am up under 
the dash, I will clean the contacts all again.

Important point...when you have the switch unplugged from the harness, and 
turn the key on, my wipers start to run...


The switch(which I had out as well) does look like a perfect candidate for 
a small micro switch that would run an electric washer pump.  it is on my 
list for the near future as I alread have a universal pump from the local 
FLAPS that will work on it.

Richard, my original switch look like yours and does run the wipers for 
about 4 wipes...maybe part of the intermittent wiper stuff that came std 
on the Champagne edition?

BTW!  Does any one have, or can the give me a reference to a wiring 
diagram that shows the intermittent wiper relay?  I *have* bentley, but 
could not find the relay info, even in the 79 wiring section...did I miss 
it?

Cheers, dave
