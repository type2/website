Subject: Ohhh, man... I'm soooo nervous!

We had our first real rain last night/this morning since I've owned
the bus. I know some of the door seals aren't up to snuff. I haven't
replaced them because I honestly forget about them since it never
rains here.

I don't wanna go look. I just did all that interior work... Sigh.
