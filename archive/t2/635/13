Leaks found:

Driver's side door seal. (I knew that was bad and have a seal to install.)
Sliding door seal. 
Windshield (due to rust)

But the worst is the window in the hitop on the passenger side!
Crap!!! That thing flooded my interior!

I'm going to go RTV the crap out of it before the rain starts again,
but I'm not expecting much. Grrr....
