Richard,

Plug wires come in either resistance or "real" wire.

I always use "real" wire as I hate the resistance ones...can go flakey in 
a second.  Sound like the beru are real wire and the bosch are resistance 
wires.

You *can* get bosch real wire sets.

There is still resistance in the spark plug boots..about 1k ohm I suspect.
I just measured mine on my bus and got a little less in the 1/3 side and a 
little more in the 2/4 side.  YMMV

Zero ohms is good as far as I am concerned.

Cheers, dave
