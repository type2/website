1st go into the house and retrieve your Bentley manual and/or Haynes. 

Remove armrest, door handle, window crank. 

Remove door panel. 

Unbolt regulator from door and window. Slide winodw all the way up, and remove the regulator. 

Install the new one from Bus Depot/Aircooled.net/etc. 

Installation is reverse of the above procedure. 

These doors are really great - durable and simple. 

Enjoy!
