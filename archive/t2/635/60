Hi Don,

Check these out:

www.bustedbus.com

I used to live in Aspen and did a few campouts and carabuses with the Club 
folks -- nice people, every last one of them.  There are a few big all-VW 
shows in Denver each year, and there's a decent amount of Buses in the 
Denver area.  If you head North towards Boulder (~20min), you'll see a lot 
more, as Boulder is a college town with all the associated neo-hippy types, 
and lots of Buses.  When in the Boulder area, be sure to check out BustedBus 
-- it's a great source of used parts, old Buses, and good mechanical folks.

I'm sorry to hear you may have to move, but Colorado is a lot more 
Bus-friendly, despite the fact that it gets much colder there than in 
southern CA.  No safety inspection, emissions inspection only in certain 
areas, and no emissions testing for vehicles more than 25 years old.  Better 
than CA, where I hear they pull you over for having the wrong brand of spark 
plugs in your Bus!

Good Luck!
