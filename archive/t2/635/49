Hi Folks:

In September I borrowed a big ol' Suburban and helped a friend tow a 
disabled Westy back some 200 miles home from the Mendocino coast.  We 
used a rental dolly, propped the front wheels and put the 
transmission in neutral.  Stopped and checked every half our to 45 
min.

Think I hurt anything?  The big ol' Bus Depot box showed up and now 
we need to put it together again.  It DOES fire right up but will run 
better with a fan and flywheel..

Thanks,

BEN
