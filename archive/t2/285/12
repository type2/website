Have you checked your brake fluid?

what would cause the brake pedal to not come back up after i take my foot
off of it? then, one time out of 10 it goes straight to the floor and
doesnt do anything... again, doesnt pop back up for a few seconds. then
it will grab a bit like before.

irony~they worked fine (well, not as well as earlier today, so they just
started this on my way home tonight) but when i tried to turn on MY
street, that was when they went to the floor but wouldnt grab... pulled
the e-brake, then let it back and turned on the next street, went around
the block. the brakes were weak, but worked... sorta... but when i went
to turn on MY street from the back way, THEY WENT TO THE FLOOR AGAIN! it
was like the bus just DIDNT want to go home! lol.

waving... people outta the way CUZ I CANT STOP!!!
