I didn't see where you adjusted your rear shoes before you started this
procedure to bleed them

If the wheel cylinders have to move out too far, the pedal will be lower.

You can check this easily,, pull out your Ebrake, and step in the pedal. did
that do anything to the amount of pedal movement?
does it come out more than 6 clicks?

Make sure the rear shoes are adjusted, and see where you are .
