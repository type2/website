Mint used might be tough, but I'm sure you could find it easily from Bus
Depot, Busted Bus or Rocky Mountain with no problem.  I've been working
on the same project myself.

Subject: [T2] Heater Boxes

Does anyone know where I can get good new stock passenger (right) side
heater 
box for my 1973 VW Bus?   Code #: 029 256 092 C

At one point I made a connection with a company that could order them
direct 
from VW in Germany, but I lost the contact on that.  

Does anyone have any ideas?  If not, does anyone know where I can get a
mint 
used one?

Thanks!
