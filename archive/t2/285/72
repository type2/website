Subject: volt meter

I am about to go on a road trip with my 71 westy and preparing my travel kit.
I haven't used my voltmeter (analog, radio shack) in a while, so I tried to
test it by putting the probes in an electrical outlet, thinking it would read
120volts. Instead I get nothing. I flipped the dial all around all scales, and
amps too, nothing. I even changed the battery, which if I'm not mistaken is
only useful to test resistance. Is my meter shot? How could this have
happened?
