Hiya All,

Just had to comment on the piece above..........  Most of you are probably 
too young to remember this.  Back in the sixties the Traffic Safety Institute 
(I believe) ran commercials advising drivers to take off their shoes on long 
trips.  It was supposed to help you stay alert at the wheel.  They showed a 
gorgeous blonde (natch) in a Chevy convertible tooling on down the highway 
with no shoes.  I'n not sure that the shoe removal thing works, but the 
blonde would have kept me awake.
