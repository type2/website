I agree the Bentley is a MUCH better manual overall, and I would consider it 
a necessity.  BUT.  The Clymer book I have was the ONLY reference I could 
find information on my one piece throttle-valve positioner.  It had a nice 
diagram and photos that the Bentley did not have.  I keep mine in the 
glovebox 'cause the Bentley doesn't fold very well... ;^)
