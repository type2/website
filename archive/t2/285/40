Did you see where it's located?  Catalina Island, CA
A 25 mile trip across the Pacific Ocean via boat, helicopter or seaplane
Heck, I don't know if the seaplanes are still running.
Not exactly easy access for "inspection"

It's actually a sweet setup for the island.  Very few of the roads over 
there would you want to go over 25mph and with our lack of rain, those side 
panels could stay off most of the year.

A neighbor had a buddy pull up with a bay bus that had been converted to 
topless.  They cut off the top and reinforced the bottom to make a "party 
convertible beach cruiser".  The things us left coasters will do.  Must be 
all the sun baking the sense out of our heads.
