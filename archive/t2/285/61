Further to what Richard Atwell wrote,
Yes, you need a 'triple square spanner. 8mm to remove the CV's
The drum often rusts to the hub as pointed out, but don't forget to loosen the
brake shoes with the 'star adjusters' as sometimes the shoes wear into the
drum leaving a lip on the edge preventing the drum from coming off.
As for the squeak, I found a strange one on my '77, the spacer the arm the
hand brake pushes on was rattling and giving off a high pitch squeal at
certain speeds. I think there should be a clip to hold it onto the spring
originally. It's something worth checking for.
