Hi Volks, dug through the junk in my garage last night and found the
following VW original publication manuals:
1. Original Service manual to '76 with colored wiring diagram- great
shape. 
2. AFC Fuel injection troubleshooting guide.  This is the original one
that Sami Daki had on the list. It goes from November 1974.
3. BA4 gas heater trouble shooting guide from August 1972.
4. AFC fuel injection trouble shooting manual Type2 1976.

I have $35.00 in the service manual and about $25.00 in each of the
others. If anyone is interested, let me know. TBear

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
