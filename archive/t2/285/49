Michael was very patient indeed!  It was a number of months between when
Pacesetter promised availability on their new U.S. made exhaust system, and
when they actually delivered it.  All the while, I'd call them every few
weeks, and be promised each time that they'd be shipping "in a few weeks."
I guess it took them a while to ramp up the new factory.

It was worth it, though. The muffler is quite nice. This is a one-piece
replacement for the convoluted '75-78 Bus non-California exhaust system. It
looks like the stock muffler, but with an integrated tailpipe and with
simple tubes going to the heat exchangers instead of that confounded
crossover pipe setup.  So it's all you need behind the heat exchangers.
Basically the same as they had before, but a bit more nicely put together
now that they're making it themselves in the U.S. rather than in Mexico.  If
some of you remember the Ansa one-piece setup sold years ago (which was
actually Italian), this is pretty much the same thing.  For years I had been
trying to persuade Ansa to resume production of theirs, but they weren't
biting.  This upgraded Pacesetter pretty much resolves the issue.

I still recommend switching over to the stock '72-74 setup as the best
option for non-California '75-78 bus owners, as this eliminates all kinds of
no-longer-available parts in your '75-78 system, and the still-available OEM
(or stainless) '72-74 setup still outclasses the Pacesetter.  But that is a
somewhat expensive option, as it also entails replacing the '75-78 heat
exchangers with '72-74 ones. On the other hand, this Pacesetter setup is a
direct bolt-on to your stock heat exchangers.  So short of replacing your
heat exchangers and all, it is your best bet (and not at all expensive).

My part number is 352000 and the price is $99.95. (No further discount on
this item, as it's very low profit at the $99 price. Pacesetter sells it for
$135.)  When ordering, be sure to specify PACESETTER ONLY in the comments
section of the order form, as we may have a couple of stray Empi units still
lying around from before the Pacesetters finally came back in.
