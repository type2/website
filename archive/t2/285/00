Subject: Dropping T4 Engine without Tranny Questions

Ok, my clutch is screwed up, so I am dropping the engine. I have done it a
couple of times before, but not without my buddy's help. I got the carbs
off, the tins off. disconnected the fuel line, accelerator cable, alternator
cables, starter, removed the coil,etc... I rolled the back wheels up on some
sturdy ramps, and got the front wheels blocked off. here we go..

1) Do I need to support the tranny in some way, or will it stay in place
when I unbolt the engine from the bell housing?
It depends if it has an upper support bracket above the two engine carrier
bolts and the starter, which bolts it to the
frame of the bus. I've seen early bays (68-71) that didn't have it, and
Later Bays seem to have the extra Bracket.

 2) Do I need to remove the oil filler neck from the case?
Not Necessary. I would remove the plastic portion though and stuff a rag in
the hole or else you'll spill oil when you pull it.

 3 Does it sound like I should get someone who knows what is going on here,
or does it sound like I am doing ok so far! (lil' joke)

Doing Fine. Use a good floor jack. If you're not sure about the Trans
Bracket then support the transmission bell housing with a scissor jack and a
block of wood in between bell housing and jack to spread the load.
