Just the "aura" from an evil PO.

Replaced them with what, exactly?

What was done in this "rebuild," and by whom?

With the same compression tester?  Are you sure the O-ring on the tester is 
sealing properly?
Is your battery fully charged, and all spark plugs removed?

It would mean that the piston rings are leaking, not the valves.

A leak down test is much more informative than a compression test.
The device costs around $50, and you must have some source of compressed
air--though high volumes are not required.

Is this an accurate reading? (have you calibrated it with a known correct
lab thermometer--about $4 ?)  Is your cooling system (including all tinware
and seals) all present and installed correctly?

You will if you keep running it way too hot.

>Should I first try retorquing the heads?

It sure wouldn't hurt any.  I'd retorque the case while I was at it.

>Evil spirits?

At the base of the PO's front door, arrange five black candles around
a chrome 009 distributor.  Light the candles.  Open a can of soda pop
(Budweiser will work fine, here).  Drink half, throw half away.
Read the "Rap on Oil" sermon from Muir's Idiot Guide backwards.
Blow out the candles, and sneak off without being seen.

Burn it, unless you have need for a doorstop.

Forget about the doorstop--just burn it!!

Clymer............evil..................burn it NOW!!
