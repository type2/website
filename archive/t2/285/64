...................I'll give you two local options: (1) Bill, at Der 
Wagonwerks, 126 Yorkshire Court, Elyria, OH 44035; (440)322-9459. He is 
about 30 minutes from Cleveland. If Bill accepts your contract or any part 
of it, you will get a fine engine back from him. Bill doesn't do much 
except VW buses. It is his specialty.  (2) More of a generalist, but a very 
experienced VW enthusiast and engine rebuilder right there in Cleveland is 
Ron Yanus,who wns Done Right Engine & Machine, Inc., 12955 York Delta 
Drive, (440)582-1366: Ron Yanus is a former auto shop teacher who started 
his own engine rebuilding company many years ago after years as a VW 
enthusiast in his youth. Ron accepted the contract to rebuild my type 4 
about 3 years ago, and did a very fine and careful job. His shop 
specializes in restorations of fine vintage cars.



 >2. Any good local (Ohio/ Cleveland area) venders good for emergency parts 
i.e.
 >bolts, misc. hardware, oversized piston rings? I would prefer not to wait 
for

............Again, right there in Cleveland: Euclid Foreign Motors, Inc 
20020 St. Clair Ave., (216)481-9200.



 >4. Any idea how long to breakdown an engine?? The breakdown of the engine
 >only. (assuming I "know" what to do/ no major suprises/ accidents, etc)
 >Cleaning and rebuilding, I believe, will the long and time consuming part.

............Set aside at least three days to take it apart and clean up the 
major grime, once it is out of the chassis. And give yourself an hour at 
the end of every day to clean yourself up. The rebuilding part is something 
others can best address, as there are lots of variables. Talk to someone 
like Bill at Der Wagonwerks. Call him up.

 >5. I plan on taking pictures with a digital camera I will be borrowing 
for my
 >own reference. If I have time, can I post pictures to the group? Or
 >do/should I set up a ftp or website?
......those pictures and _lots_ of real tags and labels on wires and hoses, 
etc, will help you greatly to get it back together.

 >Thanks,
 >Mike

Here is a PARTIAL parts list I used when I was planning to rebuild a 1976 
type 2 Westfalia Campmobile, 118,000 miles, with original 2.0 liter engine, 
never rebuilt prior to that project, and never out of the vehicle. It 
had  solid lifters and manual shift tranny. I considered rebuilding with 
hydraulic lifters, so I got quotes both ways.

THE PROJECT GOALS:

Heads: rebuilt with new seats, guides, valves & springs, solid lifters. 
EXCHANGE.

lifter heads.
