It's a triple square or sometimes called a serrated wrench. Get the right
tool in case this happens again in the future.

Visit your VWFLAPS. They either have BugPack Tool #7057 or EMPI #5796.

...or try Pepboys for K-D which for the same price as the socket you'll get
4 bits (6-8-10-12mm I think) which fit into a  3/8" socket...

It sounds like what happened to me: the drum has rusted to the hub.  There's
actually not much surface area to contact the two but it's likely rusted
together.  Get a big hammer and give the drum a couple of good whacks.  I
bet it comes loose and then you can wiggle it off.
