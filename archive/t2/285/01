Hey Rick,

The door panel just pops off.  Just remove all the screwed on parts; the 
door pull, the door latch well cover and the window crank.  The window 
crank is a snap ring. You can get the snap ring with a flat head screw 
driver and/or a pair od needle nose pliers.

The arm rest is attached to the door panel and will come off with it.  

The panel itself has about 20 or so push clips that can be popped off. 
 To prevent you panel from ripping around the clip you might try a 1 
inch paint scraper to help pry the clip out.  Just start in one spot and 
work your way around the panel.

The Bentley manual has all the info and pictures you'll ever need for 
repair.  Also many VW part web sights have the parts and pictures listed 
if you don't have the Bentley.  The window crank assembly and track 
system is fairly simple and you should be able to figure out what's up 
without much trouble.
