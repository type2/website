Subject: Rebuild questions - '78 2.0L

ALMOST finished with my '78 2.0L rebuild, have a couple of quick questions.  
Appreciate any help....

1- Are these weep holes I see in the top of my tranny?  Have the tranny out, 
rolling it around to clean about 1/4" of solid gunk off it, and transmission 
fluid comes pouring out of a weep hole.  On further inspection, there is at 
least 1 hole that really looks like a weep hole, a couple of others that 
might or might not be weep holes.  What's the story on that?

2- I've been reading up, getting ready to reinstall the flywheel.  Some of 
the books mention a felt washer near the flywheel.  I don't believe I have 
one in my gasket kit.  Do I need one for a '78?

Those are the major questions for now.  Still trying to decide how to preset 
my valves for hydraulic lifters, still struggling on getting out that *)$!& 
pilot bearing.  Had to take a miniature pipe wrench to my valve adjusting 
screws to get those worn-out suckers out of the rocker arms.  Boy were they 
in there - and I bet they hadn't been adjusted for more than 20 years.

Thanks for any advice,

Beth in Houston
