Subject: NEW BUS RESOLUTION / New Years Eve Campout

GET READY TO BRING IN THE NEW YEAR..........in the best place one could 
imagine......a VW BUS CAMPOUT.

I apologize for not getting information out sooner,  but I am glad that I 
have not posted the web page as of yet, because we WILL BE MOVING THE 
LOCATION for the campout.

Previously the event was held at Camp Croft State Park.

NOW THE EVENT WILL BE HELD AT THE PINE RIDGE CAMPGROUND.  This campgrounf is 
located in the same town - Spartaburg, SC.  The folks at the State Park were 
let's say.....less that accomidating.  Plus, the facilities and the camsites 
are much nicer at the Pine Ridge Campground.....a private campground owned 
by a nice Canadian couple that moved down South.

So here are the details.

DATES:  DEC 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 2002  and JAN 1, 2003
come and camp as many nights as you can, even if it is only new years ever

WHERE:  PINE RIDGE CAMPGROUND - Spartanburg, SC
located near Walnut Grove Plantaion

They are not very busy at this time of year, so we will almost have the 
entire place to ourselves. You will not need to call and make reservations, 
but you can if you like:  the campground phone # is: (864)576-0302.

DIRECTIONS TO CAMPGROUND:   Take I-26 away from Spartanburg (towards 
Columbia, SC) and take Exit 28: HWY 221.   Take HWY 221 NORTH, approx. 200 
feet to light, and turn right on "Stillhouse Road".  Go one mile to Stop 
Sign and take left on "Ott Shoals Road"...go 1.5 miles and see campground 
signs on the left.

There will be more information posted later about the Full Moon Burritos.
