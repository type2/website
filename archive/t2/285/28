Subject: 73 Turn Signal Switch

Hello all,
Anyone out there have an extra turn signal switch for a 73 Bus?  Mine seems 
to be on the fritz.
When I turn it on the lights on the dash light up but that's it.  Not lights 
at the front or tail indicators.
I've checked the flasher and it's good.
Have some parts to trade if you want to go that route.
Please email me off the list.
Regards,
Al
