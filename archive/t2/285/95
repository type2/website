Subject: Rocky Mountian Motorworks catalogues

Is RMMW making their nifty catalogues any longer? They refuse to send one up
here to Canada to me, even though I've bought tons of stuff from them. This
is weird. Is it out of print or something? Anybody got one kicking around
they'd be willing to mail? Of course I'll pay for it.
Thanks,
Courtney
