Subject: weber carb

Hello,

I have a 74 bus with a rebuilt 2.0L.  I bought a used weber 32/36 progresive
carb from somebody that lived in Maryland. I live in Denver Colorado and I
am having a hard time tuning this carburetor. I don't have any experience
with carbs but from what I have read I think the carb is running lean. I
thought a rebuild would help so I bought the kit and it did not help.  I
have to turn the idle up high or it will stall when I come to a stop.  Also
I have the idle mixture screw out about 3 1/2 turns. It starts ok in the
cold and runs great while its warm,  but after it gets hot it idles
terribly. Does anybody have any jetting suggestions? Or is this a different
problem? Any insight would be helpfull!
air jets are 180 and 170
main jets are 145 and 140
idle jets are 50 and 55

thanks.
