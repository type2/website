yeah but there is a simple solution, call and place your order,  I rarely
use the web site....and on the phone it is easier to clear up any
confusions...so it cost's a buck or two for the call, but then I always
get the 2nd day shipping too so I get to the front of the line...Ron makes
some mistakes, but as an owner of a small business I know that sometimes
things happen, it is what happens then that seperates the good guys from
the also rans and Ron has always made good on his mistakes (and a few of
mine too)
