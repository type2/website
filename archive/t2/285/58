Subject: Seat Question

Hi all,
Can some one e-mail me a close up photo of what the rear seat latches to?
I have a '77 micro bus which has the rear (rear most) seat that folds
forward. The seat is all in place, but I seem to have lost the parts it
latches to when it's up right. There are some holes just under where the
seat belt mounts in the rear parcel area.
Thanks in advance.
