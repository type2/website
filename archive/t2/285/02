I don't think that you should swap out the good axle.  Life of CV joints
varies widely, and the failure of one does not mean the others will fail.
I recently replaced an original joint on my '71 which went 270,000 miles
and was still quiet even though it was galling badly.  I just watch the
boots, and when one goes bad inspect the CVs while replacing the boots.
Of course, this doesn't work well with the "replace the whole axle"
philosophy, so you'll have to take your own path.
