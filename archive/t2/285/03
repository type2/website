Subject: Re: [T2] New trick for replacing bottom generator brush

Not a bad procedure, but I've never really had any problems with simply
removing the screw.  The bottom one is a bit tricky but as long as you put
a cloth under the generator to catch the screw if it falls it won't get
lost.  To reinstall, just tape the screw to the tip of a screwdriver and
then guide it through the tab and into its hole.

It helps to have a generator that is eating brushes regularly to get you
into practice!  :)
