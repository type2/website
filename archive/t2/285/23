Subject: Mechanical fuel pump

Hello list,

The fuel pump on my 74 Westy is dripping. I have already replaced it
with one out of my used parts box but it seems that both of them really
are in need of a rebuild. BTW, all hoses and clamps are new - that is
not the problem.

Busdepot has a new one for $99 which is a good deal, but still - it's
99 bucks that I don't really have to fix an annoyance that is not really
a problem yet.

I have rebuilt fuel pumps for other cars before. Is there any reason
why I should not try this one? Where can I get a rebuild kit? I did not
find any on the Bus Depot site and I could not even find fuel pumps at
Bus Boys.

What are the pro and cons of using an electric fuel pump? 

My engine is a 2 liter CJ case with dual Solex 38, dome top pistons,
and a 296 cam - so it is more or less a 2 liter 914 GB setup.

Marcus
