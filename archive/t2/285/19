You guys are forgetting about the pressure regulator. I have seen this fail
more often than the master cylinder when no brake fluid comes out the rear
cylinders.
It is mounted up in the frame on the drivers side middle.
Before I condemned the master cylinder, I would check for brake fluid on the
input side of the regulator. Bleed it like you are at the rears, except you
are cracking the line loose. If you get fluid under pressure going in, try
cracking the output line and see if you get fluid under pressure.... more than
likely you won't.
