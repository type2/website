Subject: Anything BAD about using hyd lifters in a 75 w/ stock cam??

At the moment, a friend/mechanic is redoing the top end of a 75 bus, and
we were discussing putting in hyd. lifters when the bottom end need not
be split......I've seen references to doing this with a stock cam, and
don't recall any bad outcomes mentioned when doing this- does it just
affect power, or can it wreck something later?  As this is for my
daughter's bus, (going to college end of next yr) I don't expect her to
overdo it, nor do I expect her to remember to have the valves adjusted
every 1500 mi or so or pay for it.......(and as an artist she doesn't
want to do it herself).
