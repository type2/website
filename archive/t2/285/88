Subject: setting up dual carbs/Other Ones tix 4sale

Hey list,

1.  Anyone in the Virginia area want to take their bus and SO to the Other
Ones in Roanoake on Thursday?  I have a pair (GA floor) that I need to get
rid of. Face or best offer.  Tell me today; I will Fedex them promptly.
(every dead show is the biggest bus gathering ever! not too many trailer
queens though)

2.  I need help on the procedure to set up a pair of dual Dell 34 FRD "Baby
Dells" on my 1835 DP.  Finally got all the parts and linkage together.  What
do I need to do to get these running.  How different is this from the
Bentley procedure for Solex dual carbs?  I think all I have is an idle mix
screw, these are pretty simple carbs.

thanks,
Will Anderson
