Subject: final inquiry (i promise) - jackstands?

volks-
i apologize for having to ask again, but being my first time having to jack 
my bus up and not having much experience as a mechanic, i want to be 
ABSOLUTELY SURE when it comes to my own safety. And maybe this will help 
someone else in the meantime. Please visit this page and respond if you know 
what you're doing. THANKS SO MUCH!!
