Subject: Heater Boxes

Does anyone know where I can get good new stock passenger (right) side heater 
box for my 1973 VW Bus?   Code #: 029 256 092 C

At one point I made a connection with a company that could order them direct 
from VW in Germany, but I lost the contact on that.  

Does anyone have any ideas?  If not, does anyone know where I can get a mint 
used one?

Thanks!
