Two rebuilt heads from AVP in Sacto.

Main reason for rebuild: #3 exhaust valve toast.  Compression then was
about 110/110/0/110.  I did the rebuild (well, with help from the list),
top end only.  Kept the p's & c's, since they were still in spec (borrowed
a micrometer to test tolerances as per Bentley).  Used new Grant rings.
Did the whole honing bit.  Cleaned all the nasty carbon off those p's &
c's.  Did lots of other ancillary stuff, not related to the engine (fuel
lines, clutch...)

I ended up taking the bus to a shop _twice_ to work out gremlins (which
still seem to be lingering).  Two problems initially: one hyd lifter had
come apart, result was lower compression (roughly 100/100/90/100).  Also,
distributor was replaced, since the advance wasn't working.  Second trip
to the shop was chasing down vacuum bugaboos (which I believe still isn't
quite resolved, though vac was 16" at last check).

Same compression tester, same way I've always tested, all plugs removed.
The test was done after driving for a few miles to warm up the engine.
Battery is relatively new, charged, and the starter is cranking just
fine.  Valves are adjusted as per Bently: 0 clearance, then 2 full turns.
One good thing to note: valve clatter that haunted me in the past has gone
away and the engine sounds relatively quiet.

I've already spent so much bread on tools and parts and trips to the
shop... Sigh...

When I installed the gauge a few years ago, I did the boiling water test
and it was right on.  The bus never used to overheat, unless the temp
outside was sweltering and I was driving in the desert.  Now, temps around
here are pretty cool.  The bus seems to heat up more driving at low
speeds as opposed to highway speeds.  All the tin is in place, and as far
as I can tell is installed properly.  It is getting so hot that the
rubber spark plug seals are all melted and shriveled.

Case was never split, this was a top end rebuild only.  Problem these days
is I recently threw out my back, so it is hard to get down on the ground
to do stuff like this.  I'm also finding less time to do work due to
family obligations...

Where do I go from here?  Should I just have a shop do a leakdown test?
Am I looking at _another_ rebuild?  If so, anyone want to buy a bus?  :^(
