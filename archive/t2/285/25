Sure.  It will work even better if you soak the built-up spots with
degreaser for a day or so, scrubbing periodically with a stiff brush
before you blast 'em.  If build up is thick, you
might need to soak and spray several times.  Resist the urge to scrape
with a screwdriver unless you are priming and painting again.
