 There are so many factors involved with purchasing old parts like these I can't see how posting to the list is going to be productive especially when the matter hasn't been fully resolved. I've been tempted on occasion to write up such emails but it's usually a bad idea to write when you're mad and in hindsight I'm glad I didn't. I value the vendors far more than that and as you can tell from Ron's replies it's disrespectful.

Missing parts, late parts, wrong parts, duplicates: these are the realities of mail order.

As a reader of this list what am I supposed to do?  Go to the ends of the earth to avoid a particular vendor because of problem with a perfectly good part that was lost by a third party when my experience has been excellent?

Maybe we should amend the list charter.
