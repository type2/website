Subject: HC Emissions Trend Line??

At lunch, I was looking over my three previous vehicle emissions reports, 6 
years period. (I have got to get a LIFE!!)

The data:

RPM           HC ppm

809	433  (I failed - 400 is upper limit)
914	373
983	305

I would say there is some relationship between RPM and HC ppm.

If I had my RPM at 1000, what would I expect my HC ppm to be (I estimate 288 
ppm); and at 1050, what would I expect for HC ppm?

Thanks to all the math teachers out there...

So, hint, if your are concerned about your emissions exam, get your idle 
speed up to 950 at warmed engine.  Or not . . .
