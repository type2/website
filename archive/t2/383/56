Well, the isopropyl you buy at the drug store is 70%.  That may or may not
be saturated, but let's say that it is just for argument's sake.  The
"drying" version is 90 or 95 percent.  The difference between these is
about 25%, so it would be reasonable to say that each ounce of alcohol
will absorb a quarter ounce of water.

There is a fair amount of sump space below the outlet in a gas tank.
Getting the alcohol down there is pretty tough, and you can be spitting
water for some time even with dryers.  Does this tank have a removable
outlet like my '71?  If it does, pull the outlet and flush it with a
couple of gallons of fresh gas.
