Yuck, they must have gotten more strict since my last California emissions test, which was back in 1995.  Back then, the spec was something like 650-1,050rpm so I always set mine at about 1,000rpm.  I don't think there was any idle rpm spec on the sticker - it was shown on the screen of the gargantuan emission check machines.  Not sure where the spec originated but I remember them looking stuff up in a large book.
