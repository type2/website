Subject: coil primary resistance-more info

This is what the directions say: " The total resistance in the ignition coil primary circuit (coil primary resistance plus any resistor or resistance wire), must be at least 2.0 ohms.
When using  the Compu-Fire module with a low resistance coil, 0.5 to 0.75 ohms, a suitable "ballast resistor must be installed between the ignition switch and coil.  A suitable resistor would be 1.5 ohms and 50 watts."
 
So the four coils I have all have a minimum of 2.0 ohms internal resistance. So I should not have a problem running the Compu-Fire with out a resistor.  
 
The blue coils have an internal resistance of 3.4 ohms,  The blacks have 2.0 and 2.9 ohms resistance.  Are the blue coils a Better choice?
