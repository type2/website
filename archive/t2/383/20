Subject: Which Distributor?

Hi gang,

VW newbie here... just bought my first one after 10+ years of lusting!  I
love it!!

She is a 69 Campmobile.  According to PO, recently rebuilt 1600.  Can't
find the engine code, so I don't know exactly what it is... but it looks
pretty stock to me.  It has a 009 dist and a 30 pict 2 carb.  I keep
reading that the 009 is not a good dist for a bus due to the advance
issues... my question is should I replace it, and with what?  The engine
runs great, but I want it to last (and better fuel economy would be nice
too).  Thanks!
