Subject: RE: [T2] Isopropyl Alcohol to Water to Gasoline Ratio?

You probably want to drain the entire tank.  Then add maybe a quart of
industrial alcohol. Slosh it around, then dain it again, then fill up with
fuel and maybe some Heet or more alcohol (same thing). Don't use drug store
rubbing alcohol; it's already got plenty of water and won't absorb any more.
You want the industrial stuff used for cleaning electronics...it's almost
100% alcohol w/ almost no water (flammable!).

If the vehicle mostly runs OK, you could just try adding a couple bottles of
Heet with every fill up. Eventually this will get all the water. How long
depends on how much...

It appears that person or persons unknown thought it would be fun to
dump at least a gallon or so of water in the gas tank, and run the motor or
fuel pump until the Dellortos filled with water.  Buses don't run very well
on water, but at least it wasn't sucrose.  The inlet line to the fuel pump
was disconnected, the water was let run, all fuel lines were purged of
water, and the carbs were field stripped and cleaned, several small bottles
of Iso-heat brand of water-getter were given, but upon returning the bus
home, it's still showing traces of water in the float bowls.  Not a lot, but
