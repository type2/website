That might have been from me. The Karmann Ghia Club of North America offers "The Key to Metal Bumping" as a regalia item (I'm the regalia guy) for $15 postpaid. You can send a check to the club address (see www.karmannghia.org) or you can cut the response time and send it to my PayPal account at sonofed(-at-)karmannghia.org.

The Key to Metal Bumping teaches the old school method of body repair that stresses deconstructing the damage from the moment of impact to bring the body back to its original state with minimal need for body fillers afterwards. The book was originally published in the 30's and the current version is a reprint from 1953. I worked in the auto body field for 12 years and when I read this book and put it to practice it was a total revelation for me to see a body panel come back to its original shape. I think this book can be especially helpful when working on a Bus with its large flat panels that are seemingly so
hard to fix because of the metal stretching involved.
