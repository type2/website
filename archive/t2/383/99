Hi,

I have a few sets USED (with mounting screws) of the Westy child cot
brackets
($10 plus $5 shipping/handling), if anyone jumps on Ron's child cot offer.

"This includes the canvas and the poles, but not the mounts on the A/B
pillars
(so if you have a non-Westy you'd have to fabricate something there)."


I am a "virtual" wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
"HAPPINESS GUARANTEED"
