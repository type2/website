Subject: RE: Oil Change (Plus a few ????)

I was just wondering, how often should I do an oil change on my 74 Camper?
Is it the normal every 5000kms?
Or should I do it more often?
 What type of oil is best to use?
 I don't really care for the brand, unless there are some that are just no
good for the engine...
All so I was following my husband home last night and I noticed that it is
back firing, is there something that I can do to stop this from happening?
One last question and I will be done.
What type of brake light's and running light's in the rear should I put in?
Thank all of you who take the time to help me out....
