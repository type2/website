Hmmm... well I can rule out a few things for you.  You say that it has no power when revved up - I assume that means when you are driving it at part to full throttle.  That rules out any problems with idle solenoids and all but the most severe vacuum leaks.  

Since you have dual carbs, carb problems are unlikely (since generally both don't fail simultaneously).  

Your fuel supply is okay because if it were completely blocked, the van would simply stop running and if it were partially blocked it would idle okay but stall under power.  Bad gas would be a remote possibility.

Low compression in all cylinders is also a remote possibility, but easily ruled out with a quick compression check.

That leaves the ignition system.  You said you replaced some parts, and also tried the old parts.  All I can say is go back over everything again and triple-check.  Inspect every piece closely, verify any specs that you can.  Pay special attention to the condenser as I have seen it cause problems like you describe.  Use your timing light on each plug wire and the center cap wire and look for erratic flashes - that may give you a clue.  For instance, if the center wire flashes steadily and the plug wires flash erratically that tells you the problem is the points, cap or rotor and not the coil or condenser.

Good luck,
