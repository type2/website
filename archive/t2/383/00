Thanks for your help. I have triple-checked the wires. I got my other bus
back from a "volks" mechanic once with two wires reversed, so I don't take
that one for granted.

In the end, I did not adjust the timing. That was to be the next project.
The dist seems good and tight. I am reluctant to start messing with it now,
as I cannot see how it could suddenly change and be causing this problem,
and I have not yet sorted out the maze of PO marks on my pulley.

Thanks for your time. If you have any other thoughts I would appreciate it.

Cheers,
Matthew
