They have figured out a way to get the older vehicles off the road. They keep lowering the specs to make it
harder to pass. Right now they are lower than what the factory designed the engines to put out. Does not sound
right and legal but they are getting away with it every day. What you passed at 2 years ago, will now cause
you to be a gross polluter. Good old California....
