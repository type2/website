 Craig's photo shows an obvious misalignment
 of the # 2 main bearing shell which was not
 addressed in his post. This would present a
 problem in the axial direction, and a possible
 problem regarding endplay.
 Previous info from Craig regarding the dowel was
 that the hole was too deep, nothing about this
 misalignment, nor any from Rimco or Northwest
 Connecting Rod.

 The first cases had many problems, including
 being plugged with casting sand everywhere,
 which anyone could see.

The defective case cutoff has been raised from
# 5000 to # 6000. Now it's # 6381.

 From cases 6000 on, all issues were supposed to be resolved. I have
 cases
 6322 and 6381. Case number 6381 has a center main bind. there are 3
 different answers from 3 different engine builders/machine shops and my
 view
 point on the lastest issue of the center main

 It seems to me that the case wasn't torqued properly when bored at the
 factory. In unbolting the case halves I find less then 20 lbs torgue on
 the
 case half bolts. I ran my bore gauge (I just spent $$$$ on one for just
 this
 purpose) and found the center main to be out .00015, well within spec but
 with the case torque set from the factory. I am going to retorque the case
 to see if there are changes. When the cases leave the factory and also my
 importer all case bores are check with a factory jig. All cases shipped
 pass
 this test due to not properly torqued cases, when torgued the test gauge
 will not go through (most recent finding) some of the cases

   A machine shop/engine builder in Cali builds 10+ of these engines a
 month
and has worked through all the issues. In talking to him the main problem he
 has come across was the dowel pins be offset, thus cause the bearing to be
off a little causing a crush when the case halves are bolted together, he
suggested removing the dowels and bolting the case together to see if that
IS the problem.

The center main problem is a new isuue that started around case numbers
5000 and is intermidiate, as I have built 2 5000 series engines without
any
mods to the cases. Most if not all previous problems have been addressed
and corrected.

In my opinion it seems that the first series cases were the best with
just clearancing problems and not machine work issues.

The numbers of rejects/problems is such a low percentage that for a new
item they are actually below the industry standard for rejects. They just
need a better quality control before releaseing the product to the
consumer.

There is plenty of documentation out there now on the durability of
these
cases and I am seeing more and more performance builders going to these
cases

So there must be something good about them
