This might be a good time to mention that I have a closeout on
replacement childs cots - at $39.95 (originally $100). This includes the
canvas and the poles, but not the mounts on the A/B pillars (so if you
have a non-Westy you'd have to fabricate something there).  The poles
are the '74-75 style, meaning that they will also fit '76-79 (although
they are not collapsable), and will also fit '69-73 if you relocate the
mounts slightly. (Or, of course, they'll fit any year if you are
fabricating your own A/B pillar mounts.)  At this price, it's worth it
for the canvas alone; the original factory wholesale was more than the
current selling price!  Part # 7001
