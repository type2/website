How do you know when to change your oil. Not guess, know. The one method 
that is best for all uses. Inspect the oil. Look, smell, feel. If it looks 
dirty or milky, smells gassy, or feels thin and/or gritty, you have waited 
too long. Reduce your interval and inspect again. This is regardless of 
time/mileage. When it needs changing by inspection, note the miles and 
change it. Next time it's due by actual inspection, note the mileage. Now 
you know what mileage interval is right for the way you use the vehicle, 
whether you drive it once per year in a parade or 100 miles daily, and 
everything else in between.

Maintenance by inspection is a universal procedure far superior to any 
time/mileage interval guessing. It requires one minute of your attention. 
Why guess when knowledge of what's right is before your very 
eyes/nose/fingers and available with such little effort???
