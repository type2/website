Subject: Re: [T2] Plastic/Fiberglass Glovebox Source?

I called around on this when looking for one last year.  Bus Depot 
service guys, at 215/234-8989, called theirs a "insert" but the guy at 
Rocky Mountain Motorworks told me it was plastic replacement box.  So I 
went with the RMM one.  I'm happy with what I got.  Heavy gauge and fit 
like a charm.  Definitely worth the money spent.
The two plastic boxes are probably the same product.  Ron Salmon at BD 
Inc. can probable tell us the origin of each and solve the mystery.
