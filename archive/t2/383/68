Subject: Plugs  Bosch vs NGK

Ok-- Here I am asking about my 1641 motors, two uprights,--  and my 1776 low
compression upright--I run these in those Funny VW buses with the two
windows in front--If I go to NGK  what do I use ? As of now, All have the
Plain Jane Bosch and they run VWonderfull.   Is it worth a try?--Emissions
on my 1967 will be TOUGH in AridZona.  It may call for changing the Main Jet
to get through--then change again to run normal--Remember we have 5+ months
of 100+ degrees.  I'm Always running straight 40 W dino oil--
Just be nice to this Old man.  I am here to learn from all you young
Bucks--Bless you and thanks, uj
