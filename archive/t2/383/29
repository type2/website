Subject: RE: [T2] odd clutch cable failure mode

It's a pretty thick cable; it could probably handle starter current for a
few seconds. I would guess that if the cable serves as the permanent ground
strap, electrolytic corrosion could occur (over time) where the cable
contacts other metal structures. Just a guess...

All,
One of the more odd risk factors for premature clutch cable failure is poor
transmission electrical grounding. With no tranny ground strap, starter
currents can return through the clutch cable. Seems that conducting high
starter current through the cable weakens it in some way.
