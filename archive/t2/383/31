I am aware of this, Ron. Conversely, if it werent' for volks drivers like myself who stick with their vehicles as california attempts to pry them out of our hands there would be no market for these guys.

You should also consider my background. This isn't the east coast where most v-dubs have long since rotted and you're trying to have a parts outpost in 
v-dubless wasteland.

This is central california. I can count 10-15 vw's in 3 block radius of my house and I'm not kidding. Plus, have you heard of Pismo beach or dune buggies?

These guys showroom is full of chrome and steroids. Come in and try to talk a little vintage or bus-talk? Not interested. 

I'm a very polite person, Ron, and they act annoyed at me everytime I show up and then argue with me that you can replace 8A fuses with 16A fuses because they have them.

Last time I checked, that was called customer service if you want return business. I have bent over at my jobs for clients throughout my working life for the very same reasons.

I'd call it 50/50.

Or 5.95....

Negative ghostrider, I got 5 bucks worth from the tow truck drive who backed up into my yard and put the bus down on my concrete slab where it's covenient for me to work on before he knew I was tipping him a 5'ver.

That's service.
