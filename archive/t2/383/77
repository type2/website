Hi all,

I do agree, hats off to Christian and his crew for driving from Cape Town to
Germany in a Fleetline Splittie, and it was a shame they could not complete
the trip. [For newer members of the list Christian was a long time past member
of this list and wrote about his adventures with his 66(?) Dormobile in the
South Africa wilderness].

How ever in his record of the Zebra Safari he does record all that was wrong
with the van by the time it reached Germany - including the structural
defects, and how due to lack of funds he was unable to repair the major oil
leak which inevitably drew attention to the van.

I don't comment on the driving laws in California and other parts of the USA
(in fact, as reported on this list, I think some are quite generous, and some
of the state inspections quite lenient); but as a citizen of the EU I don't
want structurally unsound vehicles on OUR roads endangering MY life - even if
they are VW buses. And given the evidence of Christian's account the German
police did the correct thing.

I've put my money where my mouth is and scrapped my previous bus after 6 years
of rolling resto (estimate #8000/$12000USA spent), including having just
replaced the interior (and slept in it for one night) due to a major
structural defect coming to light. Dangerous vehicles belong in the scrap yard
(or a museum) not on the road.
