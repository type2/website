Okay, this is what they call "flexible guide sleeve"
or something in the bentley.

And what of the spacer washers used to adjust it properly, anybody got a size on those?

Yes, I'm hip to that. Probably order a new one with the pin/clip Karl pointed out just for good measure.

Who's Bowden?

Bowden Tube is in the rear on the tranny. Its the flexible tube you are referring to above. If it is not adjusted properly you will find the cable
binding and could affect your need to screw teh wind nut down all the way...
