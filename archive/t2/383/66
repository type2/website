Either do what Compu-Fire says, or contact them to confirm or explain. If 
it clearly states "must be used", it seems quite clear to me what 
Compu-Fire advises. But read the whole literature that came with the 
device. May be better all around to buy the Compu-Fire coil designed to 
work with the Compu-Fire trigger, and even the Compu-Fire CDI. Then you 
will have a system designed to work in harmony, just like the Bosch system 
you removed. Mixing ignition parts from various manufacturers can open 
doors to strange happenings. But this is a case where you need to know for 
sure as you may find a clause somewhere that says, "warranty void if 
installed incorrectly".
