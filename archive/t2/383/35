Well, the air filter is not really a trick - a clean one is always a good idea.  Find out what the maximum allowable idle rpm is and set your engine to 50rpm or so less for cleaner emissions.

You have to be careful because if your sticker says 875 +/- 75 and their instruments (the only ones that count) clock you outside of that range you fail even before they get to the emissions test.
