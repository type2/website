>Yuck, they must have gotten more strict since my last California emissions test, which was back in 1995.  Back then, the spec was something like 650-1,050rpm so I always set mine at about 1,000rpm.  I don't think there was any idle rpm spec on the sticker - it was shown on the screen of the gargantuan emission check machines.  Not sure where the spec originated but I remember them looking stuff up in a large book.

They have the book still but use your own stickers against you. Also, if your timing is out by more than 3 degrees you fail. Last year, the smog referee told me they won't even test the emissions if you can't pass the rpm and timing test but that seems unfair and surely they'd want to locate a GP when they have the chance.

What I really don't like is that they check the gas cap last and if you only fail that I believe you have to go through another complete test cycle when you get your new cap. I hope the local test stations aren't this strict.
