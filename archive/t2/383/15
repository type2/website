Subject: ANOTHER '78 Fridge Question...

Or two:

The first is simple.  What is the coldest setting, 1 or 7?  I know that my 
home fridge's coldest setting is the largest number.  Is that true for the 
dometic in my westy?

Second, the coil doesn't seem to be getting hot all over.  Could this be 
that the ammonia/paraffin inside is "froze up" and causes a blockage, or is 
there something else that could be wrong?  The coil gets very warm in some 
spots but not throughout.

Any suggestions would be very welcome, I have searched all of the resources 
I know to try to find these answers, but no luck.

Thanks!

Susan
