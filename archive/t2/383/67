Subject: timing/009/34pict3?

I have been doing my homework getting ready to do my first timing adjustment on 
my 69 bus and in doing my homework I came to Kens buggy barn page and upon 
reading the article on timing with the 009 it has a little thing in there about 
timing the engine with 009 and 34 Pict 3 carb. It goes into this big speal 
about drilling jets and all kinds of little adjustments  complete removal of 
the carb etc. I honestly don't think my engine runs real bad for a $150.00 bus. 
It cranks up and works EVERYTIME like Colt 45 but does have a little minor 
stutter when idling and this is the reason I thought I should check and adjust 
the timing. Do I really need to get knee deep in this carb buisiness when 
setting the timing or am I getting the wrong message from the article?
Another question I've been wanting to throw out there and I'm sure it's been 
beat into the ground (but I wasn't there for those beatings) is to thermostat 
or not to thermostat? My local flaps guy asked me "why would I want one" and 
said that they were notorious for erupting and somehow making the flaps stay 
closed. My 79 never had one but then again it did drop a valve seat on me but 
that was after 5 or 6 years of abuse through high school and a couple of years 
after that. That thing was a tank! Took a lickin and kept on ticking. Any way 
please let me know so I can go and scrounge a t-stat and mounting hardware from 
the boneyard. Thanks
