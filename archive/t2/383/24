Subject: [T2] odd clutch cable failure mode

All,
One of the more odd risk factors for premature clutch cable failure is poor 
transmission electrical grounding. With no tranny ground strap, starter 
currents can return through the clutch cable.  Seems that conducting high 
starter current through the cable weakens it in some way.
