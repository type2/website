Subject: clutch cable again!

David, Karl, Ted, all,
 
More thoughts on my clutch cable. I didn't pull it yet, tonight.

The bowden tube is the first thing it runs thru in the front (fif) of the bus correct? Then the cable is exposed, then it enters that flexible tube that has a special name in the bentley that I read yesterday and don't remember. I assume damage to the bowden tube would mean crimped/cut in some way, rubbing on the cable.

Apparently it's important where it broke. No I've not replaced the pin, guess I will now. No, I didn't grease the wing nut.

I guess I haven't been a good clutch cable installer.
