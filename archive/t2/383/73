Subject: Plans for my foamboard front bed (replaces cot)

A suggested replacement for the front cot (uncomfortable after babyhood)
(I can send pics):
Essentially, you make a frame of 3 1x1" oak rails cut from a 5/4 X4" oak
board from Home Depot.  I used a tablesaw.  The side rails hang from
nylon rope loops hung from the seatbelt holders and level with the
bottom of the child cot hangers.  I notched the part hanging on the loop
so it cannot slip out.  The other ends lie on the dash and stops at the
windshield.  You can pad with moleskin.  Driver side lies next to the
steering wheel, other side is just at the right of the dash handle.  The
other rail you lay across both and mark the miter angles with a pencil. 
How deep you make the bed is
based on the driver seat back to windshield distance.  I have a turning 
passenger seat and moved it rearward further by lifting the stop on the
side-
I made a safety stop for the seat by using a piece of cord behind the
seat fastened ti an eyehook- you only need 3" of grab within the rails.
.  Thus you can sit in the seat while the bed is occupied.
To fasten the rails,  I drilled a horizontal 1/8" hole through each side
into the center of the mitered back rail.  Blunt (8p?) nails and slip
into the holes to hold the rail.  I cut pieces of aluminum plate stock
(3") and screwed them to the bottom of the side rails so the rear rail
"laid" on these. Drill another vertical hole through each end of the
rear rail right through the aluminum plate.  Slip another nail through
the ends to hold the frame together.  The board width is based on the
width of the dash, and lies on the dash- you may add a cener shim that
takes up the 3/4" gap to the dash top, or let it sag.   I scribed the
windshield curve onto it.  The board is slipped onto the frame from its
storage location above the rear bed.  Drill "stabilizer" holes through
the board and the side frame rails one on each side near the dash, and 2
more near rear.  Add a foam pad cut to fit the board and you have a bed
 that will hold 150 lbs! Worked with our daughter from age 3 to 9.
