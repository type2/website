Subject: RE: [T2] STUPID QUESTION... PLEASE HELP

My '77 has those the two bolts.  I recall the engine/tranny mount changed
with the type 4 engine. The bolts are not really hard to R&R (once you know
about them :0), but I assume they're there for a good reason...

QUESTION.... ARE THOSE BOLTS REQUIRED.  SHOULDN'T THE
TRANNY SWING FREE WITH THE ENGINE WITH NO MOUNTS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANS AND ENGINE (I.E. ABOVE THE
BELL HOUSING)?????????????????
