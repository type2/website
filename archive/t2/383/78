Woah! This is wrong! It's probably right about putting a vehicle off the
road temporarily, but banning and confiscating the plate!!! That's too much.
After I read about the Zebra safari experience I have avoided Germany for my
trips with the bus; I say Germany it's "unsafe" for it.
We obviously have a different conception of what an "unsafe" vehicle is...
surely a 240+ kph mercedes qualifies against a 90 kph bus...?

I don't have such money to spend in the bus, but slowly I do what I can. I
cannot afford to fix the bus fully to fit germany's standard and surely I
cannot let it sit for years until it's ready

Police officiers here in the UE seldom do the right thing... more often do
the most convenient for them.
