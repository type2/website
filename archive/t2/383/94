A nifty little trick I learned from the VERY helpful women of the North
Portland Oregon DMV. If you are taking a vehicle off the road (ie mine was
totaled) you can switch the plates, which means you get to ride out the
rest of the tabs (a year and a half in my case) before getting resmogged. 
They have a form that lets you switch plates, but apparently they aren't
allowed to tell you about it. The N Portland office is the best tho' and
the lady had loved the bus of her youth. I walked up to the window with my
St. Muir and she fell in love- with my bus.

It doesn't put off the inevitable struggle forever, but it gives you a
breather. Total cost to register my vehicle: 56$ half of which was getting
a temporary plate while waiting for my old plates to show up from the
junkyard. Cost in Washington State? $200+. Hope this info helps some one
out.

So if your a Portland resident, go to the N Portland DMV. They are fast,
friendly and helpful.
