Subject: RE: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

  When I was at the SEMA show and talked to a BOSCH engineer I was amazzed
that he said NOT to RUN any BOSCH plug in an air cooled engine unless it was
new. He said that BOSCH plugs (standerd style) have a higher tendency to
foul then other brands and also said ABSOLUTLEY do not use Platinum plugs in
an air cooled engine.
  I guess that is why all new VW air cooled engines from MEXICO come with
NGK plugs and the BOSCH factory is with in spitting distance of the VW
engine plant!

On the topic of plugs, I have been running Bosch W7CCO in my 78 westy FI.
This recommendation came from a long time VW mechanic friend.  The car seems
to run a bit better, and rev a little freer.  It might just be me, but it
really seemed better.  Anyone else runing these?
