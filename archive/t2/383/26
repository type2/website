Sure, but you got to walk in at 5:05 and have a new cable in your hot
little hands by 5:06. It costs money to operate a retail store and keep
a relatively slow moving auto part on the shelf for one, two, three
months, just so it will be waiting at your beck and call when you run in
five minutes after closing with a broken down bus. Not to mention the
fact that they helped you out even though you walked in after closing,
rather than just telling you to come back in the morning, on a sale that
only made them a few bucks. 

Far from ripping you off, they hooked you up. You should be singing
their praises rather than complaining.  Speaking as someone who sells
the cable for about $4 myself, even I'd have to admit that you more than
got your extra six bucks worth.
