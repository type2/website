Subject: Oil Pressure

Sorry, the archives don't seem to work today...

My newly installed VDO oil pressure gauge (on my newly installed AVP
rebuild) shows:

Cold idle: 55-60
Cold revved: 70

Cold is relative; I'm in San Diego.

Is this too high? I've got Castrol 20W-50 in it, but planning to switch to
another brand, and probably straight 30 or 10W-30 for break-in. About 100
miles on the rebuild.

Thanks,
