So am I, and the lack thereof!  The only sound insulation that they put 
in the bus was some padding on the roof of the engine compartment and 
some meager insulation in the walls.

But it is SOOOOO much improved if you actually put sound proofing on the 
bare metal.  It's like night and day.  If you've ever driven in a 
Vanagon, you'll know what I mean.  They learned from their previous mistake.

I guess.... and you probably can't hear the car honking behind you over 
the rest of the bus racket - good isolation? :)

And actual dynamat (or equivalent) makes it *that* much better.  Don't 
get me wrong, having some padding is better than no padding, but stock, 
VW did a horrible job of addressing sound levels in the bus.  Because I 
haven't insulated the front, it's still difficult to have a normal 
conversation in my bus, and that's with the *stock* setup.  In the back, 
though, it's like night and day.

I think it cost me 90 bux for the rubber mat stuff, another 15 for the 
bubble wrap, and regular insulation is cheap.  That's not a bad price 
for some sanity.  It is a lot of work, though!
