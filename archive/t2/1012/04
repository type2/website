I don't run my Westy with a stock FI 2.0L hard either, it seems happy at
55-60, not so much at 65-70. I've always equated going fast in a bus with
watching my dog walk on his hind legs. He can do it, but he doesn't do it very
well, nor for very long. What's the point? To me driving Peapod is relaxing at
moderate speeds, anxiety inducing at higher speeds. The lack of power and the
suspension prevent it from ever being a high performance vehicle.
If I want to go fast I ride the motorcycle, that will go 125 mph all day.
That's what it's designed for. I have worry about the legal ramifications not
melting the engine. At a constant 85-90 mph on the bike I can get 45-50 mpg.
The bus at 55-60 mph gets 20-22 mpg, in town 16-18 mpg.
