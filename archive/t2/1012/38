Subject: New panel clips, drill size? Plastic sheeting on front doors.

Hey kids,
I am approaching the end of the restoration of my '74 Westy, one of the last
things I need to do is put in the front door panels. I got the OG Orange panels
from Greg Lindquist in Canada (thanks Greg!) and new panel clips and boots from
The Bus Depot (thanks for everything Ron!). Two questions:
1. What drill size should I use for the new panel clips?
2. I need to replace the plastic sheeting behind the panels. Are these 
available new, or can I make my own? I know they need to be 2 layers, but since
I dont have an original to go by, I need to know where the second layer is
attached.
