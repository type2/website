hahaha.. that's a good one :)  Sorry, but besides all the furniture, 
there is little to no insulation inside that thing, at least compared to 
modern day car insulation.

If you really want to do it right, pull out all the furniture and then 
start from there.  I would suggest some kind of dynamat insulation to 
help stop the transmission of the engine vibration into the cabin.  I 
would cover EVERYTHING with that stuff, and then to make it look pretty, 
cover that with nice interior car carpet stuff.

The floor in my westy has the dynamat, foil bubble insulation, wood, 
plastic shield, carpet padding and carpet.  The walls have the dynamat 
stuff and home insulation in them covered with a vaporshield.  Then I 
put the furniture back in and it's SOOOOOO much quieter.

I haven't yet finished the front, but you get a LOT or roadnoise from 
the wheel-wells and floor as well.  Cover all that stuff up with sound 
insulation and you'll be having a much more pleasurable drive :)
