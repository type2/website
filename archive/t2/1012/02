Subject: MPH/Top Speed

Driving at 55/60 mph isn't being an old fuddy duddy!  I challenge anyone to
have sat in on one of my physics classes when I go over accel/velocity vs
force lessons and not become much more aware of the real dangers of excess
speed.  We here in BC are constantly told of the number of road fatalities
and injuries due to excess speed and the costs to the gov't run insurance
program.

My wife and I drove Magikbus from BC to Newfoundland and back logging over
22,000 mi, in 2 trips of approx 2 months apiece a few years ago at an agreed
upon speed of 55mph.  We never had any negative responses from anyone except
1 guy in a mercedes in NY who honked, tailgated and gave me the finger.
After the last trip I happened to be travelling in Magikbus with my wife
following in the car and she asked me on the radio why I was going 80kph
(50mph) and it turned out that the speedometer was 5mph fast.  Yes, I had
logged over 22,000 miles across the continent twice at 50mph without mishap
(or breakdown getting 24mp imp gallon per mile).

It can be done, all it takes is less pressure on the gas pedal and a more
laid back outlook on life.
