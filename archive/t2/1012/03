Subject: VW speed, and fuel mileage

When my '74 Westy 1800CC, is rolling, I love the fact that my "Canadian"
speedo, tells me I am doing 80   albeit KMH, but the "big" number registers in
my mind, not as 50mph, but 80, and I purr along the roads oblivious to
anything external.  I keep to back roads as much as possible, (total visual
bonus), and in the mountain gravel roads here, have been impressed how the
gear box in 3rd, can go from 5KMH up to 50 kmh!!  If I want to go faster, I
will break out the "sawzall", section the bus a bunch, "rake" the front
windshield back tons, drop the suspension, build a huge engine,....but that is
not why I enjoy driving it!
