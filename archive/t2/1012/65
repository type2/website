You know, all you guys talking about doing 60 and I am struggling to
STAY at 60! Maybe it's the fact that with as far back as my seat goes
I am still pretty cramped up to the wheel and am forced to "lay" on
the gas a little. And believe me, Zoey does NOT mind running it hard.

I'll tell ya though, I am usually shifting from 3rd into 4th at 50 or
55 and it sounds as if the engine is getting bogged down a bit it I
keep it under 55 in 4th. Granted, Don drives like a psycho, but I have
to say that he chooses to drive fast and I can't seem to help it.
Also, due to the issues I am having with my transmission, the only way
I can get into 2nd from 1st is to wind the engine up. Otherwise, it is
just grind central right now.

I am trying to slow down though to see what effect it has on my gas
mileage. Stiles looked at her this Saturday and saw no real issue with
her mixture, just other "obvious" things (like rust).
