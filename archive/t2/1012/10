Dunno if it's a year thing or you've got a bad engine (or a smaller 
engine - mines a 2L), but my 78 has no problem keeping up with traffic. 
  I will cruise at 70 on the speedo (which is really around 64) all day 
with no problems, sometimes up to 80 depending on traffic.  Mileage is 
somewhere around 18-20 which isn't that bad either.  I do have the 
MegaSquirt with a wb02, so I do a fair amount of tweaking, but really, 
unless there's a headwind, the bus has no problem traveling that speed 
unless you're engine is pretty badly out of tune.

If any of you really want to see what kinda tune your engine is in, get 
yourself a wideband o2 sensor.  It's hands-down one of the best pieces 
of tuning equipment you could ever own.  It's especially handy for 
getting the bus to pass smog, too.  Get the mixture dialed in such that 
it hangs around 14.7:1 and you're golden.  Trying to tune the bus 
without some kinda exhaust analyzer is like shooting in the dark...
