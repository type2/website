Subject: Porsche 914 in junk yard - Nova

OK, this is a complete 2.0 Porsche 914 that has it's rear end pushed in.

Probably good for parts, and it has the 2.0 three stud intake /heads

Someone local could pull this home and strip it and take away the heads (no
carb, just a set of spider intake runners and a intake manifold.)  Has the
trans too.  Four 4 lug alloy wheels.  Ratty interior.

It is OUTSIDE the yard, so they are trying to sell it whole.  If it gets
inside the yard, then they will only sell parts.  (Yeah, I know, if it gets
pulled inside I will be after the heads!!)

BTW, I was Karma'd a single 2.0 head from a friend.  Pretty bare, no valves
etc, but pretty clean.  Now I know the distinction of the spark plug
positioning on the Porsche 2.0 head versus the type IV 1.7, 1.8, 2.0

Ok, yes, I have a set of rebuilt 2.0 heads and a single rebuilt 1.8 head,
and a pair of Vanagon bare heads.  Plus the 2.0 914 head.  These are extras.
(I am posting it here and fulllmoon because I want to build up a bit more
karma.... I have no interest in the 914, though my buddy does race 914's but
he is usually looking for a 'perfect' body because of al the crashes!!  And
he cannot use the 2.0 heads because of his class, but he does open up the
1.8 type IV heads to a good size!!)
