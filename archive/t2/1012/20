Subject: Re: RE: [T2] Straight Info On SM & SL Oil

I've been running diesel 20-50 for years in my VW's and aircooled bikes with 
no problems. I have a 2275CC Type 1 engine with about 150HP that will run 
diesel oil as well for the zinc content. My last 120HP 1835CC Type 1 ran on 
diesel as well, and was thoroughly abused in my bug with a 7000rpm redline. 
If you read the label on Diesel engine oils, you will see that they are not 
energy conserving either. In effect, they give you plenty of zinc, and good 
viscosity at all temps.
