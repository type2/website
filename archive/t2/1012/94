I mounted two speaker enclosures to the fresh air vent with screws from the
back. If you follow the fresh air vent under the dash, right about where
your right knee is (starboard side, left knee if you're driving) there is a
panel held in place by several screws around the perimeter. Take it off and
drill a couple of holes to mount the enclosure. If you get some quality
speakers and a sub, or some larger speakers somewhere else in the van for
bass, you're set to go. Makes a really clean installation and the speakers
are pretty much out of sight.
