Subject: Re: New panel clips, drill size? Plastic sheeting on front

Jack, Michael and everyone who has replied to this thread,
Thanks! I now have enough information to tackle this job.

I'll follow Jacks method below for the plastic sheeting, adding a second layer
behind the fresh air vents, shipping-taped to the front sheet. That way, any
moisture that collects from condensation stays away from my panels, and any
rain that drains down the tubes goes inside the door skin, and out the drain
hole.

I got a few differing responses as to the correct drill size for the new style
clips, so I checked out the Cip1.com website (which I should have done to begin
with) and they state;
***NOTE (on 68-79 Bus or Van the original clips and boots are no longer
available- these clips will work fine but you will have to drill the clip holes
in the metal out to 8mm)*** 

8mm = 0.3150 decimal inches, and is only .0025 larger than a 5/16 drill bit.
Using a hand held drill, I'm sure I'll get the equivalent of a 0.3150 hole with
a nice fresh 5/16 bit. I'll be working on the bus today, and give yall an
update as soon as I can.
Thanks again for all of your help, and thanks to the List, without which I
would surely be in trouble!

 I chose the clear stuff and brush on contact cement.
 Spray on contact cement would make a mess and attract dirt.
 Taped the sheet to the door and then used a Sharpie pen
 to trace the outline and cut with scissors. I put a patch
 of 2" shipping tape on the plastic sheet where a hole goes
 (window crank) to toughen the area.
 
 Before you glue the sheeting down, check and lube the
 window regulator and clear the drainage at the bottom of
 the door.  Best of luck,
