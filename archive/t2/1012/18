Soooo...

I've been using standard Quaker State 20W-50...anybody
know if that's still good enough?

The mfgers web site did not provide data on zinc or
phosphor composition.

Maybe synthetic would be better, but it's pretty
expensive. Would all the 20-50 synthetics have enough
zinz/phosphor, or do they even need it?

Thanks,
