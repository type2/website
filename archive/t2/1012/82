Subject: re:decibel

I love all this talk about sound, it is something I've been slowly doing
battle with for years. With varying success.

 

I never thought to get a decibel meter, always thought they would be super
expesive. I checked the r*dio sh*ck for one, and they have a $50 model.

 

Does anyone know if this would be worth getting, ie is the thing accurate at
all, or do you  need to spend hundreds of dollars on one? I don't need it to
be super accurate I guess, just relatively accurate-so I can tell if he
stuff I do makes a difference or not.

 

Thanks for any decibel meter recommendations.
