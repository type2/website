I have 72 westy that is currently down with the sickness, and got a 68 westy
and the 68 is way louder inside than the 72 was.  I do not know why.  So the
interior came out of the 68 and I put a McMaster Carr rubberized layer on as
much flat panels as possible.   Did behind all interior panels, cargo floor,
and doors,  then put in a floating laminate wood floor that has a thin layer
of Styrofoam between it and the metal flooring.  I didn't get to the front
of the bus, where a lot of noise comes from the road, but what I did do was
such a huge difference.  I can't wait until I get to the front.  Tires also
play a big part in road noise, those Vanco 8's really helped.  Browse the
forums on the samba or shop talk forums and search for sound deadening,
there is a lot of folks who have done many different things, you can get a
feel for what you might like to try (or can financially afford).

Good luck
