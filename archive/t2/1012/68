If your fuel lines are reasonably new (as they should be) you should have
no problem with incompatibility.

If the fuel is truly 10% ethanol (the number stated is a maximum), you
will be about 5% lean.  I've never noted any problem here in California
where we've been stuck with "oxygenated" fuel for years.
