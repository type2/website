[...]
I just removed a switch from a 78,,, it doesn't have a vw number on it...it
says germany int.pat. MWO

it only has 5 terminals ,, as terminal P is missing,, and Terminal 1 looks
to be factory flush cut off.

I noticed the picture Karl linked to have terminal differences, but I think
they interchange..
this picture http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=171905865
has the P terminal,, and another term marked G ... and the terminal marked 1
on my switch is 0 on the above link,

I dunno if that helps .. but it may fit interchange with the other vehicles
that require all the terminals,,  I think in this case... there are extra
terminals not required on the bus. The wiring diag shows  term 30, 50, 15,
X, Su  ,,, no P or G or 1 or 0 required for a late bay bus...
