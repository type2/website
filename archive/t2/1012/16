Subject: ethanol in vw engines

Hey Gang,

Here in Maryland (depending on the county anyway) we are using up to 10% ethanol in our gasoline.? 

I am aware of what this "moonshine" has done to my father's boat (not pretty, he had to replace all fuel lines and rebuild all three carbs).? 
I was wondering if any one heard, seen, or experienced any problems with this stuff and what can we do to counter act the effects.

I am guessing that engines are running leaner, due to the fact the water is soluble in ethanol, but not gasoline?? If so, should we be running richer than factory specs?
