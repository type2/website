Subject: Re: Front Wheel Bearing Adjustment

Do it with the wheels able to rotate, so off the ground. That way you 
can spin them a little to assure the bearing is being compressed equally 
after each inward adjustment and check of the thrust washer.

Interestingly I just did this job - on my '87 Porsche 944S - exactly the 
same system.
