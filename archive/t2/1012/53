Since I've stripped Freebird naked as a jaybird inside, now would be a good
time to think about sound deadening.  Does anyone know of any spray on stuff
that would serve?  It would be super easy to apply even in hard to get at
places.  I'd want to stay away from extremely flammable foams but there must
be something else out there.

I've planned on putting down a soft mat of some kind, on the cargo floor,
with plywood (1/4" ??) on top, and cork flooring, left over from my house
glued on top of that.  The cork is about 0.13" thick and comes in 1 ' x 2'
pieces and is pre-coated with 3 coats of urethane.  It'll make a  nice
looking, warm, and easy to care for floor.
