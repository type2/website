In a recent message to the list you wrote:

<<<The Bus does move, I've got all
new steel fuel lines to replace those old fabric (?) lines... it does scoot
along.>>>

Please tell us about the "all new steel fuel lines"
I have recently tried to find fittings to do the same and could not  
find anything that would attach to the Bus tank.  What did you do?  
What parts did you make or buy?  Also, what year is your bus?

Thanks,
