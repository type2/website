Subject: Front Wheel Bearing Adjustment

Hi,

Just replaced all my torsion arms (for the new ball joints), and
decided to do the front bearings while I was in there too. The job was
actually quite pleasant, some large channel locks helped with the sway
bar bushing clamps, which folks usually seem to indicate is the more
difficult part of the job. The right tools helped too, the $15 pitman
arm press (harbor freight) I used to pop the ball joints out of the
steering knuckles was worth every penny.

A quick questions regarding the adjustment of the bearing end play on
the front wheels:

I'm using the following instructions:

Seems simple enough, however it is not specified if the adjustment
should be made with the wheels on or off, or with the vehicle raised
or on the ground. I ended up doing mine with the wheels off (vehicle
obviously off the ground).

Perhaps it doesn't make a difference. Thoughts?

peace
