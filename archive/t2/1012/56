I'm really interested in hearing if someone has used this product,  
too.  I have the interior of my bus stripped out with the exception  
of the paneling on the walls which I just haven't gotten around to  
removing.  After the body work gets done I'm going to tackle the  
sound issue, as I remember how loud it was when driving all day from  
SF to Chicago.  You really had to crank the stereo up.  And since it  
was a stripped out Kombi with only a back seat and cardboard for  
carpeting, it was *loud* even with a stock exhaust.
