Hi David,

What I was trying to say was that even though the engine might be  
turning 8.5% faster, that doesn't mean it's burning 8.5% more fuel or  
making 8.5% more heat. Reduced torque requirements mean a smaller  
bang is required at the piston, and more of them (per minute) will be  
required to achieve the same vehicle speed.

I am not saying it is less. It probably isn't even equal, given the  
increased friction of higher RPMs. But that doesn't mean that the  
lower gearing wastes all the fuel or that all the excess heat is  
absorbed into the engine.

And as I said before, I KNOW it isn't efficient. But that doesn't  
make it impossible to get high speeds from a T4 engine pushing a 002  
transmission. A few years ago Collie Corner rebuilt a 2L engine with  
a mild cam and stock FI, it  was confirmed with a GPS to be capable  
of maintaining 100MPH while pushing a 1977 sunroof bus and was  
connected to a 002 transmission.

Happy Trails,
