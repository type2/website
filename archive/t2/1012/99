Subject: RE: [T2] re:New panel clips, drill size? Plastic sheeting on

I've seen a lot of folks mention location as being critical. Ie does not
interfere with anything in the door. Thanks for the warnings I will double
check clearance.

I have a single cab, so my door panel does not have any air duct on it. So
looking at the door there is a oval shape hole, where that duct runs on
other buses, where I was going to put my speakers. I'll be taking pics of
the process.

I would stay low. As Dan mentioned,  you could interfere with window
operation. There isn't a lot of room horizontally.
