Subject: FI on a Vanagon

Hey Volks,

Could someone give me a run down of the differences between AFC, 
Digijet, and Digifant on Vanagons?

My 86 Westy runs with Digifant and recently I picked up a motor out of 
an 80 with a complete FI system attached.  I plan to put a carb on the 
80 motor and put that in my 74 transporter.  I noticed some of the parts 
(mainly the injectors) look similar to my 86 but a few things are 
different.  Basically, I was wondering if it would be worth keeping the 
Aircooled FI as parts for my 86 or if it is not compatible enough to 
merit keeping and to sell the entire FI set up.

Thanks,
Andrew
