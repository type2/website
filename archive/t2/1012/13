Subject: What's your MPG?

Every time I "fill up" I put in 10 gallons and jot down the distance 
travelled.  Then all I have to do is put the decimal point in the 
appropriate place and I have my MPG.

Generally its around 18 MPG, mixed city and highway.

When I "open it up" on the highway, I put the tachometer around 4000 - 
4250 RPM.  That equates to about 70 MPH (indicated - my speedometer is 
around 5 MPH fast).  That also equates to about 200+ degrees Fahrenheit 
for oil temp and 380 degrees Fahrenheit for cylinder head temp (CHT).  
This is on the flats.  Hills and headwinds change the temps 
accordingly.  Oil temps fluctuate slowly according to driving 
conditions, whereas CHT is a little more responsive to current driving 
conditions.
