Subject: sway-a-way sway bars to be reproduced

I sent a recent e-mail to sway-a-way (SAW) to inquire about the sway bars 
they used to produce, and the conversation led into them being reproduced in 
a limited quantity for those who want them.

He said he could produce any amount, and the price will depend on quantity.

So... now the question is... HOW ABOUT A SHOW OF HANDS of people that would 
want a set (front and back) for the 68-79 loafs ?

Send me a simple e-mail if interested saying YES, INTERESTED (no commitment 
will be/shoulb be expected at this time).

No prices available at this time.
