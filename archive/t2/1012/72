	I haven't the exact numbers in front of me, and they vary 
slightly with T, but I think you'll find there's no such thing as E50 
-  once you try to dissolve more than c.15% EtOH in petrol, it will 
not form a single-phase solution.
	Then when you get up around E85 it becomes again possible to 
make a single-phase liquid.  E90 is an attractive fuel, according to 
the U of Canterbury team who researched it (mainly on Dr John Peet's 
Mini with readily changeable jets in a Solex); the vapour in the tank 
is not explosive.
	The Brazilians are of course the experts on hi-EtOH fuels, 
including VW T2 with CR c.16:1 (like the old J.A.P 500cc single on 
E100 which ruled speedway till suddenly eclipsed by Jawa).
