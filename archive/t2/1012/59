Michael,
Thanks for the link and the pics, I see now where I need to double the plastic,
so that any moisture stays on the inside of the door itself. I dont have any
speaker holes in my panels (and I'm going to keep it that way) so I only have
to worry about the fresh air vents.

 Michael,
 
 Some of these pics might help...

 is the directory, the dr_revamp jpegs show what I did.  The 2 spots you need
 to double up are for the speaker and the fresh air vent.
 
 I'm sorry, I forget the bit size I used...
