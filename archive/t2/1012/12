Subject: Hydraulic lifters

It currently has (as far as I can tell using ratwell.com) solid
rods....Where would I look if I wanted to purchase Hydraulic rods (and
lifters)??
I guess also, is it recommended to even run hydraulic lifters/rods (if
adjusted properly over  time).


i am not the expert so I am interested in what others say and have read many
of the previous arguments,   but in deffense    I drive a 78  all stock with
almost 180,000 original miles and my Hydraulic lifters are performing well!!!
(adjusted once)  I always make sure I warm the engin up a bit.  You can really
tell (hear)  when the oil is getting into the valve train!   Dos'nt take too
long  and well worth the patience.  When it is cold   I warm her up  longer
(have to), but it is a good idea any way,  IMO.
