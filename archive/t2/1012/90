I was going to locate the speakers up in the middle of the door. There is a
small oval hole in the door. I believe I can fit a 4x6 speaker in there.

My suggestion would be to put your speakers in the kick panels.  Door 
panels are way more expensive, and your speakers will end up getting 
kicked around as you hold the door open with your foot and so on.  Leave 
your nice door panels intact.
