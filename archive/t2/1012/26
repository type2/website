Subject: Re: [T2] What's your MPG

As to this subject of mileage, I've been watching a few videos on 
YouTube recently where they show how to assist your combustion with a 
simple electrolysis system creating hydrogen. Anybody done this yet? 
Seems very simple and the unit doesn't draw a lot of current, allows you 
to retard the timing towards TDC, runs cleaner, etc.
