Subject: Re: [T2] ethanol in vw engines

Bran,

Most of, if not all of the country is running 10% ethanol in the lower
octane gas.

Unless you choose to run BP Premium which is all gas--no alcohol.

10% won't do anything catastrophic to your engine, other than lose a
miniscule MPG figure.
Not to warrant changing the main jets over anyway.
