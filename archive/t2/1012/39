Hello,

Any tips on parking a bus over the winter? I live on the prairies, so
it's cold and dry for the most part.

I have:

- Washed it inside and out (including underbelly)
- removed battery
- filled gas tank
- changed the oil
- plugged tailpipe (I've been told mice will make a home in there!)
- inflated tires


Thanks,
Zach
