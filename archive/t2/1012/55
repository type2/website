This from Auto Pride itself-
Michael:

Here is what I can tell you:
The Auto Pride oil is definitely refined by Valvoline (Ashland Oil Company).
The material safety data sheets for Valvoline and Auto Pride are identical.

  Subject: Is Auto Pride oil  repackaged Valvoline?

  It is known amongst VW aircooled bus owners that Valvoline seems to be
  best for the hydraulic lifters of the 78 and later or hydraulic 
rebuilds of earlier engines.  I use Valvoline 10-40 or 20-50 oil plus 
TUFOIL additive.  At a National Auto store I was told by a salesman that 
their house brand AutoPride was made by Valvoline- the Type2 community 
wishes to know if this is true, and if so, are the specs the same??
