Subject: Re: [T2] Body/Paint Shop in Maryland

I worked at Dave's collision center when I lived there but we really only  
did insurance work. A 58 ford once and I did paint one of ex president bush's  
limo's while there. Its a high end high quality shop if you had the body work  
done I'm sure they would paint it.  (In a real nice heated booth) 30+ yrs  in 
business.
 
You could also talk to Sartwell racing and ask them who they  use.
