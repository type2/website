I started this thread to get people to think about their health, prolonged exposure to noises over 85dB is bad for you, I didn't realize that it was that loud, I work for a speaker manufacturer and I blew the Director of Engineering away with these results.

We are not supposed to be exposed to this kind of noise, sanity is right, I think that the biggest thing I really notice is fatigue, I get tired driving my bus with all of the noise, not the way I want to reach a trailhead.
