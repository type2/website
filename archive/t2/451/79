Subject: Used, rebuilt, new heads?

which is better to use?

i am fixing to rebuild my engine and if i buy new heads i am out another 800 bucks... if i rebuild the heads i already have; then will they hold up ...?

i guess maybe it depends on how much damage is done to the head itself to determine its future for the machine shop??

just really curious till i pull my engine maybe this weekend depending upon how the winds are from Isabell...

peace and thanks in advance
