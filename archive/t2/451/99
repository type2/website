Subject: Lurching in Low Gears PLUS 2000 Euro-Camper for Sale (TN)

Digester Here,

My 82 Vanagon with a 4 speed manual transmission has always lurched in the 
low gears (1 and 2) when moving through parking lots or manuvering in tight 
areas.  It has performed this trick before and after a clutch replacement so 
I don't think it is clutch related.  I have no problems getting it into or 
out of any of the gears and it doesn't pop out of gear on its own.  Anyone 
know what is causing this?
