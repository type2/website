Subject: i want to change '70 front end w/ '71, how much work is this??

im thinking if i keep my bus, i may want to change the
whole front end to a '71. I may have a killer deal on
one..

has anyone done this before?

does every thing mount up the same??

how long does something like this take, someone w/
medium mechanical skills??

just a thought,
