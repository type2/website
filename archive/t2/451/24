I used regular westy-style door clips in my 71 and they worked fine (except in one or two places, but not enough to really notice).  See 
http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=221867615A, though I think you can get them cheaper in bulk.  You can see how this looks 
(on a 65 bus) at http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/vw/65neunsitzer/bus6.jpg.  Elsewhere on the splitty I used screws and fancy washers like the 
original (http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/vw/65neunsitzer/bus2.jpg).  Basically, you can match the original fasteners in each spot.

It's nice to use the clips because you don't have to drill more holes.  Just template your panels with a big piece of cardboard and you can spot the 
hole locations.  I cut my panels and drilled the clip holes, made sure everything lined up, then sanded the panels and coated them with clear 
polyurethane.
