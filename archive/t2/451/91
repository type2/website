Subject: Re: [T2] rear vent window fitment

Hey folks...

Weren't the right side vent windows just left units upside down?

If anyone finds a good cheap right side with a good frame holler at me 
'cause I want one if I can afford it. <grin>

Surface rust is okay but major rot through I've got here... <grin>

Got a good left and want to put a matching right side in.

Transvair update: cleaning the transaxle for paint. Should be ready to 
paint tonight. Wahoo!
