Sounds like this cylinder is the only one running right--
Maybe the other 3 are running rich--
If you had a burnt valve--you'd know it--

A light grey port is a sign the gas is being burnt correct--

Take a compression check on all the holes first---then check out the
other 3 holes for leaking injector's--

problem
Hi all!
My 78 westy (stock FI) has a funny problem. I recently replaced the
header and exhaust. I have the 74 style heat exchangers. When I had the
header off, I noticed that 3 of the pipes were dark colored, while one
was very light grey. This cylinder also has a pronounced popping while
running. The engine runs smooth at idle and at speed, and runs cool. It
definitely is not missing because the engine has plenty of power. I am
thinking the cylinder is lean from an injector seal, perhaps? Or does
anyone think burnt exhaust valve??
Thanks
