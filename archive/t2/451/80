Another scam (at least I believe it is a scam) is a
little less obvious. I have a bug for sale and I
received an email saying "We have a client very
interested in your bug. They have seen the photos and
read the description and they would like to offer you
$1,650 for the car, please let me know if you agree to
this price and we will set up payment arrangements"
The offer mentioned was only $100 less than my
advertised listing price.  So I email back to them,
"Sure, I'll take that offer, CASH ONLY."  Guess what??
Never heard back from them.
