Subject: rear vent window fitment

After my bus was painted I went on vacation with it for 2 weeks and started
a new job afterwards. I've only just got around to checking on all the
little items after it's been put back together and everything is back to
normal except that I've noticed that the rear vent window was incorrectly
installed:

Any tips on what I should do?

This a a new window (thanks Billy) and an expensive new seal (I'm re-using
the vent window frame) so I imagine the fit was tight. It's almost been 60
days but it doesn't look right and I can still barely close the window.
