Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Buying Scams

Where do these guys get our e-mail addresses?

I never got any gunny requests to purchase my bus, but I often get offers
to take 20 million $ treasury cheques and other miscellaneous scams &
spams.  It's funny because I don't give out my address anywhere - except
for the type2 and vanagon lists.

Regards,
Shawn.
