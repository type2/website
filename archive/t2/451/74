Subject: Bus Buying Scams

Hi,

I have been off list for a while but I wanted to check in and find 
out if there are any known Internet bus buying scams that are popular 
at the moment. I also want to pass on some odd buyers I have 
encountered.

I have my bus listed on www.thesamba.com and www.type2.com. I have 
received  several strange e-mails from people stating that they are 
brokers or collectors. One persistent fellow wants to buy the bus 
sight unseen with a cashiers check and send an agent to pick it up. 
The catch is he wants to send a cashiers check for $10,000 and have 
me mail back one for the difference between the check and the selling 
price of the bus. Yeah, right.

Another fellow claims to be a" west German "(sic) residing in west 
Africa. He has an (-at-)aol.com address. Should I tell him Germany has 
reunified and he can go home? Perhaps he is legit but.........

If anyone is truly interested I will forward you the correspondence. 
so you can be on the lookout. The cynical among you make accuse me of 
being overly suspicious but I would only call your cynicism into 
question for that accusation :)

Thanks
Chris
