Subject: Fw: [T2] i want to change '70 front end w/ '71, how much work

It will fit up. The only differences are, the 71 has front disk brakes with
a vacuum booster. The 71 front beam has the mount for the booster. More
importantly, the front brakes are disks, and the wheel bolt pattern changed
from the wide 5  to the narrow 5 wheels. Do you want to have different
wheels on front and back?
I do think you can pull the arms out of your 70 beam and keep it wide 5
drum. Be careful of the seals, they're NLA.
I had a site from I think Steven Dolan, can't find it now. He detailed his
trials and tribulations swapping front beams. Look in the Library and
Archives.

whole front end to a '71. I may have a killer deal on
one..
