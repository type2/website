<< Tony,

What is a "shooting brake" for all of us folks that don't live in the big 
city?

Just as the British drive saloons without fear of getting a DWI...Or use
spanners instead of wrenches, they wouldn't be caught dead in a sta-
tion wagon. Ordinary station wagons are called "estate cars" but if 
you had the bucks (or the pounds sterling), to buy a Rolls-Royce,
Bentley, or Daimler and have your coachbuilder do the body work,
then you could have a "shooting brake" built for you...Something to
put the dogs and guns in when you wanted a little sport. The shooting
end of the name is easy, but the brake was not the stopping kind...A
brake is a area containing mostly one type of vegetation...i.e. a "cane
brake" for example...
There was one built for an oil-sheik some years ago...On a Rolls-Royce
chassis with a hydraulically operated rear seat and sunroof. When the
prey was spotted, the roof opened and the seat came up, allowing the
sheik to loose his...falcon on whatever one sics falcons on...
