First thing to always check is your fluid, is it full, overfull, does it
smell burned, have large metal flakes in it.

does it also lurch in idle when in reverse,  1st and rev share a clutch

does it make any noise when it lurches,

check your idle speed if the idle speed is too high it can lurch like that

check these and get back to me
