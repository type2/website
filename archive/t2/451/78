It's never a problem unless he is requesting money back for services
rendered for his client. 

If you want to go through with something like that. Tell them you wish to
hold the check for a MONTH while it clears. And then tell him to send you
a check for the total amount to be paid to you, and not over and above
(which would require you to remit the balance).

And also look for the word ASAP.. the Nigerians LOVE that term....
they'll use it in the beginning and end of every sentence... like:

"Hi, please send me ASAP your final price on the car ASAP. I will ASAP
back to you my payment from my client ASAP."


hehehe
