Subject: replacing fuel lines

I wrote an article on signle carb line replacement for the type2 archive,
but can never find it.  I was never sure if it was under carb, fuel or fire
prevention but in either case it doesn't seem to be in either place.

Did someone remove my article from the library without telling me?

Thanks,
Shawn.
