Hmm,, If we are speaking USA mpg,, I get the exact same mileage as Dave, 
I drive a '74 calif 1.8liter dual carb , points ign.,Manual trans, Westy Camper
usually Fully loaded for 5 people

Dave drives a '73 1.8 liter dual carb, points ign. AUTO trans, Westy Camper
usually 3/4 loaded 

we both get 20 mpg using the US gal, highway driving on U.S. interstates From
Buffalo to N.C. about 65-70mph

Check that you have the factory style distributor and that the advance is
working,, 

I agree with the rest of your thorough advice

to about 22 miles per U.S. gallon
