Subject: smell of petrol

I have a 1982 2.0l aircolled Vanagon.  It has developed a strong smell of
petrol in the cab when the tank is over half filled and/or left in the sun.
There is no obvious leak, and I have checked the plastic expansion tanks,
which seem to be sound.

Has anyone else had the problem?

Does the complicated system of expansion tanks serve any useful purpose - I
have never seen such a system on any other vehicle?

Is dropping the tank complicated? (This is a carb vehicle, not FI).

As ever, all help gratefully received

Thanks,
