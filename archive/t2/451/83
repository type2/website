Subject: FS - Bus front caliper, p/n 251 615 108

FS - Bus front caliper, p/n 251 615 108 will not fit '71 or '72, I believe it will fit all the later models.  The caliper is NEW, not rebuilt ATE with all hardware and pads.  The original box was all but destroyed in shipping, so I don't have it anymore.  $99 + $12 shipping, you can paypal me the money (bdann2(-at-)earthlink.net) or send me a money order.  Let me know if you want it!

thanks,
