Your cht temps are low in my books,, maybe your highway speeds are 55 - 60
mph? lower than my 75 mph
or you have the CHT somewhere other than the #3 plug

I am guessing your driving habits stayed the same, and you have driven the
same sort of terain before,
so I would guess maybe you got some gasoline that is a different blend??

Or,, there is an vacuum leak causing the engine to run a bit lean?
The distributor decided to seize up and fail to advance properly,
could the CHT sender have been loose?
What color are your spark plugs,, do they look lean?


I dunno, It sure will be interesting to hear what caused this.
