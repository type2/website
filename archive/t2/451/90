Those are Nigerian style scams. In the end, you send them the vehicle and 
the refund and a month later you bank comes back with news that the 
original check has bounced and they want payment for the funds you sent 
overseas. You lose your funds and they vehicle. Beware.

Google for 411+Nigerian or 419+Nigerian if you want to do some reading.
