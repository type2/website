I never got any gunny requests to purchase my bus, but I often get offers
to take 20 million $ treasury cheques and other miscellaneous scams &

for the type2 and vanagon lists.

Speaking of spam, I've got a few cartoon anthologies from the New Yorker
and one of 'em (WW II vintage), has a couple of Russian soldiers looking
at cases piled up on a dock. The caption? "What's a Spam?"
