Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 FI

Hello all,
2 questions.  I am getting terrible gas mileage on a 78 FI with automatic
transmission.  I am getting 14-17 mpg.  I have checked and adjusted the 
timing
and dwell, install new distributor cap and points.  What else could be a
culprit?  Usually travel 65 mph or less.

Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III

Frank,

Has there been a recent temperature change there?  Check your tire pressure. 
  It sounds silly, but I have suffered similar losses in mileage for just 
this reason.

Eron
