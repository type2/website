Subject: re fuel mileage

I recently had a new stainless steel tailpipe welded on in place of the tiny
steel tailpipe that was on my stock replacement muffler.  The diameter of
the pipe is a lot larger, in my opinion reducing back pressure and letting
the engine breathe more freely. The problem is, my fuel mileage seems to
have suffered- the bus is definitely burning more fuel.
Would going to a larger diameter tailpipe, and thus reducing back pressure,
lead to poorer fuel mileage?  And, if so, should I put some restriction back
in there, and how?
