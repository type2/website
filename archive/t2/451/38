Brandt,

I am going to cover that in about the third installment on my 78 restore, 
but I guess now is partly the time.

Take lots of pics of the way that the front doors are done now so you can 
match it.  Wups, just reread your post....I didn't take pics of the front 
door seals and it took me about an hour to decide how they went on 
properly and where I was supposed to glue them.

I used 3m weatherstrip adhesive on mine.  Yellow stuff that comes in a 
tube...accept *no* substitutes!

I had to use the adhesive on the front door seals, but none on any of the 
others except the rear engine lid seal at the top.

Brandt, most of the seals are made to fit back in correctly and stay there 
without any adhesive....of course, good seals help as well in that area.

No adhesive on the window seals at all.

*NO* weedwhacker line!...  use the nylon line that will not
get thinner when pulled hard...I don't know how else to describe it, but 
you'll know when you see it...it will be about 3/16' in diameter.

Means you can actually lip it over rather than tearing thru the rubber.

Cheers, dave
