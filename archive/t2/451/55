My front vent windows have never closed completely. They latch and they are 
watertight but they flex and push outwards a bit at the top. I think it is 
a seal that isn't exactly to size. Otherwise the seal fits right, installed 
right.

As for your vent window - you can remove the large pane of glass using a 
palstic knife or spoon. You'll need a helper and some lube such as 
dishwashing liquid or??? (I use silicone spray but some argue I'll pay for 
that come repainting time - I'll let you know). Simply work around the 
inside of the seal and work it back around the window opening and you can 
get the window out. My wife and I had to remove a window for some reason I 
don't remember now. Came out okay (20 minutes) and went back in okay (5 
minutes).
