Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Cable Question

in the '71, there is no cable for the heat/defrost -- the lever acutates 
the vent itself.  If you've got two cables and one lever, my guess is that 
they both go to the same lever.  In the '71, there are two levers, so you 
have a cable for each lever.

HTH,
