Tony,

Just sand blast them and start over?

I have used enamel based paint to paint on top of powder coating, but it
looks like after a couple of years that it is beginning to come 
off.....the powder coat underneath looks great tho!

You can probably just rough up the powder coat like you would almost 
anything surface for preparation and get it paint to  stay pretty well.

Cheers, dave
