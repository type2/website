Subject: EveryBus camping cash

Hi Volks~~~
With the EveryBus event coming soon, I've recruited my brother to go along. He
asked a question that I hope can be publicly answered: Is it $16 per bus per
night, or is it $16 per campsite per night? The website says it's per bus but
I remember last year being charged per night. Can anyone clarify this? I wanna
bring enough to camp with my bretheren the whole time ~~~
