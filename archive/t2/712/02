Thanks Richard! It's great to have actual numbers to use when
inspecting the disk. It looks like there's about 1mm of clearance, if
I'm measuring from the highest rivet, so sounds like it's time to
replace.

Not sure about the clutch slipping (I only got a few miles on this
before I had to drop the engine) but I think the blue on the flywheel
may be a reflection from my coveralls :) I went down and checked it
out last night, and didn't see that level of blue on the metal.

Thanks again for your help!
Mike.
