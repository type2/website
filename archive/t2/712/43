I would get
. bearings of course
. consider new pistons and cyl
. new rings
. new cam and followers
. new valve guides
. new exhaust valves
. consider a new oil pump


I had my rebuild 1gram dynamic balanced and it made a huge difference in
how smooth the engine runs.  (VW spec I believe is 10gram) it is
diminishing returns half the balance double the price at some point you
have to say "good enough"
