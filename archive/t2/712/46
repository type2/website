Subject: Difference between Solex 30 pict1 and Solex 30 pict 2???

Hello List,

I have a Solex 30 pict 1 that came off a 1968 VW bus,
1600cc SP engine. Someone asked if the 30 pict 1 could
be used to replace a 30 pict 2 from a 1968 Karma Giha
1500cc engine. Would this make a feasable replacement?
Would they run into any problems?

Thanks!

Regards,
