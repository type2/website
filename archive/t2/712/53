Hi Clayton,

The stock jets in the dual solex carbs for a 1700 engine will run too 
lean for a 2L. My 1.7 had 127.5 jets in it, so for the 2L upgrade I 
made in the summer of 2003 I used 132's. They are available as mikuni 
jets at your local Motorcycle shop.

As Karl said, you will also need a new fuel pump, and a relay to 
control it. Ideally you want the fuel pump to run from a double-relay 
like the 75-79 buses have so that in the event of an accident the fuel 
pump shuts off as soon as the engine quits.

What else? You *might* need to move the studs over from the 1.7 onto 
the 2L case to get them through the 3-rib tranny's bell-housing. No big 
deal. It would also be a good time to put a new clutch disk in if the 
current disk is more than half worn out.


Happy trails,
