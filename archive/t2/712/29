Subject: Bon Voyage to me

     Well, I'm leaving on my first air cooled trip ever. It's true I'm an air-cooled-roadtrip virgin, and would greatly appreciate any advice on anything that anyone can give me on how to handle this. I'll be going from Irvine Ca up the 5 freeway to Frisco, then onto the 101 on up to Mendocino Ca. Any tips on driving techniques or tools to take along would be right helpful. Thank you all ahead of time.
