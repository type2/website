Hi Jason,

I am holding you responsible for the puddle of saliva on my keyboard. 
Perhaps you were simply unaware that 3 time-zones to your right it's 
almost dinner-time.

"Honey, we're going out for Seafood tonight..."


Happy trails,

take that West, all the way out to CA-1.  Turn right (north) and head 
into Point Reyes Station, and stop at the Cowgirl Creamery for some 
fantastic cheese.  Might as well keep heading north on CA-1 to the 
Tomales Bay Oyster Company and have an oyster picnic (pulled right 
from, and sitting right by, the Bay) ... if you like 'em raw, order the 
"extra small" (should be ~$8/dozen).  Bring a couple of kitchen towels 
(for protecting / wiping your hands), a baguette, and a bottle of 
chilled Chardonnay (available at the grocery store in Point Reyes 
Station :-).  They'll gladly rent an oyster knife to you at the Oyster 
Company for a pittance.
