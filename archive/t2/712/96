on the one type4 I have torn down I seem to remember having trouble in
this area once. I just dug around in my toolbox for a cheap deep well
socket that seemed to be thin enough to slip over it.

Is the crank trashed, or just useless to you? Might be worth offering
up to the list? As far as the gears I sure don't mind having an extra
gear in my parts stash, you might not mind having them if you intend
to rebuild a type4 at some time in the future.
