Subject: Correct jets for PIC 35 Carb?

2 Questions:

1.) Does anyone know what size jets come on a Stock pic34?

2.) Does anyone know where you can buy these? online, FLAPS etc ?


A local shop drilled out the jets on my pic34 to get a little more performance
out of the 1600 and well it did , but dropped my gas millage to around 11 mpg.
Felt liked I owned a splitty. (always having to stop for gas) :) Anyway:

The performance problem was with the heads. That's fixed now.

Thanks,
