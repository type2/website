Skyler -

My additions to the list:

Throttle and clutch cables.  Or, at the very least, a metal coat hanger.

Extra quarts of your preferred brand and weight of oil.  Don't set yourself up
to run out and end up having to mix brands.  (If you haven't changed your oil
in preparation for the trip yet, consider: full synthetic like Mobil 1 is
best, and straight 30 wt is also a very good choice for long hot runs with few
cold starts. 10W30 is good, but nonsynth 10W40 is a bad idea as it will break
down when hot.  OK, enough about oil.)

Spare bulbs: headlight, turn/marker, and brake-light.  Reverse lights are a
different bulb too, but missing one of those won't interfere with a night
drive.

Spare fuses.

DON'T OVERHEAT YOUR ENGINE GOING OVER THE GRAPEVINE.  When you're going up
steep hills, your "sweet spots" in terms of best power/torque, decent cooling,
and not over-revving the engine should be around 25 mph and 40 mph.  My rule
for steep uphill sections is that if I can't maintain 55 in 4th, I drive at 40
in 3rd instead.. and if I can't maintain 40 in 3rd, I drive at 25 in 2nd.  On
the steep uphill sections you'll notice that the heavier trucks are driving at
similar speeds.  Just follow them.  Since you are not used to driving
aircooled vehicles, you will naturally feel tempted to pass these trucks while
going uphill.  DO NOT TRY TO PASS THE TRUCKS.  They are setting a sensible
pace that will be easy on you and your engine.  The right lane is your
friend.

Have fun!

p.s. in the Bay Area, the local nickname for San Francisco is simply "The
City" -- so, unless New York City is "y'nork"....
