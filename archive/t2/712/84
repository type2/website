I just recently changed the oil in a Toyota 6 cyl. 4Runner I inherited.
It was around 5K since its last change.  Oil still looked near amber and 
not black with no changes in performance.

My dad left a Toyota Corolla he had go for a VERY long time adding oil 
when it needed it until he blew the engine.

Oil destabilizes and gets darker as it takes up dirt, etc.  Other than 
that it's pretty tough to tell unless you did some chemical analysis.

If you just changed it and are concerned you might add some valve 
cleaner/upper engine lub/MMO or something in that line to dissolve any 
sediment or deposits that might have accumulated.

...bad time to let the oil changes go though.
