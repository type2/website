Subject: Re: [T2] Nose Replacement.

A guy ran a stop sign in a parking lot last a year ago February and I ran 
into him - my 78 was totally mint - stored inside since 80 - was I p'd off - 
anyway - insurance company mentioned write off and I sent them a 'letter' 
and quoted values for buses in the cond'n that mine was in - anyway - the 
adjuster came out and no problem he recognized the value of a mint 78 and he 
recommended a body shop to do the work - I had a couple different shops in 
mind but when I went to the one he recommended the owner said that the last 
time they did one of these repairs on a bus they had trouble getting the 
fans to work - whoa - that was the place for me - they used the part the bus 
depot stocks - same raised portion where the emblem goes - if I were you I 
would spend a bit of time searching around for a NOS nose - they are around 
and the metal is better and the place where the emblem goes isn't raised. 
Anyway - the price here in Eastern Canada for the whole job when an 
insurance company picks up the tab was about $3,500.00.
