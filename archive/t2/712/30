Subject: FS: Side tent (fits 68 to 79) $500US

I have an original westy side tent for sale (fits 68 to 79). It is in 
good usable condition complete with poles. But it needs a little bit of 
TLC for a couple of frayed corners and such. These seem to go for $500 
to $800US. I'll take $500US because of the TLC. Paypal is fine. I'm 
near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is heavy so shipping is at your 
expense.
