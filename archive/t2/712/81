Well.. my Subaru has 276K on the original engine, and it still runs perfectly.
Doesn't even burn oil.  The only engine work it's ever had was what prompted
the P.O. to sell it: a blown head gasket due to overheating (the electric fan
switch had failed).  I have a really hard time believing that a Subaru engine
would have problems like these if it were not overheated.

For me, the engine decision for my '71 came down to the time & expense
involved in the installation.  The Meximotor was decisively cheap and simple
by comparison, even though it might last only 60-80K miles.

Cheers,
