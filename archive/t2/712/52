Chris,

Getting lazy in your "old" age??<grin>

google.....enter define:Powder Coating

6 entries.  Basically, it's like xeroxing, except the "plastic" powder
goes on metal instead of paper.

Some *very* interesting stuff here:

http://www.powdercoating.org/splash.htm

Where it says:

Powder coating is an advanced method of applying a decorative and 
protective finish to a wide range of materials and products that are used 
by both industries and consumers. The powder used for the process is a 
mixture of finely ground particles of pigment and resin, which is sprayed 
onto a surface to be coated. The charged powder particles adhere to the 
electrically grounded surfaces until heated and fused into a smooth 
coating in a curing oven. The result is a uniform, durable, high-quality, 
and attractive finish. Powder coating is the fastest-growing finishing 
technology in North America, representing over 10% of all industrial 
finishing applications.

What they didn't mention was that it also can contain silicone(for the 
hi-temp stuff I think).

Also at the above site...*lots* of interesting stuff...including the fact 
that they are working on powder coating *wood*....if they haven't already 
done so by now.

Powder coating is the answer to a prayer by the EPA(and lots of the rest 
of us too)!  Now if the Mercedes folks can figure out how to powder coat a 
car, and then fix it to look good later using powder coating, we will all 
be in the definition of "heaven" by the EPA.


Cheers ,dave
