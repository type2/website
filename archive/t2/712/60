I wouldn't say "lots".  280 from the 101 interchange to China Basin /  
Mission Bay (right by the ballpark), 80 from the 101 interchange to  
the Bay Bridge, and a tiny bit of what's left of the Central Freeway  
between the 80/101 interchange and Duboce St.  But the freeways are  
not what makes San Francisco beautiful.

A good places to drive a Bus:

- Embarcadero St. from the ballpark towards the Wharf.
- Great Highway along Ocean Beach up to Cliff House / Sutro Heights.
- Golden Gate Park - take JFK from Great Highway through the park and  
stop in at the Conservatory of Flowers! (note: closed to most car  
traffic in the east end of the park on Sundays).
- In the Mission (because you MUST stop to get a true Mission  
burrito! -- contact me off-list for recommendations :-)
- Golden Gate Bridge, DUH!! :-)  Note, $5 toll for the southbound  
(towards-City) direction, northbound is free.
- After you cross the Golden Gate, take 101N to Sir Francis Drake,  
and take that West, all the way out to CA-1.  Turn right (north) and  
head into Point Reyes Station, and stop at the Cowgirl Creamery for  
some fantastic cheese.  Might as well keep heading north on CA-1 to  
the Tomales Bay Oyster Company and have an oyster picnic (pulled  
right from, and sitting right by, the Bay) ... if you like 'em raw,  
order the "extra small" (should be ~$8/dozen).  Bring a couple of  
kitchen towels (for protecting / wiping your hands), a baguette, and  
a bottle of chilled Chardonnay (available at the grocery store in  
Point Reyes Station :-).  They'll gladly rent an oyster knife to you  
at the Oyster Company for a pittance.
