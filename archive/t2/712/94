Subject: type IV engine valve coves

Lurkers in the Northern Virginia area!!!

I am looking for a few pair of type IV [is that correct??] valve covers.  
Rusty is fine, but they need to be straight and undamaged.

Does anyone have a pair they could spare??

[I would like to REFINISH them with this POR-15 I just bought.  Is the 
POR-15 capale to withstand the bail wire scratches??  ]

BTW, does anyone need to buy a pair of emergency brake anchor pins??  I 
could ship them out for $5 a pair.  You would be participating in a near 
future group purchase.
