Guys,

They will eventually scratch.  Thre is just nothing that will stand up to 
repeated scraping of one piece of metal on another like that.

Even chrome(God forbid) will eventually get worn away and ugly.

I supose if you were really serious, you could find some kind of thin 
heat resistant rubber or teflon tubing to slide on the bails where they 
contact the covers....

mcmaster.com has some good to 500 degrees F and not "too" thick.

If I thought that bolt on covers would ever work and not leak, I would use 
them, but since I have hydraulic in the bus and don't expect to have to 
open them up but once ever 20,000 miles or so, I just powder coated them.

Cheers, dave
