That's right.  The correct term is "Sam Clam's Disco"

Carry some spare gas or make sure you're topped off on the 5 thru the valley,
sometimes there's 70 mile stretches without service.

Skirting the city is probably a time saver, but San Francisco is a cool city
to drive thru if you've never seen it.  Lot's of elevated freeway so you can
see what goes on around there.

Airs list for sure.  I'm near the 198/99 if you need any help around there.

Later,
