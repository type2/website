Hi Andy
The VW cam hunting was put on hold Tuesday & Wednesday while I got kidnapped
by my host to drive all over Miami & meet his friends.  Tomorrow the quest for
a completely worn out used up cam will begin anew & for sure I'll start
calling that list of guys you suggested.  Thanks for following up.  I
appreciate it.


Thanks also to Mike Benthin for passing on the specifics of his Key West
adventures.

The Kerouac reading on The Steve Allen Show from November 16, 1959 is just
really, really good.  Steve Allen is playing semi-improvised jazz piano w/ a
small combo in the background while Kerouac does 3 or 4 minutes of
strung-together fragments from "On The Road" & "Visions of Cody" (which
incidentally was
written first & had the working title of "On The Road" until JK decided to
completely set it aside & start over).  This piece came off a 3-CD boxed set
called
"The Beat Generation" on Rhino, which is maybe 25% music that inspired the
Beats & 25% Beat era authors doing readings.  The remaining material is more
or
less representative of the Beat-inspired cultural explosion that ensued & not
everything here is worth owning.  (But read the enclosed booklet to discover
that insipid "poet" Rod McKuen was a CIA agent during the '50's while, whether
using the alias Bob McFadden or his real name, he was performing so-called
"Beat music" which in fact consisted mainly of lyrics designed to promote
negative
Beat stereotypes.  Believe it or not, the CIA's technique was roughly on par
w/ Kevin Nealon's "subliminal message" skits on SNL from the early 90's.)  The
boxed set sells for around $35 but I got it from the library.  If your
library doesn't own a copy maybe I can try sending you the Kerouac on Steve
Allen
"link" ;-) via pmail.  There are several documentaries out on video which
feature film clips from the Steve Allen reading & at least one that has it
from
start to finish.  Here's the listing from the library's online catalog:
