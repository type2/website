Subject: Re: [T2] Engine alternative in '71 bus?

Don't forget the location of the radiator if you choose to go watercooled. Only this week did I find a picture of a Westy that had an acceptable radiator location (i.e. invisible). 

Folks have placed the radiators under the main frame rails with air scoops, where the battery goes along with a big grille in the side of the bus, in place of the engine hatch, inside the passenger compartment in place of the rear hatch (was a cargo van), on top, and in place of the spare tire (sometimes disguised as the spare tire). 

The best one I saw was a bus that had a 2nd vent grille (like the one under the windshield) grafted just above the front bumper. Nose looks stock. Inside they created a small compartment like a diminutive engine cowling on a big American van but this one did not even displace the emergency brake lever. Duplicates loosely the location of the Mexican bus location. Air exits below the floor. Had room for an electric fan too. 

I don't know that I would want to chop my bus that much but I love the hidden aspect of it. I have seen pictures where people just hung the radiator out front with hose and pipes and such but that is not for me.

I have the pic of the van I like best but no where to host it... Send it on request.
