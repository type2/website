Subject: It started!

Hi Volks!

After having parked my (non-registered) '72 panel van
last August, I had to move it last weekend.  So I turned
the key, and lo and behold: it started on third try, as
if it had been parked for seven days, not seven months.

I'm impressed.

I'm also quite eager to drive it again.  There's a lot
of oil leakage between then and now that needs to be
fixed, though.  I'm looking at a partial engine teardown,
and I don't look at it with great anticipation.  However,
I will go for it quite soon -- this van last ran so long
ago that I cannot quite remember when (early this decade,
I'd say), and that's definitely not something I'm proud
of.

I'm confident however that any problems that will certainly 
surface during the work will be solved with a little help
from my friends.  This means you.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
