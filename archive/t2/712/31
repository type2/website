Pack a toolbox (just in case), spare belt, spare points, oil, fuel line, fuses, etc.  Print 
out the AIRS list for CA and put it in the glovebox.  Make sure the spare tire is good, 
you've got a lugwrench and make sure the jack works.  You may not need any of that
stuff, but better to have-and-not-need than need-and-not-have.  I'm sure others can 
chime in with a better list of stuff.

Drive easy.  The right hand lane is your friend.

Unless you've got a compelling reason or desire to visit SF, it might be better to 
bypass the "inner" Bay Area.  Traffic and people on cell phones being the main 
reasons.  

My suggestion:  Take 80 west towards the Bay Area, then pick up 12 at 
Cordelia Junction just past Fairfield. That would skirt you just south of Napa, through 
downtown Sonoma (the Sonoma Cheese Factory on the square makes an *excellent* 
pepper jack) then up through Kenwood and into Santa Rosa, where you can pick up 
101.  Much nicer scenery.  

If you take that route, watch out for idiot drivers around the Napa/Sonoma area and 
101 from Santa Rosa to about Healdsburg or Cloverdale.  I grew up in Santa Rosa, only
moved to Oregon last year, so I know that area well.  Still pissed that I can't afford to
live there anymore...
