Many thanks to Andy for taking time out of his Sunday to deliver the cam, 
which he graciously donated to the cause.  Unfortunately, yesterday I discovered 
that the gear on his cam just isn't worn out & sloppy enough to fit in my POS 
aluminum case.  Andy had given me a list of other local vendors & options 
which I will start trying as soon as I mail this.  Does anyone know if there is 
still a junkyard in Miami that has any air cooled stuff?  Here's a typical 
example of what I'm encountering here in Miami: the owner of a huge VW repair shop 
called The Buggy Doctor told me he hasn't worked on an air-cooled engine in 10 
years.  He's exclusively into water cooled now.  Does anybody sell short 
blocks or used engines?  

Anyway, thanks to everybody who has made suggestions so far.  If Andy's other 
Miami ideas don't pan out I'll be moving on to the Lauderdale & farther away 
options suggested by Eric Tamila.  Thanks also to everyone who provided ideas 
about camping in Key West.

FYI - the owner of Florida Foreign Parts, a VW specialist here in Miami, 
complained angrily that Autolina has refused to give him credit for any of the 
aluminum cases that he sold & then had to give refunds for when the cases were 
returned by buyers who shared one common characteristic --> they were all 
screamers.  (How well I know this feeling.)  Incidentally, unlike what I've heard 
said elsewhere, this quality control issue was NOT limited to the first 
manufacturing run of aluminum cases.  The Florida Foreign owner was talking about 3rd 
& 4th generation cases that he had sold as late as April 2004.  The excuse 
that Autolina gave for not giving him refunds was that the cases were perfect & 
the problem was that he was selling them to the general public, as opposed to 
trained mechanics who would have assembled them correctly.  This is also 
exactly what I heard last year in Las Vegas when my aluminum engine died out there.  
The VW parts supplier I used (don't recall the name but it was a great shop 
in the NW part of LV) said Autolina refused to provide refunds for bad cases & 
blamed everything on "untrained mechanics."  That shop had to give 5 or 6 
refunds for aluminum cases, threw them in the dumpster, & ate the loss.  Is 
Autolina really so big and/or important to the VW aftermarket industry that nobody 
wants to sue the pr*cks?

And lastly, for those of you on a workplace computer or who for some reason 
have neglected to install the Type 2/VintageBus email decoder program on your 
home computer, here's the decrypted account of Andy's "Good conversation, good 
company, a few beers and a bus= good times."-->

Sunday afternoon Andy & wife Billie arrived in a black New Beetle dressed in 
matching all black outfits.  Andy is sort of a cross between actor/director 
Paul Bartell & lovable 50's TV beatnik Maynard G. Krebs 
(http://www.bobdenver.com/Maynard_s_CoffeeHouse/Maynard_G__Krebs/body_maynard_g__krebs.html).  His 
lovely wife Billie is a combination of Louise Brooks 
(http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000315/) & Morticia Addams of The Addams Family as played by Carolyn Jones 
(http://www.swinginchicks.com/carolyn_jones.htm).  As for me, my nieces & 
nephews now snidely refer to me as Napoleon Dynamite 
(http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/napoleon_dynamite.html).  Royce drives an SUV so no 
description of him is necessary.  During several hours of conversation Andy & Billie 
displayed the healthy symbiosis of a marriage based on tolerance, mutual respect, 
& contradictory crosstalk reminiscent of the Mike Nichols-Elaine May comedy 
routines (you can do this one- www.google.com).  Contrary to what Andy implies, 
getting them to accept a couple of beers was like pulling teeth.  Anyway, the 
conversation went something like this:

5 minutes - Showing them my '60 bus & explaining that I was just learning to 
do body work when I did the body work on it.
5 minutes - Showing them the notorious aluminum engine, now strewn across my 
friend's garage floor.  Refrained from doing my usual profane ranting about it 
because they were company.
10 minutes - Bickering about relative merits of single port (Andy) & dual 
port (me).  I can do 77 mph in my bus (previous magnesium engine case) if I have 
to pass a semi in order to keep from being killed in murderous Miami traffic.  
Andy is happy to do 60 in his.  R.I.P.  Ha, got the last word.
5 minutes - Bickering between Andy & Billie about his VW parts stash vs. her 
(peculiar) notion of what a garage ought to have in it.
5 minutes - Me complaining about the mistakes made by "factory trained & 
certified" VW mechanics who tried & failed 3 times to rebuild my transmission 
correctly (with me doing all the tranny R&R's in between failures).
5 minutes - TomTom's VW Museum & Repair Shop in Moab, Utah.  It needs to be 
listed someplace on Type2.com as a Vintage VW tourist attraction.
9 minutes - Me trying to convince Andy & Billie to drive their '68 bus 
through southern Utah on I-70 while playing Doors music at high volume.
6 minutes - Me trying to convince them to fly to Denver & drive a rental car 
through southern Utah on I-70 while playing Doors music at high volume.
3 minutes - Me getting out my iBook to use iTunes to play an mp3 for them of 
Jack Kerouac doing a reading on the Steve Allen Show in 1959 in which he 
describes the experience of driving across southern Utah & hearing God instructing 
him to go forth & write "On The Road".
1 minute - Showing them a photo on my iBook of my bus at Spotted Wolf Canyon 
in southern Utah last fall w/ God using cloud formations to tell me it was 
time to wash the bus.
5 minutes - Discussing the fact that all of us, including Royce the SUV 
lover, are Macintosh iBook owners.
2 minutes - Smug self-congratulatory discussion about the fact that as Mac 
owners we don't get viruses or make Bill Gates the Son of Satan any richer.
2 hours - The lies W (stands for "Wrong") told America to get us into Iraq & 
various other progressive political issues.  Well what did you expect?  See 
above, where it says they arrived dressed in all black.  I saved this part for 
last so I wouldn't lose 25% of you in the first paragraph.

Anyway, an abnormally entertaining afternoon where the beer wasn't even a 
factor.  And a perfect example of the work ethic that accounts for why after 11 
days in Miami my engine is still on the garage floor.  Tomorrow for that.
