Subject: what happens if you don't change your oil in 10,000 miles?!

Ok, so I think I *might* have forgotten to change my oil in the past 
10,000 miles and I'm kicking myself for it.  Actually, I just can't 
remember if I changed it somewhere in there and that's the problem.  I 
remember doing something on the car and not writing it down since my 
last oil change (10,000 miles ago), but I'm not sure if that's what it 
was as I've been doing so much work on it lately.  Granted, I've 
probably gone at least 4k if I did change it somewhere in there, but 
that's still better than 10k!

So, I was curious what are the signs of unchanged oil?  Is there 
anything I should look for in particular?  I just changed it and I also 
adjusted the valves and it runs perfect.  I just did a 600 mile trip up 
to 6600 feet after changing the oil and ran perfectly the whole way.

I might be pulling the engine to retighten things (recent rebuild) so I 
thought I'd see if there was anything else I should look for.

Any help would be much appreciated!

thanks,
mike
