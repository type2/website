Also at the above site...*lots* of interesting stuff...including the fact
that they are working on powder coating *wood*....if they haven't already
done so by now.
-------------------
wood is being done now there was a post about it on this list about a
year or so ago and i read up on it at that time.  its very popular on
office furniture to comply with sick building off gassing regulations.  to
get it to work on the wood often they have to spray it with some type of
conduction water based solution first.  typically they use powder coating
on some "special" type of chip board, i forget the name its the stuff all
that cheap office and student furniture is made out of.


****************
Powder coating is the answer to a prayer by the EPA(and lots of the rest
of us too)!  Now if the Mercedes folks can figure out how to powder coat a
car, and then fix it to look good later using powder coating, we will all
be in the definition of "heaven" by the EPA.
----------------------

mostly what i have seen here in the auto industry is that they went to
water based paint systems.  that yields both a reduction in emissions and
cheaper electrical installation because the stuff doesn't have to be wired
in a explosion proof manner.  the Ford Rouge plant has/had a water based
paint system that was used to paint the mustangs.  they moved mustang
production out of that plant and now make the new F150 there so i would
assume that those are painted with water based paints also.  that said in
some research a while back i did see a patent application by diamler
chrysler for a electrostatic/powder coat system for body panels.
