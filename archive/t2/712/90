Hi Jamey

Here is a Quote from http://www.type2.com/~type2reflect/msg94223.html

Please visit the web site at http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/

There are three important updates.

1) Revised fee structure. Campground fees will be $16 per vehicle per
night. Additionally,  there will be a $5 event charge per registration.
For example. You and your family show up in the bus on Friday and leave
Sunday. That will be $32 campground fee plus $5 for the event charge.
The total in this case would be $37.
