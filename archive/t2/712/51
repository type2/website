Subject: Re: [T2] Powder coatng

Hey Chris - is that furniture covered in "plastic dip" or powdercoated? 

My powdercoated wheels are rusting slightly along the edges where the shop didn't put enough material. 

Was thinking powercoating was basically the paint solids without the solvents? 

Anybody set me straight?
