Subject: Re: [T2] CA Smog Exemption

From: Rick:

Anybody know if my '77 Westy is still on track to become smog exempt in CA in 2007? It's due this year; so
would I have to get one last smog in 2007, or should this one be it?

Not sure where you been hiding but good old Arnold passed  AB2683 and STOPPED the rolling exemption back in
2004.....on 10/8/04:

and now 76 and newer will always be smog checked.
