Subject: 10mm valve adjusting screws

I was talking to my vw parts counter buddy today and he told me they just got a new "tape" from vw and the parts prices in their computer system have changed: some up, some down.

I was looking for some genuine 10mm valve adjusting screws (022 109 451) and the price is now $12.85/ea!
