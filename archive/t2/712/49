Powder coating is really just a plastic coating, so I imagine that any good 
primer that is rated for bonding to plastics would work fine. There are 
"plastic paints" for lawn furniture and the like that hold up really well 
and last forever. You might try them. I don't know how well they would hold 
up to any kind of heat or oils, but for my inlaws lawn furniture it looks 
just painted and it lives outside in PA for the last 3 years.
