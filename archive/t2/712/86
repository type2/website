To the person who was looking for Weber jet sizing, this is what I have in
mine, running on a Vanagon CV engine.

Primary Main Jet              1.37mm
Secondary Main Jet            1.40mm
Primary Air Correction Jet    1.65mm
Secondary Air Correction Jet  1.60mm
Primary Emulsion Tube         F66
Secondary Emulsion Tube       F50
Primary Idling Jet            .60mm
Secondary Idling Jet          .50mm
Pump Jet                      .55mm 


I am on my second Carb, I was too lazy to rebuild the first one.  I have
gotten a steady 15 to 15.5 miles per gallon for over 60K miles.  I also have
an 009 Dist. installed.  This MPG does not seem to vary from these values
even during 70MPH, 45 minute to 1 hour trips on the expressway.  Most of my
driving is "city miles".
