Subject: Nose Replacement.

Anyone have any first hand experience with this nose piece?
http://www.busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=9556200

It looks like it would be short on the bottom, but looks are SOoo
deceiving. Does it just look short becouse theirs no bumber their?

I'm gonna need to replace the whole nose becouse their's a HUGE dent
where the spare connects, reaching over the driver side, then the
drivers side is Crumbled from the windsheild area all the way down to
the bumper. It's torn and crumbled, and just shot to heck. Not to
mention the usuall rust under the windsheild rubber.

So anyone got advice for what to do, or not do when replacing the nose
piece? And anyone got a more Localized source for the greater Seattle
area that might carry the nose. Nothing against ya' Busdepot, just
hoping to avoid that shipping charge. :)
