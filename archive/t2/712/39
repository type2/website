Subject: 30 pict-1 rebuilt carb for sale Reduced price!

Hello List,

Many of the things that I listed for sale have sold. I
still have a rebuilt solex 20 pict 1 carb from a 68
bus for sale. This carb had new gaskets installed and
the injection tube was replaced. This carb came off a
running bus and it worked great after the rebuild. I
am not using it because I now have a 1600DP engine
with dual carbs. I was asking $100 for it but I am
dropping the price to $75.00 plus shipping. It comes
with an aftermarket air cleaner and stock SP intake.
This is a great Carb!

Take care!

Regards,
David Kelly
