There is another link for you. The Aussie guys are really working with the Subbie and Nissan options being so close to the Aisan car makers.

I've read dozens of pages there about Subbie conversions. Never owned one myself so I couldn't say they are good or bad. Missed a Legacy AWD wagon for $100 about 2 months ago... Dang..
