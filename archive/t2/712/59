Any engine swap will involve a lot of work!  Getting the engine mated to
the tranny is just the tip of the iceberg.  You still have to deal with
linkages, wiring, hosing, mounts, cooling, exhaust, etc.  You become the
engineer at this point and find out why they make the big bucks!

That being said, a number of engines have found their way into a type 2.
Type IV, corvair, toyota, and Subaru seem to be the most popular ones.

I am in a state of constant research on the Subaru option.  2.5 liters,
165 stock horsepower, 200K+ life and good economy seem mighty
attractive.  However, the installation would have to become another hobby,
as the cost in time could not be justified any other way.
