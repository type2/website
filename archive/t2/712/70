I agree with you George. My wallet is fat from all those cards, not from all
the dollars in their. I like places that sell things at a reasonable markup
and keep the prices stable and low all the time.

  To me, a "member discount" is just another way of saying "Jump through my
  hoops or you'll pay through the nose".  I have to carry one card so that
  won't be ripped off at the supermarket, another so that I won't get ripped
  off at the bookstore, etc.  This is not a situation I like, but everyone
  is playing these games and I don't have a choice.  I'd like to keep my VW
  transactions free of this nonsense.
