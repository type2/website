The reason the page moved was because I redid the way the pages were set up
at the first of the year. The ftp storage and the way I had them set up was
a pain to update( not to mention a mess), this way is a lot easier to
maintain and navigate. Plus now we have the archives of most of the pages
since 2000 or so.  Main url is www.metwiz.com <http://www.metwiz.com/>  .
Spare time is something I have very little of so what I can save updating
gives me more time to focus on other projects, or to just chill out. Later
