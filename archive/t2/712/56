Subject: Questions about my our 73 Westy

Greetings to the list!
My fiancie and I have become the new owners of a 1973 Westy. This is
our seventh VW, and our third air cooled, so we're pretty familiar with
VWs. However, this is our first type 2, and was both "accessorized" and
neglected by POs, so I have some questions I hope the list could
answer. It appears to have the standard 1700cc engine with two carbs
and the paper air filter.

1. Being in upstate New York, we're trying to make what heat there is
heat work properly. (There is no gas heater.) I've found many good
resources online to how to repair and improve the heating system, but
none seem to go into detail about the small blower fan in the engine
bay. At this point, I have never seen it run, even when the engine is
running. The Bentley shows a heater air blower switch, but I don't seem
to see one in the bus. Further confusing me is the existing wiring: a
PO wired the two prong receptacle with the rubber boot to the coil
+12VDC and ground. Finally, it looks as if vacuum lines should be
hooked to the device with the two prong plug. There currently are none,
nor are there any to the vacuum line connections on the underside of
the air cleaner duct.
	- Was the heater air blower switch an option, or should it be on all
busses?
	- If I should have one, where would I find it?
	- Where should that two prong receptacle be wired to?
	- Similarly, should I have vacuum line connections to the fan? If so,
from where to where? (No vacuum line diagrams I've seen online match my
engine/carb configuration.)

2. There is an item wired to my left carb that I'm unfamiliar with. If
someone could help me identify it and clue me in to where it should be
mounted, I'd be most appreciative. Pictures are available at
