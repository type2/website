Subject: Split the case

OK, I split the case.  My first time ever!!

After all the nuts were removed, it came apart easily.  The one nut I didn't 
see was the one over the oil pump.  And I looked at least 5 times, all 
around the case.  It was RIGHT THERE!!

Question 1:  I could not take one of the 14mm nuts off one of the connecting 
rod. 5 came off easily with a socket, but I could not get a socket around 
the sixth nut.  I rounded the nut with an open end wrench [the box end would 
not fit, either].  Is this a normal thing, that one of the connecting rod 
nuts might not be accessible with a normal 14 mm socket??

Question 2:  The cam has [IIRC] this part number, 021 109 111C   Is this a 
solid lifter or hydraulic lifter cam??

Question 3:  I am trashing the crank, but there seems to be some gears at 
the fan end.  Should I attempt to remove them and save them??

[I forgot to get the woodruff key from the end of the crank shaft.  I 
ordered a key from Bus Depot, but I don't expect to get it.  I had better 
fish the crank shaft out of the recycle bin and pull the key.  I guess just 
vice grips will do.]
