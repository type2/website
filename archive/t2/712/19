Subject: Steering box rebuilder

Volks -

So, my '71 Bus has developed excessive play in the steering gearbox.
(Originally, some may recall, it was just a clunk... but no more!)

I tracked down the guy in Redding, CA who is reputed to rebuild steering
boxes, and wanted to post his information for the benefit of the list and the
archives.

His name is Wolfgang.  Phone number: 530-246-4264.

He sells rebuilt steering boxes for $299 plus a $250 core charge, and warns
that 80% of the cores he receives are not rebuildable.  He says that core
availability is a major problem.  Wolfgang feels that his rebuilt units are
better than the stock design because he adds a bushing around the main shaft
where VW omitted one.

Also for the record, I called NW Connecting Rod & another VW machine shop that
they referred me to here in the Seattle area.  Neither rebuilds steering
boxes, and both suggested Wolfgang.

Cheers,

- Miles
