Subject: "Red Cup Ale" EveryBus Shirts

Hi Volks,

I'm passing along some information about the "Red Cup Ale" T-Shirts 
that my friend Adam is making for EveryBus. Red Cup Ale is the homebrew 
that is currently aging gracefully in my basement awaiting the trip to 
EveryBus where it will be dispensed at the Canadian Pavilion.

Here's the message from Adam:

 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

To celebrate the Everybus 05 Canadian Invasion I have created the "Red 
Cup Ale, Everybus05" T-shirt.
The shirt rides alongside the 22 litres of Red Cup Ale that will be 
making the journey. Well...it may be less than 22 litres by that point 
:-), but you get the idea.

Requests for the shirts are coming in,but I need to make a confirmed 
order early next week.
That means, deadline time. If you would like a Red Cup Everybus05 
Canadian
Invasion shirt, I will need to know by this coming Easter Monday.

Please look here:

for the shirt pic.

Then click here:
mailto:suburban(-at-)busesofthecorn.com?subject=RED_CUP_SHIRT
to pmail me.

Please include the size, your name, your favourite skittle flavour, 
whether you
like long walks on the beach, and your location. Do not repsond on the 
list, please.

Shirts are $12. Printed on a nice green cotton T. Pre-payment 
guarantee's a shirt. You can pay by pay-pal, cheque, or the always fun 
"well concealed cash". pmail me for the mailing address.
Also available are tank-tops for tha ladeeze. Let me know if you want a 
tank instead of a Tee. Tank prices are "to be confirmed" as I am trying 
to find a good supplier of a nice tank.

You will receive an email confirmation shortly after this coming Easter 
Monday.

Shirts will be distributed as I see you on the way to Everybus. (while 
stopped) Only shirts pre-ordered are guaranteed.
I may have a small quantity available at the event. But supply will be 
limited and on a first come basis.

Thanks for your support!
