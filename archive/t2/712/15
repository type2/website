Subject: Valve train disaster?

Today I was chaging a valve cover gasket to fix an oil leak.  When I popped 
the cover, out fell the number 1 intake valve adjustment screw and one of 
the adjuster nuts.  The other nut was nowhere to be found.  The inside of 
the valve cover was gouged a little where the adjustment screw had hit it.  
The screw looked stripped which probably means the rocker arm threads are 
too. I haven't driven my bus much this winter and it actually started fine 
and ran well...no problems.  I replaced he push rod tubes last year and 
checked on valve clearance fairly often so it must have been a recent thing.

I have that sinking feeling in my stomache and lots of questions.

1.  Could the adjustment nut been sucked into the engine through the pushrod 
tube.  It looks like it wouldn't fit and if it did, I would hear a whole lot 
of noise.

2.  What invisible horrors have I done to my engine?  How would I find out? 
There has to some metal that ran through it from the valve cover metal.

3.  Can I fix the rocker arm by rethreading it, or do I have to by a new 
shaft and two new rocker arms.

Basically, where do I go from here?  I have to use my bus to do some moving 
next week, so this couldn't have happened at a worse time.


Thanks very much for the help.  It is much appreciated
