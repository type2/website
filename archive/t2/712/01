Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 Solution

Barry,

best to stick with their thinner....I have some but have used it
only to wipe por-15 off of things before it dried.

I usually brush por-15 on the parts i am doing...usually flows out and 
looks great.  I think they only recomend the thinner if you are going to 
spray Por-15....something that I am scared to do...and don't have the 
equipment for.

That's why I like powder coat!

Cheers, dave
