Subject: Re: [T2] Engine alternative in '71 bus?

Mark makes an interesting observation.

While my wife and I have two Subies (97 Outback Sport, 2002 Outback 
Wagon) which have been 100% trouble-free and reliable, my other 2000 
Outback Ltd. Wagon suffered a blown head gasket at only 28K miles. I 
regularly changed oil and filters and all, and the Subie dealership was 
quite puzzled by that.

Mine was a 2.5 engine as well. Replaced under warranty though.

Of note is that this engine saw a LOT of California highway miles (can 
you say STOP and GO?), but ran like a top afterwards. It was a fine 
vehicle, though, all in all.

I currently have just over 100K miles on my 97 Outback, and it still 
runs like a champ. We'll see what happens in 40K miles, though.

Nonetheless, I am a firm believer in keeping things mostly stock, and 
would probably never put anything other than a basically stock motor in 
Konrad, our 69 Westy Hard Top. Now if someone GAVE me a Subie-powered 
bus, I'd grin like a fool and say thanks!
