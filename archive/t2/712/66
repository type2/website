I don't know if it was an option, but I can tell you where to look for it! 
VW in their infinite wisdom created a system so that the heater fan can 
only work when the engine is running ie. not while off or starting. They 
did this by using a relay (attached to the heater fan) that draws power for 
the +ve side of its coil from the wire going to the alternator light. The 
-ve side is switched by a contact near the base of the lever on your dash 
that operates the heater flaps. When this lever is most of the way down it 
hits this contact shorting it to ground (and switching your fan on if the 
engine is running).

The long and short of it is that if you've got the switch you should be 
able to see the contact at the base of the heater lever. It's even more 
obvious if you take the dash off.
