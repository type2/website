Y'know, one thing I appreciate is a vendor who charges a fair price for
what I buy, including shipping.  someone who orders a set of heater boxes
should pay more shipping than someone who orders a headlight relay, as the
true costs are different.  I know that the current style in marketing is
to try to convince the customer that something is free, but intellegent
people know that in the end the cost is borne by the customer, including
the cost of the advertising campaign to convince us that things are free.

To me, a "member discount" is just another way of saying "Jump through my
hoops or you'll pay through the nose".  I have to carry one card so that
won't be ripped off at the supermarket, another so that I won't get ripped
off at the bookstore, etc.  This is not a situation I like, but everyone
is playing these games and I don't have a choice.  I'd like to keep my VW
transactions free of this nonsense.
