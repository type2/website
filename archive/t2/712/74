Subject: Oversized Oil Drain Plug?

I have a Vanagon CV engine installed in my 72 Bus.  After 60K of trouble
free miles, I have a problem that I would like to correct somehow.

When I changed my Oil today, my drain plug came out with a little thread
still on it.  It tightened up "ok" but I would be happier if I could retap
and install a new oversized plug.  Is there something available?
