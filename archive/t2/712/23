Subject: '73-79 steering box into '71?

Given that new (Brazilian?) steering boxes are available for '73-79 Buses, for
a lot less money than a rebuilt one costs...

Is anyone here familiar with the (externally important) differences between
the '71 steering box and the later Bay steering box?

How much modification would be necessary to transplant the newer design into
the older Bus?  Could it conceivably be worth trying, or no?

Thanks,

- Miles
