Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Purchase

Clayton asked:


 I am going to make a purchase with Bus Depot to get another engine in my ride.  I might as well upgrade and
get the 2.0L.  Has anyone done this?  What problems are involved if any?  Should I stay with my 1.7L?  What
other parts are required to complete and engine swap?  I've never bought an engine before and would like some
advice.  I figure I'll get another fuel pump, oil cooler, misc gaskets....but what else would be required?

If you are going to keep your dual carbs and the engine you get is a true USA 2.0L case, you will have NO
provision for the manual fuel pump. You will need a new electric pump under the tank.
