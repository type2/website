Hello Guys    I believe this mileage figure is inflated  they are having real 
problems with the head gaskets on the subu engines. I see most of these 
happening at about 140K  and on some like the 2.5 they dont make a head set and you 
have to buy each part seprately . Also are seeing the blocks cracking but I 
think this is because people are really overheating them.   I personally like 
making a stroker motor for the older aircooled engines  like a 1835 cc   later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
