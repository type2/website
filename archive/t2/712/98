Objet : [T2] Split the case


OK, I split the case.  My first time ever!!

After all the nuts were removed, it came apart easily.  The one nut I didn't

see was the one over the oil pump.  And I looked at least 5 times, all
around the case.  It was RIGHT THERE!!

Question 1:  I could not take one of the 14mm nuts off one of the connecting

rod. 5 came off easily with a socket, but I could not get a socket around
the sixth nut.  I rounded the nut with an open end wrench [the box end would

not fit, either].  Is this a normal thing, that one of the connecting rod
nuts might not be accessible with a normal 14 mm socket??

Use a 3/8" drive 14 mm socket and grind down the outside diameter until it
fits in the machined "pocket" of the nut.  Some "pockets" seems machined
smaller than others.  Worked for me.

Question 2:  The cam has [IIRC] this part number, 021 109 111C   Is this a
solid lifter or hydraulic lifter cam??

I think the part # you mention is gear #.  You will probably have to find a
# on the shaft itself.

Question 3:  I am trashing the crank, but there seems to be some gears at
the fan end.  Should I attempt to remove them and save them??

You need to remove the stiff circlip and use a very good puller.  If you do
not have any available, they are expensive to buy.

[I forgot to get the woodruff key from the end of the crank shaft.  I
ordered a key from Bus Depot, but I don't expect to get it.  I had better
fish the crank shaft out of the recycle bin and pull the key.  I guess just
vice grips will do.]
