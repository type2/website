I just recently changed the oil in a Toyota 6 cyl. 4Runner I inherited.
It was around 5K since its last change.  Oil still looked near amber and
not black with no changes in performance.

My dad left a Toyota Corolla he had go for a VERY long time adding oil
when it needed it until he blew the engine.

Oil destabilizes and gets darker as it takes up dirt, etc.  Other than
that it's pretty tough to tell unless you did some chemical analysis.

If you just changed it and are concerned you might add some valve
cleaner/upper engine lub/MMO or something in that line to dissolve any
My favorite tests, and I do it whenever I check the oil, is smell (smell for
gasoline, burned smell, indicating dilution or damage/breakdown) and feel
(rub it between your finger and thumb). Is it still slippery?
