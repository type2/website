Subject: Engine Purchase

I am going to make a purchase with Bus Depot to get another engine in my ride.  I might as well upgrade and get the 2.0L.  Has anyone done this?  What problems are involved if any?  Should I stay with my 1.7L?  What other parts are required to complete and engine swap?  I've never bought an engine before and would like some advice.  I figure I'll get another fuel pump, oil cooler, misc gaskets....but what else would be required?
