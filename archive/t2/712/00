Andrew,

I just fixed this problem on my 79 type 2 last week.
Turn signal indicator on the dash came on solid. Replaced
the flasher relay, same thing. The emergency flashers work
but within a few minutes of fiddling with it, it quit too.
I replaced the emergency flasher relay. When I removed
the old one, it fell apart in my hands. Popped the new
one in, everything works. Just make sure you swap the
wires over to the new relay, one at a time.
