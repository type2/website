Ok,
I found this on a buggy page.
http://www.geocities.com/updog2002/index/trannytech.html
I figure these guys spend so much time tearing these
things up and scouting parts, the information can be
seen as fairly reliable.
I know my local trans guru was surprised i was having
my 71 trans installed in a bus...
I was right in keeping my 74 and selling the 71 i
think...

"The type 2 or bus trannys can be identified easily by
their case design. All of the IRS ones up to 73 1/2
have 3 ribs on the top of it, so most people call
these "3-rib" trannys. Most of these have a 5.38 R&P,
and a "moderate" (3.80) first gear, however some have
the 3.78(same as the late model beetle transmission)
first gear (much stronger). The way to tell if it has
the 3.78 first gear is to take off the nose cone. The
mainshaft will NOT have a cone washer under the snap
ring. Also the mainshaft is bigger than the one that
has the weaker 3.80 first. Some of the 3-rib trannys
also have a 5.42 R&P which is "supposed" to be
stronger than the 5.38. I have seen a lot of R&P
problems with the 5.38. I have only seen a few of the
5.42's so I do not if they are actually stronger or
not. 
From 73 1/2 to 75, the case was changed to the 5-rib
design. These all have a 4.86 R&P, and the good 3.78
first gear. From 76-82?, the case was changed again to
the 6-rib design. These transmissions are sometimes
called the 091. These are the toughest. They have a
3.78 first gear, but it is even wider and stronger.
They also have a 091 differential section(bigger
spider and end gears). VW also made 091 trannies with
what I call a "side shifter" nose cone. The shifter
actually comes out of the side of it. These are
basically the same trans as the earlier 091 and can be
converted to the front nose cone by changing the nose
cone (of course), the intermediate housing, gear
selector, and shifting rods.
