Subject: Re: [T2] Master Cylinder to Vacuum Booster O-ring - spec and source?

Steve,

Can get dimensions off of my old one this evening if you still need it by 
then.  It is still laying in the floor where i took it off.

O rings in various sizes/flavors can be found at ACE hdw or any of the 
larger home centers.  Thye are in the section where they sell specialized 
hardware in the small boxes lined up down one whole row.

They might not be made of the same material as the original, but if they 
get brake fluid on them and deteriorate then you would know about it 
pretty quickly instead of ending up like i did with about 1/4 to 1/2 cup 
of brake fluid in the booster.

Cheers, dave
