Subject: Lift Channel for 68??

Hey all, I was just at the Bus Depot and they no longer had any of these
lift channels, their part # is 211 837 571A, not sure if that is the VW
# or not. I am in need of 2, both of mine have rusted out. If anyone
knows where to find them, please let me know..thanks..Brian
