Subject: Re: [T2] 70 Westy Cooler Ice Tray/Water fitting

I may be able to help you but......
There is a white plastic coated ice tray. Do you have that?
Below that is a white plastic drip tray. That is what the hose connects to.
There is 2 different size trays. Early like 68/69 were large. Somewhere around
70 or 71, they were smaller. Mainly width. I believe depth were the same.
Early was around 15", late was around 12 3/8". But these are only 'off the top
of my head figures'. What I need you to do is cut a piece of cardboard to fit
and send back the measurements. I have the late ice tray and drip tray.
I also have the fill pipe. It is barbed and just pushes down into the water
tank.




>Does anybody know where I could get the ice tray for the 70 Westfalia?  As
far as I can tell there is supposed to be a tray there in the middle of the
"fridge" with the drain hose hooked to the bottom. I have the hose running out
the back but no tray.  Looks a little inefficient compared to a regular cooler
but space is pretty tight in there so I want to find the tray if I can.
Another long shot part I am looking to find is the water fitting that goes on
top of the water tank.  It appears there is supposed to be a fitting that
threads on the top of the tank and extends it up the last 5 inches or so to
the level of the top of the sink.
