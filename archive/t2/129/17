Subject: Re: [T2] Installing master cylinder

Glen,

Just finished doing it 2 nights ago.

My method(78):

I usually have the front end jacked up pretty high.

Install MC brake lines loosely.
Leave the 2 brake switches off.

Fill reservoir.  With switches and wrenches handy under the car, wait till 
brake fluid start comming out of the switch hole furthest away from the
front of the cylinder.

Insert switch and hand tighten till fluid quits coming out.
As you do this, fluid will start coming out of the brakeline next
closest to the front of the car....tighten it down and wait a few seconds
for the next "leak"....you get the idea...follow the leaks and tighten as 
you go.

Wipe down new mc and start bleeding.  When finished, go straight 
to the car wash and wash down everything and anything that might still
have brake fluid on it..

Works great for me.  


Cheers ,dave
