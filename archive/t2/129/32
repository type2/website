Subject: will someone please help me!!??

hello again,

well i posted my gauge question the other day, however
i suppose no one saw fit to answer it. so i'm forced
to ask again.

-what should cyl. head temp be?

-what should oil temp be?

-what should oil pressure be?


as always, thanks in advance. any answers, insights,
or opinions will be greatly appreciated.

BTW-thanks to Kevin Leahy for answering my question as
far as where and how to hook the gauge up. i still
need the correct readings however. thanks again.
