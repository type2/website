Subject: Bye bye Bus

Hi All,

My first camper, a 1970 westy bought two years ago, goes to
 the crusher today. I striped off everything of value for my other 70 westy,

and traded the camping interior for a 73 Bug. Does anyone know of a resource
as 
wonderful as this list for Bug owners? I'm not a traitor, just expanding my
air-cooled stable.

Thank you

Jeff.
