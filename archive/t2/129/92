Steve
The dimensions for the O ring is 41.5 x 2.5...This will fit Master Cylinders 
from 68 -79, with or without a Servo. Availability is up to you...I would 
suggest a machine shop or any other type of Hydrolic Specialist in your area. 
(Who knows, you may find it at your local Ace Hardware).
Aloha,
Jeff Raven
