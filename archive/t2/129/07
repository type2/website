I guess the point I was attempting to make was, if you can't afford the
proper procedures at this time ( which was suggested ) don't do it it
all, or at best apply something that won't cause any dismay, when the
time comes to do the job right.

Or just leave it for the next owner to fix.

Try axle grease, it will prevent rust, removes easily,
and will surely protect against parking lot dings.
