Subject: Re: [T2] shifter adjustment and tank hose replacement

I found the source of the gas fumes. I put installed a new filler neck 
when I redid the tank. When I dumped gas in the filler hole it was 
leaking from around the base of the new filler neck. The clamp must not 
have seated correctly. The fuel would run down to the hose between the 
tank and filler pipe leading me to think it was bad. I loosend the clamp 
up made sure the pipe was seated and retightened it. No more leak.
As for the bumper, it was NOT a stab at the vendor it came from I use 
them all the time. It was a stab at aftermarket parts in general. Don't 
get me wrong though,if I couldn't find a good used the flimsy ones would 
be on my bus too. All done sniffing gas fumes for now.
