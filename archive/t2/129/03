Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Engine Wiring Harness Wanted 

Calif or Federal version?  It makes a BIG difference. [a quick way to tell:
Cal version has electronic ignition]


>I'm in the process of putting my engine back together for "Blue Eyes" and
have decided that the wiring harness in the engine compartment is so burnt and
has suffered through so many mouse attacks that it would be easier to get a
replacement than fix this one.  Does anyone have one for sale?  My Westy is an
82 model.
