Subject: Leaving for now

Hi Volks!

I've been silently reading, then skimming, then very hastily
looking at, then skipping reading the list for the last couple 
of months; some of you might even remember me from more active 
days, but I cannot handle the volume of mail at the moment.  

Hence, it's goodbye for now.  If any of you have any 
German-specific questions or problems, feel free to e-mail me.  

I hope to rejoin y'all at some later point in time.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
