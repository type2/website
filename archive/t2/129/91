Hey Y'All!
This may be kind of a Friday post, but I am going to be away from the computer all day Friday, so here goes:
I am now taking orders for "official" event T-shirts for the Second Annual VW Buses 'n Boats Event in Ohio this May. Shirts cost $12 bucks each, and I will be donating $1.50 to the Type2 and Vintagebus lists support fund for EVERY shirt sold, so it's a good cause!  Even if you are not attending, it's still a pretty cool shirt to have. Pictures of the design and pre-order information are available at

Thanks for your time!



Peace, John Baker
