Welcome to the wonderful world of "can o'worms"!  I am sorry to say that
you have just opened a BIG one!

The early and late starters, bellhousings, flywheels, etc. work and play
*very* poorly with each other, this I know from vast and sad experiences.
Even if you could fit a starter from a '73 (which would fit the bell
housing), the odds that the teeth would engage the flywheel are low (I
don't know, but I would bet against it).  Also, you say it all fits...
have you checked clutch engagement? pushed on the clutch pedal ad tried to
shift gears?  Again, I don't *know*, but, again, I would bet it either
won't engage or won't disengage.  Different years had different numbers of
teeth on the flywheel and different diameters of flywheel.  They also had
different depths of bell housing, different lengths of input shaft,
different offset of teeth on the flywheel, different pressure plates,
etc., etc., etc.

With a '71 bus, you are limited to T1 flywheels in your choice of
flywheels.  The T4 flywheels fasten to the crank with a different system
and cannot be used on a T1 engine.  So, unless you want to equip a T4
engine with a bug-stype shroud (do-able, but an even *bigger* can
o'worms!), that T1 flywheel has to be the limiting factor,

What you need to do is to assemble and install a compatible set of
flywheel/pressure plate/bell housing/input shaft/starter. Since you are
starting with a '71 body, I would go for a '71 solution.  First, this
minimizes problems down the road, both for you and for future owners.
Second, you *probably* already have all the correct pieces, presuming you
still have the old trans and that all the bits used to work and play well
together.

I have *not* done this particular operation, but have dealt with many
trans/flywheel/starter/clutch incompatibility issues over the years and
know for absolutely sure that the best solution is to pick a year and
stick to it for all parts.
