Subject: Re: [T2] will someone please help me!!?? - engine heat -

Matty
I have been collecting info on this subject for years...here is what I found:
Official #'s of how hot a typeIV engine (from VW-Industrial Engine Division)  
Oil temp:

  Green Arc...170 - 220
  Yellow Arc...220 - 250
  Red Arc...over 250
  (Range of air temp with full load-85 degrees)

VW Magazine 1984: "260 degrees is not uncommon - with standards of high 
quality, mineral based oil, the rate of oil oxidation doubles every 18 
degrees in temp.   ...   180 -190 degrees is to low a temp. This will reduce 
lubricating efficiancy"

According to Penzoil Tech Rep. oil temp should be optimum (-at-) 210 - 230 degrees.

Oil Pressure:
Start up...75psi
Warm up...40 -65psi
Slight Upgrade...35-55 psi
Headwind...35-45psi
Climbing...30-35psi
Idleing...20psi

Head Temp.
(sender in Sparkplug #3)
0-55mph...275-300
60mph...300-350
65mph +...350-375
Head Temp. should not go above 360 

Gas Octane
Higher Octane gas burns cooller.

Oil Level
Fill dipstick to between high and low mark...never overfill...affects 
lubrication of bearings.

I cannot vouch for the validity of these sources...my personal experiance 
however coincides with these figures.

I don't beleive that oil on the thermastat makes any difference as they 
probably figured this would happen, but I suggest that you test the 
thermastat is boiling water to make sure it "expands" instantly when dipped.
