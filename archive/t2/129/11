Subject: Fixing Sliding Door

I was wondering if I could get some advice on the sliding door on my 70.  It
is stuck.  Actually I tried and tried to open it, couldn't get anything,
forgot about it, and a few minutes later it just popped right open on it's
own.  Kinda spooky really in an airplane hangar at 2am, I just about...
Anyhow, when I slid it back it very nearly got stuck in the full-open
position but after enough pushing I got it to move.  Now that it's closed
again I I haven't had any more ghostly openings of it.  I can't see anything
wrong.  Everything appears to be in great shape.  I do not know anything
about it though since I am new to the bus.  Glen Ward
