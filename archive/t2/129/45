Subject: oily thermostat

hello all,

i checked out my thermostat last weekend. turns out
the little pulley was broken disabling the flaps. i
have ordered all the parts, and i plan to to replace
the entire system, with exeption to the flaps.

heres what i'm wondering. the thermostat was all
coated in oil, from my (for the time being) leaky
engine. will this affect the thermostats operation.
(ie. insulate it from heat). if so, what can i do
about this until i can get the leaks plugged with new
seals and such.

as always thanks in advance. and answers, insights, or
opinions are greatly appreciated. thanks again.



BTW- is it possible to change heads on 76 Type IV
without removing the engine? i've heard it said that
you can, just wanted to get the opinion of the group.
