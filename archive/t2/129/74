Subject: Wiring a tow lighting harness into the bus


 Need some insight on how to wire the lights of a 79 loaf to be towed.

I would prefer not to use external tow lights. I have searched the archive
and cannot find any suggestions, so here goes:

  Where do I hook into the running lights, brake lights and turn signals?

  At the fuse box? Or at the switch? or ....? Any special hints or advice?

  Any guidance would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Chuck Harvey
79 Sunroof (Sheba)
