Bill,

I used the napa hose when I redid my 78.

It is very stiff, but if you cut it on a bias on the tank end

\---------------------

   \------------------

put it in hot water before installling and use plenty of your favorite
lubricant, you actually slide it around pretty well.  I also used "real"
worm gear clamps instead of the phillips head originals.  Last time I 
filled it up, I deliberately topped it off to see if it would leak.

No problems, no gas smell.

I *did* take out the ecu so I could hold the metal pipe from the
filler while I twisted it around to get on the tank.


Hope this helps, Dave
