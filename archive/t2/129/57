Jim, 

I don't have my later bug manual in front of me, but I'm going to take
stab at this for you.  Subject to correction by the more informed...

Before we go any further.  You need to confirm how what terminals you
have on your alternator, or a part number marked on the alternator.  I
don't think it has been established for sure that you don't have an
internal regulator and therefore need the external one.  My internal
regulator alternator is something like a AL82X and has two terminals
plus a ground.  One is the large lug with nut marked as B+ and the other
is a push-on marked (I believe) 61.  B+ (BIG RED WIRE) goes to battery
and 61 (thin BLUE wire) goes to the idiot light.  If you have a DF and a
D+ (lug?) terminals, then I think that would indicate an external
regulator alternator. That one should be marked AL75X

This would be correct if it's an internal regulator.  It is the wire
that charges the battery and supplies the rest of the system when the
alternator is carrying the load. However, it it's an external regulator,
neither of the terminals go to battery.  Both go to matching terminals
on the regulator.

The numbers with circles around them on the wire diagram go to the test
plug (T20) and a black wire with the number 14 is the correct one for
B+. The note on the wire diagram is under the title "Test network".

If you have an external regulator, then the idiot light (little blue
wire) goes to the regulator "61" connection.

Don't worry, it probably wouldn't help a lot, even for reading the
diagrams.  Different language than my electronics. (now 27 years
experience).


Good luck and ask if this raises more questions.  I'll give it a try.
