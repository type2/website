Hi Glen,

Take the panel off the inside of the sliding door. You will find a cable
connecting the handle to the rear latch with a tensioning adjuster bolt near
the rear latch mechanism. The problem is most likely that the tensioning
bolt has loosened off and the rear cable has gone slack, or is twisted and
binding somehow. It should be easy to sort where the issue is once you have
the panel off.

Happy trails,
