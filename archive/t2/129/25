I agree with everything Steve said about parts swapping, but if you had the 
091 trans in your bus and if it was running and starting properly, then my 
guess is that you should be able to use the 73 tranny if you get the 
starter that goes with it.  The bellhousings are indeed different.  I 
haven't done this swap either though, so no guarantees.
