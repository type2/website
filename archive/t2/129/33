David,
Miller's site has been down for quite some time now, just a message saying that
the site is Temporarily Unavailable, check back later.  If you decide to go CIS,
I'll be happy to guide you along.  Also, ronnie has a CIS project on the table
and was telling me that given the right VW/Audi part numbers you can select the
right length hoses right off the shelf and cheap too.  That was the most
expensive part of the whole deal for me having Gary hand fabricate each hose to
the correct length.

Oh yea, the MegaSquirt FI is tunable and should work fine on the TIV.  I have an
efi332 system that is being "slowly" put together as time allows.  The goal is
individually fired injectors, Coil On Plug, and a turbo sitting down there.
That's the next engine I'll play around with once the Jag is done.  The CIS
doesn't have enough control for me to feel comfortable putting it with a turbo on
the aircooled.  Even though there were some Audi CIS Turbo's out there, if I go
turbo, I'd like to be able to control & monitor all the variables.
