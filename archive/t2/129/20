Subject: Altenator 

Hopefully these will be the last questions regarding my Volt reg and
altenator. I have had several Volks help me out so far and I am very
grateful. This is such a wonderful resource. So for those of you with
altenators with the external VR, Please take a look under the hood and help
me out one more time.

What are the 2 wires on the B+ terminal on the altenator?
One is a heavy gauge Red & White wire - I am told and am pretty sure it goes
to the POS Battery, but do I wire it directly?

The other is a small black wire - I have no idea about this one. I thought
it was for the light in the speedo, but the wire for the light appears to
plug in by the VR (in a connector on the D+ wire) and not the Alt. Also on
the wiring diagram I looked at for a 74 Beetle, it has a 14 in an orange
cirlce at the other end. I do not know what that orange circle refers to.

Lastly, am I correct about where the wire plugs in for the idiot light? In
the connector for the D+ wire.

I really should have paid more attention in my electronics classes.
PLEASE HELP.
Later,
Jim
