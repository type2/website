You will not find many lovers of GEX anything on this list. For good reasons. 
Me too.
And...yes, you can pull  out  either Mech. lifters or Hyd. lifters 
easily...usually a strong magnet will do it, just remove the pushrods and 
tubes and pull em.  Don't forget to install new Viton seals properly before 
reinstalling lifters and tubes.
And...based on your recent inquireies I suggest you get the Bentley Manual, 
and the Idiout guide by John Muir...and the Haynes Manual...these will answer 
alot of your questions and give you solid procedures for 80% of your needs 
VWISE.
