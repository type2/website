Subject: 74 rear brake shoes and Central FL parts dealers

I'm trying to get my rear brakes straightened out on my '74 Westy. The
shoes have the e-brakearm rivetted to the shoe, not attached with a pin and clip. I can't seem
to find anyreplacement shoes with the e-brake arm attached similarly. I drilled one
off but I haven'tbeen happy with anything I've found to attach it to the new shoe. Anyone
have anyideas?

Also, I'm heading to Florida today - my first 500+ mile trip in the bus
(I've done afew 200 mile trips but nothing this long). I'm heading to KSC to see the
shuttle go up tomorrow(albeit without the bus, which will be up on stands at my parents with the
rear brakes tornapart). I need to find a parts dealer between Ocala and Kennedy Space
Center that stocks thebrake shoes, new adjuster screws (at least one of mine is bent all to
crud), rebuild kits forthe rear brake slave cylinders, and a rebuild kit for a Webber prog carb.

A bus graveyard
would work for some of it - I wouldn't mind pulling an entire rear hub and
brake.

Thanks,
