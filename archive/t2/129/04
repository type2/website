> Well said Hal.  I for one appreciate hearing that it's ok NOT to have a pristine bus.  I have a friend who painted his Jimmy with Tremclad Black.  It too passes the 20/20 rule.  Although I don't think I'd do it to my Westy, I've often wondered about spray cans.  I guess it'd be pretty expensive in cans.

I painted my bus with good quality rattle can paint (about $7 a can) if I
recall it took about 3-4 cases.    I did it because I had to keep the van
on the road it was my only ride so I figured out how much I could get done
in a day (a single panel)so the bus was done in 9 days (6 side panels,
each end and the roof)

8 years later it still looks pretty good and touch up is a breeze because
the paint matches all the time, got grafittied year or two back, sanded it
off, hit it with some paint and was on the road the same afternoon, can't
tell where it was done.
