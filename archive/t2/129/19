Subject: Just a note

Hey, what's the list for, if not to share happiness.
So ........

Just a note to let you know Casper is doing well.
The surgery goes better than I could ever hope for.

Casper is a great patient.
What a guy !

Trimmed and fit the weld area yesterday,
and the new piece will fit in with a perfection beyond my wildest imaginations.

Final results will be very acceptable indeed !!
