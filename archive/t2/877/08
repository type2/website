Actually, probably not. The way the type 4 cooling system is designed, the
heat from the oil cooler dumps out of the engine compartment. If you put a
separate oil cooler in, you'd have to mount it somewhere outside the engine
compartment to do any good. And then you run the risk of losing oil due to
rock damage or something. If you mount it inside the engine compartment,
then the heat goes right back through the system heating the cylinders and
pistons. Yuck.

Only affecting one side? Unless there's something wrong with the manifold, I
can't see how it could only affect the 1 and 2 cylinders with a center mount
carb? Maybe someone knows how this can happen?

Get the points and condensor (is the rubber connector square or round?
That'll help getting the right parts..) and see what happens.
