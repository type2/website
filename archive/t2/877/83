Subject: sound dampening

Well, I hate to beat a dead horse but here goes.  I've scoured the  archives and found all kind of products for sound dampening.  But  I need something cheap.  I'm a bit financially embarrased right  now.  I thought about trying truck inner tube material as Mark had  mentioned forming it to replace missing engine tin.  
  
  Does anybody know of any cheap material that could be obtained in a  surplus store or scrap yard that would help.  I don't have to have  complete silence, but anything would be better than nothing.  I  just can't justify $30+ for a 24"x48" sheet (or maybe that was for  two).  Egg cartons?  Shipping beads?  Please, someone  help me out here!  Cheers....KR
