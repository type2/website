I'd like to have my 1981 Autobianchi A112Elite. 900cc with 5 speed. 
Think Italian Mini - well the direct decendant would be an Innocenti 
like my roomate's girlfriend had, but I liked my Autobianchi better.

Anyhow I drove it to Rome and made a sudden u-turn. A Fiat Uno Taxi 
t-boned it. Wisdom: don't drive liek a southern Italian in Rome. In Rome 
do as the Romans do and follow the traffic laws.  I drove it a while 
longer but the strut towers were cracked, the ball joints bad, and one 
day on the autostrada the front brake pads literally flew off... The 
body was rusting away too.  Saw a nice late model there in Lago Patria 
but did not have the funds to buy it.

VW content: I replaced it with a Super Beetle, then an '84 Rabbit 'vert 
(US Spec), then '65 Beetle (TN car purchased in Naples, daily driver for 
a while and now it sits in my TN  shed waiting for attention - it's been 
back and forth across the Atlantic  3 times now),  then '78 Westy 
(current), '97 Cabrio (current). I'll never get rid of the Beetle or the 
Westy. Still love the Cabrio too!
