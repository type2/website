Subject: Re: [T2] oil filters and oil

20/50 might be the way to go, but I've run 40wt for years in the 2 liter
with no ill effects.  In the very hot triple digit weather of Northern Cal
in August/September I even ran 50wt in my 80 Vanagon.

I've used Wix filters for over two decades now.  These are an excellent
quality-made product.  When I can't find Mahle or Mann, I use the Wix
everytime.  I currently use Wix on my 84 Wasserleaker, no oil pressure
problems to speak of.  Do not use Fram! Ever!
YMMV
