In a sense an "air cooled' engine is just as much an "oil cooled" engine.
These engines can get hot, and the Type 4 engines in particular don't like
that much. In my Type 4 engines I have generally run 20W50 in the
spring/winter/fall, and straight 40 weight in the summer (PA, often 85-90
degrees or more).  I had a conversation with a rebuilder many years ago (not
positive but maybe Leonard at AVP?) who pointed out that multi-weight oil's
viscosity will tend to break down over time such that a 10W40 oil ends up
functioning more like a 10 wt oil; hence the potential advantage of
straight-weight oil in climates where cold-weather starting is not an issue.
