Might not hurt to run a quart of Marvel Mystery Oil in with your oil  and go ahead and throw one in the gas tank.   Or some suggest  transmission fluid (in the oil).  Might free up a clog in the oil  cooler.  Cheers....KR

  i am still not sure if i did anything to help but so far so good...
   
   
  yes i was speaking of both sides of the heater box i plugged off and  already had the side that goes into engine bay blocked all along so  that wasnt a concern but i think redoing the battery tray made a world  of difference..
  the air flow can flow through there like its suppose to..
   
  the condensor needs to be replaced but i dont know what condensor to buy...
  also now got to get another new set of points...
  that will make a difference as well... i have a condensor here but cant  match numbers on busdepot site... anyone got a list of condensor  numbers so i can match this one up i got to see if i can use it... ???
   
  will have to pull dizzy later on to see about what the dizzy numbers are and maybe match them that aways....
   
  thanks for al the help will keep updated.. also thinking of installing my external oil cooler i got....
  that will or should help tremendously...
   
  also i did vaccum out in the tiin holes and changed spark plugs .. the  ones that came out #3 and #4 were soot black and numbers #1 and #2 were  light ash grey .. so that means then that 3 and 4 are burning rich and  1 and 2 are burning lean..??
   
  so my carb might honestly be a big problem here also...as i have also thought all along...?
  i have another carb here thats new/r so i might try that and see what  happens..only after i get the condensor straight though...
   
  peace
