Way back when, I was taught to always wipe the
contacts of new points with acetone or use contact
cleaner, as they have a coating from the factory.
Forgot that years ago, but every now and again I have
been reminded with new points not working. It is alson
crucial to clean the area underneath the points
assembly so that it makes good electrical contact.
