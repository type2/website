You sure have great taste Ron!!!

I'll be adding a Fiat 500 to my stable someday I hope... Wish I had 
smuggled the one I owned for a week home in my luggage when I left Italy...

I put ALOT of miles in those Fiat Panorama vans. Almost died in one 
while avoiding a concrete truck making evasive manuvers. We squeeze 
between the truck and the guard rail and he got back in his lane. The 
U.S. Navy used to send 6 of us across Naples, Italy in one of those 
during shift changes or out on patrol. 900cc and six guys... What a 
hoot. Friend got one up on 2 wheels and I've had one airborne for a 
short distance...

Watercooled 900cc engine in the rear with 4 speed manual. Fan is belt 
driven on set off to one side. Sounds very much like a turbine during 
highway driving. Swing axles in the rear. Somewhat tippy... Rear doors 
are hinged in the normal direction not sliding.
