Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop cleaning suggestions

man honestly i have used MR Clean straight out of the bottle and it works wonders... that and the CLR stuff WOW ... and algae isnt good so the mr clean will disinfect that .... also works good on canvas... 
   
  good luck...
  and think about it like this ... it will smell like lemon fresh when done not like clorox or ammonia does...
   
   
  peace

  Planning this weekend to clean my pop top on my westy. It's been years
and I have the prerequisite algae growing on it, etc. I'd love some
suggestions as to what works well to clean the fiberglass.
