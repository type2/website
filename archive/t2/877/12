Hey guys  My high school ride was a 62  23 window that we got for  $25  and 
painted pis yellow.  It didn't have a sliding roof  so  we cut the roof section 
off a donor bus and made clamps to hold it in place. We  would go partying 
and take the roof off and just leave it someplace beside the  road and come back 
a couple of days later and get it back :)  I have seemed  to always keep the 
cars i really like a lot like my 64  356C euro  porsche  later  Mark Dearing
