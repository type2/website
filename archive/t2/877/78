Subject: Re: [T2]HighTop transport and questions

ok how about this... a friend emailed me and said what about taking a empty little john boat type trailer behind me since they are light and the bus wont have problems pulling it... that aways i can lay the top on its top and tote it back...?
   
  that seems very reasonable...
  also he said he deals with shipping etc and to not go that route... these guys think that they can replace it if they break it and it not being a tv or vcr and a hard to find hightop then i say i might just make that drive after all....
   
  after of course i get my heat issue worked out...
   
  now to find a good little boat trailer?????????????????????? any ideas...
   
  peace
