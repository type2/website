I was wondering if this was going to come up about Castrol.
I personally had this problem on a '70 Beetle I used to own,
but it was the cam bearings. I think I may have some around
somewhere. I didnt think anything of it at the time. Years
later I was talking with a neighbor who was big into MGs.
During our chat, he brought up using Castrol and how he
and others had problems with cam bearing wear.  Might have
been a coincience, but it was enough to make me not use
Castrol anymore.  ...just my .02
