hello Arnaud   Well no amout of setting the rings will fix that  will it:)  
When putting these together it is always a good idea to make the  keeper go 
around in a circle before installing the clylinder.  I have seen  a bunch of the 
type 4 circlips come out as they were installed backwards.   The type 1 with 
the round keeper doesn't have a front and back side so I would  guess that you 
didn't get it completely into the groove . rotating it will let  you see that 
it is installed correctly.  The type 4 on the other hand has a  flat side and 
a round side and you always want the flat side facing out. this  applies to 
any circlip type of keeper wheather it is in a motor or tranny or  wherever . 
Think about how a circlip is made , it is stamped thus creating a  flat side and 
a round side. You could use telfon buttons and do away with the  keepers 
altogether but I do not know exactly how long they last as it is  something that 
racers do . I use the keepers and rotate them to check  them.  later and have 
fun  Mark Dearing
