hey Kevin  As far as the tent I don't use a ground cover under  mine,but I 
have found that if you raise the bottom and hook it to the top frames  it will 
dry out quicker and allows you to clean the bottom before putting it up.  I 
have an old army duffle bag that the tent part fits in perfectly and is a lot  
tougher than the OE bag. later and have fun  Mark  dearing
