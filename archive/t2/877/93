I had only had my '79 bus about six months when I had
a head-on with a brand new Ford Probe. It was just
getting on dusk. I was returning from a camping trip
and had unsecured camping equipment just thrown in the
back. When (she) hit me (I was actually stopped) the
camping gear was about chest high all around me. I
first wiggled my toes and it felt like they were
working, but then I remembered the "phantom limb"
stories... Pulled the camping gear out from around
myself so I could rotate around and see if my feet
were, indded still attached! They were and I was
overjoyed. I climbed out the slider and procedded to
survey the situation.

The Probe had bounced off the bus and rolled backwards
accross three lanes of traffic and was sitting in a
heap on the far shoulder. Someone was helping the
injured driver. The car was totally folded up from the
windshield forward (like it's supposed to) and it was
totalled. She did not get enough money from the
insurance company to pay it off (about six months
new).

The point of impact was directly in front of the
drivers seat (bus). The driver door wouldn't open, the
left headlight was pointed to the sky, and just
generally a mess up front.

The Probe driver was home on leave from military. She
spent the night in the hospital. I drove the bus home
and only had to loosen the brake rod 1/8" before
driving it around for estimates.

Had it been a 4WD pickup instead of the Probe, impact
area would have been in a much weaker spot and the
results probably much different, but maybe not (see my
other post on this subject.) -BaH
