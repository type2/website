Subject: Fuel filter woes

This morning the Guac started bucking and cutting out like it did when I was
in California. Sigh.

I pulled the fuel filter and tried backflowing it to flush out any gunk. As
last time, chunks of rubber popped out. After I put it back in it was
better, but still cutting out.

Luckily for me I found another filter in the garage (thanks Troy!) Put it in
and everything's copasetic.

Now I have to figure out where the rubber's coming from. The hoses between
the tank and the filter are still flexible and look good. No brittleness or
stiffness. The only other place I can think of is the filler neck that I
already know needs replaced. I suppose that's it. Sigh.
