Rite Aid sells the best oil in SoCAL. FYI Rite aid also sells the best
ear plugs in Socal (the blue ones) and good beer.

Tonite I'll go buy some awesome  dyno break-in oil right there from
the best shop in SoCal.

The engine rebuilder I talked to says 10-30.
I did oil pressure measurements with 20w50 and wt30 and saw no difference.

oily cheers - Arnaud
