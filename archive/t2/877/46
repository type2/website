Subject: Re: [T2] oil filters and oil

Sorry guys, I had an epiphany.  Seems like I have more and more of  those these days.  He plainly said 'Wix', which I've also sold and  used  for years, but for some reason I saw 'K&N'.  Boy, I need  another  cup of coffee.  And based on Karl's chart, I'm going to start  using 40W  Castrol in the summers.  I don't like changing brands.  The  additives can have adverse reactions.  When I get my 2.0 rebuilt  I'll probably go with Mobil 1.   That's all I put in my  Jags.  I've  pretty much stopped my oil leak, but I don't see any reason to make a  change now.  She seems to like Castrol just fine.  Sorry, my  bad....KR

with no ill effects.  In the very hot triple digit weather of Northern Cal
in August/September I even ran 50wt in my 80 Vanagon.

I've used Wix filters for over two decades now.  These are an excellent
quality-made product.  When I can't find Mahle or Mann, I use the Wix
everytime.  I currently use Wix on my 84 Wasserleaker, no oil pressure
problems to speak of.  Do not use Fram! Ever!
YMMV
