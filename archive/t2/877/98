Speaking of terrorists and busses, you would not believe the number of
people who have approached me regarding the "Back to the Future" movie. I
painted my sunroof kombi blue and white. Anybody know where I can buy big
machine gun or a rocket launcher? (uh oh, i just got added to the CIA's
watch list). Wait, I hear a knock at my door...
