One of the more respected VW engine builders once told
me to stick with the big brands as in Shell or
Chevron...
I have found that on some engines 20-50 worked well
but on another same type engine, the lifters did not
like 20-50 but liked straight 40. I have gone to
lighter to quiet lifters and have gone to heavier to
quiet lifters. It simply doesn't make sense, but some
like it one way, some the other way.

As for lubrication - I stay away from the parafin
based oils like Pennzoil and Quaker State and
generally end up with Chevron or Shell or Valvoline.
The key with an aircooled engine is change it
regularly and use as good a filter as you can get - my
recommendation is WIX. I steer clear of Fram and
Purolator. Carquest and NAPA both have WIX - made
filters in their store-brand line - but not all! 2000
miles is absolute tops for aircooled engine oil. If it
was a watercooled engine and operated at the same temp
all the time, 3000 or more is actually reasonable, but
not aircooled.

If the engine is getting on in years, I add either
Hilton HyPerLube or Power Punch as "viscosity
stabilyzers" both are 100% petroleum.

I live in the northwest and winters are mild, but
definitely cool. I always ran slightly thicker
viscosity in summer than winter. On my last aircooled,
I ran Valvoline Racing 60 - but not in winter! -BaH
