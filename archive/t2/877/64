The nice thing about using a ground cloth is it provides a bit of extra
protection for the tent in case any sharp rocks are missed when clearing the
space.

Another tip for keeping crawlies out of your tent I learned when I was a
Scout leader: Sprinkle Ajax or Comet cleanser all around the tent on the
ground. Bugs hate that stuff and won't cross the line of cleanser.
