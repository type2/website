Arnaud,

Nice thing about a VW is that you can replace one piston and cylinder (don't 
have to rebore an engine block).

If you have circlip piston pin clips, there is a right and wrong way to 
install. One side of the circlip has a sharp edge which should face out 
toward the cylinder wall. I think the theory is that the other, rounded edge 
might allow it to work loose. I've installed quite a few the wrong way and 
never had one come out. I suspect that in most cases of failure the circlip 
was not completely seated in the groove.

My first rebuild will have lasted 1350 miles. R.I.P. first rebuild.

 Something went wrong with #3 piston pin clips. Maybe two were
 installed instead of one ? Maybe it did not clip right in. A mess
 happened in the pin area, grinding on the cylinder wall on both sides.
 There is then enough room for plenty oil to go get burned in the
 combustion chamber. Next time I will assemble alone, whithout trying
 to cheer up a friend at the same time !!
