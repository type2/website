Sure. Just run some hose into a gas can:

Hey, Richard, are you saying / showing that the FI fuel pump can suck gas in
as well as pump gas out?!?!

I thought that gas had to be gravity fed into the fuel pump (via the fuel
filter).  So how high can I have the FI fuel pump above the petro can??  How
about 3 feet??
