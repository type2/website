Subject: steering box ??

 Oh La,
I have a 70' camper, and although i am a mechanic and should know the awnser to this question, i've never felt this particular problem before. 

As I am turning the steering wheel, if feels like it's hmmmm....skipping or binding...sorry for the weird description, it's a little hard to describe, and i know thats important.....but it's the strangest thing. Make believe you are turning the wheel and in the middle of your turning it like skips, like it goes from smooth and hard to almost like not really binding cause it doesn't stop, but it skips i guess is the best word for it. 

It's been like this since i've had it like a year ago, i did adjust the steering box last year, and thought that i did it correctly, but could it be that it's too tight or too loose? Or do they do this when they are low on fluid? that i have yet to check, but will when i attempt to adjust it again on Fri (a day off)

Also could the steering damper cause this feeling? Or is  the steering box on the way out? If so I should keep one on hand.....

I did check the front end when i got it and replaced the tie-rods (complete) so,  nothing should be loose.

Any help appreciated.
peace,
tracy
