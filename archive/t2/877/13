I used to drive an RX3 that had a newer RX7 engine shoved into it.  A real
"wolf in sheep's clothing," it looked like the typical Japanese tin cans of
its era but was FAST!

I also miss my '77 Westy (mostly I miss its gas heater :-), and my Innocenti
Mini Cooper, but the car I think I miss most is the most diminutive, my Fiat
500 (a 2-cylinder aircooled rear-engined "car" that resembles a Beetle that
got shrunk in the wash).  I've been seriously thinking of buying another one
(or maybe a Fiat 900 camper just for the novelty; it looks like a Westy
shrunk down to 1/2 size, but with way to big a poptop).
