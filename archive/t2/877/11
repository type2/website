Subject: Re: [T2] When Bus Owners Strike Back (window Installation)

Hi,

Got the glass today and got it installed.

I was unable to get the glass in from the top down. I was also unable
to get the new window in with the lifter mechanism in place. Instead I
undid the screw and bolt for the vent window and pulled the top of the
vent window back. This indeed does create an opening by which the
lifter mechanism can be removed as per Bentley. Then I removed the
felt window tracks, loaded the glass into the door through the lower
opening, reinstalled the lifter mechanism, reinstalled the vent
window, reinstalled the felt tracks and inner window scraper,
reattached all the necessary bolts and I'm ready to roll.

Mario, I will get that check to cover the shipping costs out to you
tomorrow in the AM. THANK YOU!!

And to the loyal and tireless listees, thanks for all your help. You
folks are the best of the best.



peace
