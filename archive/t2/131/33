Correct, vacuum advance shut-off is used to lower NoX emissions. NoX is formed
when combustion temps exceed 2500 degrees F. On US vehicles it is called
'transmission controled spark'. It started on 1970 vehicles. However, it is
not the installation of air injection systems that affected 74 yr model buses.
It was EGR. By adding a percentage of inert matter, i.e. exhaust gases, the
combustion temps are lowered. Air injection pumps fresh air into the exhaust
ports to lower CO and HC by adding the 3rd thing needed for fire: oxygen. The
exhaust ports have 2: fuel and spark.

Here in Calif, in the early 70's, NoX was addressed on 66 to 70 vehicles by
adding on either a vacuum advance disable kit or on VW's, a STP EGR valve. The
more expensive vacuum advance kit was made by Pure Power and was a real
'transmission controlled spark' system. The CHEAP kit contained two rubber
caps and a sticker you put on the speedo. You removed the vacuum advace hose
and capped both nipples! Most 1970 GM cars were exempt because they had
factory installed 'transmission controlled spark'.
Since VW's only had vacuum advance-only distributors, the only thing you could
install was an EGR valve. You had to drill a hole in the preheat tube, screw a
long pipe in it, screw the EGR valve on it, remove the carb, install a spacer
plate with a nipple on it, install a hose between the valve and the plate,
install a ported vacuum hose to the valve. Even today, I still see remnents of
this POS system on bug engines. It was by STP, which was owned by Grancor,
which was owned by Andy Granatelli.

Are you using the 74 intakes with the EGR valve in each base?
Even if you aren't, you should connect both vacuum hoses to the distributor.
When you are cruising, both vacuums equalize and the spring in the dual vacuum
unit centers the unit. No advance/no retard. This lowers combustion temps and
lowers CO dramatically. As soon as you move the throttle either way, one of
the 2 vacuums act on the dual unit: decel and manifold vacuum overcomes ported
vacuum and gives you retard. Accelerate and ported vacuum overcomes manifold
vacuum and you get advance.
