Hard to say without some experimentation, both with a stock engine and
with a swivel-foot engine.

There also seems to be two different kinds of swivel foot adjusters.  Some
have a captured ball bearing with a flat ground onto one side.  The flat
is the "foot" that bears on the valve.  I've found that these are a bear
to adjust as the ball always rotates in a way that prevents the feeler
guage from entering the gap.

Others seem to have a foot that swivels on a ball attached to the
adjuster.  I've no experience with those, but I'll bet that they are
easier to adjust.

Unless you're running heavy valve springs, I see no pressing reason to use
swivel foot adjusters.  Even if the stock adjusters dimple after a while,
you can just unscrew them and replace them.  I note that the larger
diameter adjusters on the Mexican engines seem to be more resistant to
dimpling than the German adjusters.
