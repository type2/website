Sounds like a little piece of grit hung up inside. Tear it down again. Do 
the dip again. Rinse in hot water. Use about 50psi+ air nozzle to blow 
through all the little holes and jet mounts. Then take apart a piece of 
12-14 gage wire. Use a single strand of wire to poke through all the 
passages you can. Then turn up the air pressure and blow through all the 
passages again.

To be most certain, you must pull the lead plugs to better clean the 
passages and reset the lead plugs. Even so, sometimes even this will not 
resolve a tenacious, unrelenting piece of crud. I have one genuine original 
German 34PICT-3 sitting on the self that I have been at several times and I 
still can't get proper idle circuit flow. I am keeping it in case I can 
think of something else to try.
