Hi Victor,

There is a translation engine on the web that might be of help to you; it's
at:
http://babelfish.altavista.com/

You can copy and paste text into it, or supply a web address and it will
display the whole page translated to or from the language of your choice.

It translated your text to:

   " trailer coupling for VW beetle before year of construction used 1960
   with unsynchron / teilsynchrongertriebe. Unfortunately without vehicle
   identification plate and besides something " deposited ". Mounting
   elements are missing, are however as copying hurry without problems to
   refer "=20

Not sure if that's exact, but it probably gets the gist of things.

For a laugh, try converting poetry or song lyrics from english-german, then
from german-french, and then from french back to english. What you wind up
with is so far out of context it's usually quite funny.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
