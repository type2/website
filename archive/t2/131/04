Subject: Re: [T2] Catalytic Converter

Look on your drivers door post for a sticker. It will be a small emissions
sticker below the big one that has the vin # and builddate on it. It should
say "NON - CATALYST". Fed vehicles are non cats. Look on the back side of the
engine lid. The tune up/ emission sticker will say that it meets USA specs and
has no cat.
If both stickers are missing......shoot whoever repainted the bus! He is
causing all your troubles:)
Cheapest way out is to buy another engine lid with the correct emission
sticker on it!
