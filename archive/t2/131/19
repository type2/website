It will probably still leak a little.  The studs are weak enough as it is, 
with two or three not helping the remaining ones will probably not last long.

Not a chance.  At a bare minimum you will have to remove the exhaust.  Once 
that's done, you can tap the hole from underneath if you are very careful 
about keeping the tap straight.  I wouldn't bother with the 9mm tap, the 
hole being stripped is probably not going to provide enough metal for the 
1mm oversized threads to have adequate strength.  I'd go straight to 8x10mm 
stepped studs, which are available if you look hard enough.  I can say all 
of this with authority as I've performed the operation myself twice now 
(once when I bought the crappy GEX heads, years ago before I knew better, 
and once when I let the Volkswagen dealer replace my heat exchangers and 
they overtorqued the nuts).
