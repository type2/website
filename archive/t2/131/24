Subject: "creak" in rear suspension


The 78 is still running at over 234,000 mi (I'm still thinking about
Everybus) but has a creak in one side that is obvious if you roll around
in the rear bed,  rock the bus from side to side, or lift up the bumper
- hard to tell if it's where the big axle tube meets the swinging flat
plate on the driver side, or at the other end, where the shock is.  When
you lift the bus rear slowly and push it down slowly, the creak is a
series of clicks, about 6 per second.
Any way of telling what this is, or has anyone else noticed such?
