Actually, you will.  See:

The Subaru seems to be the most compatible of conversions, but if I were
going to all that trouble I'd want a later, more powerful version.  Of
course, those aren't so easy to adapt to a baywindow.

I've seen a couple of conversions where the radiator is located in the
left engine bay, drawing air from the left air intake and exhausting it
through the gaps around the engine (no more engine bay seal)  I've also
seen a conversion done with the radiator replacing the engine bay door,
but that one had cooling problems, probably due to lack of shrouding
around the radiator to prevent recirculation.

The ideal seems to be to get a waterboxer vanagon, as it is already set
up for water and can often be bought for a song with a blown engine.
