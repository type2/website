Subject: need bus picture

Folks,
The guy that is admin-ing the 'drive your vw to work
day' advised that if i can get him a bus pic, he'll
make a bus flier to compliment the Beetle flier at
http://www.geocities.com/billberckman/idrove.html 

I don't have any as good as the beetle pic in that
flier.
Didn't want to just steal one off the internet
somewhere..

Anybody got a pic of a bus that looks like the one in
the flier above?  Can i have it?

thanks and pmail me,
clark
