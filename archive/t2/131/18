If you can figure out how to do that, you should patent the process. I 
might pay for a license to use it. The odds on drilling and tapping with 
the precision required is almost nil, and will waste time/money. Without 
the head jigged in a proper drill press, you can't remove the risk of 
failure. If the threads are not dead straight it will put side load on the 
stud and they will crack or you might even not be able to slip the flange 
back on without reaming the holes.

New heads now will be much cheaper in the end than failure by every 
compromise fix, then failure from poorly (cheaply) rebuilt heads and then 
finally new heads in the end to stop the bleedings from failure. For 
absotively, possilutly sure!!!!!!
