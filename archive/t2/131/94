Break out the Bentley again. Start at each Tailight bucket and identify each
wire
on each bucket and trace each one forward and see where it ends up. Check
the colors
up near where they go into the loom in the engine compartment for color
change as
they may have been spliced by a PO.

Do the same with the wires on the Brake Light sensors on the master
cylinder. Trace them
up to the fuse box. Then Finally, open the turn signals and trace each wire
to the
flasher relay. Hopefully you'll find the crossed wires.
