Subject: New Carb install

Thank you to everyone that replied to my tire quest.

Here is another.  I ordered a new 34pict3 carb from BusDepot this morning.
I am told I am running a 30pict3 on a DP1600.  Two part question...  Is
there anything I need to be aware of doing the installation?  Is it a simple
bolt off / bolt on?
Part two...should I notice improvement?  The engine is a new Mexican
longblock with maybe 1200 miles.

Thank you in advance.
