Subject: Fw: [T2] 2L Engine help please

Many thanks to Sean Bartnik,

Sean you were sport on, a valve seat had dropped and that was causing the
problems. Unfortunately
the valve seat had already been repaired (badly) So it looks like I'll have
to buy an exchange unit!

The piston crown had been nicked (by about 3mm) by the valve. I've cleaned
it up with a Dremel, but will this cause
me more problems - should I replace the piston?

Dave, Wales
