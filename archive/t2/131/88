Subject: Pulled case sealing studs

I'm going over my bus engine and discovered that at lease 2 case sealing
studs have stripped threads.
 
One of the studs is right behind the crankcase pulley and the other is
lowest one in back near the bottom of the flywheel.
 
Can these be fixed with threaded inserts or is a new case in order?
