Subject: Tire Size Calculator

>>The standard tire/rim size of T-2, as I 
understand, is 185/82/R14.   If we use 
195/65/15, can anyone please tell how far 
the deviation of Speedo reading would be?   

Here's the link,
http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html, but
you cannot plug in 185-R14, or 185/82/14 or
185/85/14.  (I know some disagree as to what the
implied middle number is.)  You can plug in
195/75/14 and 205/70/14.  The former is often
used as a replacement and is supposed to be
close.  The latter was stock on vanagons with
alloys and is supposed to be close.  You will be
2% or less faster running the 195/65/15.  

If you are looking at all seasons, you will be
also get a tire with a load rating of about 1200
lbs, far far far less than safe.  My family and I
would not ride in your van.  The only reinforced
tires in that size a proper load rating to my
knowledge are nokians.  Agilis is available in
205/65/15 and a great load/speed rating of 102T.
