Oh, he has excess capacity coming out the a**. There's an electric fan on
it. There's also a secondary radiator under the car with a fan on it.

What would work fairly well on an inline 4 is an adaptation of the VW
Quantum's radiator setup. That engine is so long a radiator in its normal
position won't fit in the car, so they've set the engine off to the side
(one halfshaft is longer than the other) and put the radiator next to the
engine.

Hobart Kennedy does say that purging the air out of your coolant lines is
the hardest part of a front-mounted radiator setup. You'd be stuck with this
problem even in a watercooled Vanagon conversion.
