The aspect ratio is the ratio of sidewall width to tread width measured in
percent. As an example, if you have a 70 series tire with a 10" wide tread,
then the sidewall would be 7". 60 series, same 10" tread, 6" sidewall. 50
series, 5" sidewall. And so forth.
A tire with no middle number has an aspect ratio of 82%. Using the same 10"
wide tire as an example, the sidewall would be 8.2". Lets say you have a
choice between two 10" wide tires, one with no middle number and the other a
75 series tire. The height difference would be almost 1". 8.20" - 7.50" x 2 =
.90"
