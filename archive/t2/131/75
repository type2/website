this one is certainly the most attractive, but I'm not happy with the
engineering aspects of the installation.  It does nothing to prevent
recirculation, which is the usual cause of overheating.  I think that the
spare tire arrangement would work fine in motion, but would have problems
when moving slowly or stopped.  I note that he used an extremely efficient
(and expensive) custom radiator, so he might have enough excess capacity
there to overcome recirculation problems.

Another problem is one of vulnerability.  One parking-lot tap and you've
got a major problem with the spare tire radiator.

The engine bay installation I saw was done with a stock radiator from a
japanese car (don't remember which) that pretty much filled the left side
bay with the diagonally mounted radiator.  the radiator was well-sealed
all around and equipped with the fan that came on the radiator.  In order
for air to recirculate to the radiator it would have to go all the way
from the bottom of the engine to the left-side air inlet.  I really liked
this installation as it was inexpensive, efficient, and gave no visible
evidence of the modification from outside the bus.  The coolent lines were
short and didn't need bleeding like long lines to the front of the bus
would.
