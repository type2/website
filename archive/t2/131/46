Subject: Re: [T2] new vs. rebuilt

I totally agree with Doktor Tim on this issue.

A quality rebuild with the right parts will be much better than a *new*
Brazil/Mexico engine.  

I could ramble on the details why, but will save you all the rant.  :)  Read
up on the Hoover posts if you seriously want to learn why.
