Hey,
You can buy the book new. You can go right down to Barnes and Noble or
Viking and buy the same book I have. The only difference is that the =
wiring
diagrams aren't in color, as far as I know. The new ones are around $26. =
The
old ones are more desirable and go for about the same used because of the
color diagrams.
I got mine on Ebay for $20 (buy it now) and that was a steal!! I would =
watch
Ebay or even half.com. I checked and didn't see anything right now though.
Good luck!!!
