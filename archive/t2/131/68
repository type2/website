Jamie,

Unless someone on the FMBC or the type2 list is willing to sell you 
one your best bet is ebay. They can be had for less than $20. If you 
want a new one you can go ahead and buy it as Andrew suggested and 
then download the color wiring diagram from www.vintagebus.com. I did 
this for my 67 and then laminated the color print and kept it in the 
bus.

Good luck.
