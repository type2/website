Subject: trip report, ramblings around California and Nevada


My bus has been quite busy in the last few weeks.  The family took two
trips to see relatives in Atascadero, CA and Carson City, NV

The first trip was a quickie, only 200 miles each way to Atascadero.  We
went up over the Grapevine on I-5 and across CA41 from Lost Hills to Paso
Robles.  We stopped off at Mike's diner in Gorman for breakfast and
enjoyed the perfect weather all the way.

We returned via the coast route (US101) and CA126.  The weather was again
perfect and the trip went well except for the perennial traffic jam in
Santa Barbara.

A week later we set out for Carson City, NV.  This is a much more
ambitious trip of 400+ miles each way over four high Sierra passes on
US395.  We had a mild headwind through the Antelope Valley and stopped at
the Skillet Cafe in Rosamond for Breakfast.  The headwind abated throught
the Owens Valley, and we slowly crawled over the passes.

Carson City was unseasonably warm, and we had a good time playing tourist.
After a week there we headed home and retraced our route.  The passes went
well, but as soon as we hit the Owens valley we encountered stiff
headwinds
that had the throttle to the floor most of the way.  Normally, a tank of
gas will take me from Bishop to home, but in this case we fueled in
Rosamond, 50 miles short of there.  The antelope valley went well and we
took the madness of the 14 freeway in stride.

Including side trips, we put on a little over 1200 miles.  The Mexican
engine didn't use any oil and ran fine the whole way.  It seems to be a
bit behind on hill-climbing power over the mystery motor it replaced, but
that is to be expected of a low-compression engine that runs on any gas
you fill the tank with without complaining.
