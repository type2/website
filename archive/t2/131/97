Subject: FW: Bleeding brakes!

Hello

> I was wondering if anyone can help me.  I have a 73 westfalia.
> 
> I have renewed all the brake lines and flexi hoses.  I have bleed the
> system but can not get any pedal.  If I pump the pedal I get some presure
> but then lose it again.  This makes me think it is probably the master
> cylinder but there was no problem with this before I drained the system.
> 
> Does anyone have any ideas what else it could be? or is everything as I
> thought pointing to the master cylinder?
