Subject: Harbor Freight tans adaptor 

Hi volks, 
A while ago i remember someone saying they had used a 
floor jack tans adaptor to drop there engine.

I have a question for that person or anyone else out 
there who's used one.

Did you use the adaptor to remove just the engine or 
were both engine and trasn removed as one with the 
adapter supporting trans and and addtional jack 
supporting engine?
TIA
