Subject: pilot jet on 34PICT-3

I have been trying for weeks to get my rebuilt 1600DP with stock 34PICT-3
to idle. I just disassembled the carb, dunked it in carb cleaner for an
hour, and reassembled.  No change.

Aftre fiddleing with the usual bypass and volume screws, all to no avail,
I withdrew the pilot jet several turns and for the first time actually got
the engine to idle!

I read that this jet meters gas at idle.  I inspected it and found the four
holes in its tip to be clear.

What does this symptom says about my carb?
What is the function of the steel ball embedded in this jet? Should it move
if pushed with an awl?

Thanks, Jack
