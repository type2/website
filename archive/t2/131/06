Subject: new vs. rebuilt

I'd like some help deciding on a Brazillian / Mexican new engine vs. a 
rebuilt one for my '71.  First priority : long lived reliability. Second: 
money. I'd appreciate feedback from those who've faced this decision before 
and if you've had good experiences with shops/ suppliers, that would be 
helpful too.(I'm an hour north of L.A.)Thanks, Craig
