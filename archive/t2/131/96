You can make a super easy to read color diagram by 
inserting the downladed jpeg into powerpoint. Select one 
section at a time from the main slide(set up to print 
out on 8.5x11 paper) and paste each section into its own 
slide in the same presentation. Now each section is 
blown up to 8.5x11. The printed image is actually 
10x7.5, so you have 4 2.5 inch sctions across and 3 
down. I did this with almost no loss of quality. I'm 
thinking of having the 12 sheets mounted on a poster 
board. Not exactly portable, but I also printed out the 
original slide to slip in the betley.
