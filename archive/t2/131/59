It was another disappointing showing for the Bay window variety.  Only 3 were registered (which didn't include the single cab that Sam shot).  First place went to a '71 sunroof owned by Dave Sample of Redwood City.  Second went to a '76 Westy
with the full plaid treatment owned by Christopher Renz of San Francisco.  Congratulations.

I'm glad I got to meet Sean Bartnik, one of the 3000 spectators at the show.  When I came back to grab something from my Bus he was just kind of hanging out there like he was waiting for me to show up.  He seemed pretty impressed with the
number of cars and people there.  Sorry I couldn't come through with the extra Bus, Sean, for you enter in the show.  Saturday I struggled for 2 hours to get the engine back in.  I've had this problem on occation in the past on other Bays
where it just won't go the last inch.  Oh well, I'll take another stab at it this week.

Another highlight for me was going down to the BYOB (Bring Your Own Bus) event on Saturday where I managed to score a color Adventurewagon brochure copyright 1970.  Unfortunately they don't let Bays into this show (not that for lack of room)
so mine was relagated to the parking lot.
