Made the mistake of ordering the curtain kit from BusDepot who ordered =
them from GoWesty and charged me $10 bucks more than if I had gone =
directly to GoWesty.  Anyway - the kit I ordered has a one-piece front =
windshield curtain that wraps around to cover the driver and passenger =
windows - bummer - the stock ones had 3 individual curtains (one for the =
windshield, one for the driver side, and one for the passenger windows). =
 Also the stock setup - at least what's on my bus (1970 Westphalia), has =
tracks for the driver and passenger side curtains - the kit has snaps - =
double bummer!=20

Also the kit didn't include the bungee card hold downs - any ideas?  And =
I don't seem able to attach the sliders for the curtain track above the =
sliding door to the curtains- again, any ideas?=20

All and all  - I'm really disappointed in the kit I received.  (The gray =
color is butt ugly but that's my fault for ordering it - just a word of =
warning)

Curtain Set, Incl WS, ties, snaps, 68-91 Westy, Specify Tan or Gray and =
Year.         Cost -  $149.95      Part #  232721
