Subject: Dropped Valve Seat

Greetings Volks,

It would appear that I have dropped my #4 intake valve seat in my '71
hardtop camper.  Unfortunately, I don't have anywhere to work on the beast
at present, specifically, I don't have anywhere to drop the engine
and replace the head.  That said, I've been nursing it along and 
doing the valves every morning before I drive her -- especially
given that I've been driving somewhat long stretches (yes, I know
it's not a great idea, but I don't have many options presently).

So, reading Muir, I'm considering "running a quart of diesel" through the
carb in an attempt to reseat the head -- as a temporary solution.

What are people's thoughts on this?  

If I want to do this, should I wait till I only have a gallon or two of
gas left in the tank, dump a 1/4 of a gallon of diesel in and run it
through, or just pour diesel straight into the carb (with a fire 
extinguisher handy)?
