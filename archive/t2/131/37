>>Vauxhall Omega 16inch wheels 205/55 16inch
lowish profile tyres. Better high 
speed stability but it now wanders more on minor 
road imperfections. 

High speed stability?  Ha ha ha ha.  I'll bet it
rides real nice over those "minor road
imperfections" also.  Heck, Civics ride like crap
with those tiny tires, I can only imagine the
ride of a bus with these tires.
