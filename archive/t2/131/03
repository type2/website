I asked a Swiss guy I know to translate this, and here's what he came up
with:

"Used trailer hitch for VW Bug pre-1960 with un-/partly synchronized
transmission. Unfortunately without identification plate. Apart from that, a
bit long in storage (Jim here: he's had it a while). Reinforcement parts are
missing, though can be easily fabricated."
