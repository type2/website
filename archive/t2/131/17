Subject: More Exaust Studs

Now that I have learned how to use my clicker type tourq wrench, I have
some questions.

How bad can this be?  I only stripped 2-3 and each mount has at least one
good stud.
If this really bad, can I re-tap my heads with the 9mm size stud, with out
removing the exchangers?

Thanks
