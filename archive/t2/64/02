Hi ,
Adam here. I normally lurk on the old digest, but I saw a mention of the Fort and a need for habitat so I thought I'd chip in.
Go to a site called www.allcentral.com.
This is a site for a band called ALL. They are a buch of cool guys from Fort Collins, and they happen to have a pretty good fan base there too.
On that site there's a message board, and (hopefully) a "contact us" link.
Now the message board is full of Punks (I mean that in a nice way) and band members rarely go there.
But if you mention on the board your situation you may find something. Also try the"contact us" link. You could try addressing it to Bill, Stephen, Karl, or Chad (the band) and simply state your plea. They've had to live out of busses, I'm sure they may be able to help you do the same.
Good Luck.
Happiness is questing ALL.

Adam
