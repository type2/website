Ed,

If you are unable to afford a vacuum gauge, here is an alternative method
that may work...  (I dunno, I have a gauge and use it regularly)

Open the throttle.
Look down the throat of the carb, flashlight in hand.
If you mentally follow the tube for that vacum port in toward the throat,
  it is going to open into the throat as a hole that will be ~.5mm in
  diameter (really, really small in other words).  Do you see that hole?
Presuming  you see the hole, let the throttle butterfly close.
Do you still see the hole?
  If you see the hole, a couple of thousandths of an inch *above* the
    butterfly, then it is good for the vac advance.
  If you do *not* see the hole, if it is covered by the throttle
    butterfly, then it is no good for vac advance.

If yu do not have a source for vacuum advance on your carb, then you are
stuck with the 009 or 050.  DO NOT hook up the vacuum retard only!!!!  The
vacuum advance/retard distributors were made to meet polution specs at
idle and the vacuum retard only works at idle.  If you hook up that side
only, your performance will be dead flat doggy!

OK? If this does not help, let me know!
