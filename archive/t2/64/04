Subject: Gemmer steering boxes...

Gentlepersons-
                      I'm trying to cross-reference a Gemmer steering box. 
Since
VW's (among others) used this manufacturer, I was curious if any of the
vendors or anyone else (I'm an equal opportunity enquirer...), knew of a
source for Gemmer box #'s and applications.
TIA
