Subject: Re: [T2] Fri--What is it with the dead?

grant,

you have asked the question that i live to answer. i
will tell you what is so interesting about the dead.
they are amazing musicians, who broke down a lot of
walls in the music world. the music is good, real
good. it so varied that there is a song for everybody.
there are a millions of interesting tidbits that i
could relate to you if you really want to know, but
for now, to save this email from being 50 pages long,
i'll hold my tongue. 

the relation to the dead and busses, is dead tour. the
bus is the perfect tour vehicle. not only will it move
7 people from show to show, it will also house them!
plus it is an economical vehicle, which helps when you
are broke and on tour. 

as far as the name grateful dead goes. it is actually
completely random. the dead started as the warlocks,
however i suppose they just weren't feeling that name
so they decided to change it. the name actually came
about as a result of jerry garcia flipping through a
dictionary and randomly putting his finger on two
words. grateful, and dead.

i myself do not really understand what the skulls and
skeletons are all about, but the art is certainly very
cool looking, and as someone with a definate morbid
side i dig them! however, they also offer very nice
and cuddly dancing bears.  hope that helps.

PS- I myself have never seen a dead show or been on
dead tour. i was simply born too late. it bites! 
however i have read and researched extensively, in an
effort to make up for the enigma that i have, and
never will see. plus some of the stuff you find about
these guys is really just hilarious.
