Bless ALL of you and thanks for the VWonderful input I have received
regarding the value of the VW Bus!! When I receive the next update to NADA I
will have some much needed assistance from the list--It really helps.
Another thing is that VW Bus values Vary from where you are located in the
States. All I ask if that when you have a Value on a bus --being sold or
restored --just e-mail the stats to me so I have some input--It takes over
an hour to go through what NADA sends me for updating--They also ask for
sales results-which I try to keep track of from the list and friends--
Bless all of you and thanks--"Keep on Truckin"  , uj
