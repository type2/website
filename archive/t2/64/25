I can't explain a single other thing about those guys, but this one's easy: 
it was a hippie thing. The Dead had a lot to do with drugs and hippies, and 
buses did have a big part in the hippie movement.

I don't get it, personally. I do love the way it shocks people when they 
pull up alongside a big old "hippie van" which is blaring the Sex Pistols, 
though.
