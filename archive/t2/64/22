Hi Rob

I'm not counting on Insurance Co's wanting to help us.

My bet is that if they increase the $$$ value on our buses, they're going to
ask more $$$ for the premiums to cover their increased risk.

And it can also inflate the expectations of the guy with the
rusting-to-pieces westy in his back 40 such that no-one will ever be able to
get him to part with it until it's too far gone for anything but a photo
album and the crusher. We already have too many of those guys in these
parts, asking $2K and up for a bus with more rust than metal. And I'm
talking severe *ONTARIO* rust, where you can put your hand through the frame
members without even pressing hard.

There's a cloud with every silver lining.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
