Drain enough oil off to run a quart of Marvel Mystery oil for 300-500
miles, change the oil, filter and clean the strainer after this running
time.
Gaskets shrink, rubber cracks so after eight years I'd definitely install
new lower injector seals, fuel injector lines and verify that you are
getting good ground to the engine, fuel injectors
It doesn't hurt to run a pint of Marvel Mystery oil in six gallons of gas
to clean your injection system, valves, piston tops and cylinder heads.
My newly rebuilt 2000cc FI Type IV will idle at 800-900 for weeks at a
time but after a long run at 3200 RPMs and 70-75 MPH for several hours it
idles at 1100-1200 RPM until its cooled down once and it reverts back to
the 800-900 and it stays that way until I give it a good hard running
again. I'm guessing it is fuel/air ration that causes this but I just
can't see any problem with it and I'll probably never confront it as a
problem.
