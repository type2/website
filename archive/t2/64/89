Subject: Trans gear oil replacement

Can someone tell me where the gear oil fill opening is on a 71 transmission, and how do I get the oil in there (I assume it's on top of the transmission). After exensive archive research I found that I should use GL-4 90 weight oil, but not the specifics of changing it.  I also had no luck finding this info in my Bentley.
Peace, John Baker
