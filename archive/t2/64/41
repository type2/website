Subject: Winter Storage on Tireless Rims?

Hi Volks,

The cold weather has finally bitten into Toronto, and it'll soon be time to
put the bus away for the winter, before snow and road salt can put their
mark on it.

Unfortunately, the garage I parked the bus in last winter is NLA.
I've considered storing the bus in the single-car garage in my townhouse;
but the new garage door that was installed last week has reduced the ceiling
clearance to 73", whereas my Westfakia measures in at 76" in height.

The suddenly I'm reminded of an Audi Quattro commercial I saw a few years
back.

I have some spare rims that don't have tires on them, and a bus without
tires on would have sufficient clearance to squeeze in under the new door.

Is this going to damage permanently damage the rims? I could put down
carpeting to drive on to protect the bead surface. Two of my spare rims are
rusted enough that I wouldn't miss them, but the other pair I would prefer
not to destroy, they have definite potential for a sandblast and re-spray.
My driveway is asphault, the garage floor is cement. The hardest part in all
of this would be getting over the lip at the outside edge of the garage, but
I think I can bridge that with plywood or something.

If anyone in the Toronto area has some scrap rims for a late-bay they want
rid of, now is a perfect time to see them put to good use, if only from mid
December through late March.

Advice, opinions or flames on this would be appreciated.

Happy trails,
