I have to agree with Greg here.  In fact, I don't really want Busses to be
worth too much(flame suit on).  One of the big drawing cards to owning a Bus
is they are relatively easy to buy and maintain.  And good people abound
that add positively to the Bus experience.  If I want a car that is
expensive to own and maintain, with snobs to deal with and hard to find
parts, I'll go get some other obscure European car.

By the way, did anyone see the 69 Westy on a certain electronic bartering
board?  What a surprise to go through the pictures and see it's had the
Corvair conversion.
