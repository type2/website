Subject: N.A.D.A.Bus Value -Insurance


If there's anyway I can help with this I'd be more than happy.  Here's how
I insured my vw's:

I recently just changed insurance company's & now go through a 'antique
auto insurance'.  This place lets me pick the price I want to invest my
vehicles at!  I put my bus at $10,000 & beetle at $4,500.  Both were
accepted!  The pictures I sent of my bus were not the greatest -primered,
half sanded, etc.  Once I finally finish the resto I'll be putting the
value at $15,000 or more.  Only problem is there is a some restrictions.
(mileage, etc which really sucks, but I don't believe they check that. : )
)  I pay about $150 a year for that insurance (for both vehicles).  If any
of you want to check into it, my local insurance company goes through JC
Taylor (huge company that just does classics).

happy busing,
Keri
