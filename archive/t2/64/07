enough of it is heavy enough.  story time.  many years ago when I was
driving a bus (big intercity type) ran into a snowstorm.  bus just chugged
along and got to my destination.  unloaded and went to return home (empty)

the Bus no went anywhere.  hmmmm. I want to go home, nearby is this front
loader clearing the parking lot.....open luggage bays under the bus and
had front loader fill the luggage compartments up with snow.   close doors
and drive right off....got home with no trouble.  but I forgot to tell the
shop the luggage bays were full of snow.....they put the bus inside over
the shop pit. when they returned the next morning they couldn't figure out
why the pit was full of water???

so to make a long story short, if push comes to shove, fill anything up
with snow and put it in the back of the bus.  just remember to remove the
snow before turning on the heat!
