Subject: #*^&%$*!!!!! sliding door falls off???

So my 79 westy pulled a cute one today. I slid the door back to let my
daughter out, and as we're closing it, the bottom pulls right out of the
track and my daughter is holding a door!!! What's with that? What do I need
to check, apparently the bottom bearing was replaced but I don't know if the
previous owner did it correctly.. What adjustments can you do, etc etc?? I
would appreciate the wisdom, pictures, brains, websites, emails, prayers,
and incantations of the gurus who have been there, done that. :-(
Thanks,
Courtney
