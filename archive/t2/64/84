Subject: removing engine tin from a 73 automatic and thanks

Hello List.

Well, it appears that Type 2 is back on line, well for
the mean time any way. I got tired of looking at my
oil caked engine and decided to do somthing about it.
I have tried cleaning my engine in the past but I was
never very successful at it. I figured that i would
take off all the engine tin and clean and paint each
one. This would let me get the sldge off the cylinders
and oil cooler as well. I had no problem at first. I
removed the tins in the verry back as well as the tin
from the front of the engine compartment. I am having
trouble removing the tins that go directly over the
top of the cylinders, the ones that have holes for the
spark plug wires. My engine is from a 73. This is one
of the years that has EGR ports on each side of the
carberator manifolds. Thes EGR ports seem to be
holding these tins on. How can I remove thes EGR
Ports? Is there some other way to remove the tins on
top of the engine? I am stumped.
I have reomved all of the screw that hold them down.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for all of the
help!!!!
