Better read that policy carefully before driving! Most antique car policies
limit both mileage and when the car can be driven...And, yes, they check.
If it's in an accident, and you try to make a claim, you had better be on 
your way to or from a show or a parade. And, as regards value, check
that you can prove the restoration - pictures and an independant ap-
praisal before declaring value are essential. They don't want to pay de-
clared value on a rust bucket or rolling wreck, so it's up to you to prove
the condition of the car before any accidents.
