Subject: VW Westfalia Breakdown on I 395 Connecticut



There's an orange Westfalia 1974 or later disabled near exit 80 on Interstate 395 in Connecticut.  If anyone is in touch with them you might want to let them know that Budzeck Auto (860-889-3119) probably the nearest shop that will work on air cooled engines.
