Subject: Re: [T2] Fri--What is it with the dead?

I went to see the Dead in 94 at Soldier field.  I am not a fan, per se, but
just wanted to go so I could say I've been.  It was an experience I'll never
ever forget.  Busses lined Soldier Field's parking lot and McCormick place
as far as the eye could see.  And the people, well, the people were as
original as the paintjobs on their Busses.

Traffic opened up for the Dead, the show seemed to last for hours without
the musicians tiring.  And I believe it was Uncle Jerry's last Chicago
performance.
