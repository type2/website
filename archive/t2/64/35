Subject: Re: [T2] Single Cab Weight Distribution

On ya',Chad!
Too many people have obsessions with double cabs,
particularly here in Australia.
You don't know where I could get complete stats or
blue-prints for a 72 single cab?
Another friend over here is considering starting a
site like dropgates.com for bay-windows.
I think they'll all be sorry in 10 or 20 years when
the supply of split window projects have dried up and
then all those resources about bays will be more
impossible to get than the stuff for splits.
:-)
Cheers
