Try your local farm feed supply, one that blends their own feeds. They have
the woven polypropylene bags in the 50 and 100 pound size. These bags are
tough. I make bags like this for a living, but half this size and twice as
strong; they're used for packaging explosives for the mining industry. A
little small for using as sandbags, but talk about tough!
