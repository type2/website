That is normal operation for that door.  Watch your feet, it hurts when 
it lands there.  This is usually a rust problem.  Mine needs the lower 
track replaced, and everything below it.  If you're careful when you 
open and close it, you can learn to use the door without it hitting the 
dirt.  You have to remember not to close it like your neighbor closes 
the door on his (insert trendy name here) minivan.  Just remember to 
love the bus.  And lock the door, so your not so bus minded friends 
don't end up with broken feet.
