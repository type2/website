Subject: Re: [T2] Fri--What is it with the dead?


this thread i cannot pass up.
i sent in a letter to (ahem) a certian Hot &&'s magazine about this same 
topic, as they were saying that grateful dead stickers equal more police 
interest on the roads. I came to the vw scene from the dead scene and found 
that i was in a wierd middle ground. first of all, i can say deadheads love 
the busses for the utility they provide. i slept 7 people in my 77 bus and 
drove 14 people to a show in my 71 bus, for the music. you cant do that in a 
cavalier, or even a jetta for that matter. so, i started to feel funny when 
i was bringing my "nearly show quality" bus to dead shows and parking next 
to busses that, due to all physical laws, should not work. there was a 
tremendous amount of Muir knowledge in those dead show parking lots, so i 
saw a lot of funky aberations. for example, an international harvester 
school bus with a splitty top half and a super B top half both welded on the 
top. i actually got to crawl in there and see the sleeping setup, it was 
much live being in a VW submarine. So, the short version of the story is 
that the dead started touring in 1965 and the busses probably seemed ideal 
for the purpose of following the tour. they are a natural fit and all the 
vw/dead bumper stickers help to put the two together in everyone's 
subconscious. i admit i feel a little like a stereotype when i have the dead 
on in my bus and i pull into a rest area. on the other hand, mabye my button 
up shirt and clean shaven face negates the image. one last thought, the last 
dead show i went to in 1995, i got a ride home from a 20 year deadhead, 
several hundred concert veteran, in his LEXUS! So, there is my friday 
morning sermon.
