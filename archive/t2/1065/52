needing a battery in  BumDuck, Nebraska and the only battery available at the
parts-store/towing-company/wrecking-yard is a Group 24F for a '73 F-250
pick'em-up.  From experience, a 24F is tough to get in there with the cables
hooked up. The terminals end up on the "back" side of the battery from the
point of view of the installer.  However, a group 24 is a perfect fit, both in
size and terminals, and  seems to last longer than the bug-sized battery.
That's the one I  normally use.  ------------------------------

By application,  a group 41 battery is the correct size:





millimeters:
L 293
W 175
H 175
inches: | L 11 3/16
W 6 7/8
H 6 7/8
