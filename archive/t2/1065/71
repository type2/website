I just used the plastic fuel tank off of a dead lawn mower.  It had the 
right size outlet fitting for the VW hose.

With care, you could just put a fuel line into a 1 gallon gas can and feed 
the carb with it.  the pump can suck gas up a fair distance.  Secure 
things well and don't use this for more than reparking the bus.
