Subject: Re: [T2] I found an engine

Hi Steve,

I have had a lot of experience swapping engines and transmissions into
the westfakia. I started with a 1.7L dual carb, moved to a 1.8; then a
2L/dual carb; then a 1.8FI; then a 1.8 dual carb for a few months, now I
am running a 1.7FI engine.

The main problem with a 1.8FI longblock is that it doesn't have a 
mechanical fuel pump. It also has smaller intake valves than the 1.8L 
carbed heads. You can ignore the valves, but it won't run as-is unless 
you add an electric fuel pump.

It's not impossible that your heads or the heads on the bustedbus motor 
have been swapped at one time or another, I am merely referencing the 
original configuration. But if all that's wrong with your engine is a 
thrown rod then you probably should keep the heads; they can be 
refurbished and reused some time in the future.


Happy Trails,
