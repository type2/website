I will first clarify, I did not "buy" a bernie bergmann motor. I was lucky
enough to have received one from a very kind aquaintence after he started to
have problems with it. He was older, this motor had given him thousands of
trouble free miles, and he wasn't prepared to fix it. He bought another
bergmann, and I got the old one.

On inspection here's what I found.
1. Counterweighted crank, with the journals still very well within tolerance.
2. The rods had markings that seemed to indicate that they had been balanced.
3. Endplay? No, not really.
4. Deep sump with remote oil filter
5. Hydraulic lifters.
6. Heavy duty rocker set-up. 
7. Burnt up piston on cylinder 3. (head of piston rounded off to the ring, and
then started to collapse.

I put a feeler guage everywhere I could, and checked the tolerances. According
to my book vs. the tolerance numbers, the motor should have been new.

I put a new piston, cylinder, heads, and top-end on it. I drive it to work (a
long haul) daily. I am not a smart driver, I drive that bus at 70mph most of
the drive. It hold just under 350. 

I've never seen another Bergmann, but I can attest that this motor was built
extremely well. As for "fancy colours", mine was/is black. (Which is a good
colour according to the folks that fly these motors in their planes.)

YMMV, FWIW, add your own,

A current post is asking about GEX engines, and has recieved the usual
warnings, but has anyone ever purchased a Bernie Bergmann motor? He
advertises
in gorgeous colors in the usual VW rags, but I've NEVER heard any feedback
from anyone. Just curious. Typically Type 1 motors.
