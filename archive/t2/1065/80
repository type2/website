In virtually every case, we and OEVeedub source our rubber from the same
suppliers - as the case with this particular seal. (The same cannot be said
of other suppliers, who often buy from the lowest bidder.)  That said, our
markup tends to be a bit lower. In this case, their price is $64.95, and
ours is $56.95 (with your Type 2 List discount; pm me if you don't know
about it).  That difference is quite typical.
