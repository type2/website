I've seen a muffler that is very similar to the 74 setup but the trapezoidal
mounting points were upside down.  This meant that the indention for the oil
filler spout was on the wrong side.  I have no idea what application this
muffler fit.

Is there a muffler with the double hole at each end different from the
74 setup?
