Subject: Re: [T2] temporary auxiliary fuel tank

Hey all,

Thanks for the tips. I ended up with a 3 gallon marine tank, which
unfortunately cost 35 bucks. But I can always use a spare for the boat. I
bought an extra filler cap (another 10) and drilled out the vent and put a
barb fitting in it for the return. Now I wish I had put a T in the line, but
I wasn't sure I could do that until I read the other posts this morning. We
wired the tank between the rails under the body of the bus. It took a bit of
cranking to get the fuel system loaded up, but now that it is it suctions
out just fine. We are starting on the bodywork this week, beginning with the
nose.

Thanks again for the recommendations.

Ned
