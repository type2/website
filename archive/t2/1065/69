Subject: Headlight issues...

Ok Y'all, this is actually a 68 bug question HOWEVER I know that the headlight system on this era bug is basically the same as on a baywindow bus as far as having basically the same switch, dimmer, and flasher, so some of you may know the answer (does that count as "mandatory bus content?  I think so!)
Anyway, I have working turn signals front and back, working emergency flashers front and back, and working brake lights.  BUT I have no headlights or running lights in the rear. Soooooo, where is my problem likely?  I am 100% sure everything is wired up correctly I must have gone over the wiring diagram 1000 times.  I know that the headlight bulbs are good (they are brand new).  I have tried 2 different headlight switches (although they were both old so no guarantee either is good as well as 2 old dimmer relays sames as headlight switches).
Soooo, is the dimmer switch on the turn signal tree\switch the only thing left???

PEACE!
