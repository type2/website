Yep, I had one of these, too. Picked up at a camp-out for cheap,  
painted it silver, tried to mount it and did not work. I then re-sold  
it another camp-out making it perfectly clear that the flanges needed  
to be flipped (requiring a welder) or re-drilled for different stud  
orientation. If yours is a OEM VW one with shiny silver high temp  
paint - my muffler may have found its way to you ....

It had a Vanagon part number (though that should fit - mufflers  
stayed the same 72-82 in Europe). My only explanation was lousy  
quality control and an apprentice at work when they made it on a  
Friday afternoon or Monday morning.

Here is an idea (I was planning that): cut the flanges off the old  
one and weld them on the new muffler's flanges in proper orientation.  
It should work and be considerably cheaper than another quality  
muffler. Easy work for a muffler shop.
