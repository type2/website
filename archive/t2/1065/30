Hi Troy,

Interesting... Living down here near 250 ft above sea level I wouldn't 
call 100 PSI good... Good in my book is more like 120 or so.

 From what I have seen 100PSI usually indicates an engine (or 
piston/ring/cylinder getting close to the end of its life cycle. At 
90PSI you will see serious issues in the state of tune. As always, YMMV.

But I didn't consider the effect of the difference in altitude between 
me and BustedBus (about a mile or so, give or take) until now.

Happy Trails,
