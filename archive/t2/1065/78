If they aren't makin' noise, just clean 'em out and put new grease and 
boots.

Get some vanagon backing plates and drums from the junkyard and a couple 
new wheel cylinders and pads and enjoy not having to adjust your drum 
brakes anymore.  If you can afford the ball joints, I'd do that first 
cuz this is a pretty cheap upgrade.

If you can afford to do this, do it.  However, when I went in to have 
all 4 joints replaced, they ended up having to replace some broken leaf 
springs and I also had to have tie rods replaced, too.  Total cost was 
around $800.
