CIP doesn't seem to have the diagrams anymore (snuck in a backdoor.)  The Bus
boys page for the '79 only CA shows the overall system layout.  Again, anyone
looking for a '79 only L CA NOS heater box email me (NLA there and CIP I
see.)  Anyway the diagram does not show the under tins.  The thing to
recognize that L side tin as I recall is a little punched relief for the
header tube that points towards the BACK of the bus, sort of in the center of
the tin, dipped down and pointing back about 2" wide, an inch deep,  into the
tin for 4-5 inches.  A pic would do 1000 words here, someone must have one
convenient.
