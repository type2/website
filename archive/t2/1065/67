The return line is the same as the rest of the fuel circuit, but if 
you're just trying to run a line to your extra fuel tank, you don't have 
to use anything particularly special because it's not under high pressure.

If you do use other fuel line, I would put lots of tape on it such that 
it doesn't get mixed in with your good fuel lines.  When you do put 
everything back together, make sure you use the same type of fuel line 
(high pressure 7mm) everywhere for longevity's sake.
