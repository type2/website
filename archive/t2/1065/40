Subject: Steering box on the way out FIXED!

I posted about a month ago regarding a peculiar behavior in my  
steering.  There seemed to be a "catch" about every 60 degrees of  
rotation.  I ordered a rebuilt one (plus a coupling) and installed it  
today.

A pickle fork did not work, so I went to the FLAPS and borrowed a  
pitman arm puller.  POP! - pulled it right off.

Bentley helped a little, but I mostly learned a lot from my mistakes.

Now my steering is smoooooooth.  Now if I can rearrange my call  
schedule, I'm stoked for Mountain Bus, February 20th.
