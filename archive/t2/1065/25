on any used engine you need a leakdown and compression test,  
regardless of where the engine is coming from. i know chris / 
bustredbus also and he's a square dealer but it doesn't matter who's  
selling the engine, the tests need to be in hand or you're flying  
blind. $1K is a decent price if the engine is good, but it's hardly  
chump change. you can't operate on faith when buying a used engine,  
you need facts.
