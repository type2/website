Subject: Oil change first, THEN...

wash bus. I did it backwards and had to spend 20 minutes cleaning up the
handprints on the bumper. heh.

I did manage to take another look at my new battery. I found out why it's
longer than my 47 series. It's a 49. Whoops! I musta been looking at the
shelf label for the 47's and grabbed a 49. Oh, well. 1000ca, 850cca. :)

I did get the battery in there, but have to relocate the charcoal canister.
I'm wondering if I shouldn't relocate it to the other side of the engine
compartment. But the 49 fits:

Doing the oil change I found my oil was foamed up:

I'm figuring the huge temp swings we've had lately have dumped some
condensation in there. That or I've been overfilling and the oil's frothing.


Go me. ;)
