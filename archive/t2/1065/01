That 15k miles not 15 miles on the GEX. Not meant to be a joke but when you
read it - it's funny.

I bought a 71 Westy with a rebuilt 1600 DP GEX engine (500 miles on it) and
I ran it for about 15 miles with no problems other than it ran hot (I live
in Houston duh) . Amazed it did not leak any oil. I bought a 1600 DP from
Boston Bob and have 2k miles on it so far and it's fine. I heard they are
still making engines at Boston Engine. RIP Bob.

ON another note - I wanted to build an engine myself and use the GEX case I
had it checked out, it has been bored to 80 thousands. Not good.
