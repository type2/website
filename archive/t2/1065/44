Hey Chris,
Just to make sure, did you fill it with gear oil?  It will go bad in 
short order if it's dry.

Btw, for those of you looking to fix a broken box, you can get used 
steering boxes pretty cheap on thesamba.  I ordered a used one from a 
guy and paid $70 after shipping and it's smooth as butter.  The hardest 
part is pulling off the arm.  I went over to my mechanic and he used an 
airhammer to pop it off, but a puller will do the trick, too.  I used 
the arm that came with the used box as I didn't want the one with the 
air-hammer marks.  I did purchase a 2/3-arm puller and that might have 
possibly been able to pull it off... not totally sure, though.

One thing - make sure that you center the steering box (there's a notch 
that lines up) and that should center the wheels.  If you don't do this 
correctly, you'll hit the internal stops instead of the steering stops 
and that couldn't be good for the box.

Plus, make sure you pick the correct mark on the box shaft for L or R 
steering wheel setups.

Mike
