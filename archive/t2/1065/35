Subject: CHT Thermocouples

Hi, I installed a thermocouple ring under my sparkplug quite awhile ago...and
I sense...it must have been from 'that' German company...and it is nicely
nestled into position...now I have purchased a Dakota CHT gauge with wire and
sender..and upon 'pain of death', they state that 'theirs' is the only one to
use with their gauge...so..I am wondering...what the difference in readings
can be between thermocouples..since they are inanimate...and don't know their
host...gauge, and whether I am going to have to tear all of the sheet tin off,
to get at that spark plug to reinstall the new one..or just hook up my
existing leads from one in right now?  Cheers.
