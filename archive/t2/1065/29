IMHO, I think those compression numbers are pretty good.  As far as how much life is left in it,
that will be hard to tell, given the info you have, or don't have.  As mentioned before, a leak
down test would help determine the health even better.  But I would keep in mind the possibility
(maybe likelihood?) that the engine may not have always been kept tuned up.  Did it run with low
oil levels, or timing that was too advanced, or valves that were out of adjustment, or plugs that
were gaped incorrectly?

Running under any of those conditions will contribute to the rate of wear on the engine.  I guess
my point is that unless you have maintained the engine from the time it was built, it's going to
be hard to tell how much life it has left in it.  I'm not trying to tell you that you shouldn't
buy it (chris is one of the few on my short list of people that I would buy an engine from,) but
rather, help you understand the reality that many of us here have come to know.

Peace, Troy
