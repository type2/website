Subject: Muffler query re 74 setup vs later crossover pipe

Daughter's 75 has the 74 setup with heater boxes/ex manifold in one,
with 2 holes/trapezoid flange on each HE.  It needs a muffler and I had
one bought at a campout visit to a VW shop years ago, with the exhaust
tailpipe at the right and the 2hole flanges at each end.   I gave it to
a VW shop to put on.  They claim it does not match and ordered an over
$200 one (the OEM one I hope for that price)- I asked over the phone,
and it seems this one is for attachment to the crossover system non
extant on this bus or even my 78, which bolts right to the u-pipe single
hole flange. Something was said about turning it upside down may have
worked, but the tailpipe is welded on and thus can't be flipped.  My
review of Atwell's microfiche site shows a base down trapezoid for the
flange- are'nt they all like that?
Is there a muffler with the double hole at each end different from the
74 setup?
