Subject: Transaxle mounting ...question?

On my '74 Westy (canadian), the top of the transaxle bellhousing, mounts to a
Frame cross memeber (albeit with holes in it to save weight), but..did all
later transaxles have the same top mount point,...on that "cross member with
the holes in it"..reason being....I was 'surfing" Samba...and it looked like
one newer model did not have same mount.  Was just idly curious.  Cheers.
