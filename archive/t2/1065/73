Hi Ned,

Hi Ned,

I have run a bus from a marine tank, but that was with carbs. We routed 
the fuel line through one of the seatbelt bolt holes.

Last winter I ran FI engine on the workbench with fuel coming from a 
tiny 1.5 liter lawn mower tank. A tee fitting in the line between the 
tank and filter was used to connect the return line. It ran fine. You 
could place the lawn mower tank inside the engine bay or up inside the 
rear cargo hatch; it'd work fine.


Happy Trails,
