Subject: Re: [T2] temporary auxiliary fuel tank

Yeah, it is FI. It's a 78 2.0L (a Boston Bob engine).So I'll need a return
line. Can the can be below the fuel pump, or does it have to be above?
Didn't Timo do something like this when he was having problems with
dissolving filler line? Scott, what do you use for a fuel cell?

Thanks again.

Ned
