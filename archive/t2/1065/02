Subject: Re: [T2] GEX is bad because ...

I got a blown parter engine from Bus Depot like 6+ yrs back- remember 
that the heads were stamped GEX and had cracks extending into the valve 
seats; they were VW heads and appeared to be recut. Amazing they are 
still in business.

- So. Why should I stay away from GEX engines?
