Subject: Re: [T2] Vent Wing Rubber - How to get it out or where to buy

Hi Paul,

AFAIK that rubber is either NLA or just plain stupid expensive. The vent 
wing is a terrible rust magnet, so a lot of people replace the vent wing 
window with a solid glass window from a parts bus; that seal is readily 
available and not at all expensive.

The downside is that you don't get quite so much ventilation. The other 
option is to try to find a set of jalousie windows from a westfalia or 
to find a set of 78-79 sliding windows.

Happy Trails,
