The Navy ruined me that way. Most bases had/have a "hobby shop" where lifts 
and tools can be rented cheap. I MISS being able to work under my vehicles on 
a lift. Especially the two post double arm lifts. 

A lift and a high ceiling garage is on my to-do list when I get rich someday. 
(in about 253 years now... Thanks Wal-Street...<sarcasm>)

Seriously I had a chance to buy a lift for $800 a few years ago but skipped it 
b/c I had no hope of having a suitable garage in the next 15 years. Having 
the kit laying around would have been torture. <griN!>

Thanks to all for some great temp gas tank suggestions. Not my thread but will 
need a temp tank one of these days soon. C'mon warm weather...
