In my search for a '74 engine I contacted Boston Engine and got this reply:

"Sorry to say we are not currently building the 2.0L air-cooled engines. I still need to update the Boston Engine price list.

Boston Bob's engine assembler for the last 10 years is trying to keep things going with bug engines and 2.1L water-boxers; the engines he knows best. Hopefully we'll be doing the 2.0L again, but not at the moment.
