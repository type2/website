Removing S-boots, taking off the air filter, turning on the ignition is 
a bit of a bother- I have a 6 ft wire with an alligator clip at each 
end-lie under, clip to fuel pump, touch to battery terminal (either by 
starter or above and it whirrs away; in our bus you can hear the gas 
returning from the pressure regulator.


- You can also just remove the s-boot and reach in and activate the flap
  without taking the filter off.  You can open the fuel rail just a little
  bit and tell then it's primed.
