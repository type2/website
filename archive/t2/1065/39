That simplifies their tech support.

Their CHT guage uses a k-type thermocouple. AFIAK this is the only  
type used with automotive gauges. I bought a lot of thermocouple wire  
a couple of years back for some temp experiments and made my own  
cable. You should be fine.

You can boil some water and test your thermocouple/gauge against the  
212F reference temp.

Dakota sells VDO senders with their products...
