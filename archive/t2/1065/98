Subject: Pressure in the fuel tank

Should there be any?  I've noticed that after driving around (in town  
or longer highway runs,) there is a lot of pressure released when I  
open the gas cap.  I've tried to associate it with the outside  
temperature but it happens when its cooler as well.  I've never  
experienced this with my '78 bus.  The culprit bus here is a '74 auto  
with a '78 FI engine.  Is this common?

Peace, Troy
