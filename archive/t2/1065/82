Subject: Re: [T2] temporary auxiliary fuel tank

Hi Ned,
I did in fact use a marine tank to get back from Sweden to Germany. Using a
tank designed to feed a running engine is IMHO a lot safer than just a spare
canister. It costs about 20 Euros, has a secure breather opening, a fuel meter
and a hand pump. I routed it through the drain hole in the spare tire well and
from there to the right of the engine compartment and then through one of the
rubber grommets to get to the fuel pump. Ran fine for 1500 miles.
My bus has a carb engine, so you obviously need a return line, as others
pointed out. On a friend's FI bus we used the same marine tank and a tee
fitting between the pump and tank. It was fine for driving in and out of the
garage, but I wouldn't drive with this setup for even a mile.
Cheers,
Timo
