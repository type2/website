Subject: I found an engine

Busted Bus has a 1975, 1800 longblock that Chris says will work in my 1974.  Its fuel injected (mine's dual carb) but all that stuff is coming off(?) so its the same engine(?).  He sounds very knowledgeable and I'm not :( so I'll have a little faith and get it.  The price sounds fair at about $1,000.  It runs and he says it has 75k on it.  Its a VW, I guess meaning not a GEX or other rebuild.  Opinions??  

On another note, should I keep the bad engine?  I've been told that it threw a rod and the mechanic thought the core would be shot.  I'm rather mechanically challenged but was wondering if maybe it would have some value to someone?  Maybe somebody that rebuilds engines could use it?  Or do I just let the mechanics dispose of it?

Thanks for your input while I was deciding between a used engine or spending more money and going with a GEX.  No need to comment on that one, not going with a GEX :)
