I don't think the VW's fuel system is fragile at all.  I think old fuel 
lines are very fragile.  If you keep the system in top shape, you won't 
have fuel leaks.  Many people, however, don't change their lines and 
that's when you have a problem.

Why?  The fuel pump turns off when the engine stops running.  If you're 
gonna go through this much trouble to add an after-market device that 
might fail (or leak) and cause you more headaches, why not take the time 
to inspect the rest of the fuel system and bring it back to stock spec 
so it will last you another 20 years.

It's kinda like the hot-start relay - I thought I needed it until I 
realized that it didn't help my poor starting.  Installing new wires 
fixed the starting problem.

Don't get me wrong, it doesn't hurt to be paranoid about fuel systems 
(and I am), but I think most fires are cause by cracked lines after the 
pump.  I'm extremely religious about changing and maintaining the fuel 
lines and that would be my first recommendation before adding additional 
systems which may or may not even make a difference.
