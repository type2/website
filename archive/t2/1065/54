Yup.  But when you're needing a battery (like I was) and you're in  
the boonies (like I was), one sometimes has to take the only battery  
available that has a snowball's chance of fitting and getting you  
down the road .. like I did with the 24E several years ago.

I've got a 41 in it now, the 24E finally gave up the ghost last  
August (44 months on a 48-month battery, I ain't complaining) and the  
right battery was at the parts store around the corner...
