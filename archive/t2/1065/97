Thanks John and Scott.  The catalytic converter I have is the big one  
and the exhaust setup was described just right by John.  The picture  
is just about exactly what my underside looks like (sans grease, oil,  
etc).  That engine looks sharp!

I'm going to check my tin to see whether it fits as described.  If it  
doesn't I'll probably be in touch with you, Scott, to place an order.

Speaking or orders, I also need the triangle support bracket shown here:

Do you have any of those laying around Scott?  Seeing pictures of  
complete engines really makes me realize how much I'm missing.

Thanks!
Zack
