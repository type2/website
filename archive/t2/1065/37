Yes, the extra wide 3-person bed seat rocks- I parted out TWO 74's and 
put one in our 78 deluxe Westy (minus the fridge) and in daughter's 75 
plain bus, turning it into a camper.  Email me to see the removable 
vanagon seats we put behind the front seats of her bus so she could 
legally carry 6 friends.
