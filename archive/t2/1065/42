There's a lot of batteries that'll physically fit in there as long as  
your cables are long enough.  Which is handy when you wind up needing  
a battery in BumDuck, Nebraska and the only battery available at the  
parts-store/towing-company/wrecking-yard is a Group 24F for a '73  
F-250 pick'em-up.
