Subject: Lower Warm Air Ducts

Hey all,
I have a '79 bus that I'm going to be tearing into shortly to convert  
back to fuel injection (it has a little weber carb on it currently).

The bus is missing the tin that goes below the push rods.  This tin is  
identified in the following diagram and parts list (engine tin  
section) as R and W.  I picked up a couple pieces of tin from a  
wrecking yard recently but I don't know if they're correct for my bus.

http://www.bus-boys.com/aircoolsystem.html

I think my bus is a CA model for two reasons: 1)  The exhaust has an  
O2 sensor (with it's leads clipped); and, 2) The sticker on the engine  
compartment door says "This vehicle conforms to US EPA and California  
regulations applicable to 1979 model year vehicles."

The parts list for bus-boys.com is a little ambiguous about what is  
required for a CA bus.  Part R, (warm air duct, lower left, Used 1979  
CA only) is shown as CA only for 1979.  Part W (warm air duct, lower  
right) isn't even shown for 1979 models.

What should I have under my bus?  What are the differences between  
these pieces of tin between CA and Federal models?  How do I identify  
what I have?

Lastly, does there an exist an archive anywhere that shows exactly  
what tin is needed per model year?

Thanks a million for your help.

Zack
