From experience, a 24F is tough to get in there with the cables hooked up. 
The terminals end up on the "back" side of the battery from the point of 
view of the installer.

However, a group 24 is a perfect fit, both in size and terminals, and 
seems to last longer than the bug-sized battery.  That's the one I 
normally use.
