Thermocouples have a "type" and if the sender type matches the 
thermocouple type, it shouldn't matter.  I used a VDO gauge with a 
sender I got from Aircraft Spruce (non-VDO) and it worked fine.  My 
guess is that their statement is designed to increase their thermocouple 
sales.  DYODD of course.
