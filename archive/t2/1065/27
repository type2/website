Subject: Re: [T2] Up In Smoke!

Darn! not good news, but good we can learn from it!

One thing I found from my Camper fire... btw did require assistance from the
local VFD ... was.. a permantly installed fuel pressure gauge should be one
that is liquid filled.
The normal water pressure style 0-60 psi under $10 gauge failed on me,, just
a tiny little pin hole burst in the vane... that is all it takes to have a
small bonfire... bbq..  excitment you don't need!

I suggest to put a cutoff valve in line with the gauge.. or use a liquid
filled ,, good for vibration continious use style gauge.

replace all your fuel lines

> 3 things to take from this: A fuel pressure gauge permanently installed is
a good thing (on FI engines!); Align those switches and secure them!; and
finally, a battery cut-off (I think) should be mandatory! I put mine on the
battery negative terminal, but a more sensible place would be to make it
accessible from outside the body - in case of a fuel line rupture type of
fire, you would not want to open the engine door but you need to kill the
battery connection to stop the fuel pump from running! On Bus2 I'll likely
add a hinged cover like a fuel filler door to conceal the battery
switch. -BaH
