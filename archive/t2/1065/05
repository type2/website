Subject: Speaking of engines, anyone ever bought a Bernie Bergman motor?

I have had two Bergmann engines. Ran the first for over ten years and
upgraded to a larger engine.
The second is now five years old and going strong. There were never any
oil spots on my driveway.
Bernie is from Germany and runs a one man shop because he does not want
anyone to compromise his work and reputation.
