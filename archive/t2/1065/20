I'll vouch for Chris knowing a thing or two about Volkswagens.  I would ask for sure if it's a
GEX, if that's what your are 'guessing' at, but are concerned about.  This doesn't mean he'll be
able to tell you if it is or not.  Also see if he has any recent compression readings.  This won't
tell you everything by any means, but it can give you some ideas on the state of the engine.

You can learn a thing or two from tearing down an engine.  Ask me how I know ;)  If you have the
means, maybe keep it to help familiarize yourself with the workings.
