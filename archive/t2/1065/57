Subject: temporary auxiliary fuel tank

Hey all,

I'm doing some major work on my bus. One of the problems I'm having is
moving it in and out of the shop as I have some pinholes in the fuel tank,
but I can't get them fixed until I drop the engine and I can't move the bus
if I drop the engine. So I want to use a small portable gas tank to be able
to pull the bus in and out of the workshop. Can the fuel pump pull fuel out
of a small gas can, or does it have to be gravity fed from above? Has anyone
come up with a unique solution? Maybe a portable marine tank?

Thanks in advance,

Ned
