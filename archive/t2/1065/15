Hey John--I guess the obvious place would be to post up your question in
TheSamba Beetle forum? There's more than an archive over there ya know, you
can post up a new question at any time and I bet you'd have your answer in no
time.

Hey Y'all,
There is a ton
of great stuff in the TS library about trouble shooting bus headlight
problems...But is there somewhere I can get the same info except for a bug?? I
have have deduced that I may have a bad dimmer relay, but not really sure.
I
have turn signals and brake light buts No headlights.. ..

PEACE! 
John Baker
