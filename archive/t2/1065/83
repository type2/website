Hi Timo,

My westfakia has an early bay single-outlet fuel tank. When I converted 
to FI in 2004 I put a T fitting on the gas line and connected the single 
line from the tank to the fuel pump and return line. The T was made from 
a right side injector rail cut in half.

This modification adds one more fuel line clamp to the system; other 
than that I can't see the harm in it. I have driven this setup about 
30,000 miles or so without any fuel delivery issues.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
