Subject: What to buy next?

I'll get a couple hundred to spend on the Guac from this year's tax return.

My possibilities are:

New wiring harness (but my hackjob is working fine right now)
New CV joints (the boots have been trashed for a while. I have new boots I
can put on there instead)
New rear drums (at least one is warped beyond the ability to turn. Bus stops
though with the all new front brakes)
New ball joints (it would be nice to not look like I'm drunk when I ain't.
Plus a road trip without my shoulders aching would be wonderful)

I'm really leaning toward the ball joints. There's no workaround for those.
And I think I can slip the drums past the wife this summer. I think if I
replace the CV boots, keep up on the rear brake adjustments, and sacrifice a
few small animals for the wiring harness I can get away with it.

Thoughts?
