Subject: Vent Wing Rubber - How to get it out or where to buy new rubber

Type 2ers-

Recently, I've been stripping my 77 Transporter down to bare metal, sanding,
wire wheeling, welding (poorly), and priming it, getting ready to ship it off
to the body guy. The engine, etc. will probably come out last, because that's
the part I'm least comfortable with (I write software for a living, and read
enough VW manuals to pretend I know what I'm talking about).  One thing I'm
having a hard time with is the vent wing windows in the sliding door and both
driver's side back windows.  I don't want to cut the rubber like I did to get
the other windows out, because I haven't yet found a source for new rubber
for those vent wing windows. One of windows had it's bottom hinge post
rust/rot out, and so I could get it out, but not the rubber.  It's really
rusty in there, it's the last big rust area (still not too bad), so I'd like
to get it out soon.

Can someone either tell me how to get it out or point me to a decent spot to
buy the vent wing rubber (so I feel comfortable just cutting it out).
