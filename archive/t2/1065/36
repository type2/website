Subject: Re: [T2] I found an engine - altitude calculation

This is more info than anyone probably needs, but hey it's my $1,000 so I'm trying to figure it out :))

This is very helpful, because like you said later in your post, there is a significant altitude difference.  

I can't find the actual equation for compression relating to altitude, but I did find this one for horsepower: http://2.3liter.com/Calc2.htm#BasAltCal  Of course, who knows if the guy that wrote the equation knows what he's talking about :)

I know next to nothing about how an engine really works, but it seems to me that compression has got to somehow be related to horsepower, though there are other factors I'm sure.  So anyway, choosing 50HP as a random number, a change from 250 feet up to 7500 according to the calculator a change in HP from 50 down to 38 ... or a change of 24%  

If my logic is right, would that take Chris's 100-110 compression up to an acceptable 124-136 at 250 feet.  Even if we said he was doing the check in Denver (5280) that would be a change of 9HP, or 18% ... boosting the 250 ft elevation compression up to 118-129.

I also found this:  http://www.gregsengine.com/compress.htm

"There are factors to compensate for the different altitudes and the corresponding temperature differences. These are as follows: 1000' = .9711, 2000' = .9428, 3000' = .9151, 4000' = .8881, 5000' = .8617, 6000' = .8359, 7000' = .8106, 8000' = .7860. 

The equivalent compression reading for a cylinder that should be 135 PSI [at sea level] by the data at 5000' would be 135 x .8617 = 116.33."

That's really comes out close to the HP analogy.

I'll ask Chris at BustedBus about the altitude angle tomorrow.

Thanks for the feedback guys,
Steve
