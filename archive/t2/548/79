Subject: Why I drive a VW bus...

Ah, come on.  That is exactly what I was talking about.  Now see, I could 
respond with something similar to:  "Is there actually a social or economical 
class that is protected for left wing, pinko, commie, tree hugging, dirt 
worshipping, Birkenstock wearing, whale saving, dope smoking, granola biting, Clinton 
voting, non-bathing, draft dodging U.S. citizens?", but that would be getting 
too serious.  Ah, lighten up, and live!  I love the first admendment, and love 
that you have the same ability to express your viewpoints.  So why would my 
original post get someone upset?  It is humorous, and was intended to be from 
the start, unlike some VW's I've seen in town and their hateful messages.  But 
then again, to each his own...

Thanks for the reply,

John
