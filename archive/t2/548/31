Subject: [T2]When did all the camping start>?

just curious but does anyone know where all the vw bus camping started..?
 
i mean we all know that the hippies and such were camping and that the family image of the sale of the bus in those days were that it was a traveler and a camper.. ?
 
My thought is where did it start as we know it today as that of everybus.,High country,and others that are terrific camp outs.. ..?
 
not when these particualr camp outs started but when all in all~!~
 
Can someone put a finger on it....
Its got to be one of the neatest, creative things i have ever been 2 or a part of....~!~
 
Peace
Cha
