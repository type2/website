Subject: RE: [T2] auto tranny

I have to comment.
After spending a week trying to find a replacement for my auto tranny
in my bus I have to say I am not a supporter of the dunebuggy movement.

From talking to wreckers and parts places they all comment on how they
come across wrecked busses simply for the tranny .. all to put into dune
buggies.  It's made them rare and expensive and has placed some decent
busses into the junk heap.

Ick

Sorry for the moment but it was mine.
I did find a tranny and my bus should be moving this afternoon.
