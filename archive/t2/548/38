True, because that is the only one that my comments referred to. Unlike
AABest, Dawn (PLF) does make her own canvas, so it is not the same as
the ones I was describing. She does good work. In fact at one time she
supplied me with canvas, but at that time (several years ago) she had
some trouble keeping up with demand, being a "one-woman show," so to
speak. While delivery was slow at that time, I never had a single
complaint about the quality. I notice that her website says she's not
taking new orders, though (although it's apparantly been a while since
it was updated, so maybe this is not accurate).

Actually my site doesn't claim the cotton canvas to be heavier, although
in fact it is (that is, it weighs more). GoWesty claims that it is twice
as heavy as the original. I would guess they actually weighed it in
order to make that claim but who knows. Then again, being heavier
doesn't by definition make it better. This particular type of material
simply weighs more than the one Westfalia used.

I'm not sure if I agree with you personally - that is, I can't say I'd
spend the extra if I were buying it for my own van. (Truth be told, I'd
probably get the German one, myself.)But as they say, that's why there's
chocolate and vanilla - we offer both canvas and sunbrella so it's up to
the buyer to make the choice. The new ones I'll have in a couple of
months will be a good alternative, as they are very close to the German
canvas in look, texture, finish, and weave, yet inexpensive like the
cotton one. This appeals to me, as I like the smoother OE style finish
better. But again that's pretty much a matter of personal preference.
One of my best friends has the cotton one on his Vanagon and likes it
more than the original.
