Subject: WHY DRIVE A BUS

Hello everyone.

The reason I drive a bus is because its fun.
I like that I am sitting up as high as as big 4x4's
and the seat keeps your back nice and straight (g00d for posture)
and that i can rest my elbows on the steering wheel as i'm cruisin
along. the nice large view through the bay window, sitting on top
of the front wheels as i'm makin a turn feels good.
being able to sleep in comfort, being able to fix the problems
and keep it alive! Seeing all the smiling faces and children pointin
nudging there parents....look mom its a volkswagen van.

Basically JOY.

Darren
