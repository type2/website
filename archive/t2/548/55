Subject: Re: [T2] why drive a bus?

Same here. I bought mine a coupla months ago, but it's been setting waiting
for me to have time to work on her.

I finally got the engine working the way it should, and dropped it off at
Mike's VW this morning. $250 to replace all fuel lines and the pivot
shaft/relay thingie. Not bad. I had expected much worse.

My tie rod ends and ball joints are apparently all original, hence worn. But
those will have to wait ($$).

Once I chase down the wires to the turn signals I'll be driving it daily.
Woot!!!
