Chris,
Believe me the 110 AC unit on the roll won't fly--not with an inverter
anyway.
You'll smoke the alternator in the process--the AC units draw way too
many amps for the alternator on a continuous basis to keep up.

A 110 accessory generator would be the only way to handle the amperage
load--especially when it starts.

Prior to building my window unit I was toying with the idea of just
purchasing a portable--free standing AC unit.

Three things that I didn't really care about them, and put the kibosh on
buying one of them.

First the price--your talking between 7--800 bucks.

Second--you have to manually empty the condensation tray after every
6--7--8 hours--

What if I forget ?

Splish Splash, the inside of my Van would be taking a bath.

And the physical size of them--
They take up a bunch of room that isn't really available to start with.

So-this is why I went with the window unit--
It works well--looks good-- takes up no interior space,and work
flawlessly--  
 
Later,

TK
