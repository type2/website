Big red wire is B+ and connects to the battery cable stud on the starter,, or directly to the
battery positive will work

Other wire connects to the blue wire near the regulator... that is the dash light circuit.

If you have a black wire,,,  I don't know! LOL   I think Karl told me what that was,, and I forgot...
Karl.. anyone.... do you know what the extra black wire from the alternator is for??
Thanks
