Richard,

Mine on my 78 was copper with silvered end on the battery side...just like 
the "newer" lead free type that I encourage everyone to switch to.

I don't remember for sure on the end attached to the frame, but am almost 
certain it was just copper.  I can go pull it out and look if it is  
important.

It was also very short(or seemed so to me).  I replaced it with a modern
"lead free" one that was longer...the new longer one also had *two*
body attachment places.  I think I used one of them on the bolt that holds 
the ecu in and the other one to the original attachment point on the body.

In my opinion, this is one of those places that "newer" is better.


Cheers, dave
