Subject: Re: [T2] Why Drive a Bus?

There is more versatility and sports utility in a bus floormat than in all of most modern SUV's... 

Furthermore - shadetree fixer friendly, old enough to be distinctive but new enough to be driven daily, great amount of space in small package, that sound that comes from the motor (maybe I wish for less volume), the wife likes, the kid likes, the dog likes, the cats tolerate it (vet trips). 

Lastly I love underdogs. I love to hear some Moostang guy declare it a piece of junk when his Moostang is half the age, have the mileage, half the expected life expectancy (the car, not him), and considerably less ability to do anything but drag race or cruise. Is it a piece of junk when they have been used for ambulances, crossed every continent on earth, etc. etc? More like - it just isn't his style... He's afraid he'd like it. Might compromise his manliness... <grin!>

Further on the topic of underdogs, there is nothing like wondering if you can climb the next hill in high gear. Aircooled VW's are the only vehicles (besides Fiat 500s and citroen 2CVs) that I have felt compelled to CHEER for while climbing a hill. 

Lastly - I love to take the bus anywhere - the drive-in theater, Sonic drive-in, hardware store, family gatherings, the Smokey Mountains, camping, house hunting, to the park for a picnic or to ride bikes, car shows, down a forest road, to K-mart to get more food for the animals.... 

Etc.

Etc.
