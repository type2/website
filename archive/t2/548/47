Subject: Track Roller Question

I sent this ? To Ron (-at-) Busdepot & he suggested trying the list.  I can get a
picture of what this unit looks like in case I have some mutant custom piece
that the PO put on.  If anyone has one of these or knows where to get one I
have a little dough to spend.

Hey Ron,
I was wondering if you carry or know where to purchase the
slide roller units that were used in the Straight Pop Top
Campers like are commonly seen in the Rivieras.
