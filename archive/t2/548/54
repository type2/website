Bizarre...the only thing I can imagine where hissing in the cab could be related to engine trouble is a vacuum leak:
 
1) Do you have an aftermarket vacuum gauge? Maybe the hose is coming loose
2) The brake booster is vacuum powered and is located under the cab on older buses (not sure about an '80), but if it or it's hose leaked, you would notice hard braking as well
