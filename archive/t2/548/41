Subject: More part ID

Ok, I admit, I have way too many types of engines for different buses.  So
parts matching is always fun..

Is there any place to match up a Distributor to the internal parts needed?

I have a 0 231 137 021 vac dizzy
and have :
cap 1235522056

Are they a match?  I truly doubt it but am hopeful
