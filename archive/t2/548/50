Subject: re: [T2] Pop-Top Camper in a Sunroof Body?

Hi Jay,

Westfalia used sunroof bus bodies to make pop-top campers from 
1968-1972. From '73-79 westfalia used a special roof that is not the 
same as the sunroof bus. Fitting a 68-73 pop-top onto a sunroof bus 
should only take a couple of hours, max.

As a matter of fact, there's no good reason you couldn't use a 74-79 
pop-top on a sunroof bus, because in either design the sunroof area is 
unobstructed. Using a 74-79 pop-top on a sunroof won't get you a double 
bed upstairs, but I don't think it would be all that hard to make a 
68-73 upper cot fit facing the other way. The hard part about fitting a 
late pop-top is getting the luggage rack lined up, as there is no way 
to see where the holes through the steel go, except to compare with the 
donor bus (assuming it's available). AMHIK.

The VW sunroof is not designed to be watertight. It is designed to 
channel the water that leaks through the top pening into 4 drains(one 
in each corner).If the drains clog, the water backs up until it runs 
inside the bus. I would suggest you use a ccoat-hanger or a piece of 
stiff wire to dislodge whatever debris is blocking your drains. I would 
NOT recommend using high pressure water or air except as a last 
resort... When we got my wife's sunroof bus it had one of the drain 
tubes disconnected from the roof drain, which meant that all the water 
coming through that drain wound up leaking into the headliner just 
behind the drivers seat. It was an easy thing to fix the drain pipe, 
but the headliner is FUBAR. I plan to replace it with a wooden 
headliner from an early westy instead.


Happy trails,
