Subject: Why drive a bus?

Rather than using my wheels for negative, cliche, "fun" stickers, I use my
Westy as a daily driver mini-van that I can fix.
As a single dad, I realized that the kids were outgrowing the Beetle --- and I
entered Type 2 world! I saw the Westy as an amalgamation of all kinds of good
things --- dependable transpo, easy to work on, fun to drive, good visibility,
lots and lots of interior room, and most of the camping amenities I'd ever
need....until I can get a toilet in that thing....lol
In my opinion, there's also something to be said about air cooled engines
being superior, as well as the simplicity of the beast. No computers, no
radiator, no plastic body parts...just decades old, road beaten metal toughing
it out year after year with a little TLC from the pilot.
A bus is a heluva package deal, but I'm preachin' to the choir here!
