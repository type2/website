That explains why the ACDelco branded ones I saw proudly displayed "Nitrile
Gloves".

Latex works too, but the latex ones that are available cheap are for doing
dishes and have like zero sensitivity.

I have yet to try some of these, but will probably get some the next time
I'm at the FLAPS.

Thanks for the info!
Don
