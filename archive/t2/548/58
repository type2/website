Hi Eric,

I think Rick caught the culprit.. the FI system on the vanagon can be 
very sensitive to vacuum  leaks. Sounds to me like you have a leaking 
power brake booster.

Or else it might be a relay or buzzer under the dash. The sound from 
some of the buzzers on my Dad's vanagon might be described as 
"hissing". Sort of.

Happy trails,
