Chris just got back in touch with me.   He now has a place to work on his
bus, now he just needs some parts.

needs New Pistons, crankshaft and crossmember for 68 bus single port.

call (803) 802 8983 or  email him at salidressing(-at-)excite.com if you can help

He said he found a running 1600 dual port recently rebuilt for $300 in Fort
Mill if anyone is interested.
