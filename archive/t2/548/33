Subject: RE: [T2] Overheating? How can you tell?

Conventional wisdom says that it's ok for the oil light to flicker after the engine's warmed up really good at idle. I only see it at oil temps > 220*
 
It just means the oil pressure is slightly below the senders threshold pressure. As long as the light clears when you rev the engine, should be ok.
 
Older worn engines may have more tendencie to do this.

I'd like an answer to this also as my oil light comes on dimly when I am at
a stop light after a good highway run but she still drives strong and I can
hear no detonation in the engine.

The old school technique is to feel the dipstick handle. If it's scorching
hot to the touch, then the engine's running too hot.

These are my experiences with a FI 2.0L Westy with oil temp a gauge:

Oil temps have always been good (<= 220) in climates < 85 *F. In warmer
temps, I can cruise at 60 all day and climb short hills. Extended hill
climbs (> 5 minutes) tend to overheat. You can also overheat by driving
into a strong headwind, beacuse the engine makes more power and heat to
overcome the headwind. If yoo have to climb for a while in a warm climate,
stop and let the engine cool for 20 minutes every 5 minutes or so.
