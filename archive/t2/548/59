Subject: Re: [T2] Track Roller Question

Here is a picture of the top mechanics, look at the base of the support
crossmembers.  The roller unit I am looking for slides back and forth in
that metal track parallel and sitting on the bus roof.  I need one if anyone
has some extras or knows where to get some.
