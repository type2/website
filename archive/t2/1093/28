Isn't that retard accomplished with the dual nipple vacuum advance
unit? If so, I've understood you can just disconnect the retard side
of the vacuum advance and time it like a regular distributor at 7.5
BTDC at idle and 28 to 32 BTDC at 3500. Of course, not allowed for
California emissions.

 The reason for the retarded timing on the CA engine is to improve emissions.
 The total advance at 2800RPM is the same as on a federal engine, so
 performance is not affected.
