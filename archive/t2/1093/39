maybe it should be worded,, be careful welding ,, especially galvanized 
metals..  the gases are not good for you over time. 

zinc in the galv metal will give you quick results of poisoning..  drinking 
a lot of milk will remedy it
but,, you have to weld for hours on galv and breathe in the fumes..to get 
the jitters 

don't breathe the smoke! 

also,.,to get a good weld on galv metals.. grind the galv off where the weld 
is going, 

hope that helps
