Subject: Did my homework..but still cannot "play"!

Hi, I posted about having no wires, beyond ..a foot..of each of the voltage
regulator wires.  Now..I know....that the brown..is rotor neg...Green
is..rotor field..red..is stator output..and yes..I have 'read' the
diagrams..but..is there a way..with the alternator already in place..to run
wires from the current short leads .. to..receptacles on the
alternator..itself..that I can get to with the starter/alt..inplace? Can't
this be a..'paint by numbers"??(sorry, old school..circa 1960)
'74 Westy..'currently' external reg..but.prolly going to Bosch
0192062007..solid state reg!  Sorry, just a trying day!!
