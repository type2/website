Subject: RE: [T2] Bus shutter

Well it looks like I got some work ahead of me. Checked the bowden tube last night. Looks good and already has spacers in it. Most likely I will be pulling the engine and at least replacing the clutch and plate. Most likely will have to get a reman. flywheel from busdepot.

Not sure (cause im a novice) what is meant by pilot bearing. Or the plastic bushing of the shaft being worn... collar for release bearing with the three bolts?

I want to thank everyone for the help, this process is truly amazing.

Subject: [T2] Bus shutter

Hello all,



I have a 1972 hardtop westy with a 091 trans and a freshly rebuilt 2.0 engine. My problem now is that the bus kinda shutters when letting the clutch out in first gear. Not always though just after the bus has been running a while.



 I am using the same clutch/pressure plate and flywheel from the old engine. The shuttering was happening with the old engine also. When I put the new engine in I replaced the throw out bearing thinking that was the problem... guess not. 



Clutch/pressure plate looked fine with no flaws. The flywheel had some blue where it makes contact with the clutch. Could this be the problem? Flywheel warped... need turning like a rotor?



Any help would be much appreciated. Aloha from Hawaii.
