Subject: Odd Noise

Started hearing an odd noise coming from my bus this morning.  It's a '78 FI
w/ automatic transmission.  I have owned it for 3 years, it has been sitting
for 20+, and has been on the road for 3 weeks.

The noise is coming from just below my feet, it sounds like something is loose
and knocking on the frame.  Or like something with worn out bearings but like
I said it's right in the middle of the bus on the underside.  When I hit the
brakes it immediately goes away.  I haven't noticed any changes in the braking
pattern and a visual inspection didn't show anything obvious, although I'm not
sure what I'm looking for.

I went ahead and lubed the front end but despite sitting for so long the
expelled goo didn't look that bad.

Thoughts on where to look next?

TIA,
Chandler
