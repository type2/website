Subject: Re: [T2] Melling Oil Pump installation

I'd suggest returning the pump, and saving your money and time.B  A flicker of
the oil light is normal after a high speed highway run at idle, as long as it
goes away when you hit gas.



If you do decide to do the swap, you do not really need to drain the oil,
unless you get some gasket material in there when scraping the old junk off
the case.



You need to make sureB  the pump will work with your cam, which depends on if
it is dished or not?

Also i have heard bad things about that pump, as I assume it is a steel body
that holds the gears? I heard they expand different than the oem aluminum
ones.



Make sure the oil holes align between the case and the pump, or you'll be
rebuilidng the whole thing real soon.B 

You may have to loosen the case halves to get it out.

Your message snips:

I'm fitting a Melling oil pump this weekend to my '70 bay 1600. Bought B 
an oil pump puller tool (I've never used one before) and will replace B 
without splitting the case.

I've been getting a little flicker on the oil pressure light at idle B 
after long motorway runs and want to try the new pump before, as a B 
last resort, I try switching to a higher viscosity oil which people B 
seem to recommend. (currently using Morris 30w monograde)

Does anybody have any tips/do's/don'ts for this oil pump swap B 
procedure? (it's a three bolt cam).
