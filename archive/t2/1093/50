Subject: New engine won't turn

Hey Volks!
So I just dropped (lifted?) the new-to-me engine into my '72
Westy.
Everything went as well as I could've expected until the moment of
tightening
the tranny to engine bolts. As I begin to tighten any one of the
bolts it
becomes impossible to turn the engine.

Ibve used a virtual copy of my old
engine except the
flywheel and clutch are different, which is apparently the
problem. The new engine
came with a different Fly so I had to buy a 215 Clutch
instead of the 210 that
was on the old engine. I thought the Fly/Clutch would
fit just fine in the old
Tranny.

Short of swapping the Flywheel/Clutch, which
appears to be a
big pain, is there anything that I can do to resolve this?
Maybe a spacer
between Tranny and Engine?

I really need to get Sunshine
running again.

Thanks, as always.
