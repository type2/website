Subject: Fresh Air Cooling vents stuck...

I used the self-adhesive foam strip inteded for draught exlusion and
available from any DIY store stuck to the back of the flaps. This seemed to
 keep the worst of the wind out. Oh, and the circular side vents on my van
 have been fitted with small round speakers behind the grille. Looks great
 and keeps the wind out too !

 I have a problem with my fresh air vents apparently being stuck open  on
 my 1970 Bay (1600cc). The weather here in England is getting COLD  so I
 need to do something about it:)

 I can't find any info/diagrams in the manuals or online regarding the
 fresh air system and flaps so I was wondering if any of you could  point
me in the right direction?
