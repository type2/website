Subject: Re: [T2] Melling Oil Pump installation

Hi Guys

Thank you for the advice. I'm new to the list and now realise that I  
should be more specific with the details regarding my question. The  
flickering light is kinda keeping me up at night, I'm sure you've all  
been there:)

I rebuilt the engine 2 months ago (new magnesium Genuine case, CB  
Counterbalanced Crank, new cam, lifters, all bearings etc.) the only  
part I put back in from the old engine was the oil pump and cover. ( I  
was in a rush at the end...) and I didn't bother checking the OP gear  
clearances as it looked reasonably new to me. The flickering light at  
idle when it's pretty hot has happened only since the rebuild (I've  
always used Morris 30w) . I also notice a small oil leak at the bottom  
of the pump so I'm thinking that this is the culprit.

It's not a worn bearings issue. I checked and double checked that I  
got all the correct sizes so I don't really want to go for a 20-50w  
just yet.

When you mention everything lining up on the oil pump what do you  
mean? Is it possible to line the pump up wrong? That would explain my  
pressure issue if that was the problem. Do some cases not suit certain  
pumps? If the holes don't align do you have to drill the case? My case  
is a genuine VW AS41 Dual relief from Brazil.

I've checked the Pressure relief switch which is operating correctly.  
Unfortunately I don't have the means to check the actual pressure  
readings.

My current thinking is that the old pump and cover were more worn than  
they visually appeared but if I'm missing something please let me know:)

Thank you for the Puller instructions much appreciated.

Thank you for your time,

Bearclaw
