Tony,
the spacer idea is good will try that. What do you mean by the motor to trans bolts? Like the motor is coming away from the trans?

	Hello all,
	
	I have a 1972 hardtop westy with a 091 trans and a freshly rebuilt 2.0 engine. My problem now is that the bus kinda shutters when letting the clutch out in first gear. Not always though just after the bus has been running a while.
	
	I am using the same clutch/pressure plate and flywheel from the old engine. The shuttering was happening with the old engine also. When I put the new engine in I replaced the throw out bearing thinking that was the problem... guess not. 
	
	Clutch/pressure plate looked fine with no flaws. The flywheel had some blue where it makes contact with the clutch. Could this be the problem? Flywheel warped... need turning like a rotor?
	
	Any help would be much appreciated. Aloha from Hawaii.
	
	Sam
