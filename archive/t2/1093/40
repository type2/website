I'm building the Busaru Conversion section, bit-by-bit. I have the motor mounts done, the frame extension, the radiator housing and just finished the throttle cable. Check it out and tell me where your questions are. It won't be up forever - hopefully I'll get it finished before I have to leave it!

The T4 tech section is gonna go slower now. I'm about as far as I got with the old Yahoo Albums I used to have up but will expand on it as weather keeps me indoors!
