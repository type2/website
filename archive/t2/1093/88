The pilot bearing sits inside the end of the crankshaft. They are
small roller bearings, perhaps better described as needle bearings due
to the small size (about 1mm diameter or less). They ride inside a
metal cage. When it goes bad, usually due to lack of grease, the cage
shatters and the bearings are broken up. It is quite difficult to
remove the remains of the cage when this happens. The job of the pilot
bearing is to support the transmission input shaft. When they fail,
the shaft vibrates and the first thing to be affected is the
transmission oil seal on the input shaft, causing it to leak.

If yours are still good, clean and grease them and make sure they rotate freely.

Release bearing is alternate terminology for the clutch throwout
bearing. When you push in the clutch pedal, the cable pulls the clutch
fork which pushes the throwout or release bearing into the clutch
pressure plate to release the disc from the plate pressure, allowing
the disc to rotate freely independent of the pressure plate and
flywheel. Three 10mm nuts hold the throwout bearing onto the bell
housing and a spring clip holds it in position. This is removed to
change or inspect the input shaft seal, or to replace the throwout
bearing, which gets noisy when it is getting ready to fail.

I am not aware of any plastic bushing on the shaft. If it's internal
to the tranny, I wouldn't expect to find plastic there, but you never
know....
