Hello David, one of the first things I would do is remove, clean and
lube the shafts that go from inside to outside the Bus. These are some
of the most neglected places for lubrication, probably because it's a
PITA to do. If these are binding enough to burn fuses, they can also
cause the nylon drive gear to shear from the center shaft, and there is
no easy way to fix it when it does, short of replacing the whole thing.
These shafts should move freely, as any properly lubed part should, no
binding. To remove them take the wiper arms off, remove the black
plastic caps and circlip holding them from falling inward, pop the ends
of the arms of and pull them towards the insideof the bus. Hope this
helps, Timo
