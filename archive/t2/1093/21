My first stick machine was an older Lincoln...  copper core (makes a
difference, really, it does!) ...  I abused the (deleted) out of it and it
came back for more.  When I took a welding class, guess what they used?  Um
Hmmm...  Lincolns.  I like em.  But get an older one - the new ones don't have
the same reputation.


Now again...  the Miller 135 (yep, I think it's now the
140 too)  is a darn nice mahine for a 110 - which is a HUGE convenience.  It's
not as fast as a 220, but it holds its own.  Like others said, make sure
whatever you get can push gas, and isn't just a wire unit.  Or you can wire
your house for 220...  just be careful which socket you plug the cake mixer
into!!!  And yes - Millers are pricey...  but there's a reason most folks will
spend the money.  Try one, and get hooked.  

The MOST important thing you can
get, tho, is a GOOD helmet.  Just replaced my old flipper with an auto-dark -
I'll NEVER go back.  You NEVER botch a job because you can't get a good clear
pix thru a #10, nor will you misstrike (or burn thru a heater channel or zap
your throttle cable) ...  it makes life SUPER easier...  Honestly, I thought I
spent too much on mine (BTW, it's a miller... grins...) but the very first
time I used it, I realized I woulda paid twice that for it.  Also, get the
biggest "window" you can afford - you can see where you want to put your bead
a lot easier and still pay attention to what you're doing!

I won't get into
Plasma cutters...  but that rates, IMO, up with sliced bread and american
whiskey as one of the greatest things going.  Cutting without depleting your
Acetylene bottle (and beautifyl, clean cuts, too)...  Wheee!!!!

I've posted this many times over the years, I'll post it again.  I've had a
220V MIG, and then 2 110V ones, current is a Miller, 135A I think but current
(ha ha) version may be 140A.  I would NEVER own a 220V machine again.  You can
do 3/16" easy with a 110, and probably 1/4" if you are slow and careful.  For
anything over 3/16 I pull out the stick anyway.  Why do I own a 110V MIG, so I
can weld on my back porch, on any outlet in my garage, in my basement
(supports for the main beam) on my trailer next door with a generator,
wherever I want.  I would NEVER pass up that convenience again.  Why do I own
a Miller, well, buy one and find out.  I've had a Lincoln and a Century, now I
have a real machine (BTW Hobart is likely the same now days.)
