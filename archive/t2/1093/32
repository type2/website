Just fyi, you have to time it to 7.5 idle OR 32 max, but you can't 
necessarily achieve both if you don't have the correct distributor.  Max 
advance is really what you care about most, but they tell you to adjust 
idle because the VW engineers have already done the math.  The built in 
mechanical range has to be correct.  If, for example, the mechanical 
range is 32 degrees, you'll set your max advance at 3500 RPM at 32, find 
it idles at 0, advance it 7.5 at idle, and then you're max advance is 
now 39.5 (bad).  You really need the correct distributor for that year 
engine, or you need to tweak the mechanical curve to get the correct 
timing range.  Or, you set max advance at 32 and hope that the advance 
is somewhere close to where it's supposed to be for that engine.  And if 
it's not, you just try and tune your idle to run as best as possible, 
but it won't be optimal.

In addition to that, just throwing any distributor in with the correct 
mechanical range won't solve the problem.  Various distributors kick in 
their mechanical advances at specific RPM points to match the torque 
curve of the engine.  If you're running full throttle all the time, 
stick an 009 in there, time for max advance, and call it a day.  But if 
you want good drive ability and fuel economy, get the correct 
distributor tuned specifically for your engine and it will run it's best.
