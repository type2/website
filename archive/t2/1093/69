Subject: Fresh Air Cooling vents stuck...

Hi All

I have a problem with my fresh air vents apparently being stuck open  
on my 1970 Bay (1600cc). The weather here in England is getting COLD  
so I need to do something about it:)

I can't find any info/diagrams in the manuals or online regarding the  
fresh air system and flaps so I was wondering if any of you could  
point me in the right direction?

I've recently rebuilt the engine etc. myself and have a good grasp of  
mechanics and of the bus. I'm very familiar with the heating system  
and that is in perfect working order.

The Two Blue dash controls operate freely, the cables? on the Two Blue  
control flaps are connected and I can see them independently (on left  
and right) moving something like blanking plates?? that are split left  
and right near to the grill. Trouble is It's not sealing off the cold  
air at all and on the motorway it's blowing cold air through three  
separate places (the far L/R window vents, The two L/R circular dash  
vents and below that through the large black plastic vents at knee  
level on the left and right of the cab.) which overpowers the heating.

Does anyone have any advise before I start dismantling the dash and/or  
front grill?

Many thanks in advance,

Bearclaw.
