Subject: Re: [T2] wiper switch

Well, David, it could be the switch, since the fuse doesn't blow when the 
fuse itself is used to start and stop
the wipers, and it does when the switch is used.

Both the wiper motor and the switch are tricky, incorporating circuitry to 
try to land the blades at a downward stop when the switch is turned off. 
Way to compicated to try to go into here.  If you do not as yet have it, I 
urgently suggest that you avail yourself of a copy of the Bentley manual for 
buses, often available used on eBay or new from Bus Depot: 
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=BENTLEYV279

It includes colored wiring diagrams, and will pay for itself many, many, 
many times over in time and money as you begin a new and what I guarantee 
will be an intense and personal relationship with your new bus.

Where in NC you located, by the way ?

Cheers and welcome,

John Rogers
