Subject: Interview - Limited VW Content

Hello Volks,

I'm sorry I did not get this out on Friday (for those listservs that have
Friday guidelines) but my schedule did not allow me the opportunity.

I am looking for anyone in the VW community who has started their own
business (preferably VW related but I will entertain other offers if no VW
offers present themselves).  I need to write an interview paper on a
founding entrepreneur and have four questions I can send via email.

If interested, please P-mail me.

Thanks in advance,
Andrew
