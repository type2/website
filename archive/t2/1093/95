Subject: Re: [T2] Melling Oil Pump installation

Hi Rick,

One thought comes to mind.  Did you use the same OP sending unit in the new 
engine or replace it with a new one?  It's possible that if you replaced it 
with a new one, the new one has a lower triggering point -- newer unit, 
stroger spring etc.

If so, you might try putting the old one back as an experiment if you still 
have it and see what happens.

Again, cheers ....

I rebuilt the engine 2 months ago (new magnesium Genuine case, CB
Counterbalanced Crank, new cam, lifters, all bearings etc.) the only
part I put back in from the old engine was the oil pump and cover. ( I
was in a rush at the end...) and I didn't bother checking the OP gear
clearances as it looked reasonably new to me. The flickering light at
idle when it's pretty hot has happened only since the rebuild (I've
always used Morris 30w) ....
