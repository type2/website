There's a good article on welding galvanized metal safety here:

http://www.sperkoengineering.com/html/articles/WeldingGalvanized.pdf

3M makes a couple of easily found filters for their masks that are  
suitable for welding:

- 2097 (pink pancake style)
- 7093 (spark resistant cartridge)

If you have trouble breathing due to the restriction that filters  
often present, you probably need to ventilate you helmet and/or work  
area.
