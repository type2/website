Subject: Re: Re: Proper Timing for 050 Distributor

Thanks Mike!

I don't see the 050 listed in the oldvolks home tech so it is probably  
best I start to look for a stock distributor. The aggrevating thing is  
that the bus was running fine with a 050 before I did a "tune up." But  
I couldn't leave well enough alone so I bought new points, condensor,  
rotor and cap and had a field day. Now I really don't know why it  
stalls after a minute of running even though I've tried the spectrum  
of timing options. I've looked at the oldsvolkshome tech before with  
no joy. I was hoping someone out there may have had a similar  
experience and could confirm the proper timing with thier set-up. Best  
thing to do though is probably install the right tool for the job.  
Thanks again!
