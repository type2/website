This is basically a variant of the 009 with all the cautions and
caveats that go with all the advice you have heard about 009s. As Jim
mentioned, it does give 5 degrees more advance, so if you must use it,
it is a little better than the 009. Shoot for timing at 7 BTDC at idle
and 32 BTDC at 3500 RPM.

 Hello, I have a 1973 Westfalia which came with a 050 distributor when I
 bought it. Does anyone know the proper timing for it at idle (800rpm). I
 have it dialed in at 0 (TDC).

 I have a stock pancake 1700 engine and stock dual carbs. Neither are
 modified to my knowledge. The engine has been rebuilt, which is probably
 when the 050 was put in.
