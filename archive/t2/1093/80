Go out right now and check your wheel lug nuts. and then, if you have regular
steel wheels, look for cracks. Not likely, but I've been through that scenario
and it's a clunk-clunk-clunk right underneath you!

Next check out your front
brake rotors and your front wheel bearings. Check for anything loose on
caliper mountings.

If you're in a bumpy environment, it's those darn shock
mounts (braking would have no effect though!)

Speedometer drive is from the
hubcap of the left front wheel, through the stub axle and works its way up to
the EGR switch and then to the speedometer. A dry speedo cable or a screwed up
EGR switch can make noises like that, but the speedo needle would usually be
jumping all over the place if so.  If it IS the speedo cable or the switch,
you can replace with a new single speedo cable that eliminates the EGR switch.
Hope this helps.
