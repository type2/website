The $89 Harbor Freight unit is a flux-core (gasless) unit.  It's a very inexpensive way to learn to weld, but you are never going to get good at it with that unit.

Miller welders are good but very pricey.  $600 for their most basic welder, and that doesn't include the gas bottle.  Too much of a committment for a beginner, IMO.

I bought a used Snap-On welder (just a repackaged unit from another mid-grade manufacturer) for $150 on Craigslist, and bought a gas bottle from Harbor Freight with a 20% off coupon for about $60.  So for about $200, I was able to learn how to weld and let me tell you it is a whole new world.  I could not have lived without the welder during the engine conversion process for my bus - it was absolutely essential.  I see used welders all the time in that price range on Craigslist.

Last week a friend offered up his lightly-used Miller 135 welder for $650 including a large bottle and cart.  I still could not justify the purchase price, so I declined to purchase it.  The cheaper unit has been just fine for me.
