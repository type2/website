Subject: Re: [T2] New engine won't turn

Hi Jamie. Thanks (everyone) for the reply.

I have yet to get back to it, but I've come up with another possible cause.
You know how on the Engine Bearer Brackets there are 2 sets of holes but only one set on the Engine Bearer itself? My thought is I may have used the left set of holes instead of the right, thus pulling the rear end of the engine slightly to one side. It seems that this would be enough screw everything up at the engine/tranny connection. What do you think?

At the very least that's where I'll start. Remove the Bearer bolts, pull the engine back off a bit then make sure it's going in straight. Good thing I didn't tighten everything down before checking for engine rotation.

First time doing this whole thing and I'm doing it alone. But think of the sense of accomplishment once I get it right.

Peace
-Paul

I am puzzled,,  i thought the 215, and the 210 flywheel took the same
starter.. so the ring gear should be the same size on both flywheels..

that flywheel isn't larger,, the clutch disc is..
so .. it shouldn't be hitting the bellhousing..

hmmm...
