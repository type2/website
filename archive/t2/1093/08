Subject: Re: [T2] Mig Welders

I don't know anything about the Chicago Electric. My Dad has one of the 
small Lincoln welders, and as a complete novice I had zero problems with it 
when I replaced the pans, luggage tray, A and B pillar bottoms where they 
weld to the heater channel and things like that. It had  VERy quick learning 
curve and I have heard it recommended quite a bit.
