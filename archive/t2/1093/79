Same here.  30 some years ago, fellow employees where I worked thought it
would be a funny thing to loosen all of the lug nuts on my front wheels.  On
my way home that night I kept hearing that sound and the steering felt a bit
odd, but stopping to check things out didn't help.  I never though to look
at the lug nuts.  For some reason on my last stop to check, I looked at the
lug nuts and found that at least one wheel was ready to just come off.

They may have thought that it was funny, but it could have cost me or my
wife our lives.  I still wonder if I managed to piss off one of them enough
to make them want to kill or injure me.

Needless to say, I check them more often now.
