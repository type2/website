I got this at BusDepot for $169 a brand new Bosch (Mexican). , they 
claim it works on the bus for all years- 72-79 also, works fine in my FI 
78 camper; to get the max curve
I use 10 deg adv for initial timing.

  This SVDA works very well with stock dual carbed 72-74 Buses. 
However, the
  #1 Cylinder mark is 180 degrees opposite from the Type 4 engine Bus
  distributor, but that doesn't matter - just carefully make a new mark 180
  degrees opposite and you'll be fine.  Advance characteristics, both Vacuum
  Assist and Mechanical are basically the same as the "093" above.  I have
  used these on several Type 4 carbed engines engines with excellent 
results.
