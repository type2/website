There should be a junction on the vertical heater duct under your dash. 
  On there is a lever on the left side that directs the air to your feet 
or the dash.  If your rotate that lever, air will be directed through 
the upper vents instead.  It's spring-loaded to send air to your feet. 
Your control is obviously broke, but I used some bicycle brake cable and 
fabricated a new control cable which connects to the dash control and 
allows me to select where the air goes.
