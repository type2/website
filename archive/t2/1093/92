Subject: Re: [T2] Melling Oil Pump installation

I  also will ask, why not try using 20-50w oil first?  A flicker at idle is 
normal after a long run using 30w oil. A switch to 20-50w gives you the best 
of two worlds:  thinner  at startup and thicker oil at higher temps when the 
oil is hot.

There is controversy in the VW community about cast iron Melling pumps, 
because the metal expansion rate is different some claim this causes leaks.

The puller may seem confusing at first.  It isn't.  Once you remove the 
cover plate and the gears, the puller then straddles the assembly and the 
"T" fits inside.  Turn it a half turn so it fits behind the housing, then 
extract the  housing by tightening the nut.

As someone said, be careful everything lines up, is clean, use the right 
gaskets and new sealing nuts.

You don't need to drain the sump.

Or, return the pump, buy three quarts of Castrol GTX 20-50w and save some 
time and money.

Cheers
