Subject: 1600 now starts

A few weeks ago, I posted that my 1600 with nnon-stock dual carbs had 
suddenly stopped running and would not start after I dragged it home. 
Several people suggested ether. I tried this and the engine started 
instantly and ran only for a few seconds, evidently until the ether 
had passed through.
After eliminating spark, timing, etc, I finally got around to pulling 
the fuel lines off of both carbs and discharging them into a beaker 
while I cranked the starter.
The sight in the beaker wasn't subtle. The fluid was a milky color 
and quickly separated into a heavier goo at the bottom with lighter 
goo at the top.

I drained the tank of the seven gallons that I had put in the week 
before the problem occurred, flushed the tank with a gallon of gas, 
replaced the filter, and discharged the carb lines into the beaker 
again until the fluid looked normal.

The engine started instantly and ran normally.

I haven't a clue what was in the fuel. Whatever it was would not 
vaporize. Hence no start.
It could have been water, but the milky color doesn't fit that 
explanation. In any event, I'm rolling again. My lesson learned: 
examine the output of the fuel pump early in the diagnostic process.

I hope this helps the next busser.
