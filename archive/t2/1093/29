Subject: Re: [T2] Hobart mig welders with gas

Bob, Miller bought Hobart a few years ago I think so I presume the Handler is
a gray and orange painted version of the Miller, should be a great choice. 
Either are likely offshore made of course now days, but still probably a cut
above the rest.  I've not seen a non gas Hobart at the local Hobart guy, but
who knows, could exist.  I've not welded with one but looks very similar to
mine, takes the same parts and consumeables.
 
I do advise people BTW, consider carefully looking for a deal.  Aside from
lack of warranty, I got my Miller off of C-L for under $400 WITH a full bottle
of CO2 and a new auto darkening genuine Miller helmet (probably $900 worth of
stuff.)  It was not stolen amazingly...  I bought it from a guy who ran maybe
50 feet of wire through it in a tech college class he HAD to buy it for then
realized he wasn't going to get the auto body job he thought.  I tried it out
when I bought it (the condition was obviously as new) and it has been flawless
since.
 
C-L is a great place to scan (up here at least) for them, and you can always
pick up an old copper wound Lincoln tombstone for $10-20 (literally) to learn
to stick heavier stuff with when you search for welder, then you don't have to
worry about your little 110V machine ever not being up to a task.

Does anyone have an option on the Hobart 140 with the gas option?
