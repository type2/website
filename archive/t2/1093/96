Hi John

The first thing I did when I got the flicker was purchase a new  
pressure switch thinking it might be faulty. Sadly I get the same  
flicker when using the new pressure switch much to my disappointment.

Cheers

Hi Rick,

One thought comes to mind.  Did you use the same OP sending unit in  
the new engine or replace it with a new one?  It's possible that if  
you replaced it with a new one, the new one has a lower triggering  
point -- newer unit, stroger spring etc.

If so, you might try putting the old one back as an experiment if you  
still have it and see what happens.

Again, cheers ....
