Heath -

http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#050

While my info and link on the 050 is basic at best, it's the best I can come
up with from Andy's personal experience and my experience pretty much
matches Andy's.

The 050 was originally designed for high performance use at the drag-strip
and for off-road use.  #3 cylinder retard (about 3 degrees,) that's present
on stock distributors (and the 009) is eliminated for best performance in
that intended use.  These are great on 356 and 912 Porsches as well.  But
they can be a pain to time it "just right".

Really, the best way to go with your stock set-up for best driveability is
to install an SVDA, time it at 7.5 BTDC and you will see a world of
difference.

Known as the "093" SVDA distributor, while originally installed on Late
76-79 FI engines (& 74 412 FI), this distributor works fantastically well
with stock 72-74 Type 2 Dual Carbs.  I put one on my 68 Bug and ran it for
several months until I got a proper SVDA Distributor.  They are almost
impossible to find new (and ultra expensive new at that), but I find used
ones here and there.  Bonus:  The mark for #1 Cylinder on the distributor
casing edge is correct for the Type 4 style engine in your Bus.

This SVDA works very well with stock dual carbed 72-74 Buses.  However, the
#1 Cylinder mark is 180 degrees opposite from the Type 4 engine Bus
distributor, but that doesn't matter - just carefully make a new mark 180
degrees opposite and you'll be fine.  Advance characteristics, both Vacuum
Assist and Mechanical are basically the same as the "093" above.  I have
used these on several Type 4 carbed engines engines with excellent results.

While Airhead's application description doesn't cover the Type 4, I know
from personal experience it will work just fine.
