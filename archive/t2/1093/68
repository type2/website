Subject: Re: [T2] wiper switch

I would disassemble and see what is getting shorted out when the switch is
activated. I am not familiar with the 1970 wiper switch. On the later models,
there are nasty things like screws backing out or the printed circuit board
actually breaking and the switch parts short out in either case.

I suspect
that as you engage the switch the positive contact inside is contacting a
ground that is out of place either because of damage - or the + contact is
maybe out of alignment because of wear. Either way, you should be able to
creatively solve it if you open up and look! Be sure to have a bucket or tray
or such underneath to catch parts - and BTW - disconnect the power. No sense
in burning up a wiring harness trying to fix this one little problem.

All the
other suggestions are good, but not directed to your particular problem!
