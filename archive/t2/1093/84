Thanks to all that replied and got me looking at the wheels.  The culprit 
was a loose caliper on one side, tightened her up and no more 
clunk-clunk-clunk.  I would be lost w/out this list thanks to all that keep 
it alive.

Go out right now and check your wheel lug nuts. and then, if you have 
regular steel wheels, look for cracks. Not likely, but I've been through 
that scenario and it's a clunk-clunk-clunk right underneath you!

Next check out your front brake rotors and your front wheel bearings. Check 
for anything loose on caliper mountings.

If you're in a bumpy environment, it's those darn shock mounts (braking 
would have no effect though!)

Hope this helps.
