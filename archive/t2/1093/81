Yeah, I was pretty sure who did it.  One guy at that job was a real jack(-at-)ss
and kept at me the whole time that I worked there.  I had a feeling that
they moved me to the other store as assistant manager to separate the two of
us.  I could never prove that he did it, though.

Glad that you were finally able to nail the guy.
