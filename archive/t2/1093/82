Clutch chatter is classically a symptom of glazed or oil contaminated
clutch disc friction surface material.

If you are sure it looked good when you put it back in and it had the
same symptom before, you will have to look for another cause.

 I have a 1972 hardtop westy with a 091 trans and a freshly rebuilt

the clutch out in first gear. Not always though just after the bus has
been running a while.
