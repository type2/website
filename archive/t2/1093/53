Subject: Ultrasonic cleaners for small parts

Has anyone used an ultrasonic cleaner for small automotive parts before? I've
seen them used by jewelers with awesome results. I'm thinking carb jets and
small bits and pieces like paint nozzles. Harbor Freight has one on right now
.5 L size for 30 dollars. Part no. 3305-1RHH
