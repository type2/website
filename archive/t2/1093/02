You did well enough and that's far from a field day.  Changing out those 
things is part of a good tuneup and preventative maintenance and 
shouldn't cause the problems you're having.  Figure out what's causing 
the stalling and then try and find the correct distributor.  I'd check 
your spark plug cables and make sure everything else is connected 
correctly and securely.  Also, if you don't ever want to have to mess 
with points again, get yourself a pertronix or compufire.  I've had a 
compufire in my bus for at least 8 years now and I haven't had to 
readjust the timing once.

If you could, please list all of the numbers on the distributor so we 
can try and cross-reference what engine it actually belongs to.  You 
might luck out and have an advance curve that's relatively close to what 
you're supposed to have.
