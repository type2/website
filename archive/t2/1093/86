Subject: odd noise

Ironic that an "odd noise" would create so much traffic.

I had a clattering sound from my left front just below my foot.

Figured it was the lug nuts.

nope------tight

bearing --------no growl everything solid up in the air.

Checked with a VW mechanic (of course an old one) he told me to grease
my hub caps where they touch the wheel.

Never heard it since.

So, try greasing your hub caps.

Cheers,

Alan
