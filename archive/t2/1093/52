Subject: So long and thanks for all the tips

Everyone,

I wanted to thank everyone on the list who has helped me out over the
last six years I've owned my 1977 bus.  I would have been lost with
out all the know-how and great advice.  You guys kept my bus on the
road.
Me and my family had a great time taking Goethe, the two tone brick,
on road and camping trips.  Unfortunately, it was time for her to go.
I sold her this morning and passed on the type2 address to the new
owner.  Hopefully, he signs on soon and joins the conversation.

Thanks again,

Jeremiah
