Subject: re:odd noise

Have you taken the pedal pan off? And looked for anything loose.

It might help to diagnose if you could figure out exactly when you hear the
odd noise, or what type of noise it is.

Ie-is it when you hit a bump, while driving over 25 mph, all the time, it is
a clunk when you start it, or a constant whir, or a clank whenever you are
not braking, etc.
