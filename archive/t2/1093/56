Subject: best turnkey 1600 source new vs rebuilt

Hello,  been lurking on and off list since it was back at lenti.med.edu..now
I could use some advice.

Purchased snow cat the uses a 1200 that is not a candidate for a
rebuild..sno cat list suggests upgrade to 1600 with little mod necessary.

now your input is appreciated.

Best vendor for turnkey 1600 engine?  New vs. rebuilt?  German vs.
Brazilian? and finally is turnkey the way to go or should I go to different
vendors to get the best motor possible.   Reliability is an issue as I will
be using this sno cat for transportation to my homesite over one mile from
road.  I want to do it right the first time.

Thanks,
