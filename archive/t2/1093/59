Right. The sense of accomplishment and independence from the auto
repair industry are wonderful feelings.

I never do the engine bearer until after the engine is successfully
mated to the tranny. You want total freedom of movement for the engine
as it goes on.

good luck

 You know how on the Engine Bearer Brackets there are 2 sets of holes
but only one set on the Engine Bearer itself? My thought is I may have
used the left set of holes instead of the right, thus pulling the rear
end of the engine slightly to one side. It seems that this would be
enough screw everything up at the engine/tranny connection. What do
you think?
