Subject: Melling Oil Pump installation

Hi All

I'm fitting a Melling oil pump this weekend to my '70 bay 1600. Bought  
an oil pump puller tool (I've never used one before) and will replace  
without splitting the case.

I've been getting a little flicker on the oil pressure light at idle  
after long motorway runs and want to try the new pump before, as a  
last resort, I try switching to a higher viscosity oil which people  
seem to recommend. (currently using Morris 30w monograde)

Does anybody have any tips/do's/don'ts for this oil pump swap  
procedure? (it's a three bolt cam).

Will I have to drain the sump before pulling the old pump? (I changed  
the oil last week:)

Thanks

Bearclaw
