Subject: wiper switch

Enjoying my new (to me) 70 camper type 2.  Drove it a few hours up to my
mountain (NC) home this weekend.  Some really really steep hills and she did
just fine.

Most times that I switch on the wipers a fuse blows and they stop (16a).  If
I stop or start the wipers by removing/reinserting the fuse they run fine
and fuse stays happy.  Should I be able to clean the switch in some way or
do I need to look for a replacement?  Thanks much,
