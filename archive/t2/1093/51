Hi Paul,

You need to pull the engine and use a dremel tool to grind out the
extra metal where the flywheel is hitting the bell housing. I hope you
didn't force the engine on. Check the endplay too because the pressure
of torquing the engine onto a bell housing that doesn't fit can damage
the case main seal retainers.

 Everything went as well as I could've expected until the moment of
 tightening
 the tranny to engine bolts. As I begin to tighten any one of the
 bolts it
 becomes impossible to turn the engine.

 Ib ve used a virtual copy of my old
 engine except the
 flywheel and clutch are different, which is apparently the
 problem. The new engine
 came with a different Fly so I had to buy a 215 Clutch
 instead of the 210 that
 was on the old engine. I thought the Fly/Clutch would
 fit just fine in the old
 Tranny.

 Short of swapping the Flywheel/Clutch, which
 appears to be a
 big pain, is there anything that I can do to resolve this?
 Maybe a spacer
 between Tranny and Engine?
