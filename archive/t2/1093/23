Subject: 83 Calif Vanagon 2.0 timing

Hello all

I have an 83 aircooled Westy that I was given. I have rebuilt the engine,
and am now getting ready to static time it (insert dist). why does the Calif
version have such retarded timing? would it be better to change it over to
the 49 states ECU and retain the fuel injection. I really do not like carbs,
and I was wondering if going to the 49 states timing and computer would help
performance any. thanks
