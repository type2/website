Subject: Re: [T2] Melling Oil Pump installation

I think the obvious is being missed on this whole oil pump
thread.  ALWAYS start with making sure there is a need before
throwing parts.  Is the OPS leaking, housing loose or wrong one?
Maybe just a loose connector on the wire?  Or a weak ground at the dash?
A pro would hook up a mechanical gauge at the OPS port to determine
if there really is a pressure problem, then work from there.  I don't like
removal and replacement of the pump, as there will almost ALWAYS
be problems afterwords due to leaks, fit or part compatibility.
My vote, barring none of the above shows a problem would be to go
to a 15/40 or 20/50 oil FIRST.  Oil pump replacement as a LAST resort,
ONLY after checking the actual HOT oil pressure.  Remember that it only takes
about .3 bar to turn off the OE switch.  Thats less than 5 psi!
