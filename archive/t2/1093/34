Hi Folks
            Just a couple of (probably inane) questions. Are the cyl heads
from an 1800 engine a direct fit to a 2000?. I presently have a 1600 in the
73 Bus and plan to install Petronix, is the unit interchangeable with the
2000 engine???
                                  Cheers  Irishrover
