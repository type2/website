I've posted this many times over the years, I'll post it again.  I've had a
220V MIG, and then 2 110V ones, current is a Miller, 135A I think but current
(ha ha) version may be 140A.  I would NEVER own a 220V machine again.  You can
do 3/16" easy with a 110, and probably 1/4" if you are slow and careful.  For
anything over 3/16 I pull out the stick anyway.  Why do I own a 110V MIG, so I
can weld on my back porch, on any outlet in my garage, in my basement
(supports for the main beam) on my trailer next door with a generator,
wherever I want.  I would NEVER pass up that convenience again.  Why do I own
a Miller, well, buy one and find out.  I've had a Lincoln and a Century, now I
have a real machine (BTW Hobart is likely the same now days.)

it will do 1/8 and thicker plate at room temp.  I have welded on the
frame even and you can do it if you take your time.

sure a big welder has a higher duty cycle, but most of us are not in
this as a profession.
