Subject: Re: [T2] New engine won't turn

I have always pulled the engine and transaxle as a unit.  Mating
the engine and trans out of the bus is a lot easier, and less likely to
put 
parts in a bind and damage them.  At very least, the trans should be on a
jack and free to move in every 
direction while attaching the engine, watching closely for alignment. 
Take your time, 
match engine and trans angles and the engine should just slide onto the 
input shaft and mate to the block with a slight turn of the crankshaft to
align the input shaft splines 
with the clutch disc.  Then install the FOUR engine to trans bolts/nuts,
jack the entire assembly up into the engine bearer and install the upper
bolts, making sure the rear engine hanger is aligned side to side.

We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
