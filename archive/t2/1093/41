When I was loosely associated with Bus Boys back in the 90s, I'm the one who
originally did the website (gee, learning html code was fun, trial by
error:) ).  Much of the website is still from my initial work with some of
it modified later by other individuals and they've done a good job.  From
the reference materials I had on hand at the time, I didn't have info on the
1800 (AW engine) cylinder heads, so that's why it was (and still is) left
out.  I've never been able find a substantiated source of part number(s)
info on the 1800 (AW or ED [FI]) cylinder head numbers, OE or replacement.
