On the cylinder head question, a little poking around bus-boys.com found this:

22-101-361D  Cylinder Head, New, 1700cc, with EGR, Breather and Sensor Hole

022-101-361K  Cylinder Head, New, 1700cc, 1973 Bus with 2 Air Injection Holes

022-101-361L Cylinder Head, New, 2000cc 76-78 Bus with Round Exhaust Ports

039-101-061M  Cylinder Head, New, 2000cc, 1979 Bus with Square Exhaust Ports

Not exactly clarifying since issues like holes and ports differentiate
part numbers. Also not sure why 1800 not listed. I remember years ago
hearing that 1700 to 1800 was accomplished by increasing cylinder
bore, and that 1800 to 2000 was accomplished by increasing stroke. But
checking P&C specs as well at Bus Boys shows 1800 at 93mm and 2000 at
94mm.

021-198-075B 90mm 1700

022-198-075A 93mm 1800

029-198-075 94mm 2000

All of this goes out the window, of course, because you can machine
the heads to accept larger cylinders to a point. I once had a Porsche
motor with a bad head, so I ordered a replacement by stock part
number. When the head arrived, I found the previous owner had
increased the cylinder size, so I had to have the head machined out to
match the old head.

 Are the cyl heads from an 1800 engine a direct fit to a 2000?.
