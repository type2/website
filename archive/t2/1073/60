Subject: Question about bolt that holds front bumper on (71 westy)

4 bolts mount the front bumper to the frame under the front. Anyone know the
size of these bolts? I need to replace them with ones that are a little
longer. I don't think I can get these at Home Depot? :-) I need to find them
online somewhere.

Thanks,
