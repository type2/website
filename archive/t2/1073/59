Thx Mike, John, airic.
I have MSD ignition in my fuel only setup so far and I now want to get 
the ignition control going.  I wanted to get another distributor to lock 
out just in case I screw something up and can quickly revert to the 
original with opto sensor.  I am looking at a new 009 with factory 
installed pertronix to install after either gutting or locking out the 
mechanical advance.  CIP has this one:

Thanks for the advice; I didn't know the watercooled '86 + had zero 
advance distributors as stock.
