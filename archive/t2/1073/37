Subject: Re: [T2] Cam Follower Gallery Orientation

Greg, you're perfectly right, I was referring to the oil galley holes. I'm
slowly picking up all the correct "engineering" terms but some are still
missing (and there's no online german - english engineering dictionary I know
of). Thank you very much for your prompt answer, I was thinking the same after
I (to no avail) tried to figure out some orientation pattern when looking at
the other followers. Cheers, Timo

Timo, to what are you referring when you ask about the correct orientation of
the "gallery"?  If you're referring to the oil galley holes in the follower,
I
always install them facing up so that they are less like to bleed down while
waiting for the rebuild to be completed and the engine fired up.  That being
said, you can install them in any orientation because if everything is as it
should be, they rotate while the engine is running.  Greg

Since I have never removed the followers
and have no manual that explicitly states the orientation of the gallery, I'm
asking for help in pointing me out what the correct orientation is.
