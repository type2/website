Subject: More on hard starting when hot

Is this list still alive?
Well, I drove the camper about 10 miles and it would not start- a clue 
was that it cranks more slowly when hot?  I switched the coil and 
stupidly fried the points wire when I reversed the positions of the + - 
when reinstalling the other coil.  Put in the Pertronics I had been 
wanting to install and waited for my daughter to bring the Quest with 
the tow hitch.  We decided to try jumping it first, and it did start- I 
timed it and did notice that the distributor lags on returning to the 
proper advance position, so I wonder if when hot the weights may stick 
and leave the timing way too advanced when stopped?  Next will lube it!
