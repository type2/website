Hi Joel,

Yes, it will definitely fit on the transmission.

BUT... there are other issues that will come of it. If you tell us what 
you're planning then we can help you avoid possible pitfalls. There are 
a many many combinations of Flywheel, starter, bell-housing and chassis 
that can be bolted together, but only a few actually work.

Happy Trails,
