No no no... I should have said DUAL PORT 1600!!  The multigauge was like $350-400 and the various leads etc were another couple hundred, IF I went that way (which I did not)

I did something similar to the minigauges I mentioned, AC certified for homebuilts, and I think to replace the CHT, Oil press, oil temp, and exh temp totaled about $400 (and another $125 for the sensors), but that was a few years ago.  BUT... I knew EXACTLY what my motor was doing at all times.  Want peace of mind?

Personally, to me it's worth it, esp. if you do any kind of long distance summer driving in a westy...  esp. when you get into the 1800-2l motors, you would know WAY ahead of time if you were getting close to valve seat dislocation temps.  (BTW, BTDT, and it made me long for the upright 1600s again!!)

In all cases - it would have saved me a motor.  THAT was the expensive part (esp with those '77 2 liter motors)!!!

ok,, can some one speak to the actual numbers.. like is TC wire worth $3 a
foot..  and you need 16ft.. so that costs ~$50.00

and did I read the message right,, are the multigauge worth $1600 ??

ago that would have looked pretty awesome... and the (I think it's) UHT has
these 1 1/4" gauges that fit anywhere, and aren't gaudy at all...
