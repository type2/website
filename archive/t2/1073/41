Subject: RE: [VWBusCamp] Mutant Bus: BusZilla II Updates! PDX Burning

Hey, I can supply some EL wire to this project!  I just started a new
business as a reseller of EL wire in the Seattle area:

http://www.seattlelumin.com

I'm selling the wire in several grades & colors, as well as a wide
assortment of drivers & sequencers.  I'm also teaching workshops to
bring people up to speed working with EL wire.

Heather, let me know how much wire you might be interested in, and we'll
work out a deal.

Everyone else:

Use the coupon code vwbuscamp to get a 10% discount on my whole catalog.

I may be returning to VW bus camp this year; I'm still trying to figure
out what my plans are for this year's burn.

-mike

Burning man art car

	Hey everyone, we got the electric motor for PlayaDrive :) AND
got a page up for donating.

	Check out the blog:
	http://mutantbus.wordpress.com <http://mutantbus.wordpress.com/>


	And for donating (because wordpress doesn't like forms, its
posted on my website)
	http://vwdreamer.com/mutantbus.php

	We are thinking of naming it BusZilla II, which seemed
appropriate in 2 ways, one being that there are 2 busses, and second
that its just awesome :) lol ok ok, due to the reptilian nature of the
playawear. If anyone has any other ideas, we would love to hear them!

	For those who are new to this, this is a burning man art car
project located in portland, oregon. It will involve taking 2 bay window
busses and making an articulating (you know the kind with the accordion
in the middle of it) bus. It will be driven on the street, and plans on
attending several VW and wet westies events. It will also have a
different "costume" for burning man (check out the sketches on the
blog).

	Thanks everyone for the support!

	BTW check out the sketches, thoughts?

	Happy bussing!
