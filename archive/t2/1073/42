Subject: balance the crankshaft

Dear list,

I am planning to build a second engine and swap it with the current one.
I remember a few years ago a post which was talking about the benefice 
of having your crankshaft balances by a professional ! some people 
recommended one shops to accomplish this task at the time, could anyone 
help me  giving that shop website or any others (in California/bay area) 
which can balance my crankshaft ?

Thanks

Chris, vanagon 83
