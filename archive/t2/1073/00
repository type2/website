I  FINALLY started the type4 rebuild. I have all the innards in the  case
including the distributor drive shaft. My problem seems to be the  shaft. 
The
crank and cam shafts work perfectly forward and backward. When I  index the
distributor shaft, according to Bug Me Video and Jake Raby, the  engine 
binds
about a quarter turn in reverse. It still turns freely  clockwise though. 
Any
suggestions? I don't want to torque the case until I  get the problem  
fixed.



Thanks,





hello Bob  I don't know how they do it in the videos as I have never  
watched them, but I always set the dizzzy and gear up before installing the  
crankshaft. I set the drive where it is suppose to be and install the dizzy  
setting it on #1 without turning the drive gear and then drop the crank into  
place with it being at TDC(  #1 rod at it's  top most postion and the  
timming marks on cam gear of the crank at the top.}  I then rotate the  crank 
enough to line up the cam mark with the crank gear marks.  Then when  testing 
rotation make sure the crank is pushed towards the flywheel end  otherwise it 
can bind . retest after installing the other case half   after  tighting the 
2 center main bolts of the case   Later  Mark  dearing
