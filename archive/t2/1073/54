Yeah.. just make sure you lock out the mechanical advance.  One guy said 
that he pulled off the felt pad and replaced the stepped washer with a 
lock-washer under the screw - he also removed the weights.  That's what 
I was planning on doing.  Check out this thread:

As far as a trigger setup, I figured out how to mount the trigger wheel 
on the pulley behind the fan and the VR sensor will then be mounted on 
the fan housing.
