I suggested this to the original poster by pmail, but for anyone else thinking
about this.  The late Vanagon dizzy makes a great conversion for this
purpose.  It is non advance, you don't have to lock the breaker plate, has a
standard VW/bosch 3 wire opto-electronic sensing element, and like any VW air
cooled dizzy be it T1, T2, T3, T4, 009, 010, 050, drops right on in. 
Personally though otherwise I'd "run what you brung" and lock the plate on the
stocker, no need to pay for an 009.  I did this on my MS with what was back
then called Squirt n Spark, I guess is now termed the MS Extra, on Dolan's old
2.2 liter Mark Stevens engine, but eventually sold the MS setup when I tore
down the engine.

engine?  Thanks!
