Subject: Re: New intelligent Battery charger- interesting findings

Courtney .. good thinking!
what you can do.. connect the charger so it says the error code again.. then 
install a booster cable from the neg terminal to the engine case,, and see 
if the error code clears. 

then .. seems like a good time to install a second ground cable.. from the 
battery term to the body,, and to the engine or trans or directly to the 
starter mounting stud.. 

as well as clean up your pos cable tooo...
