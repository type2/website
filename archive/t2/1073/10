Hello gang,

i know it's been a while since I've posted, but I've been a little devoid of
VW stuff for a while.

For the greater part of the winter, I've had my van parked and under a very
minimal insurance since I wasn't planning on driving it. Now that the summer
is coming, I wanna get her back on the road and legal. Geico is quoting me
about $25 a month for minimal coverage. Now I don't plan on driving her that
much since I put all the miles on my Civic. I'm curious as to what some of
you are doing for insurance and what you might be paying.

Overall, it'd be nice if I could get seasonal insurance, but I guess that
going 6 months at a time is about as seasonal as I'm gonna see for now.

Interested to hear from you all.
