Subject: Koni's on my 71 Westy 

I replaced the shocks on my 71 Westy with the Koni's awhile back. 2 thoughts
about them - the Westy doesn't pitch down on the front end when I apply the
brakes like before (yea) but the front end seems to be a little bit higher
than before and when I get into the bus the front end drops down a lot more.

 

Have not setup the shocks other than out of the box - anyone else set these
up for a Westy out there? I'd like to get your thoughts?

 

Thanks
