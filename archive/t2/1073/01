Subject: New headers interference problem question

Installed my new European Motorworks headers. The diameter is bigger than my
stock heater boxes were. I cannot get one of the  pushrod tubes to enter the
motor side of the engine as the header interferes half way along the pushrod
tube. The rest are fine. I am wondering if I should put a small indent/dent
into the header to clearance this problem, or a small indent into the pushrod
tube? Which would be a better solution? I know I shouldn't dent the pushrod
tube very far as it might contact the pushrod, but it IS easier to do. Would
appreciate your opinions please. I probably need to clearance about a 1/8
inch. My thought is that the pushrod inside mainly goes straight up and down
in the tube, so a small clearance ding on the side would be acceptable?? What
type of heat transfer would I get if the pushrod tube was actually touching
the header? Too much?? or is the thin metal of the PR tube, and the air
blowing going to minimize any problem? Simple minds would like opinions. :-)
Would appreciate your thoughts,
Courtney
