Subject: Bad Alternator

The battery in my '74 bus was dead this morning.  I took the battery up to Autozone and they recharged it for free, said its fine and said they'd check the alternator if I drove the bus in.  The guy says its giving off ~12 volts and 4-5 amps and that it needs to be replaced.

It worked fine (no battery problems) before I just had the engine replaced.  Might they have neglected to re-hook a wire or something?  The manual has some pretty clear step by step for replacing it but I thought I should ask here if maybe there's something I should check before I buy a replacement. 

Thanks for any help,
Steve
