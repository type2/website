Hmmmm, my digital meat thermometer oil temp gauge cost only $14 and I 
got to 250,000 original miles on my 78 FI motor- had to do 50 mph to 
keep from going over 250 deg in the summer; it never died, I retired it 
as the oil pressure was low and it was blowing oil.  Still had 125psi 
compression and functional rod bearings,but the cam bearings looked 
really chewed up. http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin
