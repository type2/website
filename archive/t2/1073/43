Subject: Re: New intelligent Battery charger- interesting findings

The battery charger gave me an error code of F02 which says "bad battery
connection". So, I moved the neg cable to the neg terminal of the
battery and the error code disappeared. So my thinking is:

"The ground strap to the engine/trans is not in good shape. Tomorrow I
will crawl under my van and clean all the ground strap connections. Any
opinions on this?

Definitely clean all the major connections (+ve and -ve) and then spray
them with terminal protector. This should be a regular maintenance
activity because it seems that most of the terminals have been placed
where they are subject to a lot of water, mud, grime, etc! :)
