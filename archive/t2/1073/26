Subject: Altenator light

Just want to make sure I'm right in thinking I need a new altenator.



While fixing a couple of things I left the ignition on for about 36 hours.
Lost the altenator light on the dash, started trying to run that down found
that I'm not getting any excitor current at the red wire on the voltage
regulator.  Light bulb good, wire to dash good, wire harness from voltage
regulator to altenator good, wire to starter/battery good.



What is the exact physical location of the excitor current's source?
