John,, you sound like a regular at Ithaca Beer Company !   lol

I was in Ithaca a couple years ago.. bought a nice Westfalia there,, very
close to the Ithaca Falls... which was worth the visit.

There are a lot of wineries in the finger lake region..  so a drive along
the roads that go between the lakes will offer vistas, etc. I have only
travelled the main roads for the most part ... I am about 5hrs north west ..
You should consider a stop at Watkins Glen State Park  It is a highlight in
the state and really should not be missed.




You should also check out the weekend Farmer's Market - an Ithaca
institution and one of it's highlights.




You might want to check out Niagara Falls .. will be about 3 hours each way.
A long day if you are not doing an overnight there.
