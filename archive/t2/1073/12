I did the quick web application in Nov. '08 and they gave me an annual quote 
of $74 for limited liability, '73 Westie, 2000 miles a year and some other 
basic requirements.  I have not persued it yet because I was curious on 
their ligitamicy.  Any one know how to determine whether an insurance agency 
is reputable before a claim needs to be made.
