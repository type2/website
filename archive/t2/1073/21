Subject: Odd oil leak

Was changing the oil in my upright engine today. As I poured in the second 
quart, I saw fresh oil dripping onto the floor below! Wierd I say, I 
immediately start looking to see where I spilled. No spills. Seems like a 
little oil ran out thru the rear seal/slinger. Anyone else experience this 
before? Maybe I  poured it in too fast?
