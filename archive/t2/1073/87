Subject: Re: Gauges: Non-Dakota and Good Quality Alternatives?

I will add my 2 cents about looking to the aviation side - while they're not as inexpensive as either DD or VDO, they *have* to be accurate to be certificated to go into an airplane.  I was looking at a multigauge a while ago that would have looked pretty awesome... and the (I think it's) UHT has these 1 1/4" gauges that fit anywhere, and aren't gaudy at all...

One thing tho, if you DO put aircraft gauges in, you have 2 issues - (1) is you need to make sure the senders are correct (which may take a bit of imagineering or creativity) and (2) some airplanes have a 28 volt electrical system, so make sure your voltages are compatible.

But were it me, that's what I'd do...  WELL worth the insurance of reliability.  Having a bad oil temp sender and a CHT gauge (an automotive brand, no names mentioned) both go bad at the same time crossing the central valley of California mid summer...  IMO cost me the 1600 out of the superbeetle I was commuting with at the time.  Had I known the temp was going up (bad timing from a loose distributor) I could have stopped and investigated (and cooled down)  instead of going merrily on my way until the clunk scrape wheeze killed my car being in the breeze...
