Subject: need help with piston rings

Hey Everyone,
So I ordered a Mahle 2 liter stock 94mm piston/cylinder/rings kit.  
While installing one of the cylinders, I broke off the top compression 
ring by accident.  I then had my mechanic order another set of rings but 
these ones are slightly different than the ones that come with the kit.  
The top ring is rounded along the inner side instead of the slant, and 
the third oiling ring has a spring running inside of it instead of the 
3-part oiling ring that comes with the kit.

Is there a reason for the difference?  Should I use the replacement 
setup instead?  I was just hoping to be able to replace the top ring 
with the same one, but I don't know how to get it.  A call to a parts 
supplier said they don't sell the same rings as the ones that come in 
the kit - seems kinda strange to me.

Any help would be MUCH appreciated.  The part number from the rings that 
I purchased is 029 198 175 BR.

Thanks!
Mike
