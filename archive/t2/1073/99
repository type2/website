Subject: Engine compartment

Any thoughts on how to go about cleaning out the engine compartment after
engine/gas tank removal. I don't have access to, or can afford a media
blaster, but I do have a power washer. Is it possible to just power wash the
compartment, then spray paint it? Should I use POR-15, or just auto paint.
There isn't much rust that I can see other than the battery trays and the
insides of the rear quarters. Also is there anyone/place who sells the rear
passenger side wheel wells. It's the place under the fridge in a '78 Westy.

Thanks for all of your help and safe driving this weekend.
