Subject: Re: [T2] Have installed aftermarket headers, here's some shots.

There is no pushrod to header contact. There is an air gap between each one. 
If someone has a stock setup handy, have a look at the clearance you have 
there. I should have checked that in order to be able to compare to the 
headers. Joe St.Croix is running the same setup and loves it.
