I would make whatever mods that needed to be made to the header to make 
it clear.  First on my list would be squeezing the header tube into an 
oval shape in that location.

I wouldn't mess with the pushrod tube because deforming it might cause 
the ends to not seal well.  It's hard enough to get the pushrod tubes to 
not leak oil without bending the tubes.
