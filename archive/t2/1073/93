The seat belts can all be installed before any of the rear bench is  
put in place.  Getting a bit of fuzzy memory here, but the outside  
belts that attach to the rear wheel wells may be easier to install  
before the bench piece is in place, specifically.  For me though, I  
normally just bolt all the belts in, the put in the bench, and then  
install the back-rest section.
