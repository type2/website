At the present time they are still available.  Koni makes these especially
for me. (Thanks go to Richard Atwell, who did the original sluething that
resulted in Koni agreeing to reproduce them the first time around.)
Practically every time I put in an order in, Koni gripes that it's not worth
their effort to make them and this really will be the last time.  I have to
order a boatload to convince them otherwise, and never know if they'll turn
me away the next time. So I never know if I'll have them for another three
weeks, three months, or three years.  Over time demand does diminish, so
frankly it is only a matter of time. Sooner or later - perhaps sooner - they
will inevitably go away, as Koni's volume requirements gradually go up and
demand gradually goes down.  Until then they will get incrementally more
expensive; Koni raises the price on me a little bit each time I reorder.

These are without any shadow of a doubt the best shocks you can possibly put
on your Bus, and worth every penny. They are certain to be the pinnacle of
what is/was available as a Bus shock. The adjustability allows you to
basically dial them into your taste. They are also lifetime warranted by
Koni so they are the last shocks you will ever have to buy.  Even if Koni
eventually stops producing them, their factory warranty says that they will
always rebuild them for you to original specs as long as you can produce a
receipt in your name.
