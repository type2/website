Subject: Third gear grind

Howdy,

Patient: 1975 standard transmission bus with 2.0 GD engine
Symptoms: Slight grind when shifting into 3rd (going up or down)

Specifics: I've been experiencing this issue since I purchased the bus
in October, since I haven't driven it during the winter I'm just now
getting around to diagnosis and resolution. Grinding when shifting
into 3rd. I can usually avoid the grind if I bump up my RPMs as I
shift into 3rd or if I wait for the engine RPMs to drop off before
shifting. Also it seems that if I very carefully shift while holding
the shift level all the way to the right I can avoid the grind.

What I've done to try and fix the issue: Replaced front shifter
bushing. Checked for excessive play at the rear shift coupler (there
was little/no play). Adjusted the shift plate. Adjusted the clutch.
None of these fixes appears to have had any impact on the issue. Also
replaced transmission fluid with GL4 (no idea what was in there before
but it looked pretty bad) - the magnetic drain plug did have some
metal filings but no chunks.

Plan: continue trying to adjust the shift plate in an attempt to find
the sweet spot. Shift carefully, try bring RPMs up while shifting.
Replace the middle and rear shifter bushings if I happen to have the
engine/transmission out. Hopefully locate and fix the issue.

It did occur to me that this might be a synchronizer issue but I'd
like to cover all my bases before assuming the worst.

Ideas, suggestions, similar experiences?

Thanks
Jules
