Subject: Seat belt configuration

Just pretty much finished the interior on this 74 transporter. It has taken
so long, I don't remember how the rear seat or the middle seat belts
installed. Sounds stupid and I thought I took photos but that's it. Anyone
have photos of typical rear seat install, i.e does the seat or top section
install first, and seat belt installation for the middle seat?

Appreciate it!
