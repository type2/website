Hey,

I have been reading several reports on various guages.

I am interested in the Cylinder head temp.

In my life I have dealt with many poor guages. However someone did note that the VDO was a trend.

Is a gas tank meter just a trend?

The oil light signifys danger as it is inline with the oil path. That is a fast one.

Seeing your CHT rise and fall as a trend is a good indicator. It will have a lag time due to the nature of the thermocoupler/ natural heat.

Someone mentioned to get thermocouple wire all the way to the dash. Now I see that as a good idea.

This is just the stuff I have raked together from lurking.

Thanks for your posts on this.

Alan
