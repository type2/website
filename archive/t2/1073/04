Subject: Thanks

I just wanted to send out a big thanks to everyone whether its with my problem
or another bus as I learn from all. My latest problem involved fuel, or lack
of it. After trying everything else including taking a bath in gas trying to
replace all the fuel lines & filters, I found the fuel pump was barely
working. I opted for an electric and even put in a regulator valve just in
case.
 
Now for the funny part.
 
I spent three days trying to figure out why it wouldnt fire at all. Everything
was dialed in wonderful, set just where they should be ad nothing. I thought
it was flooded at first. Wild idea on the third day...maybe I reversed the
hoses to the pump. It pumps great...all the gas from the carbs and back into
the tank! I quickly reversed the hoses and it started imediately...WHOOOHOO!
 
Anyway...thanks again and hope ya get a good chuckle
