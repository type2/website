Hey, Volks:

Buses by the Beach 7th Annual may have been the best yet.  so many cool
buses, great food, fantastic music (Stone Boogie Band on Friday night and
Rossevelt Diggs on Saturdy night.  Brew from the HopCap Brewery and lots of
home brew was also a great part of the event.  We once again beat the
Mustang club for most vehicles at the burn survivor car show.  Wish I back
there at Gran Rogue right now!

Many, Many Thanks to our sponsors for making the raffle and silent auction a
big success!  We also had so many awesome items for our Volks attendees that
made it special.  Thanks to everyone who helped!

Everything was the best ever - except for my baby, the '79 Aardvark
overheating and dying on 196 near Saugatuk, Michigan.  Got it started when I
got it home and it cooled off, but it has a big banging sound like a stuck
lifter, but worse.  Will dig into it later.

Anyway, check out pics here:
