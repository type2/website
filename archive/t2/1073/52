I finally put mine on two weeks ago.  They replaced the 15-year-old
KYB Gas-a-just shocks.  The Konis were set to their middle position.
I'm noticing little difference.  Feel every expansion joint I run
over kind of firmness.  Excellent handling while cornering and if
braking hard.

In addition, I have a sway bar kit front/rear and Load range D
light truck tires.  Nice to know that if I need to I can go to the
low setting and try that out in the future.


These new shocks were in preparation for a trip from L.A. to MT via
US 93.  Hopefully I will be able to take NV 318 and not get caught
up in any aftermath of the Nevada Open Road Challenge this weekend.
