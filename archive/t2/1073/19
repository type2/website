Subject: Have installed aftermarket headers, here's some shots.

I took some quick shots of the aftermarket headers I've installed on my 77
Westy. The install wasn't too difficult, basically just a bolt it up thing,
EXCEPT that I had to clearance a pushrod tube very gently by about 1/8" to
clear a header tube. I guess manufacturing jigs on these headers can be off
after a few years. In any case, it was no big deal, just had to think it
through, and I appreciate all the comments I recieved from the list.

The downside, is of course no more heaterbox heat, but I live on Vancouver
Island, which is pretty temperate, and I still have a gas heater, and my Mr.
Buddy heater for backup. The exhaust is also louder now, as you only have
thinwall headers to kill the noise, not big cast aluminum and steel
heaterboxes.

The up side is WAY easier access to EVERYTHING. I can pull my alternator in
about 10 minutes now! I can see the oil dipstick bellows and change it too if
needed. I can remove the complete exhaust system in about 5 minutes.

So far I"m quite impressed. If I were living in the warmer southern climate of
the US I would have done this years ago. Still have to block off the holes
from where the fan above the motor pushes air down into the heaterboxes, the
ends of the fan shroud where it blew into the heaterboxes, and close off the
tubes that went to the front.
Here's the pics,
