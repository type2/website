Subject: Cam Follower Gallery Orientation

Hello all,

after the long fuel tank story (featuring a disintegrating filler hose,
plugged carbs and overheated cylinder heads) I got my shiny overhauled
cylinder heads back from the rebuilder. Over the weekend I found some time to
install them, which was quite comfortable having the engine on an engine
stand. I rotated the engine 90 degrees to each side so to have it level with
respect to the cylinder head, but forgot, that I already removed the push rod
tubes and push rods. What happened is that one of the cam followers fell out
(on a blanket, so it wasn't damaged). Since I have never removed the followers
and have no manual that explicitly states the orientation of the gallery, I'm
asking for help in pointing me out what the correct orientation is.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
