we sell quite a bit of VDO product and don't have any significant  
issues with quality. they are not perfect but neither are dakota  
digital gauges. and the DD gauges are outright ugly in my opinion so  
they are not a good option. yes i care how they look.

there are lots of other option in the aircraft world, and some that  
even look at home in a bus. i've never used any of them however. but  
if you go to a website like aircraftspruce.com you'll see them.
