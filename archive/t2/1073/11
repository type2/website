Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance

I am currently running collector car insurance on my bus.  It is 
incredibly cheap, I have two vehicles with this company and it is 
$250/year for full, stated-value coverage for both vehicles.  I am 
limited to 3,000 miles per year, can't drive them to work, have to keep 
them in a locked garage and have to have other insurance for my daily 
driver but I meet all of those requirements so it works out well for me. 
  E-mail me privately for the name and contact information for the 
insurance company if you're interested.  There are many companies that 
offer this type of insurance but most will not insure a clapped out old 
bus like mine.  This one will.
