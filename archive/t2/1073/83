Subject: Gauages: Non-Dakota and Good Quality Alternatives?

Volks,

I am in the process of replacing/debugging some of my gauges at the moment.

I know from discussions here that VDOs tend to have accuracy (and quality)
issues, and that a lot of people prefer Dakota Digital gauges as an
accurate, high-quality alternative.

I have a dilemma, however, in that I really dislike the digital gauges: for
whatever reason, they just irk me.  Especially the color scheme of the 
Dakota Digital gauges.

So I'm curious: are there any quality, analog guages out there?  What
brands might be reasonable?

Any experiences?

Thanks,
   Tom
