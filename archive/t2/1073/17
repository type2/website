Subject: re:MAYDAY-MAYDAY Oil screen removed for oil change

Not sure if this was answered yet, but it didn't look like it.

You should get an oil change kit at your local VWFLAPS. There will be two
paper gaskets, and a new copper washer for the main drain plug, and I think
new washers for all the little studs that hold the plate to the bottom of
the engine. Put the paper gaskets on either side of the screen, then the
metal plate on. Install all your stud nuts. And put your main plug in. I
can't remember if the correct torque is 8 or 11. I usually put them in kind
of tight(which I know is very relative) then fill it up with oil, go for a
short drive. Come home and look, if I see any oil leaking, or seeping, I
tighten them a little bit more. Repeat until you don't see a leak, or it
feels like you are actually exerting 'real' pressure to tighten them. That
could mean that the plate is warped, and therefore is not sitting flat on
the bottom of the engine, and no matter how much you tighten it, you won't
stop the leaking. Get a new plate, or figure out how to straighten the plate
you have.

Hope that helps.

Was writ:
I just started my spring oil change.

It appears I dropped the oil screen.

It has a paper gasket saturated by oil.

Thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated to ensure no leaks on
re-installation.

I am expecting torque to be 11 inch pounds.

Thanks,

Alan
