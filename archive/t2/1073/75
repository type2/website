I've had reasonable results shipping an engine by Yellow Freight.
and Boston Bob shipped his engine to me via Fed Ex ground. but both
were strapped down and then a plywood box was built around it.

figure about $100 or a little more and at least a week-10 days to get
it to MD.

nice would be finding someone who was headed that way.

with other things I have had decent results shipping via Amtrak and
Greyhound but timing can be a little spotty because it goes space
avaliable.
