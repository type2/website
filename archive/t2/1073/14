Subject: can FI have vapor lock?/odd gurgle in gas tank

Have had some problems getting the 78 camper to restart after running 
for a while (hot).  Starts immediately cold, but after a run of at least 
20 miles, it would not restart, and I noticed the following- one can 
hear "bubbles" gurgling somewhere near the gas tank. I hear it from the 
engine compartment and when I opened the gas cap I heard a whoosh of 
pressure, and could hear the gurgling down the fill pipe.  It is in 
bursts (not continuous) about 2 seconds apart, and lasted for the 20 min 
I hung around.  In case it was the coil, I switched it and it 
reluctantly started today, so I am not sure if it was this or the 
pressurized tank I released.  In the past when this happened I did check 
for spark (ok) and fuel pressure (in normal range) and voltage at the 
injectors.  The first time this happened (last Sept) I left it overnight 
and it still did not start, but the battery may have been run down from 
all the cranking, and I got it going with direct connection to coil and 
fuel pump. Any ideas as to gurgling and hard start?
