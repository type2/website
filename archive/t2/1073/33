Subject: New intelligent Battery charger- interesting findings

I picked up a new Vector VEC1092A Smart Battery Charger that tests
alternators, and reconditions sulphated batteries etc. One of the things that
happened however made me realize that this thing also checks for grounds. As
an example, I hooked it up to the + terminal, then put the neg. cable on the
engine case of my 77 Westy. The battery charger gave me an error code of F02
which says "bad battery connection". So, I moved the neg cable to the neg
terminal of the battery and the error code disappeared. So my thinking is:
"The ground strap to the engine/trans is not in good shape. Tomorrow I will
crawl under my van and clean all the ground strap connections. Any opinions on
this?
