Subject: Shipping an engine

Folks,

I need some suggestions. I have an engine in Portland, OR, that  
Myonnie needs in College Park, MD. What are my best options shipping  
this beast? Any suggestions for reliable and affordable shippers? I  
can strap it to a pallet and take it to a shipping depot. We are  
talking about a fully assembled type 4 motor sans flywheel and heater  
boxes.

Thanks,
Marcus
