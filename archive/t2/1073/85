Subject: Gauages: Non-Dakota and Good Quality Alternatives?

I too have found the VDO's to work well.  Around the Sacramento area, the VDO
three packs (in Jettas etc) can be had for >$20 including the sensors. IIRC,
someone once posted the correct sensor to convert the water temp to head temp
or oil temp.  Coming from an old aircraft instrument tech, no cheap gauge is
going to last forever, but at that price you can afford to have a spare or
two.  The gauge itself rarely fails, usually it is wiring or sensor problems. 
In automobiles, the voltage regulator inside the instrument cluster determines
much of your calibration accuracy. In aircraft instruments the voltage
reference is generally inside each instrument.  Hard to make a really nice
looking LED/Plasma based digital that suits a period dash.  It should be easy
for DD to provide alternate bezels to fit different panel styles. jon
