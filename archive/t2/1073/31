Subject: Re: More on hard starting when hot

We decided to try jumping it first, and it did start- I
timed it and did notice that the distributor lags on returning to the
proper advance position, so I wonder if when hot the weights may stick
and leave the timing way too advanced when stopped?  Next will lube it!

If you have a vacuum advance distributor it could be the plate operated by the
vacuum mechanism. I suggest you strip down the distributor and check/lubricate
the internals. Not hard to do.
