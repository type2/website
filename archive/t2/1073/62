Subject: Re: [T2] Question about bolt that holds front bumper on (71

Originally they are a 10mm Thread Bolt, 20mm Length, with a 17mm Hex Head.

Never identify a bolt or nut size by the Hex Head size because the actual
thread size can be different.  So Hex Heads mean nothing to me or a fastener
supply house.  You'll usually end up with what you DON'T want.

Cheers :-)
