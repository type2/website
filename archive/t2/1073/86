Actually, the real issue is that the VDO sensor is that it is not 
temperature compensated, so that's where most of your error comes from.  
The Dakota Digital gauge uses thermocouple wire the entire length of the 
run.  Plus, I think it also warms up inside the unit as well to assist 
with the temperature compensation.

While the DD gauge isn't the prettiest, it seems to be quite accurate 
and the high-temp warning is extremely handy.  Build quality is very 
good and the customer service has been great.
