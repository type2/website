Subject: New VW Bus Manual

Just purchased a VW van Restore manual by Mark Paxton Called, How to restore
VOLKSWAGEN BUS, and published by Veloce Publishing...www.veloce.co.uk.  For
any one who can read..from novice mechanic to able restorer..there are
excellent color photos, and detailed descriptions for anything from bodywork
to motors to suspension to paint...just everything you want to know about your
van!  Looking forward to my next 'teardown' of some component on my ride with
enthusiasm.  Check it out.  Cheers
