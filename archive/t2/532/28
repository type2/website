Subject: Windshield wipers

Hello I have a small problem. I went out to start my
bus(78 Westy) and the wipers started going. I thought
maybe I bumped the switch, that but no matter what I
did they didn't stop. They just go at slow speed, and
would not shut off. I thought something in the switch
broke, so I pulled the switch out and it is fine. Even
with the switch unplugged the wipers continue to go. I
have unplugged the connector at the motor itself, and
that has stopped the wipers. I've traced the wires as
best as I can while standing on my head, but I don't
see any shorts or bad wires. This has never happend
before, So does anyone have a suggestion? I really am
going to hate having to pull the motor if I have to.
So any input would be nice, maybe I've missed
something. Thanks for any help,
Shawn Reed
