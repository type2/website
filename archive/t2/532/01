Tom,

www.shockwaverider.com/avp/

http://www.shockwaverider.com/newengine/

www.shockwaverider.com/newbus/

About 1,000 miles so far, runs better and gets better gas mileage with 
every fill up.

I had to redo one side with a new valve cover gasket at the very 
beginning....that's all so far!


Cheers, dave
