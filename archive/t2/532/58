Subject: Exhaust system diagram

this is my last post on this subject today, I promise
;^)
Can someone point me to an online diagram (with parts
labelled) of a late bay (78) exhaust system. I have
never worked on anything newer than a 71 and I don't
even know what parts are involved in the exhaust
system of a 78.
