Subject: Pacesetter exhaust- T2 Library snippet

Looking for an exhaust system for a 78 bus. Found this
info in the library:
>>'75-78 heat exchangers have a triangular output
flange, and require a whole network of
no-longer-available piping to go to the heads (as
opposed to the '72-74 heat exchangers, which are fully
self-contained). Furthermore, an original quality
(stock) exhaust system is no longer available for the
'75-78 heat exchangers, leaving you with the $79
Pacesetter system as your best option for these years,
if you want to use your stock heat exchangers.<<
So my question is:  Where can I find this Pacesetter
system and are the stock heater boxes required in this setup?
