Subject: Rear Hatch Adjustment

Anyone ever adjusted the rear hatch? I have over a 1/4 difference in the gap
between the hatch on the left side vs, the right. THe door catch on the left
side is really squished.

The hatch shuts find but I'd like to see if I can get in lined up better, it
leaks a little back there and this might be a cause. The rear hatch rubber is
is good condition.

Thanks,
