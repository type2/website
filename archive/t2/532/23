Did you say you have the Bentley?? Remove the steering wheel and upper 
switches. Remove lock bolt for housing clamp. Turn key to unlock column and 
pull the housing off. Find tiny screw that holds the electrical portion of 
the switch. R&R switch. You don't need to remove the key cylinder housing 
unless the tab is broken or it is worn badly.
