Subject: Re: [T2] Powder Coating your TIN - anyone?

Power coated is good (i have done several sets of tin) if you can find a budget price. The prices range from $50+ for 1 wheel in VA to 16 wheels here in TN for $40. 

I also use a good spray paint (rattle can). Gun paint is even better. 

I also like Rustoleum's brush on hammer paint and their wrinkle paint.
