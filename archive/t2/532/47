mike,

i know very little about MS, but here is my two cents anyhow:

i am doubtful that a high idle would be caused by the injectors. the idle
speed is affected by the amount of AIR, not fuel. there is nothing the
injectors could be doing (or not doing) that would cause the idle to be
high.

can you regulate the idle effectively with the idle adjustment screw on the
throttle valve?
