Sorry, I own both Vanagons and a Eurovan.  If the original poster needs a VW and needs handicap access with A/C and auto, there is no reason not to get an early Eurovan.  The modern conviences of A/C, auto, and P/S are well integrated into the platform as opposed to being decades of forced add-ons.

The really over-riding consideration is the driver's seat.  The Eurovan seat sits flat on the floor, while the others sit on the wheel well.  In order to have the flexibility to add a seat that is handicap friendly there is no other choice.

It's water-cooled, front-engined, etc, but it's still a VW at heart.  Give the Eurovan some consideration.  There is a Canadian company that does conversions with lifts, etc. I think I found them with a Google for RVs based on the Eurovan.
