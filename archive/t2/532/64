Subject: Re: [T2] J-tubes for Late bays-Do they exist???

I had two pretty curvy pipes made to fit my Corvair powered '78 Westy. He used the Corvair flanges where the pipes connected to the heater logs and provided 2 hangers. $50. 

Source: local muffler shop. They also pushed my bus back on the trailer for me.
