Thanks so much Dave! Excelent work, you should be proud!

I assume the pics of the engine without the tin on represent what was on 
the engine when you recieved it. I was wondering if the sump covers came 
with the engine or if I had to reuse my own. I'm guessing from your 
remark about the gasket, that the valve covers were also on when delivered?.

Looks like I might be putting a few little thing back on the core before 
I send it back.

Smile when you drive that bus.
Thanks
Tom
