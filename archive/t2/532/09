You are correct--

Regardless of what trans is in the Bus--the speedo drive cable will
always read off the wheel hub--

Wonder what this was all about?? 

The only thing that will cause the speedometer reading to be off is the
wheel and tire diameter--

Early bay window Busses will not accurately report your speed if you put
185R14C tire on. ... Eventually VW changed the tranny to make things
right. 

Could someone explain how changing the transmission could effect the
speedometer reading. I thought all bays drive the speedo from the left
front wheel.
