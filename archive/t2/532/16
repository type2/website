Subject: disabled bus

Hi all,

I own a 75 Westy with a manual trans.  Three years ago, I was in a car 
accident (not in the bus) and I'm now a quadriplegic, unable to drive stick 
shift.  I'm looking for advice on finding and adapting another Westy 
(automatic, obviously) for use by a disabled driver - I'd love a bug at some 
point too.

I drive with hand controls and, yes, I realize the lack of power steering 
will give me a workout since I have to steer with one hand.  I also need to 
be able to get my wheelchair in and out and a/c (maybe a swamp cooler?) is a 
must.

Let's put the creativity I know you all have to work!  I look forward to 
your input.

Thanks!
