Subject: bus idles high when warm

I can't seem to figure out why my bus is idling high when it gets warm 
after driving on the freeway.  It's a brand new engine, new hoses, new 
clamps, new practically everything.  I don't think I have any major 
vacuum leaks or anything like that.  I've even pulled pulled and plugged 
the vacuum line that actuates the decel valve in hopes that maybe that 
was faulty.  Is there anything else to test to see what might be causing 
this high idle?

I guess I'll go through one more time with the starting fluid and test 
for vacuum leaks, but I think I got 'em all pretty good...

it's a 78 2liter.  Oh, and it did the same thing on my other engine, too.

Mike
