Subject: Thanks

I wanted to thank everyone (and there were many) who responded to my question
concerning an isolated accessory battery.  It was all great information.
Unfortunately, it becomes moot in my case - my 72 ASI Campmobile was stolen
from my driveway last night.

I will shortly be in the market to replace this car, so if anyone has
something similar for sale, I'd appreciate hearing about it.

Thanks,
Kurt H.Selvig
