Yes, the idle screw does work fine.

You know what.. lemme go check the aux air valve and make sure that 
thing's working ok.  I might crank the adjusting nut on it to make it 
open more, then drop the idle down a little when warm and maybe it'll 
equalize things out a little bit better.

As far as the MS, it's a manifold pressure base system, so any air leak 
after the throttle plate would be just like opening the throttle plate. 
  But I'm just wondering if a heated engine would cause more vacuum leaks?

thanks,
Mike
