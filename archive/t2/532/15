Mike,

Is this the one with megasquirt on it?

Check your megasquirt datalogs?  Solid lifters if I remember correctly?
Last adjustment on the solids?



How high is high idle?

If this is the one with megasquirt on it, you should only have to worry
about intake leaks *after* the throttle body and no place else.

Maybe one of your injectors really likes to be hot before it works good?
Cold start injector disconnected?


Cheers, dave
