Subject: Oval exhaust port gasket on late bays

Bus Boys (and Bus Depot) list two different copper exhaust port gaskets.  
Bus Depot breaks their distinction at 1700 and then 1800-2000 (oval ports to 
'78)  Same part numbers as Bus Boys'

Is there a difference between the 1700 and the 1800-2000 gaskets, and what 
would that difference be??


From Bus Boys' site:

021-256-251A  Copper Gasket Ring-Exhaust Port/Cylinder Head (2 Per Heater 
Box Required)  $.65   Bus Boys for '72-74

039-256-251 Copper Gasket Ring-Exhaust Port/Cylinder Head  $1.05 Bus Boys 
for '75-78
