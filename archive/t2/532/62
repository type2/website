Subject: Re: [T2] Powder Coating your TIN - anyone?

If you have the money, go powder.  It'll give you one of the best 
finishes.  If you have the time, go with a nice enamel.  I used 
Rustoleum and it came out nice, but it really needs a long time to dry 
(probably like any enamel) so that it won't smudge.  It was alot of 
work, especially to sandblast everything and then paint each piece.  A 
spray booth is very handy.
