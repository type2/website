Subject: Indexing impeller fan

Everyone make a note of the date: I didn't take enough photos. ;-)

Can someone tell me how the fan indexes to the pulley on the front? I
separated the two for painting and forgot to notice that the timing mark
means only 1 of 4 positions is correct. Anyone with a fan lying around?
