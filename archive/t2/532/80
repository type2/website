Subject: Fuel filler hose

 Hi all
 I have just purchased and fitted a nesw fuel filler hose to Polly, the one
 that connects to the tank on a post 72.  As far as I was awase this was
 unavailable and I have been trying to fit a chopped version of the old one.
 The new one is about 2-3mm thicker and made of and slightly more flexible,
 but it fitted like a glove AND the stck clips fit too!

 This all took me about 5 mins.

 I can forward the details if anyone would like to know more.

 John
