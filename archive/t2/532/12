I think you have correctly identified the problem area. It sounds like
your decel valve is leaking.  Disconnecting the small vacuum hose that
controls it will not cure the problem however.

To test the decel valve you should remove it from the bus and apply air
pressure to one or the other of the large hoses.  No air should pass it at
this point.  Then attach a vacuum source such as a Mity-Vac to the control
port. Apply air pressure to the large hose and gradually draw a vacuum on
the control line.  No air should pass until the vacuum on the control port
reaches a certain critical level after which the diaphram should open and
air should pass freely.  The opening of the diaphram should be very abrupt
and will occur in the 18-21" vacuum range. The exact opening vauum is part
of the specification for the valve and different valves open at different
vacuums but 20" seems to be about standard for VWs.

If your valve fails the test then you may order a replacement as they are
still produced or you may remove the system by sealing the points where
both large hoses enter the intake system as well as the control line.  I
recommend replacement over removal as this system does reduce pollution
during deceleration quite a bit.

                             OOK!
