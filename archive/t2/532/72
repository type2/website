you can get brand new axles/cvs ready to install for 120.00 per side
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=211501203

or rebuilt for around 80
for example autozone (almost every chain flaps would do)
http://www1.autozone.com/servlet/UiBroker?UseCase=C001&UserAction=performMoreDetail&Parameters=TRUE%7C%7ECV+HALFSHAFT+%28REMANUFACTURED%29%7C%7E%2445.00%7C%7ECCT%7C%7EFITS+EITHER+SIDE++++%7C%7EFALSE%7C%7EFALSE%7C%7E26571%7C%7E1255%7C%7E8395%7C%7ENONE%7C%7E%2479.99%7C%7EVOLKSWAGEN+TRUCK%7C%7ETRANSPORTER%7C%7E1974%7C%7ELLT%7C%7E15.0%7C%7EEA%7C%7EV

if they are giving you trouble I just cant imagine it being worthwhile to
mess with or replace both cv's rather than just doing the whole
halfshafts.
