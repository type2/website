It must just be me then -- I had to play around with the 1/2 side to get 
the heaterbox on because the studs on #1 weren't parallel and on #2
they weren't straight.  No big deal, but annoying.

>Hal, how may miles on yours and how is it running?  

Right now mine still has 0 miles.  The engine is in the garage, but 
the bus is 50 feet away in the driveway. =)  I'll have it installed and
broken in by the end of the week as long as the weather holds..
