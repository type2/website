Yeah, it is the MS.

Solid lifters and only one valve has needed adjustment within the 
engine's first 1000 miles.  The others are rock solid.  Cold-start disabled.

The idle seems to be somewhere around 1500.

I guess there could be a vacuum leak somewhere after the throttle plate, 
but I'd think that'd affect the rpms at both cold and hot temps.

It's not the decel valve because I can pull the hose that goes between 
the S-tube and the valve with no change in rpm.

I'm really wondering if the injectors are the culprit here.  I'll see if 
I can get my other set of injectors cleaned...
