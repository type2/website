Is it the can, or the spout?  Can the spout be modified into something
usable?

My larger gas cans don't have a separate vent.  They have a little tube
inside the larger nozzle that extends down into the can several inches.
This provides the vent when the can is inverted.

I think the black market will be in nozzles, not in cans.  I have a
feeling that "water cans" will become much more popular in the future.
