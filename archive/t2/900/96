Subject: starter problem?

Hey guys.  I just ran up to Hixson and pulled some more parts off  a donor bus.  When I got back home, she sat for a while and I  jumped in to run to the store.  No start.  Nada.  I  think I could hear the starter click but I checked all the connections  and everything seemed to be hooked up right.  Well, after doing  some other stuff I checked it again and it fired right up.  Hasn't  done it again yet.  But I'm thinking I hit a dead spot on the  starter.  It's less than a year old.   If it happens  again, I'm going to have somebody else turn it over to see if I can  hear the starter engaging.  Then I'll hit it with a  hammer.   Anything else I could be missing?  Thanks....KR
