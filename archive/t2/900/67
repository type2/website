I recall that there used to be an old guy near the intersection of Joppa Road and Harford Road in the Towson area (I could be off on the location -- it's been a while since I lived there) who worked on ACVWs.  Tony, I think is his name, and he was from Poland.  He worked alone, but did fantastic work.  He was very old school and used to get angry at me for doing non-factory things to my cars.
