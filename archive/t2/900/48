by the way its a real nice bus that needs a restoration work but he
wants it running right first.



hey Mario that is the normal way of doing things later mark d



This is just to update the problem with the 78 bus that wouldn't run 
above 45 mph,,,
Turns out that the fuel feed line from the tank to the left side of the 
engine was clogged only letting a small amount of fuel thru .
I removed the tank and cleaned it along with the metal feed line.
For some reason the fuel pump stopped pumping about 2 minutes after 
every thing was reconnected.
Installed a new fuel pump and everything is fine.

This bus sat for 4 years with gas in the tank...Very bad idea.
