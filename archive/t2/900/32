Having heard credible accounts of a Vanagon Synchro Crewcab fitted
with a V 10 TDI engine (five litres, 313 hp, out of a Phaeton or
Touareg), I dare doubt that.  The TUeV has loosened up quite a bit
in the last couple decades with regard to what is and what isn't
possible.  They seem to have a "if you're gonna do it, do it right"
policy now.

Airhowlingly yours,
