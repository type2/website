Dave,

Nice pics - thanks.  I've been thinking about replacing my old piston
compressor (unknown condition - haven't found the right best as yet) with a
rotary... could you provide the parts list you came up with to install your
compressor (sourcing and pricing would be great if possible).

Thanks again,

Wayne
