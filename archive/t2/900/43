George,

OK, it's the spout... where can one get replacement spouts that work well
and will fit on older gas cans without leaking?

Is it the can, or the spout?  Can the spout be modified into something
usable?

My larger gas cans don't have a separate vent.  They have a little tube
inside the larger nozzle that extends down into the can several inches.
This provides the vent when the can is inverted.
