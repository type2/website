Subject: Fabrication Material

Hello everyone.  I have had my 72 Bus about 11 years and have been on  
this list that long although I don't post very often.  A while ago my  
bus engine blew up, usual dropped valve.  I replaced it with a  
Corvair engine which works pretty well but isn't a perfect fit.  It  
is hot here in Maryland and my tin work is not helping the engine  
stay cool as it should.  I'd like to find some material to fabricate  
a better air seal.  The material needs to be flexible like cloth or  
inner tube material but also fire resistant (won't catch on fire or  
melt).  Any ideas?
Thanks,
John Ingram
