An easy solution to that would be a bit of gas tank sealant as found in 
the motorcycle shops. No you shouldn't have to do that (extra cost 
making the metal cans more expensive than their plastic cousins) but if 
you already have a can and want to save it...

I used the tank sealant once on an old Hodaka. Worked fine. As with 
anything, prep is the key. If any of my metal cans begin to leak I'll 
seal the bottom several inches. THAT might be why the Swiss retired the 
jerry cans I bought for so cheap. They might sell them before they 
develop any bad habits like leaking...
