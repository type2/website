Don-
The tin that was on the Corvair motor won't fit where the type4 tin  
was. and the type 4 tin won't attach to the Corvair engine.  I  
thought I'd put the corvair tin on the engine and then trim it so it  
will fit within the body.   Then I would use the "new" flexible  
material to fill in the 3-4 inch gap around the edges.
