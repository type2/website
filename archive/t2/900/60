Subject: Re: [T2] why the Corvair conversions?

Ooh, I want one.   No, I'd really just like to have a  Corvair.  Well forget that, I can't even find a decent, affordable  Karmann Ghia.  Or a Thing.  Guess I'll just have to rebuild  my $50 2.0 for now.  Cheers...KR

is about the same b/c the 95 has more torque. I joined the local Corvair 
club and am currently serving as the club president. Has been a great 
way to learn about the engines and a great way to find parts.

Plenty of parts out there in case you are wondering. Also ALOT of tech 
now as some of the members have added fuel injection, water misting 
systems for quicker cooling, lookup the SafeGuard system (retards 
individual cylinders when necessary), there is a 5 speed project, etc.
