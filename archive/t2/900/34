I find many things at Mcmaster-carr:  (http://www.mcmaster.com)

I found this:

Foil-Faced Fiberglass Sheets
 Temperature Range: 00 to 4500 F
 Heat Flow Rate: 0.22 Btu/hr. x in./sq. ft. (-at-)750 F
 Color: Yellow with aluminum foil

and this:

Melamine Foam Sheets
 Temperature Range: -400 to +3500 F
 Heat Flow Rate: 0.26 Btu/hr. x in./sq. ft. (-at-)750 F
 Color: White
     Perfect for use on ducting, tanks, and other slightly curved surfaces,
these lightweight sheets have a porous open-cell structure that absorbs
moisture. They can be cut with a razor knife and installed with adhesive tape
or mounting hardware using washers. The 2" thick sheets have relief cuts to
ease installation and relieve swelling in humid areas. Density is 0.6 lbs./cu.
ft. Meet ASTM E-84 for flame and smoke.


It seems that you need something like a blanket but one that can be well
fastened to seal air and stay in place.  Maybe something like that listed
above can be made to work.  I am thinking of this laying across your gap and
screws with a metal band holding it in place.

Something like this:

(note: 0 = screw, ---- = edge of metal band)
