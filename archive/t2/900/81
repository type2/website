Subject: Re: [T2] glass removal

If you are planning on replacing all seals and just cut the seals to  
get the glass out.  This approach took me about 1/2 hour and I did  
not need a helper, although that is advised.

Just stick a knife between the glass and the seal and cut on through,  
go around and 1/2 of the seal will fall away and the glass will be free.
