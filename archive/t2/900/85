Dick's autohaus in Wye Mills go to the intersection of 50 and 213 I think
(either that or 404) and turn left he's just a short distance on the
right.  not sure if they even have addresses in that town.

sorry I could drive right to it but hard to give directions.  there's only
two traffic lights in town, it is one of those, first one I think
