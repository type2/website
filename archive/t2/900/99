I love this quote:

"This unique event is demonstrative of how Volkswagen is opening up: we
made a clear appeal to the market - potential buyers could help choose the
name Tiguan. The positive reaction shows that this is the right approach."

Let's see, let a random group of people choose between five different
inane names and this somehow says that VW is "opening up".  Heck, the only
difference is that their "focus group" is a bit larger and less private!

There is also a rather silly assumption that getting a committee of people
together will help design a better car.  The Edsel was designed by a
committee, the Bug and Bus were designed by brilliant engineers.
