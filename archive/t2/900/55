That has been the only real challenging part of the implant project. 
Create a vertical sheet metal wall whose top edge matches the VW seal 
lib. Then cap it with a horizontal piece of sheet metal that follows the 
perimeter of the engine bay with 1/4" of clearance or so. No trim the 
metal and grind it down so it fits just right and looks right. At that 
point you can use the VW perimeter seal. I also used a few sections of 
aluminum "L" to create that lip as well. Many cuts with my grind to get 
it to bend and flex. I'll later fill all of these cuts with either JB 
Weld (sand to smooth surface) or buy one of those aluminum welding rods 
which can be applied with a torch. When I'm all done it will all get a 
coat of paint and look pretty normal and best of all the bus has not 
been altered so I can pop the VW drivetrain back in later if I want. 
This point was important to me.

Access to a MIG welder or oxy-acetelyene torch is the key.
