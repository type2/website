  Kevin-
-Air cooled flat engine
-More power (110hp)
-Hydraulic valves
-parts available including performance parts
-11 lbs less than a type 4 engine
-Very high rebuild quality possible.  The Corvair engine is a  
favorite among home built airplane builders.  They MUST rebuild to a  
high standard. Check out:

-Corvair transmission fits with the VW axles,
When I started looking for a used type 4 engine I found many busses  
with a blown engine or no engine.  When you find a Corvair in a junk  
yard it may be a rusty wreck but it usually has an engine that is  
still useable.  I bought a rebuilt type 4 for a bus I bought with no  
engine and it did not last long.  It had a poorly patched head that  
did not hold up.  It did however make it past the warrantee.
The Corvair is worth looking into as a possible engine for a bus.  I  
thought it was worth a try.
The Nader thing is not really an issue.  GM and the others have made  
many terrible unsafe cars since the Corvair and no one said  
anything.  Pinto, Maverick,  Vega,  Sunbird, Chevete.......  The  
Corvair was never that bad.  Besides he wasn't talking about the engine.
