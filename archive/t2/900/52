Subject: Re: [T2] Annapolis MD Mechanic/Body Work Needed

 Winston's in Delmar on the Shore does good work, is very reasonable, but can 
 take a long time. He seems to have the Shore attitude of "I'll get to it when I 
get to it."
 
 By the way, Hi everyone, I'm Mark, I've been lurking here for several months.  I bought my '71 bus in March of '05 right after my grandmother died, so I named 
 her Pearl, after my GM, the engine blew two weeks later and I took it to 
 Winston's for a new engine.  A year later I got it back, and it took him about 
 ten days to do the work, I just didn't stay on his ass apparently. But the 
 engine runs great. I paid $800 for the bus, got $100 back from the PO when the 
 engine blew and paid $600 for the engine, and I drive her to work every day, so 
 I think I'm doing okay. Hell, she runs better than my girlfriend's Toyota  that 
 we put $600 into last month.  Anyway, I'd like to thank you all for the info 
 I've gotten from you, I'll be bugging the hell out of you in the months to  come.

Mark
 (I avoided naming the bus Van Morrison, although I hope to drive her to the show 
 in Fairfax, VA next week.)
