Subject: 78 bus rotary compressor pics

Folks,

"Finally" have the pics of my rotary compressor install in my 78 
Champagne edition.

These are *not* 56k safe.

Please don't rag on me about the multiple washers used for spacing....that 
fix will come later.

Right now, the important thing to know is that it blows 48 degree
air when it is getting 91 degree air sucked in.  It will make
a turkey thermometer stuck in one of Ron's cupholders read 75 degrees
in about 5 minutes.  And after 2 exits on the freeway at top speed, I 
start getting goose bumps on my legs from the cold....my temporary CHT 
gauge never went over 375(but we know what that's worth).


The last pic just shows what it all looks like after the tin is buttoned
back up.

Here are the first series that I did last year...everything
was cleaner then<grin>.
