Don't feel too stupid.   I did this to myself this weekend.
Bus was parked on a slight incline (very very very slight) and it
wasn't until I started sweating profusely and noticed that I was
moving the bus forward and back that I realized it was still in
reverse.  Then I put it into first thinking it was neutral.....a few
more minutes later I firgured it out and then went on to adjust my
valves properly.

:-)  A scary lesson....but one that is easy to remember
