Lately I've been working with high-level federal bureaucrats, to help
detangle their financial management systems.  It would never occur to them
to research their pre-ordained conclusions!

Reminds me of something that happened around 30 years ago in the name of 
"consumer safety". Some politician passed a law that motorcyclists had to 
wear seat belts. Looks good on paper! It was quickly repealed.

I would love to see someone show up with a lawnmower and one of those gas 
cans, and have one of the beaurocrats fill the lawn mower up in front of 
everyone to prove your point.
