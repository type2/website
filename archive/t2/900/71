hello everyone,
  in the picure you are looking at a double relay and series resistors on a
78 bay.  notice the brown dangly wire floating in the breaze off to the side
a little.  i assume this is a ground wire for the relay.  where should it be
screwed in.  by the way i am gonnna replace the ring connector.
thanks in advance
richard carlton.
