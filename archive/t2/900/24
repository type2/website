I must say that Dave has charted new territory and has provided extremely valuable insite with this setup.  This setup is one upon which I'm currently working as well.  I am installing VPC underdash in my very recently restored 74 single cab.  Fortunately my engine is out at the moment (but running) and getting the compressor mount correct is relatively easy.  The multiple washers which Dave used are identical to the ones which come with the mounting bracket, and which the instructions say to use, from B-depot.  Greg T.

The compressor and the mount came from Busdepot. You can find the mount
under "air control" in the bus section.
