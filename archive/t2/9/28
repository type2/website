Subject: Re: Drilling case to take mounting bar

Martin,

What you propose is straight forward, as long as the bug case casting has
the areas cast that are needed for the bus mount. I think some earlier cases
will not work. It's been about 10 years since I did this, so my memory is
fuzzy. Compare to your existing case to see if it looks feasable. Use your
existing engine/mounts to determine the specifics - hole placement and depth
and tap size.

Also - Be VERY careful not to drill too deep - if i recall the pressure
relief valve area is just behind one of the mount holes.
