Subject: deck height

I'm rebuilding my '78 2l and yesterday measured the following deck heights:
#1 .043
#2 .045
#3 .051
#4 .033!
What gives??? Long rod? Shoddy crank grind? The p/c's are new Cofap 94mm.
Can I shim just one cylinder? Seems like I'd have problems getting the heads
to seal if I did.  My new AMC heads came with a warning not to use head
shims.  This is my first T4 rebuild and I could really use some advise.
