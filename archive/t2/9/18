Subject: Vanagon Westy for Sale Pictures

I finally got a chance to get outside and get some pics together
of my '80 Vanagon westy that is for sale.
See http://www.codegurus.com/cchubb/vw/vanagon/

Even if you aren't interested in buying it, you might be interested
in some of the pics, because they detail the double-pane insulated
windows that you get with the 'cold weather package'. Also some of
my gauge package upgrades, etc.

Reminder $1500, Euro Spec, insulated windows, 170k km, full westy.
Ready to drive away today.
