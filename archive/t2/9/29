Subject: charcoal cannister

I read a message on here the other day about the
charcoal filter in a '71 bus, and the part no. was
listed as 175 201 801a, and that VWoA had them for
$61.00.  I called my local VWoA, they told me $74, I'm
wondering if there is another source, perhaps
cheaper???

thanks

Blake
