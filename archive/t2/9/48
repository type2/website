First, does the engine have the mounting bosses cast in?  If it doesn't,
there is nothing to tap!

If the bosses are there and undrilled, you can drill and tap them.  The
only hangup here is that the mag case is a bear to drill (the drill grabs
easily).

I note that the new mexican engines I bought have helicoils installed in
these holes from the factory.  This might be a good idea to spread the
load out into larger holes.
