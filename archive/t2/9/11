I know this is an older string, but I hope you will find this angle somewhat
different and interesting:

I had the misfortune of riding in Jake's bus with the Powerstoke engine last
night. I say misfortune because now I want one. His shop is located in the
mountains of North GA and that bus (FULLY loaded with tools and parts)
climbed those mountains like we were going downhill drafting a semi. Coming
from a background of high-performance Type 1 engines, the thing I miss the
most about driving my new bus is the comfort level I had when approaching
the steep stuff. This bus drove through those same passes faster and
stronger than my 73 Super with a very stout 1776 ever had time to.

I dared not ask for the particulars, but WOW that thing was quick and
smooth. After about a 30 minute ride, we pulled back into the shop; and the
engine was so cool that I was able to leave my hand on any part of it
(except the exhaust) without getting burned. Sure the Powerstroke motor
costs a ton, and isn't for everyone - but man was it fun.

He's soon going to start rebuilding the engine in my '72 and along with a
little performance tuning here-and-there, he's going to install the same
external cooling set-up he's described in the past. It will be a while
before it's completed since I'm in the process of selling/buying a house,
but once it's done I'll report back my findings.

The type 4 engine is a well designed beast, however it was originally
designed for a 411& 914, both of which are hard to kill in stock foem, and
both of which have problems ever getting the oil hot enough to rid
contaminants..

Face it, you have a 5,000 pound bus, most cars of that weight are V8
powered..

And yes, I'm one of those guys who believes in external coolers, and also
one who shuts engines down at 235 oil temp.....Thats OK, my bus averages
185, most of the time, but it does take 7 qts to fill it up.. just wait till
it gets the dry sump, and CIS with a turbo this winter!!

Actually my Powerstroke engine ran 220 oil temp all the time without the
extrenal cooler, I added it for pulling all the weight of my trailer and
engine parts bins, and even engines..especially when climbing grades..

BTW almost every thermostat I see is not functioning correctly, and the oil
cooler is only getting 1/2 of what it should be with proper adjustment..
