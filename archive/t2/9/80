Subject: Hitch for sale

Anybody want this hitch for $50.00 + Shipping
Weight 41 Pounds, ship from Dallas Texas 75220
Factory built class2, I believe its Either Valley or TowRite
You can use your stock bumper to hide it if you notch your bumper out for
clearance on the bottom.
Use two 1/2" bolts on centerline. Two 3/8" bolts through bumper hanger
that you must drill (keeps hitch from rotating).
