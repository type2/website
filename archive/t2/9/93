Subject: Friday Topic For Sure

Hiya All,

So I was reading the recent thread concerning the apparent lack of waving 
etiquette from some busdrivers.  And that prompted an idle question.  Is 
there any generally agreed upon waving etiquette?  I know, it seems obvious 
that when one spots another baywindow, one waves or flashes the "V".  But as 
a baywindow driver I'd like to know,  does this courtesy also extend to 
Microbusses (not that I ever see one on the road), Vanagons (does it make a 
difference if they're AC or not?), or Eurovans?
Just idle curiosity on this beautiful Friday.

Mike
