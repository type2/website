 Correct.I'm wondering if it could be the same as for 1800 w/dual carbs?
 In '76,VW Transporters were nearly all FI...but not all.Vans generally
 were but the pickups often still came with dual solexes.Mine was one of
 those....:(   I do know it was originally timed at 7.5 deg BTDC so will
 use that as a clue when attempting to locate the most likely dizzy
 on the oldvolkshome site.

 Interestingly enough,from '77 in Oz,dual solexes again became the norm
 and FI was optional as I recall...
