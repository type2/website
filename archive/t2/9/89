Subject: replacing a push rod tube


Here's a nifty tool-get a strap wrench from Sears and cinch it up over
the CLEANED tube.  It will rotate the tube without crimping it.
You can pull it sideways or tap on it with a hammer and yank out the
tube.  Before this I used duct tape around the tube aqnd pulled on
that.  78 Westy
