Subject: '74 out the door

Hey folks,

It's good to be back thanks to Sean. I also should not have posted my admin
problem to the entire list. I'll make it up to you guys. Anyway I just
thought I'd let you know we have cleaned out, I mean every part is off,
another '74, lots of good stuff including interior panels that are in great
shape. The doors are gone already, thanks Ray. Any way a 1971 deluxe is
next, and after that 1972, then 1971 campers. Hope all is well out there,
I'm going to work on my new '72 camper this weekend, yeha!
