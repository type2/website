Subject: Need help replacing a push rod tube

I have a 73 bus 1700 cc engine that I am trying to replace a push rod
tube.  I've read the book and it says you can replace the tubes
without removing the head.  I've taken the rocker arms off and the
spring holding the tubes in place.  I can spin the tube but it does
not want to come out.  Is it just stuck or am I missing a step or
what?  Any help with this would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Kevin
