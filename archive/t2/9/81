Subject: Bus won't run...

Hey.   Two days before the camping trip and the bus doesn't run. 
1977 westy with 2000 FI

Here's the deal.  FIrst it idled so low I didn't know why it kept 
running.  After I noticed that, I shut it off, and the fuel pump kept 
running.  I had to unplug the pump to park the car.  So I  drove home 
and unplugged the pump again when I stopped.  Bus sat for two days.  
Moved it into the yard one night, same deal with the pump and the really 
low idle.  Finally got a chance to look at it yesterday, and the battery 
was dead.  Pump was unplugged the whole time.  Jumped the main battery 
with the aux, drove into the garage.  Even lower idle, with stalling if 
you didn't keep it going. 

   So, i did some testing with the wires, just trying to get the pump to 
turn off.  I disconnected the pump side of the double relay and the pump 
stopped running.  When I re-connected it, the pump did not run.  Turned 
on the key, no pump, no start.  The relay checked out good according to 
Bentley a month ago.  So I hotwired the pump to the positive side of the 
coil, like it was when i bought the bus.  The pump runs when i turn on 
the key, and the engine starts up for a second and then dies, and after 
that it won't start again until you leave it for a few minutes. 

   So, i'm pretty stumped.  I'll check to see if there's a parasitic 
draw on the battery, but after that, I don't know what else to look for. 

thanks....
