Subject: Another 80 Westy for sale

Well folks, the time has come for me to sell Klunk.  My upcoming marriage
and college tuition are turning out to cost way more than expected and I
need the cash.  Here goes:

1980 Vanagon Westfalia (type P-22)
153629 miles (37253 on factory rebuilt 2.0L engine)
Weber 32/36 DFAV carb. Bosch 205S distributor.
Icebox, working sink, two tables, rear bug screen
Oil temp guage, New brake booster, lots of other new parts.
Tons of reciepts and a log of everything I have ever done to the van (I will
let you read the log but I would like to keep it)
Fishing rod racks, CO detector, fairly new fire extinguisher
4 speaker AM/FM Cassete stereo. I don't have the radio hooked up but it
works good.
The van does not leak or burn engine oil and gets 15 mpg in city and about
18-20 mpg on highway.
Rear tires are new.
The flaps/thermosat are not in the van but I have them.

The canvas on the pop-top is original and has a few holes but not real bad.
There is some rust under the window seals but there are no leaks.  The seals
around the front and middle windows are getting old and a little water gets
in if it is raining really hard.  There are also a few small rust holes (and
I do mean small) on the driver side panel.  No rust under the van.

This van has been my baby for 3.5 years and I get teary-eyed thinking about
selling it but I have to let it go.  I am in Lakeland, FL which is smack dab
between Tampa and Orlando. I am asking $3000.

I am not going to list this in the paper for at least a month because I want
someone to buy it that knows how to take care of it.  And yes, you will be
quizzed hehe just kidding (maybe)
