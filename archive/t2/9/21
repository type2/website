Lock-tite makes a hydraulic system sealer.

Check with your local industrial supplier. This sealer is used on machinery 
with hydraulic systems.

It comes in a nice size bottle that should last for you several years.

Mine was red, dunno if there are different colors or if the colors 
represent different qualities.

This stuff is very good for leaky drain bolts, senders, oil pan bolts and 
such. In my experience it does no locking work like lock-tite nor does it 
electrically insulate that it is sealing.

If anyone finds out anything different let me know.

Ciao!
