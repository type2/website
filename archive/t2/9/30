Subject: Re: [T2] charcoal cannister

Hey list,

is this charcoal canister mounted above the inside of the decklid with two
big clear tubes from the case to canister & from canister to air cleaner
with two smaller tubes heading up to the air scoops?

if yes, what years was this stock for? please consider I am in California
also with abundant smog and smog laws.

thanks, Billy.

P.s. Another non-waving bus driver passed me today. For shame.
