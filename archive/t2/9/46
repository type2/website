Subject: Progressive carb on `77 BUS

Hello, I just picked up a very nive `77 westfalia. 
The fuel injection is dead.  Came with a new
Progressive weber carb kit new in the box.  I have it
on the van and ready to go.  

My question is what distributor should I use with this
carb set up?  A 009 Bosch?  Thr original fuel
injection dizzy...what?

Also what should the timing be set to with the
distributor/// also any other hints on this carb set
up?

Thanks
