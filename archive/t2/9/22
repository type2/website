Subject: Drilling case to take mounting bar

I've recently seen a totally rusty 1302 with a good(72k miles)1600 DP-the
beetles going very cheaply so my reasoning is that if the engine has only
been powering a beetle is it likely to be less stressed and therefore a good
replacement for my engine-and what would be involved in drilling and tapping
for the engine bearer.Anyone have any experience of this -i'm assuming i can
us my tin as my bus is a '71 with an upright engine-Cheers Martin
