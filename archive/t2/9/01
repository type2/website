Subject: front Westfalia plaid bench seat???

Hello List,

I have a quick question. Did the bay window Westfalias
ever have a front bench seat? If so, was it the same
vynal seat that was used in the standard bus models or
was it ever made with any of the plaid fabric that the
westfalia bucket seats were made of? If their is such
a thing as a plaid Westy front bench seat, does
anywone have pictures? Thanks!
