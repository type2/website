   One good thing about Weber carbs is that if you buy a RED LINE kit and
not one of the cheap rag mag kits, they offer a TECH line to help with any
problems you might encounter. I was very inpressed talking to the TECHS from
Red Line and they sorted out a lot of problems and questions I had
concerning Weber carbs, especcially the Progressive and I think I will give
it a try. They have also just came out with jetting kits for ALL STYLES of
Weber carbs that includes all you would need to re jet correctly. Thumbs up
to Red Line for there efforts.

I know lots'o folks on the list have had bad luck or just plain hate the
Weber Progressive setup.

Not me! I ran one on my '77 Westy for 4 years without a problem. Power and
mileage were very close to what I got with FI. There may be different
versions of the carb because some people suggest that there is not place to
hook up a vac dizzy hose. I ran mine with the stock dizzy without any
issues. Don't use a 009 on a 2L engine - it does NOT give enough advance.
The installation took about 2 hours and away I went. Installation on an FI
bus is quite simple because the throttle cable already comes out right where
you want it. The only Rube-Goldberg in my setup was an extension I added to
the throttle cable to reach the carb. I don't know what jet sizes I was
using - whatever came installed in the carb - I believe it came with a set
of high altitude jets as well.

Cold weather may cause carb icing - there is no heat riser. This could be a
big issue. I only run my bus in the 'better' half of the year so it was not
an issue with me.

I've since put FI back on my bus and of course I love the drivability vs. a
carb. But the Weber worked great for me for 4 years. There - that's my 2
cents worth. Good Luck!
