I have an old craftsman tool box, that weighs 300 pounds, by its self
alone...I fabbed some aluminum straps to keep it where it bbelongs, I used
the angle iron method to make tracks for it to trolly on, to the edge of the
door, it normally rest behind the drivers seat..

I really bet you guys would like to know what brakes are on the puppy..I'm
not inclined to say yet, as I may be selling a kit soon if they go a few
more thousand with no problems.. All I have to say is that they are not
stock, atleast for a BUS..It took a Lathe, Mill, Belt sander, and several
hours to make them get close to working...They are awesome..I have a few non
vw, (still aircooled) parts cars around here..
