The absolute best thing we have found for fittings of any type is "loctite
518" it will hold on oil systems that have 120PSI on the gauge, I live by
the stuff, on all fittings, it allows the fittings to be removed easier than
the hydro locker, we tried that too. I hate oil leaks, and this is the stuff
for the job..Last week I used it on a dry sump system with 13 fittings, and
not a one leaked..
