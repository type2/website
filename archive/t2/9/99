I wave at all air cooleds, even BMW motorcycles, oh yeah, and all German
cars more than 15 years old, and yeah, any 62 Corvette that comes by, and
even anything I've never seen before and don't know what it is but it's old
and it's running.

Hand in air with other than a single middle finger I think is as close to a
definition as might be offered. Even a nod of the head will do. Flashing of
headlights is also an appropriate acknowledgent of commeradery.

I know, it seems obvious

Certainly, why not.

Personal preference. A friendly wave to anyone is never a bad idea and
can't hurt anyone. I smile and wave particularly at those who give me the
finger for whatever reason they think they might have to do so. It's the
best way I know of to make them even madder. They deserve it for their
obvious intolerance of other apes on the road.
