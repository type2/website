We vacationed in Mexico recently.  We flew into Cancun, and went immediately
to Isla Mujeres.  We then went to Cozumel.

It appeared to me that about 30-50% of the autos in Mexico are air-cooled
bugs, busses, things, dune buggies, etc.  It was pretty cool.  Lots of
busses used commercially, actually as busses in Cozumel (if that is what a
"Collectivo" is.  I have pictures on our photo album.  We rented a late
'90's beetle, with the top cut out, on Cozumel.
