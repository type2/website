Subject: waving etiquitte

Hey Mike!
Well I am only speaking for myself......... (and yes it IS such a beautiful
Friday, just *look* at that sunset for all you midwesterners!) Nice night
for a drive in the 'ol bus eh? :o)
.......as I was speaking for myself on this topic I wave to ALL VW owners,
ESPECIALLY other buses, whether it be a vanagon or a baywindow or a
Westie....
I also wave at old bugs.
I tend to shy away from the new ones though as they never wave back.

But I think the original etiquitte on the whole waving to other VW owners
was because you knew what each other was going through with your vehicle and
you had an instant common bond.

Tell me it doesn't put a smile on your face to see a bus JUST like yours
only painted blue coming up the road at ya....:o)  hehe it sure does mine.
I like to leave little nice notes on buses too.  I've gotten a few nice ones
that reassure me that there are still true bus freaks in Kansas, hehe.

Smiles and Waves,
Shannon ("Sunshine") & "Buddy" ('74 VW Transporter Bus)
