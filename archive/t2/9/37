Hello,
   I reconnected the master cylinder after a new booster.I was trying to =
bleed my front calipers, I removed the bleeder and nothing came out. =
Same thing on the other side, The brake stop and hold but have air in =
the line. ( I can pump them up some but they are spongy) Can I use =
something to get the fluid to come out? A pin?
Patrick
