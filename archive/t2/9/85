Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating was Re:Mexico

I don't think all of the busses are aircooled.  Even the ones that look like 
late model bay windows have the black grille looking think on the front 
clip.  This appears to be a radiator suggesting that these busses are 
waterboxers.

Am I totally off base on this one?
