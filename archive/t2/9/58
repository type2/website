I don't mean to insult, but did you have the rings on the pistons when you 
did the measurements? If not, piston rock can really mess up the measurements.

That said, I found one that was long in and engine on which I did a top end 
overhaul. The problem wasn't in the piston, and I didn't go into the case to 
find out if it was the rod or the crank. I did skim just a bit off the piston 
after seitching pistons around and reducing the difference as much as 
possible. I was fortunate to be able to make that piston land in the head 
with the largest volume :-)
