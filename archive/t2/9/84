Subject: Re: [T2] Bug Me video, type 4 rebuild.

It is here..
Rick and the guys at bug me video rang me the other day... Looks like the
type 4 engine rebuild video is almost finished. If you guys will remember,
we teamed up with these guysand  turned our shop into a movie set to shoot
this video at our shop, a few months back..

The video is darn near 3 hours long and has been a true pain for the crew to
edit, as all the info was really needed. It took us a solid week and 30
hours of running video to edit into the video.

This video goes through a type 4 engine rebuild (stock 2.0) from teardown,
inspection to assembly and even has a shop tour of our facility. The video
is simple, straight forward and designed for the first time
rebuilder....Some very detailed work is purposely left out, to keep things
within the comprehension of the novice.

Even for the experienced builder, the video would be a good thing to have,
as it shows some different angles of assembly..

I will be selling the videos as well as the crew at Bug Me, Reply to this
post if you are interested, and I will get definite prices asap. More than
likely the video will cost between 29-39.95

I will only receive 100 tapes, so make sure and get yours locked in..Videos
should be here in 2 weeks or less. I have sold 80 already, just today....I
can get some extras if need be..  Drop me an off list e mail if interested..
