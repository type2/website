Subject: Best 75-78 Exhaust?

I have a 1976 Bus that no longer has its stock exhaust.  It sounds like
getting all the stock parts will be next to impossible.  So, what is the
best way to go while still retaining my relatively new heater boxes?

I looked through the archives and found a lot of stories of quality
problems with the available aftermarket exhausts.  Plus, in many of the
catalogs and websites, they will refer to a "Monza-style" or extractor-type
exhaust but not identify the manufacturer.  Is there a way to tell who is
selling EMPI, Bugpack, S&S, Pacesetter, etc.?

I'm looking for a good, durable exhaust (I'm prepared to sand and re-paint
with POR-20) that will sound good and provide decent flow when I replace
the current restrictive single 2 BBL Weber carb set-up.

Regards,
Todd Kuzma
