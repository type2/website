Subject: Re: Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

Today I turned the drums. Everything is back to normal, and the ride is much
better on these tires. The only bastard was getting the left rear wheel nut
off.

I still do not know about the balancing. No one in town can do it. Will call
around and see if I can find a place that offers the service on the car as
someone suggested.

I have not talked to the owner of the tire place yet. I want to see if they
are balanced correctly before I inform him of the problem. This is a VERY
small town and will need him in the future, and he also is a client at my
business. It was his employee that messed up and I am sure he will not do it
again when the owner finds out.

Thanks again,
