Daniel,

I would suggest the classic test...  do a compression check.  If the
compression is high, then suspect bad valve guides.  If it is low, but a
shot of oil helps it, then suspect rings.  If it is very low on one or
more cylinders and oil does not help, the problem is valves.

Also, there is a test called a leakdown test that tests the integrity of
your rings and valves.  The device to perform it is common in shops, but
beyond the means of most home mechanics.  Check with mechanics near you to
see if any have the necessary equipment.
