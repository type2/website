Daniel,
May I suggest a couple things.  New pushrod seals to start, then pressure
wash the engine, go to NAPA or wherever and get a tiny bottle of engine oil
dye.  Put it in your oil, then shine a black light in the dark on you r
motor and you will see where other leaks are coming from.

With a qt of oil being used that fast, I would suspect your valve cover
gaskets are not seated correctly as well and need replacement when you do
the pushrod seals.
