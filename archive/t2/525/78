Subject: Oil filler tube leak - 72 Westy 

Hey All-
I thought I had a leak at the gasket but it turns out it was at the braze
between the tube and the flange that bolts to the case.
My local shop tried to weld over it but it still leaks
Looks like I need a new used one.

Anyone out there have one for cheap?
or any ideas on who to call?

It's for a '72

Thanks !
