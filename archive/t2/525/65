Hey Dave,
The Greenbriar pickup's were pretty neat--

Single cab?
I've never seen any double cabs--and don't think there were any.
What a neat concept--and an eye catcher--a double cab Corvair
Pickup---:>)

This is what got me all cranked up on the VW Vans--

I was working on a deal for a red and white   Corvair Greenbriar Wagon
from a buddy of mine--had $1500 cash in hand--he backed out--

I got my 85 GL to show him I didn't need his stuff--

A week later some kid blew a light and slammed into the rear quarter
panel of it---broadside

He still has it--and is sorry he didn't sell it--

JUSTICE--!!--:>)

Pretty neat Vehicles--

But--In reality--the VW Bus and Van parts stuff can be a pain to find--

I wonder how bad  the Corvair parts are to locate--??

Maybe he did me a favor--


Take Care
