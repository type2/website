Store it on a stand or wooden pallet, no contact with concrete floors. The
temperature difference between the concrete floor and the air above will
promote condensation and rust. 

Fill it with oil until you think it's going to start coming back out places
it shouldn't. PUT A BIG RED TAG ON IT TO REMIND YOU TO DRAIN THAT OIL AND
FILL TO PROPER LEVEL BEFORE STARTING!!!

Turn it over slowly by hand once or twice a month to excercise the springs.
Mark the pulley and stop it in a different place every time to prevent
pressure created "flat spots".

If you didn't do the crank up/break in on a stand when you finished the
rebuild add that note to the red tag. Don't stick the engine in and start
driving like "normal" just because it's "a year old now".

This is all "best practice" preventive measures. Remember, VW's have been
ressurected after sitting in a field for 15 years by doing nothing more
than changing oil, adding battery, and turning key.
