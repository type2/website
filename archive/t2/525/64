Chris,

When I replaced one of mine on the 78, I used the cable end and old
cable I took out to make the new cable like the one you need.  

Recycle, Recycle, Recycle!

I still have about 6' of the old sheatch and wire.

BTW, I have seen a single cab corvair Pickup that is being restored
driving around town here....It's starting to look good!


Cheers, dave

 I'd like to shop for about 25 feet and replace (recreate) my short cables.
