OH - and I don't mean to imply there are 3 suppliers, there are many. Just wanted to show a couple of the bigger ones and how cheap the used parts can be.

Nah, not too hard. Just gotta find the suppliers... Corvairs are still the poor 
man's Porsche - that is still exisiting in the shadow of a hundred other brands 
and thusly relatively cheap for the moment. Nice optioned out convertibles are only
$5-6K in driver condition.
