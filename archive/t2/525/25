Subject: California Emisions ECU - can it work without 02 sensor?

Dear List,

I have a 79 transporter which has a california exhaust system which leads me
to believe that it was once a CA emmisions engine.  Ever since I have had
it, it has not used the O2 sensor which leads me to believe one of two
things:  the ECU is expecting an input from the 02 sensor and is not getting
it; or somewhere in the life of the Van the ECU was changed out with a
non-CA emissions ECU.

Is there a difference in ECUs between the CA and FED?  How can I tell what
type of ECU I have?

Thanks,

Chris
