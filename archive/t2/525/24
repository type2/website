With that many devices plugged into each other, assuming of course
that everything is in the stock radio mount on the dash, you would
probably have almost a 1 ft. length of archaic/retro/modern hardware

  You would have to put the bench seat back into your bay window bus
so that somebody could change your Jean Shepherd cds for you....
Now there is a mental image.
