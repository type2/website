Subject: Re: [T2] California Emisions ECU - can it work without 02

To answer your subject line, yes the ECU can work without the O2 sensor.
The O2 sensor is there to provide "correction" feedback to the ECU for
air/fuel mixture problems, but there's no reason why the vehicle won't work
just fine without it.  The ECU just isn't receiving that feedback.

There's a *whole lot* of differences between the California and Federal
engines, all of it having to do with what's hung on the engine itself.
There's different ECU's different AFM's, different wiring harnesses,
different distributors, different exhaust.  A Federal van will have the
series resistance pack mounted at the front of the engine compartment while
for California vans the series resistance is internal to the ECU.  You'll
see an ICU and idle stabilizer with a California van, while a Federal van
doesn't have this stuff.
