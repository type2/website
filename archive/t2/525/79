Subject: Off my rollers...

Here's a funny one.  This past weekend (on my maiden camping voyage) I shut
the sliding door and the whole thing fell off.  Upon closer inspection it
appears the "roller" on what I think is called the "rear support" broke.  It
is shaped like two washers joined in the middle or "U" shaped if looking at it
from the side.  This thing broke in two and one half fell to the ground.
We were able to get the door back in the tracks, close it, and lock it for a
safe journey home.  It just made accessing the back of the bus a little more
difficult for the duration of the trip.
Does anyone know what this part I'm describing is called (or better yet a part
#) or if they are available.  I wasn't sure if this might be sold as a unit or
if just the broken piece of metal could be replaced.

I found this in the archives but couldn't tell if the broken piece was
intended to be a stand alone part.
