Guys,

Just read that one of the local flaps sells a relay conversion
kit so that when you switch to brights, your low beams stay on as well.

I don't need a kit for this, but am wondering if anyone can think
of a reason why you *wouldn't* want the low beams on at the same
time.

The only one I can think of would be increased drain on the battery
and more amps going down the positive cable that feeds the front of
the bus.

Any more cons?....either regular bulbs or halogen?

Cheers, dave
