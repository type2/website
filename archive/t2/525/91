Hi Dave,

Bulb life might suffer as well, I wouldn't think that the bulbs would 
be designed for extended use with double the current and heat running 
through them.

OTOH, this is something I already do when driving down poorly lit 
highways, but I'm always worried I'll break the lever.

Happy trails,
