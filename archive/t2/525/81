Hello Mike,
I have a good oil filler tube from my old 73 bus
engine some where boxed up. Give me your address and I
will send it to you the first chance I get. I don't
remember if I still have the plastic top and cap for
it or not. If I do I will send those as well. I don't
want anything for it but if you would like, paypal or
send a $5.00 donation to the type 2 list and I will
mail it to you A.S.A.P.

Thanks and have a great day!
