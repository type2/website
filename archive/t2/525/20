I grew up listening to him when he was in Del Rio, Texas.
He was about the only thing you could get in the "olden" days
before FM radio in the far reaches of West Texas.

Mandatory bus content.  I probably listened to him while driving my 1967
bus thru Mexico in the late 60's....now you know!

Cheers, dave
