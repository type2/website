chris,

you are correct here on all counts. that cable is NLA. and the cable is
solid spring wire.
 
you can make it. i haven't tried to make that particular one, but i have
made similar bits for other vehicles before. if you are handy it can be
done. really good teflon lined bike cable sheathing (i think it is used for
shifters, not brakes) will work as the outer. The inner could be any number
of things, but stainless piano wire might be best. you could scavenge the
ends off the old cable, or make new ones that have tiny machine screws that
hold them onto the cable.
