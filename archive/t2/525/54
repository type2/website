Ok,

It is not quite a reamer, it is a long pattern 2-flute end mill. The tricky
part is that it is a non-standard size.

John C. of ac.net will want to chime in here, but I will tell you what I
know.

What is does is put a new surface on the seat upon which the pressure relief
valve rests. One takes very small cuts (like .003" at a time) with the tool
until the seat is smooth and true. I have used it and it leaves a good
finish on the seat. I also resurface the piston on a glass plate, so it is
also very smooth and true. Last time I rented the tool I did four cases with
it, and they all had pretty rough looking seat areas before resurfacing. The
pistons are also suprisingly roughly machined.

The relief valve is designed to bleed pressure from the oil system, and the
valve is closed until the pressure in the gallery above it overcomes the
spring pressure holding the piston on the seat. If the seat and piston are
not smooth, pressure will bleed past the valve continuously, similar to a
leaking cylinder head valve.

Resurfacing the piston and seat results in a superior seal on the pressure
relief valve, like doing a mini valve job on your oil system. When pressure
does not leak past the valve, it results in higher oil pressure.

Did I get that right, John C.?
