** How about a 6 CD series of Jean Shepherd to go with your
** VW AM radio + 8-track + cassette adapter + CD player +
** single speaker...

**With that many devices plugged into each other, assuming of course
**that everything is in the stock radio mount on the dash, you would
**probably have almost a 1 ft. length of archaic/retro/modern hardware
**sticking out of your dash.

**  You would have to put the bench seat back into your bay window bus
**so that somebody could change your Jean Shepherd cds for you....
**Now there is a mental image.


Not entirely inventive, a manual changer(by hand) with all that evolution 
sticking out of the dash, at least run a line out of the CD Changer into the 
CD adpter in the cassette adapter in the 8 trac adapted to the conventional 
AM tuner. And please use a wireless remote with voice recognition for 
handsfree capability. Safe driving is safe driving always 10 and 2 except 
for changing gears.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
