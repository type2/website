Subject: new bus to bring home

bought a nice, eastern oregon 69 sunroof this morning. NO rust NO leaky
sunroof, mint headliner, doors that close sharp - especially the slider.
siezed engine, gotta rebuilt on the bench waiting for a bus. i got brought
into a wholesale dealer auction, and what an experience that was in and of
itself. glad to have been there, more glad to have left.
