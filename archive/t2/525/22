"This is all "best practice" preventive measures. Remember, VW's have been
ressurected after sitting in a field for 15 years by doing nothing more
than changing oil, adding battery, and turning key."


- true enough.  My '78 sat next to the garage for 3+ years before I took the
time to replace the alternator, charge (not replace) the battery, change oil
and turn the key.


Amazingly resilient beasties...
