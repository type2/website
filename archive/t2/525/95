Subject: '71 colored wiring diagrams

Hi Volks- a while ago I had some copies made of colored wiring diagrams
for the early and late '71 bus. The difference, as far as I can tell, is
the addition of a computer port on the later model. Anyway, I have 3
late model and 6 early model copies.  If anyone want one, send me your
address and I'll send it to you. First come, first served. TBear
