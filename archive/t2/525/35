Dem er weld nuts on der stock shifter which are head in place for one man 
fastening. Sounds like your nuts have fallen off der welds ist caput, so 
now you must use loose nuts, and need someone to screw them on by hand 
while you put in and hold the bolts.

The stock assembly is a one man job. Assemble and line up the shifter 
parts. Force the cover down to compress the spring. Install bolts to tight 
then back off each a half turn. Adjust plate. Tighten and test shifing. 
Repeat until nice finding of all gears. Bentley gives base initial shifter 
plate adjustment procedure. That works 90% of the time. New parts are not 
spendy. Replace worn plates, pins, springs and/or housings and tight 
positive shifting will result.
