Stock is clean and dry. Use about a 320 grit to finish the flanges after 
chipping and removing any gasket or sealant residues. This will allow 
weeping enough that in 15 years+ you will have a build up of a 1/4" of 
dust/lube coating the case if, like most, you don't wipe it clean 
periodically as standard maintenance procedure. 5 minutes every 5 years if 
you just travel on pavement. Certainly several times more often if you 
drive dusty roads. Again, maintenance interval dependant on how the vehicle 
is used determined by periodic inspection, not time or mileage. That's what 
stock assembly ensures.

Only if there are surface flaws, I would wipe a THIN layer of Aviation 
Permatex on it, nothing else. Check for flatness of the flanges with a 
steel straight edge. If anything like an issue here, improve with a flat 
file. Then process as above. I have seen a few of these tranny flanges with 
a hard black tarnish that my guess has something to do with electrolysis 
and long overused filthy black lube. Try wrapping some 120 grit around a 
big flat file to remove this.
