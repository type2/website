Subject: Aircooled Vanagon Auto tranny?

Good day fellow listees,
Thanks for the advice with regards to my coworkers 81 aircooled Vanagon fuel
pump.  I applied power to it and it simply hummed.  I replaced the pump and
fuel filter today and it started right up.  It appears that when he had the
fuel tank replaced due to a leak recently and the filter wasn't replaced
leading to the failure.

When we went to move the vehicle it wouldn't make it up the driveway.  After
adding oil (not even on the stick) we got it moving and again checked the
level and added oil to the trans (engine at idle in neutral).  It ran well
except that 1st and second whine a bit, especially when shifting and there
is a leak between the engine and transmission.  The oil didn't smell burned,
and with oil in the gearbox there is no noticeable slippage however my
co-worker says there is a slight slip/clunk when starting from a stop.  This
trans was only rebuilt 3 or 4 years ago by a reputable shop.  Assorted
pistons, pump and rebuilt torque converter were used, pretty much the full
meal deal replaced.

The bus is a full Westy fit, complete with gas heater, good tyres and a 10k
rebuild engine.  Rusty around wheel arches and Westy camp protrusions around
drivers side but underside is solid .  We're talking about a trade for my 85
Toyoda pick-up, value $1500.  Does this sound reasonable?  Can I find
another transmission reasonably priced?   Can these transmission be
overhauled by myself?  I'm good with tools and my hands and the Type 4 motor
that I rebuilt for my '77 bus works great.  The vanagon is very comfy and
drives well except for the lower power...

Any advice would most appreciated:)
