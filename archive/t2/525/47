Here's an update for all those keeping score.

There is almost certainly something in the tank clogging the outlet.  I 
tried to take the Bus for a quick spin this morning, and it hesitated, 
had noisy pump, etc.  There was no way it was drivable across town, let 
alone at freeway speeds.

So, I called AAA and had it towed over to Buslab.  The tow lifted it by 
the rear wheels (rolling on the front).

When I got it to Buslab, Marco and I took it for a spin, and it ran 
*perfectly*, and my new fuel pump was dead silent.  I guess raising the 
tank like that must have dislodged whatever was blocking the outlet.

The plan is to just boil out the tank and POR-15 it.  I have a federal 
filler neck now to prevent another bird-beak episode in the future 
(thanks, Richard!).  I'm going to scavenge some junk yards for a 
Vanagon restrictor that I will try to retrofit in the unlikely (I hope) 
event that my Bus ever needs to pay another visit to the CA Smog 
Angles.
