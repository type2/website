Subject: Experience with aircooled.net Oil Pressure Relief Valve

Hi All:

Has anyone experience using aircooled.net's Oil Pressure Relief Valve 
Resurfacing Tool?
(see 
http://aircooled.net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=TZE0029&cartid=0302200486287000 
<http://aircooled.net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=TZE0029&cartid=0302200486287000>)

How did it work? Did it improve your idle oil pressure? Did it leave a 
smooth surface?

TIA
Regards,
