Subject: taillight mod

There is a mod in the workshop manual on page 94.3 that shows using seals from a 411 to better seal the 72-79 taillight housings to the body.

I bought the seals from Bus Depot a long time ago and one packet contains two seals and is enough to do one taillight: 411 941 123. The seals are 411 sized so they need to be trimmed for length slightly. I just used for weatherstrip adhesive to hold them in place but the seals are contoured to fit inside the grove in the back of the taillight housing.
