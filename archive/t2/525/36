  Check for flatness of the flanges with a steel straight edge. If anything

CAUTION: If you take more than a tiny amount of filing, you need to verify 
the shaft endplay, and perhaps use 2 thin paper gaskets to compensate. I 
would confer with Daryl at AA Transaxel to know more. If you have the 
time/skill you can indeed add a gasket made up of newspaper. This is 
standard procedure for adjustment of the very much similar era Porsche trannies.
