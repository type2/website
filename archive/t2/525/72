Subject: Headlamps

Hi folks

I am in the final stages of putting Polly back together.  There are the odd
bits where it has been so long (2 years) that I have forgotten how it goes
back together, so please help!

My headlamps seem to be held in with 1 screw, but there are a few eyes on
the headlamp bowl, what is missing? a spring?

These are the replaceable bulb type and its a 73, 1800 TC

Thanks
John
