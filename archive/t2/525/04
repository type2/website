I bought a 74 VW Bus Automatic about six years ago with the idea of
restoring it.  Instead it has become a storage shed for me and I have
decided that it should have a better chance at life than what I am
giving it.  So if you want it, come and get it!  I have a good title for
it.  You would be buying a rolling van with no motor or trans.  I have
both but unless you want to buy them from me, I am going to keep them.
I also have a full set of window rubber for this van but again unless
you want to pay me what I paid for them, I will keep them.  The van is
relatively solid and just a 7 passenger with no middle bench.  The two
front seats are there as well as the rear seat.  It needs some body work
due to rust but again should be a solid project for someone inclined.  I
am located in Southern, NJ (Millville zip 08332).  Please let me know as
soon as you can if you want this bus.  It needs to be gone by March 15th
or I will be forced to send it to the crusher.

Thanks,
