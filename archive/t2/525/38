i did the procedure with the engine apart, during the rebuild process. idle
pressure improved perhaps 6-8 psi.

if the engine is together you can prevent debris from entering the galleries
by pressurizing the oil system with compressed air during machining. first
drain the oil, then attach an air hose to the oil sender port. the debris
will be blown out of the hole as it is being machined. i have never done it
this way, but i believe it is the accepted method.
