completely.

I'll add that I've always seen an oil pressure increase, and most of it
noticably occurring at idle or very low RPMs. The piston and piston
seating/sealing surface are usually in dire need of cleanup. This is normal
even if it's a new case, let alone a used one with 200k miles (those are
REALLY rough).
