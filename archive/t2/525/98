This happened to me on the way home from a backpacking trip last month. 
  The roller split in two and the inside half was lodged inside the 
track.  The door still worked, but poorly.

I ordered a new one from Bus Depot 
http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211843419

I also ordered the guidepiece 
http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211843368

I also ordered the weatherstrip 
http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=211829193C

In the process of taking everything apart and putting it all back 
together, other items fell apart (does this sound familiar anyone?)

A lot of the components of the rear support/hinge are pot metal and 
subject to breakage (esp. after 30+ years of use).

I wound up ordering two more parts, this time from Busted Bus 
http://www.bustedbus.com/

I needed an operating cam and a pivot piece.  These parts are shown in 
the Bentley Manual, page 25 of the BODY AND FRAME section, figure 5-57 
at the bottom of the page, numbers 13 & 15.

If you don't have a Bentley Manual, get one - it will pay for itself 
the first day.

Now, a month later, I have everything back together and it is "like 
buttah" - slicker than owlshit.
