I have a BA-4 not sure how much differences there are in power draw, but
in really bad weather when I have heater on, headlights on, wipers going
and maybe my aux defroster fan I will draw down my battery a little, don't
even dare turn on radio as I am running real close to the alt limit.
under those circumstances I usually try to turn off something occasionally
if possible, or take a break with thinngs turned off and engine at fast
idle.

been trying to find one for years,  have heard of folks grafting on other
alterators but nothing that looks workable for me,

I have a 78 auto tranny bus.
