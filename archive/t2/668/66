VW portal, replacing a magazine... I'm in ... Do we have an editor
here???.. I'll build it... Nice project that could lead to a lots of
fun....

I think thesamba is a great, even a master piece for air-cooled vw's but
I think that Everett will have allot of work to do before it take place
has online magazine.

Cheers
