Subject: air hoses (vacuum hoses) answer

I had no useful responses, also none from the Dutch language 
sister list (luchtlist). The hose I am referring to is not the one that 
goes to the distributor to advance or retard the spark, but thanks 
for trying to all those who suggested something along those lines. 

However I crawled all over the motor today with a mirror and torch, 
and found somewhere to connect the loose tube.

The solution:
Under each carburettor is a vertical pipe taking the air/fuel mix 
down to the cylinders, and these two vertical pipes are cross-
connected with a 10cm diameter metal pipe that passes under the 
bracket the air filter is mounted on. Right in the middle where it can 
only be seen with a mirror and torch there is a T-junction, with a 
connector of the right diameter and in the right position (given the 
length of the swinging tube). So there it goes, for now. Only the * 
thing still won't start ...
