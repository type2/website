When I did the clutch cable on my 73,  I discovered that I needed 3
arms: One to pull the cable taut, one to pull the lever forward, and
one to attach the wingnut.

The lever on the transmission needed to pbe pulled 2 or so inches
toward the front of the bus.

It took several minutes to figure out that pulling up the pedal (as
you did with the bungee) would help keep the cable in position so I
would only need 2 arms. ;-)
