I think a close look will show burnt insulation without the fireworks... It may be internal to the switch - I have replaced two for folks whose cargo shifted and broke the old one... Look for discolored wires, they may be warm to the touch at all times too. Look for P.O. repairs (electrical tape, butt connectors, bad stereo installs).
