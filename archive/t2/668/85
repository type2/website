"geezers" out there to keep the tradition of
reading hard copy alive! I really enjoyed VW
Trends, I know the tech articles were usually
pretty lame or even wrong,

I agree with my brother JB, better known as the
Secretary General.  A magazine would be nice.
Maybe  However the current magazine offerings
will never earn my money. A green bug with purple
flames and a hacked suspension graces the cover
of volksworld.  More of the same lame crap.  Rest
in piece VW rags.
