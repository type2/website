Subject: VWTrends -- another old old fart's opinion

I've been computing (electronically) one way or another since ~1966, writing 
assembler, Fortran, Pascal... and now trying to deal with Windows.  Maybe when 
I can spill coffee on my computer while in bed, or drop it on the floor while 
taking a dump, I'll accept that reading on a computer is as pleasurable as 
reading on paper.

That said, I am 100% with the guys who will not miss a magazine whose editorial 
policy seemed to be "cutting up nice Volksies is cool."  At one time, when I 
had no alternative (lost storage space, divorce, etc) I sold a pristine 1965 
Bug to a rich kid who planned to convert it to a Ba-ha-ha-ha something.  Total 
waste of a nice vehicle.  I charged him twice the fair market value, but still 
regret the transaction.... just my $0.02 worth.
