Subject: Fuel line replacement

Hi all,

This afternoon I listened to your advice and checked the fuel lines of my
486 type 2 It might just have saved my life because when I pulled very
softly at the line coming from the tank, it started leaking immediately. The
leak got worse in some minutes and I had to capture about 35 liters of fuel

OK, now I will replace all of the fuel lines. I want to add a fuel filter,
which is the best place to connect it? And I think the original fuel line
under the bus is rather loosely attached Any advice on this? How should
this line be attached and which pathway to follow?

In the mean time I printed all the mails concerning this subject

Bart
