Subject: Torsion bar install pics?

Months back someone posted some shots of their torsion bar installation.  I
have poured through the archive and the library but must have put in the
incorrect search criteria because I could not find a single link reference
so that I could have a pictoral example.  I know its around somewhere
because I followed the link from this list and looked at it when it was
originally posted.

There is certainly descriptive info in the archives, but no link I'm afraid.
This sound familiar to anybody?  I just picked up a torsion bar and would
like to see the install instead of just reading about it.  Thanks in advance
to anybody who contributes to my torsion education.
