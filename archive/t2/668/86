Joe,

<rolling of eyes here>...all was ok with your post until I got to the P.S.

I guess I read Orwell's 1984 too much....I *like* hard copy...it can't be 
changed in 10 million homes all over the land like web pages and while it 
is a fragile media, with a little care it will outlast me.

Plus!  I *like* being able to look at my library and wonder how I ever had 
time to read all of those books.<grin>

I look at my CD collection and know that I have to go find a machine 
someplace just to find what I want somewhere around the middle of the 
file that tells me how to fix my bus.

Ok, I suspect the admins are gonna do this one in soon, so these are my 
last words on this subject.

Cheers, dave
