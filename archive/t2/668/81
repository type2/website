what I did one time when chasing a flaky short, I took the fuse out and
wired a ammeter accross the terminals with a switch and put both on my
dash.  instead of blowing the fuse it would be a visible indication, and I
was able to pin point exactly when the short was happenning, the switch
was to shut off the circuit if the short persisted.  this works best with
the intermittent shorts, in my case it was blowing when I made a turn with
the turn signals on.  bit of worn insulation hit when I turned. took weeks
before putting in the meter, about two days to find after putting the
meter in.
just a hint.
