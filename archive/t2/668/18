Subject: Oil temp guage question

Has anyone installed a mechanical oil pressure guage that uses the plastic
hose to extend the oil pressure to the guage? Is that hose any good? I have
about 5 ft of it and fittings from a mechanical guage I use for spot checking
oil pressure on engines that don't gave a guage. I am considering using about
a foot of it to make an extension hose for my electrical oil pressure guage,
only because I've discovered the VDO hose is NLA!

Does the plastic get brittle with heat/extreem cold? The last thing I want is
to spring an oil gusher on a newly rebuilt engine.

I see that aircooled.net has an alternative hose but my funds are running thin
and the price is twice what I paid for the VDO hose 2 years ago. I know this
hose has a steel braided cover, Is this overkill for a higher price? The VDO
hose seemed to last forever. Am I being overly frugal?

Thanks
Tom
