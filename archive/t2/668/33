Subject: RE: [T2] VWTrends rumor

I agree with Keri, I do not enjoy reading stuff on the web. I like it in
print. Online is great for a tech resource, but it is no magazine. VW Trends
just started covering buses a lot too. The editor, I think, just bought a
single cab. They started a complete restore of an old split. The cover of the
latest issue has a bus on it and the inside has two bus article with color
pics for every vehicle in it.

I really thought VW trends had made a good change with the past few issues. If
the VW community can keep all these VW parts distributors going, then why
can't they keep two mags going???? Heck, the bus community keeps more parts
distributors going than I thought possible.

I get the mag just to look at what others are doing. I am a VW lover, not just
a bus lover, so seeing bugs, squareback, etc is awesome.

I sure hope they figure out a way to keep afloat..

Their is always Camper and Commercial from Europe. Another good mag, but no US
buses. It is expensive, but I have been paying for it for years and am happy
with the quality of the articles and the vehicles.
