Subject: The leaks never end

I'm on digest mode so this reply might not fall into sequence.
With type IV engines there are about 10 locations that may leak on older
engines.
Rather than just chip at them one at a time you can address all of them at
once.
First clean the engine bay inside ................ I mean clean it very
good. Spray gunk and a good scrubbing with a parts cleaner brush before a
rinse off.
Then clean the bottom side ........... just spray it down with Gunk Engine
cleaner and scrub anything you can get to with that brush.
After this routine try spraying again at the $1.00 car wash. Take some WD 40
along to spray your distributor and wired down after you spray wash it. If
it won't start just remove and dry out the distributor cap.
As for leaks:
#1) Leaking around or from Oil Pressure Idiot Light sender at the threads in
the block.
#2) Leaking around the plastic oil fill tube because it's too loose or
warped from heat and not sealing.
#3) Leaking out the rear seal because it's just got got bad.
#4) Leaking out Valve Cover Gaskets.
#5) Leaking out the pushrod tube seals.
#6) Leaking around front main seal.
#7) Leaking out of Oil Cooler Seals or around oil filter seal.
#8) Leaking out distributor shaft seal O ring.
#9) You can also have leaks at the headgaskets where the cylinder mount to
the heads or the cylinders seal at the engine case. Re-torque every bolt you
can get a socket on.
#10) Oil screen cover plate and washer.
If you get these seals and gaskets replaced it should stop 99% of your
leaks.
If you have a broken ring or ringlands you'll continue to blow oil until you
repair the broken piston.
