Subject: was 55 amp laternator..now 70 amp

I called and they just asked how fast I wanted it...you pay $16.00 or so 
for overnight and nothing extra if you can wait 10 days.

part # 14062  $35.00 core charge and 130.99 for the alternator.

Wonder if they would actually know the difference if I turned in a 55 amp 
core rather than a 70 amp core?

Didn't ask about the boot...didn't think about it as I think bus-boys 
actually lists it as available.

Anyone actually have? one ofthe babies and can compare it to a 55?
Same shape.backplate/connector?  Everything the same except forthe boot?

Just leave me one for after Christmas!

Cheers, dave
