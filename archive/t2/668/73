I am not too sad to see Trends go away, I will not miss Hot VW's when 
it dies. Those had very little content that interested me. I decided a 
couple years ago to cancel my subscriptions to both in favor of Camper 
and Commercial from the U.K. I still get all the "magazine" stuff and 
its all buses.
Just my .02
