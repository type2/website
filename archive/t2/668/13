The tee is the VDO part. M10x1.0 threads on all ports. I'll have to drive
back over to the bus to check the part number on the package.

Bought the hose from http://www.aircooled.net. M10x1.0 male on one end and
1/8" NPT female on the other with a 1/8 NPT to M10x1.0 adapter included.
All stainless.
