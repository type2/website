Subject: Moving to Joplin, Missouri

Hello, I am moving to Joplin, Mo. next week. I was
wondering if there is any list members or clubs around
that part of MO? Any VW friendly repair shops? I will
only be able to take my 78 Westy, and leave my 79 bus
behind. I hate to leave it behind but this is the
wrong time of the year to move so far, But I have a
friend in Ok. who drives truck, and makes runs this
way so I can pick it up later.

I am just interested in any info on the VW scene in
the southwest corner of Missouri.

Thanks, 
Shawn Reed
