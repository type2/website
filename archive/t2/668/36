I replaced on a '73 just a few weeks ago. I only needed two arms. Did you 
check the new cable for correct length or possibly mis-routed? From my own 
experience I did not have this problem. 3215mm cable should be the correct 
length. Good luck with your move, hope t goes as smooth as mine did and you 
don't need any extra arms. ;-)

Happy Holidays,
