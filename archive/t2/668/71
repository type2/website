Subject: Re: [T2] VWTrends rumor-old old fart's opinion!

I read the mag in 1991 when I was living in Italy with limited english info sources about the car I had just bought. 

Those mags really gave me the wrong info. All the flash rather than durability. I wasted alot of money at first. 

I eventually discovered (through the mags) Berg, Muir, Bentley, and the Wilson guy. Thanks to them I learned how to make waht i had last on a budget. 

Honestly as much as I like the pics I quit buying those mags years ago b/c of the bad advice. All they had to do was honestly define what all the flash and shine on the engine got us -  afew thousand go fast miles.  

It's my opinion they are getting some of the bed they made... 

That and the youth that was buying the VW for a first car has switched to the "Fast and Furious" style/mentality and their dollars have gone with them. 

Maybe a few more VW's will get cared for rather than hacked up. <this coming from a Corvair implant guy... <grin!>>
