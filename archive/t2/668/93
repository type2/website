Subject: Frong Bearing Seal

This weekend I hope to get my front wheels back on my 76 with the new
bearings.  Just got the hub back from the powder coater and the machine shop
that pressed in the new races for me.  The kit I got from Bus Depot says it
replaces 211 405 645 DS and contains two seals.  Usually between Bently and
paying close attention when I take something apart I can get it back together
(I've adopted the habit of suplementing Bently with handwritten notes during
disassembly).
Anyway, the kit contains a seal and Bently shows one in the picture but mine
did not have one when I took it apart.
Does anyone know which way the seal goes?  One side has a groove with a spring
inside.  The other side is tapered.  I'm just wondering which way it goes and
if I have the right part.  The diagram Fig. 5-1 Sec. 2 pg. 8 shows a seal for
the drum and disc models, but the seal in my kit looks more like the one in
the drum brake picture.  It might be obvious when I get into it, but I'm just
trying to get my notes together ahead of time.  You know how it is when you
run into a question mid-way through a first-time project.  Suddenly it's dark
and you're waiting till next weekend for daylight again....

Also, when I went for grease my FLAPS had LubriMatic Disc & Drum Brake, Hight
Temp Wheel Bearing Grease.  No other info is on the container.  The
description sounds right, but this stuff seems very thin like it would liquify
and ooz out when it gets hot.  The stuff I cleaned out was THICK.  Can anyone
recommend a good grease brand / type for this application?

Thanks,
Mike
