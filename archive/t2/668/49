List,

Afaik, the 70A alternator (AL108X) is still available. It is the cooling
elbow that is NLA, and has been for quite a while. If you want to use the
the AL108 you need to improvise the elbow, which is do-able. The AL108 is
completely different on the rear housing, the cooling duct on the alternator
body is part of the rear casting and circular in cross-section, unlike the
AL75 where the duct is ovoid and part of the rear sheet metal wiring cover.

The AL108 also uses a different pulley which incorporates a fan. This is a
standard bosch part, so again, depending on your level of ingenuity and how
badly you want to get the 70A alt in you bus, it is do-able. But don't get
the idea that installing a 70A alternator is bolt-in upgrade, it isn't since
the parts to do it have disappeared.

I have a spare 70A boot and one of these days I am going to try to have it
reproduced, it is a needed part, especially here in Canada, where most 76-79
buses used the 70A AL108.
