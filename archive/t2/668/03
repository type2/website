Subject: Re: Notes on using a voltmeter on my bus...

The actual wording was, " I was finding ground all over where there
shouldn't be ground."

I meant that where there should be positive 12v or nothing at all I
was getting ground. That changed when I discovered I was acting as
ground. I moved away from the bus and retested and didn't get ground
anymore on the 2 wires I tested.

Like I said, I will be reevaluating on Saturday.
