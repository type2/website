You dont have to upgrade your alternator, I have a BA6 in my bus and usually 
run dual LCD monitors, a DVD and a mini fridge on my long trips.

I have tested the output of the alt with everyting on and its within acceptable 
range.

I wouldnt worry about it unless you want to use a 1500W invertor and a killer 
stereo too....
