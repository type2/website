According to tuneyourengine.com :

"In general, however, optimum horsepower is achieved between 0.85 and
0.90 lambda (12.45 AFR to 13.2 AFR using regular gasoline)."

You can do this if your smog laws permit. Smog regs have made
manufacturers tune closer to 1.0 lambda (14.7 Air / Fuel Ratio), which
is part of why later VW's ran so hot.
