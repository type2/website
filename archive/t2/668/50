I know this is kind of a "hippie" fix, but...

What if you re-dyed it? Get a rattle can of vinyl die, spray it into a
cup, and use a disposable brush to apply it to the felt. Just load the
brush and touch it to the felt and allow it to soak in. Should last
long enough to allow you to look good while searching for a better
fix.

I've used it on plastic, leather, fabric, etc, and it works well. I
forget the various names the different brands use, but PlastiKote,
DupliColor, etc all have versions.
