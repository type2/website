I'm with those who didn't care much for the mags - the writing was  
generally abominable and juvenile, the editorial decisions were  
inscrutable.  Once in a great while there was useful content, but nothing  
you can't find elsewhere.  It was kinda nice to scan the ads, but  
otherwise, no loss.

True, however, that (assuming worthwhile content) the print medium still  
has some advantages (and nostalgic appeal) over electronica -- but much of  
that has to do with the fact that producers and consumers are still  
learning how best to employ the medium, not inherent in the medium  
itself.  Most print advantages have an electronic analog, just takes a  
little adjusting.

Print was once a newfangled medium that would destroy writing.  Writing  
was once a new medium that would destroy speech.  We're all heading  
downhill from a Golden Age (especially with regard to the evolution of bus  
designs ;-).
