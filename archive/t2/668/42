Subject: window felt channel disgust

Folks,

Has anyone found any **good** window felt channel replacement?

The ones that I bought 2 years ago have lost their color on the outside 
and just look grey now.

This is on my 78 Champagne edition which has been washed maybe 12 times in 
the last two years and has sat in the sun for maybe 20 days in the last 2 
years.

Did the originals not do better than that?  They don't look frayed or 
anything quite yet, but look like they have aged quite badly on the 
outside.

I have the same problems on bugs, but seems even worse...but I drive them 
more too...<grin>

Cheers, dave
