That is a great Idea Bob suggested,,
Your better off to use a test lamp, or a buzzer..in place of the fuse  instead
of an ammeter

If you install a 6v or 9v or 12v buzzer you can hear it while playing with the
wiring,, it will make a noise when it gets enough of a circuit to ground,,
usually thru a short,, but it can trick you. Some loads like headlights will
allow the buzzer and the lamp to be in series electrically,, and enough current
to make the buzzer work

In this case,, if you chasing a 'short' in the left headlight circuit,, then
remove the wire right at the left headlight,, then the buzzer can't trick you.

A buzzer won't let the smoke out... and it might make your life easier.....
btw, if you want to use a test lamp,, it works the same as a buzzer but you <or
a friend> need[s] to see it  all the time,,, when it lights bright,, there is a
very good path to ground... when it is dim,, there is a high resistance to
ground,,  if it doesn't light, there is no circuit to ground, or the lamp
filament is broken! :-)
