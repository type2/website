Subject: VW Trends and other bus reading material

Hi Vols folks,
    With the rumors of VW Trends magazine stopping production some
have suggested the magazine go to an on-line format, while others have
suggested the Samba become the replacement for the magazine.  If
on-line sites replace books and magazines  I'm going to have to
install a computer in my bathroom so that I've got reading material
for when I'm sitting on the "throne".          :-)
    Have a great day everybody
