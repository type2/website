Subject: VWTrends rumor- March issue to be printed

I have been told that the March issue was ready to go to press and will be 
printed, 
It will be the last one unless some Christmas miracle happens to put them 
back in business
Primedia has about 800 magazines ,  so when cost-cutting came VW Trends was 
always on the bubble, 
I wonder what other magazines got the axe ?
