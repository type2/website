Subject: The leaks never end,

Well having dealt with all the leaky pushrods I had finally though I 
had gotten rid of my oil leaks. I have however got another ! This one 
seems rather unpleasant though. I was rather confused yesterday to see 
oil above the flaps in the engine bay, and around the rim of the fan, 
getting under the bus there is a drip from the bottom of the fan 
housing. There is obviously a leak in there but its pretty hard to see 
in there.

So my question to you all is this, what do you think could be leaking 
in there that would cause oil to get sprayed around the fan and out the 
flaps ? Checking the oil I don't seem to have lost a tone of oil but 
there is certainly a fair bit in there and its getting sprayed all 
over.
Thoughts ? Tips ? What would your first check be ?

As always its frustrating to have everything running beautifully and 
these leaks be the thorn in my side.

Steve
