I posted some of this information a few weeks back but it's not in the
archives yet and gone from the reflector. Look for the "Calif Smog Issues"
thread on 27 Oct 2004.

One note about tuning with an on-board unit is you can tune for cruise to
optimize your mileage and head temps. L-Jet isn't very tunable other than
rotating the internals of the AFM which is not dealer approved.

For example if you set the %CO to 1.1 at idle at light cruise the %CO may go
way past zero (14.7 AFR and above).

The setting I've been using since my smog test two years ago produced these
results (back then I benched 2.5% after 1500rpm and 3.5% after 2500rpm):

Cold start: 10% CO

Warm idle: 3.5% CO
Light throttle: 0% CO
1/2 throttle: 2.4% CO
WOT: 5.1% CO

The enrichment phase during a cold start is interesting to watch. I measured
the pulse width of the injectors a few weeks ago and it's approximately
double (gulp gulp).

When I turned the AFM screw out one more turn (leaner) the results were:

Warm idle: 1.6% CO
Light throttle: 0% CO
1/2 throttle: 0.7% CO (that's what I measured)
WOT: 4.8% CO

Two turns out from the original setting:

Warm idle: 0.3% CO
Light throttle: 0% CO
1/2 throttle: 2.7% CO
WOT: 4.3% CO

These last settings are very close to John Connelly's recommended settings
for FI. IIRC, the engine sounded rough when warming up on a cold morning. I
would shoot for those settings but by only adjusting the idle mixture in the
shop you won't know for sure because my AFM spring may not be the same. I
haven't messed with it but there's plenty of issues wrt the spring tension
if you search the archives.

When I took those readings I hadn't built my CHT measuring setup yet. I'll
have head temps to go with those settings in a little while.
