Subject: Sun Super Tach II Question

I have been able to obtain a Sun Super Tach II for very little cash ($2 
new in the box) but !!!!! there are no instructions for installation and 
the wires coming out of the back are missing.  I have searched the web 
and the archives and there's lots of  "Hook up the blue wire to..... and 
the red wire to ....."etc but I have no wires.  Just 4  plugs deep 
inside the back labelled "T" (on the top)  "L" on the right (passenger) 
side, "B" on the left (drivers) side and "G" on the bottom.  Has anyone 
access to one of these ($75) babies and can tell me what plug does what?
