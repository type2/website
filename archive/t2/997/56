Call me sick, but the first thing that came to mind was that episode of The
Simpson's when all the kids get video camera to tape a school project. It's
the scene when Bart tried to kick over the jacked up car so it falls on
Homer and can't get it to tip. He then says "Who knew you could hold up a
car with a wicker basket!"
