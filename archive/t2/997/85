Charlie,



The fact that this is a quandary for you, says alot about you. You sound like you would make a wonderful leader. It seems to me that the Mothership may have helped you realize your potential as a leader and given you a larger perspective than the others there.?It doesn't really matter how?they see you as a leader, you will lead in whatever capacity you decide even if that?is getting back on the road. If you decide to stay, you can always look back at your travels as good times that have shaped who you are now.



Sitting here in my cubicle, without those problems, makes me envy you. Good luck. 



Chris
