If you're gonna stick with VW aircooled, you're
already "at the top!" That was the final stage of
evolution in those engines. Next was Vanagon version
of same engine with different fuel injection system -
no advantage to switch - and then the water-boxers.
You will likely see a vast improvement in rebuilding
your current engine though. If you have current engine
rebuilt you are getting what you have taken care of
all these years only "renewed" whereas a rebuilt
bought outright will get you somebody else's stuff -
possibly from multiple somebody elses and no control
over the execution of the rebuild.

Conversion, such as I have (Subaru) is a tremendous
improvement, but I cannot recommend it unless you are
capable of doing your own work. -BaH
