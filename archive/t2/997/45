Subject: The pipe between the heat exchanger and control box

This is on my '72

I am missing the pipe that runs between my heat exchangers and heater
control boxes.   The heater control boxes were easy to find -- but that pipe
does not appear to be available in the after market.

Do the exist and I am just not finding them?

I had figured I would just fabricate one and that ended up becoming more
frustrating than I expected.  The 2 different size opening and the angle.


Thanks
