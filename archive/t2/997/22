Subject: fuel pump bad?/gas tank blocked solved!  Yay,Off to Knoebel's

1.Well, now I am an expert on a "starved pump" sound!  It runs normally 
at 40 psi for 3 seconds (full gas in line) then becomes noisy (a gravely 
"hum" with the pressure gauge swinging back and forth over about 5 psi. 
  Now I have new spare I just got from BusDepot.  I bypassed the tank 
via a hose from a gas can nozzle (can rested on chair to be higher than 
pump) and ran pump via turning the AMP flapper and voila- steady running 
for at least 20 seconds!  Gas only dribbled from hose. Blew air up the 
line (with clamps, as back pressure was high enough to blow lines off 
bibs) and it finally bubbled/ran freely and a test showed it to run OK 
for the time being.  See next to see why that was a bad idea, as the 
blockage would have been easier to find if left over/in the down hose. 
The copper pipe the mechanic had installed looked rather crimped at the 
90 deg bend and also likely helped with blocking line if a piece got 
down it.
2. Cut opening over the gas tank sender (checked archives- wow, back in 
'96 I posted the measurements when investigating a PO cover on 
daughter's 75 bus.   Easy clearance for a jig saw, so I started slot 
with a dremyl disk and cut about a 5" oval over sender.  One can JUST 
see both hose nib openings in the bottom of the "baffle box" off to the 
left.  RIGHT BY the OUTLET was this stuff that looked like tan packing 
tape, all jumbled up.  I attached a stiff 3/4" pipe to a shop vac kept 
outside with an over 20 foot hose, , with a piece of paint strainer bag 
just behind the stepdown pipe the vac provides and sucked up the 
blockage.  Looks like decomposing packing tape, not silicone, but it 
also could be some coating/sealer around the baffle box, as I found some 
stuck under the outside of the box (had to pry with a screwdriver to 
clear it) that looks more like sealer, but very flexible like tape. 
That I sucked up with some gas still sitting there; no "boom" from the 
vac.  The tank has some rust bloom here and there, but no loose scale. I 
tried to blow air in different areas/use flexible plastic hose to suck 
up where I could not see, but it is too flexible- today it's off to Home 
Depot for a Gas line flex pipe for stoves so I can shape it and 
blow/suck around the other side of the baffle box. Now the trip to 
Kampers by Knoebel's next week is possible! (real nice FREE to get in 
amusement park under Bloomsburg, Pa; you'll likely see Ron of BusDepot 
there).  C'mon, Manassas folks, come north for once!
