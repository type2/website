Ok guys,  72 1700 dual carbs.

I am getting a flickering oil light, usually when  under a load at higher 
RPM's but shows up all over the place.

where do  I start looking?

Hello Ed  check the wire going to the sender , which is behind the  dizzy, 
and make sure it isn't rubbing on anything. Then do an oil pressure  check, IF 
that is good replace the sender. The dash area is another likely place  but 
start with the engine end first  later  mark  dearing
