List,

i have a customer who had their '74 engine fail in banff. they are  
looking for leads on a good used engine, engine rebuild shop, that  
sort of thing. they are on a long-term sort of open-ended road trip  
and have time to work through the issue properly.

i posted about this a few weeks ago without any replies. they are  
still looking for some assistance.
