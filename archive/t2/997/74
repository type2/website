	On my minor experience I agree with that.  Anyone dispute?
	There are running-in oils designed on this principle.  They 
lack some additives which would be desirable only if the oil was to 
be run far more than the 500 - 1000 mi at which they are dumped.

	For the reason you've just stated!

	Many of the changes in sump oil this past couple decades have 
been to increase intervals between changes.  This is not a major 
consideration, esp with an engine such as the T1 which contains a 
tiny amount of sump oil anyway (compared with typical car or van 
motors).
	One of my schoolmates is now NZ's senior motoring journo, and 
has long been involved in racing (Jegwore D replica).  He reckons 
'old' motors like his burn far too much oil when on synthetic e.g 
Mobil 1  -  too much oil gets pumped upstairs and thence down the 
valve guides.
	Extremely low viscosity when cold e.g SAE 5W is desirable 
only in freezing weather.  In warmer climes it may allow hoons to rev 
motors abusively from a cold start, but wise drivers warm up motors 
gently.  At the bottom end of the viscosity range in a multigrade 
sump oil, 20W is low i.e will lubricate all parts of the motor within 
a short time from a cold start.
