Yes I know about fuel vapors and sparking vacuum cleaners- that's why I 
used a 2" shop vac hose 30 feet long to it standing far from the bus! 
Blowing air in let me see if anything loose was flying around in there. 
  For suction I used a restricted  small hose (about 1/2" inner diam.) 
taped 5" into the opening of the big 2" hose allowed lots of mixing of 
air into the hose to make it very lean by the time it hit the vac.  This 
was used briefly at a time to let the vac vent out what it sucked in.

  Sucking air out of a gas tank (even an empty one) with a vacuum cleaner is
  a great way to learn about fuel/air explosives.  80
