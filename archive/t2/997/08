Subject: vacuum reminder

hey all,  this is just a reminder that if you have a FI bus, you might want to check the vacuum advance to make sure it's working correctly.  I've had 3 FI buses, all 3 of which had a ruptured membrane inside the air cleaner which lead to a vacuum leak for the advance.  The best way to show this visually is at:

  The yellow hoses are the ones I'm talking about.  I disconnected the hose which goes to the air cleaner and just routed a single hose from the vacuum advance on the distributor to the throttle body.  It helped power and acceleration significantly.
   
  If I'm saying anything incorrect here, someone please correct me.  Greg
