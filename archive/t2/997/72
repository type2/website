Here's another thought on the oil Jello additives.

Ever seen the Lucas displays on a parts counter--the three spinning
wheels that you can crank to see how the Lucas jello will climb & say up
on the gear's?

Well, that's just what t does in yur trans or rear end.
It'll climb up to the top gears alright, but starve what's on the bottom
of the trans or the rear end.

It'll cause the bearings to burn for lack of lubrication.
Lower shafts will gall.

Imagine what the Jello will do for you engine.


It's county fair Flim Flam in a bottle.
