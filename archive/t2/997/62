Subject: Using "quickPlastik" as cover for sender hole cut over gas tank

I used 3 tubes of a moldable epoxy plastic called QuickPlastik (Home 
Depot, selected because its "steel" counterpart had only 6 minutes of 
work time, compared to 20 minutes for this.  I first put down Press and 
Seal over an intact rib zone  by the hole.  Then after kneading the 
epoxy and flattening it on a polyethylene box cover to an oval shape 
3/16" thick extending about an inch beyond the hole, I formed it over 
the ribs with the Press and Seal under it. It did not stick to my hands 
as some suggested it would.  After hardening, it was trimmed to a more 
even shape and sanded to feather the edges round.  It was drilled 
through to the metal with self-tapping screws mostly where the ribs were 
not up, and formed a good looking cover.  It will next have nonhardening 
sealer put under it before being closed "permanently".  For a stiffer 
cover, I can glue the piece I cut out just under it.
    Looking at this plastic (stiff but flexible) I can imagine using it 
to form parts such as a custom visor holder or a holder mounted to a 
wall for a cell phone or cd player.......
