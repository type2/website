The move to the high desert has brought forth the oil leaks. A local 
mechanic says there are several: at the front seal, and near the push-rod 
tube by the #3 cylinder, a few others that he can remove engine, tear apart, 
and find all - or we may think about getting a new engine because the costs 
would be about the same. He says we can nurse it a long by changing to 20W50 
oil, adding Lucas' oil stabilizer, and keeping a close eye on the oil level. 
Odometer is at 38,700 - not sure how many times it has rolled over, but 
certain it's at least 138k miles... maybe 238.

I think he may be right, and I'm not entirely heart broken. Last night I was 
singing, "I'm gonna get a new engine" :-). This is my "forever car" if I can 
treat her right that long. (aww)

So, we're now at Camp Verde, AZ - almost 4,000 feet altitude, desert climate 
(not quite as hot as Phoenix), there are big hills here, and any drive to a 
store is at least a 20 minute schlep. She's my daily driver. We'd love a 
more powerful engine than the stock one (duh). If we buy a new engine, what 
would you fellas recommend? Thanks.
