Odom was (-at-) 38,827.4 yesterday with new oil, etc. Last night's test drive 
went fine, was 26 miles round-trip. (had to meet family for dinner) Oil was 
still at top line upon return (38,853.4), little smoke, less power.

Oil was above top line before a drive today (Parked on incline). Went for a 
drive to town to pick up supplies, groceries. When we got into 2nd town, 
idled at a stoplight - oil smoke. Odom (-at-) 38,880.1. Pulled into a parking 
lot, looked below, it's just coming down from the center of the engine.

Cut the engine, sent honey to pick up lunch. I waited about 5 - 10 minutes, 
then checked the oil. Engine was hot. Oil was (-at-) minimum line (level parking 
lot).

I did not yet see the posts on the Lucas additive - added enough Lucas to 
bring the oil level back up to the max. line. Back home, now : 38,901.8 - 
oil is above max line, but bus is parked on an incline. Not a spot on the 
driveway. I jacked the rear end up about a foot to level and check again: 
oil right at top line. No foam on oil fill cap, or on dip-stick. New air 
filter going in along with fuel filter tonight.

Priorities: Get a new engine in it FAST so I can get on with life, and hubby 
doesn't have to buy a poop-mobile just so we can get around town. I don't 
need any more problems. I will rebuild the original on my own time, so we 
will have a "Plan B" years from now when these engines are near impossible 
to find (if we will need another one within the next 30 or so years) - 
provided it's still good. If not, I'll part out the original.

Willing to pay the $2,500 for a new one - where do I find it? Mid-America 
has new ones on sale - but they're for the type 1's. Numbers/websites 
please. Thanks guys.
