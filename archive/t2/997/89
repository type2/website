Subject: '78 2.0 won't start

HELP!  My '78 Westy was running fine on Saturday, just idling like it
should.  I turned off the engine and went about doing some odd-n-end
activities around the garage, then about an hour later I tried to start
her - to no avail.  It will start using "starting fluid", but then dies
suddenly and will not re-start (except with a shot of starting fluid -
then dies immediately).  I removed the fuel pump - thinking that it was
not working - and it tests good, so I put it back on, and the same
condition applies (only runs momentarily with starting fluid).  A buddy
stopped by and he thinks that my injectors are no longer firing ....
What could have changed???  It was running fine before I shut it down,
and NOTHING was touched after that.  I have an extra AFM lying around
(not entirely positive that it is good, but no reason to believe that it
is "bad"), and I put it in place of the old AFM ..... with NO CHANGE!
What could I be missing?
