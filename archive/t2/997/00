Subject: Spare doesn't fit anymore

I recently replaced the tires on my '79 with Continental Vanco 8's.  They
are 185 R14C's.  I had them mounted on Vanagon Alloys and now the spare no
longer fits in the kitchen tire cabinet.  The spare fit fine when I had
185's on the stock steel wheels.

Has anyone had this happen?  Mahybe it fits, and I don't want to force it?
I'm thinking of maybe fabricating a new cover for the cabinet.

Any info appreciated.
