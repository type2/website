Hey,
even your paint won't withstand exposure to gasoline!  As I recall, 
epoxy is fairly impervious to gasoline.  It's not an environment that 
should have gas around unless you rupture the tank or have leaks in the 
inlet pipe.  Then drips should be obvious. The original cutout piece is 
glued to the  underside of the plastic, minimizing exposure.
