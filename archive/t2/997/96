Hi,

 

I have a 1971 Bus I am putting up for sale.  Its been a daily driver for me
and its in decent condition.  Mechanically its good. I put in a new 1600
longblock engine and added big bore cylinders and improved cylinder heads
(Competition Engineering www.cevw.com) does most of my work that I dont do.
I just had brakes redone and new exhaust and tires are good.  The fuel gauge
doenst work (I installed a new sender but havent found a gauge yet).  I have
been working on the interior but its not all done.  I have facing seats in
the back with a cabinet. The rear seat folds down. I added some interior
insulation and paneling so it stays decently cool in the heat.  I am selling
as I have a new family with kids to cart around and my new HOA doesnt let me
work on vehicles. I will throw in a engine jack and tools (timing light,
tach, manuals) if you don't have them and I have a CD/radio that also goes
with it. I am asking $2100 for whole thing.
