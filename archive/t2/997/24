 1.Well, now I am an expert on a "starved pump"
 sound!  It runs normally 
 at 40 psi for 3 seconds (full gas in line) then
 becomes noisy (a gravely 
 "hum" with the pressure gauge swinging back and
 forth over about 5 psi. 
   Now I have new spare I just got from BusDepot.  I
 bypassed the tank 
 via a hose from a gas can nozzle (can rested on
 chair to be higher than 
 pump) and ran pump via turning the AMP flapper and
 voila- steady running 
 for at least 20 seconds!  Gas only dribbled from
 hose. Blew air up the 
 line (with clamps, as back pressure was high enough
 to blow lines off 
 bibs) and it finally bubbled/ran freely and a test
 showed it to run OK 
 for the time being.  See next to see why that was a
 bad idea, as the 
 blockage would have been easier to find if left
 over/in the down hose. 
 The copper pipe the mechanic had installed looked
 rather crimped at the 
 90 deg bend and also likely helped with blocking
 line if a piece got 
 down it.
