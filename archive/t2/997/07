Hi to all--
B  I found this group a few months ago and have been lurking since. I
have a '77 Westfalia that I picked up in soCal in '96. I moved to Las
Vegas shortly afterward and eventually parked the bus after the
transmission went out. Now I am preparing to move back to the high
desert in California and need to do something with the VW, so I am
seeking advice. What to do with it? I don't know that I'll be
interested in using it for transportation again, as I've been spoiled
by airconditioned vehicles--but I might like to use it for enthusiast
get togethers--does anybody know what's happening in southern
California in that respect? Otherwise, the options are to sell it here
(not much of a market for non-running vehicles) or trailer it to CA and
put it back together to sell. I do not want to see it go to the
crusher. It is basically a rustfree car that needs some attention.
Comments?
