Subject: Late model VW electronic ignition questions.

Hi All:

I have three questions about the California electronic ignition system.

What ignition wire set should be used? Can the federal Bosch 09171
ignition wires be used or must I get something different? If so what?
Bus Depot just carries the 09171 set.

When the stock VW electronic ignition coil goes bad, what can be used to
replace it? Just another used coil, or can I get something after market?

Lastly, should the vacuum lines to the vacuum advance/retard distributor
be left connected or disconnected when setting the idle and timing? I
have seen post stating both. My 85 Bentleys also states both. Which
should it be?

Regards,
