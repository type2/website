Subject: Childs cot / hammock

Hey there Volks,

A visitor to my webpage emailed me asking for a source of a childs cot for a
79. I gave 'em my standard "junkyard, swapmeet, online classifieds, auction
site by the bay" email. They emailed me back and informed me there is in fact a
source for a childs cot.

Seems that http://www.gowesty.com now has reproduction child cots. Check them
out here:

They've got the 69-75 cots covered, but it doesn't appear that they have the
correct poles for and 76-79 (2 piece collapsible poles). The 74 and 75 cots
stored under a full width bed/bench seat (one piece poles), 76-79 had
collapsible 2 piece poles because the bed was 3/4 width and one piece bars
won't fit under the bed in the stock storage location. So while the 74-75 poles
will work in a 76-79, you won't have a convenient place to store them. 

I had mistakely bought a 74-75 cot, and had to find the 76-79 poles after I had
discovered my mistake. That was the inspriration for this page:
