Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch problem.

Steve is right about the broken cable possibility- but here is further
symptom observing: lie underneath and WATCH the clutch arm while someone
pushes the pedal to the floor- does the arm move only a little bit? (see
below). If it moves as far as a normal bus's throwout, 
I'd suspect something you need to pull the engine to check.  IE, 1.
-throwout arms broken, and can't push in the throwout bearing 2.- locked
up clutch plate, as in failed lining (I had this; it impacted at the
edges due to centrifugal force), 3. -siezed pilot bearing (disk can't
spin).
     If the arm moved a little bit, I'd replace the cable, but you can
verify all is well in the engine by prying the arm all the way down (may
need to remove the cable end and stick an eyebolt in there)- and while
it is there, does it now shift into all the gears with engine running? 
Yes- replace the cable.
