Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator light on

Alternator Light:  My '77 Westy doesn't do this, but it idles pretty high
(at least it used to before I removed the engine).  The airplanes I fly have
what is essentially a type-4 FI engine, and their alternator lights always
come on at RPM's below 800.  The alternator just isn't spinning fast enough
to generate enough voltage at really low rpms.  You might check your idle
adjust.

Oil Light:  Mine does this too (at least it used to, when it had oil in it).
It just takes a second for the oil to fill up all the galleries in the case
and reach normal pressure.  I don't think you have to worry unless it stays
on or flickers on and off at idle when the engine is warm.
