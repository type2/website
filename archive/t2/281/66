Since its Friday, and my bus engine is on the floor of my garage, and I'm
online about it right now, I want to extend a hell of a VW deal out to
everyone.  I went and bought me a MisterSushi Montero last week as a nasty
weather driver to back up my bus for this winter, and this leaves me with 2
too many cars to park indoors as I can only get 2 in the garage and 1 in the
barn. And my in-sensitive wife demands that she should park her car inside
instead of an old VW I don't even drive any more.
So I have a 66 bug and an 85 Cabriolet Convertible that MUST GO.  The cabby
is
in great running condition except that I just blew a CV joint last week on
the
way back from the car dealer last week.  I was going to fix it and sell the
cabby for 1500, but I've too much to do.  So make me an offer on one or
both!!!
Heres a link for the bug, to see the cabby, click "View other ads" on the bug
