I think VW was making improvements to meet Fed regs on emissions and noise 
and probably had a limited budget dedicated to the aircooled engines. 
Porsche and Tatra shows what can be done with big $$$, VW limited to low 
cost solutions.

Their changes were cheap and only when necessary. Us enthusiasts are 
willing to spend a little money on our VW's.

Remember a $10 saved on 1 million vehicles is alot of money!!!
