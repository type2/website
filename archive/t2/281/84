Subject: 79 muffler mount

Bus of fools:

How is the 79 muffler mounted? 

The Depot lists a strap for 75-78.
Mine was welded to either the block or the engine carrier with two pieces of stock bar, but they have disengaged the muffler for the second time in my 2.5 year ownership and the muffler's hanging.

What's the stock method? I know about plumbers tape, bailing wire etc.

Billy
