A type 1 alternator seems to light the light until the engine is blipped a
tiny bit from first startup.  I've no idea about as type IV

Compared to a "conventional" alternator, a type 1 alternator does not spin
nearly as fast.  My guesstimate observing pulley sizes is that the type 1
alternator spins about half as fast as a typical watercooler alternator.
This may have something to do with the light staying on.

Keep an eye on it, and if it makes a habit of coming on, or stays on at
higher RPM, do something about it!
