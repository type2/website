Subject: Part # Guru Needed

Volks,

Would the real part # guru please stand up?  I have a couple of
vintage VW parts that I'm trying to identify.  The fiche doesn't
have them, and I can only find close approximates on the web
(-at-) sites like Ron's and Ronnie's.

Please contact me off-list if you're one of those folks that
thrives
on VW challenges.
