Subject: BN4 fuel pump

if you have an early BN4, it needs the special metering pump-it pumps a
measured squirt in with every stroke.  This is not compatible with the late
BN4s or any other fuel pump.  It is NLA, but there is a guy in Colorado who
has a few and quoted me $85 for a used one.

I traded my heater to John Baker for his '71, he fixed the fuel pump by
making a new diaphragm, but gave up on the unit, I think.

There is a good article in the library called "BN4 demystified" check it
out. . .
