70 was the last year of L code locks. 71+ is R code. You will need the 75
handle.

Look at the hinge bolts:
70 were countersunk Allen head. They went thru hinge on the door and threaded
into welded-on bracket on the A pillar.

Later doors used hex headed bolts that went thru the A pillar bracket and
threaded into the hinge on the door.

Totally opposite. The change was somewhere around 75/76.
