If your bus hasn't had to meet very strict smog specifications up to now you 
may have to replace some rather hard to find and expensive parts.

Determine if your bus is 49 State(Fed) model or a California model. The 
engine door should have the info written inside the lid.

Get a look at a service manual (Robert Bentley is good) and compare
your exhaust and fuel injection components to those in the manual.

My last time through smog with a 1977 bus I did the work. I had to:

1. Replace the Egr Filter $138
2. Replace the Cat Converter $125
3. Replace The Egr Valve $200 (rebuilt)
4. Replace the Fuel Filler Restrictor (NLA) $150 (long story)

You mat have to find a crossover pipe (NLA) along with muffler, tail pipe 
and other interconnecting hardware.

In addition you most likely will have to pull, clean and reinstall the input 
air distributor to clear the EGR system.

You can't pass CAL smog with a "tampered" fuel filler
neck or a non sealing filler cap.

Now if you or the PO drive away from a pump without removing the fuel nozzle 
the filler restrictor can be torn and fall under the "tampered" category. 
This is a eyeball test.

The restrictor is to keep you from using leaded gas and poisoning the CAT 
converter ( required for my 77 bus but not required for FED 49 state 77 
models). My restrictor was torn and only the FED version was available at a 
reasonable price ~$20. I was quoted $150 if they could find one at SMOG HELP 
(1-800-544-4357 Darron I believe was his name).

I put in the FED version 211 201 199 I think the CAL version is 211 201
199B. Replacing this part CAL or FED is not fun. The smog tech looked into 
my filler and marked me down for a tampered fuel restrictor (FED version).

To pass I cut the hood off the damaged CAL filler neck, closed the torn 
restrictor hole by tightening a wire tie around it (it looked good). I left 
the opening lip attached to the trimmed and closed restrictor. I removed the 
metal flange from the fuel opening, applied a coat of Vas to the trimmed CAL 
neck and shoved it into the FED neck and replaced the flange (4 screws).

Check that the vacuum operated ECC cutoff valve (air cleaner body) is 
working. I think this part is NLA.


I assume the FI system is working but if possible measure the CO emission 
content to see if it is adjustable to 1% at idle (950 RPM)and holds at 
higher revs. Do not let your bus run with less than 0.5 % CO.
