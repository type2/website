Also before you install it - take a look in the Bentley and a few other 
shop manuals to see which way it is supposed to be oriented - the gap I mean.

The engine seal in the donor vehicle might have been removed and 
reinstalled differently from the factory.  I put my foam back in just like 
it was when I got the bus, so mine could be wrong too.
