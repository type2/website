Andrew,

As Phil and Tim have said, these do not work.  If you think a second, you
will realize why the whole family of these sorts of products cannot work.
The ideal is to get as much air as possilbe from outside the engine to
inside the cylinders with as few impediments as possible.  The *necessary*
impedimentia are the throttle butterfly and the air filter.  The first
controls speed, the second engine lifespan.  OK so far?  Now, once you get
past the throttle butterfly, you really want as little tubing, as straight
a flow, and as few obstructions as possible.  Racers reduce tube length by
putting a carb on top of each intake port and they angle the carb and
connector so that the air flows straight in to the cylinder.  They reduce
obstructions by taking a die grinder (dremel) and "porting and polishing"
the whole air path, making it as big and as smooth as they can. Like
mirror smooth.

The essence of the family of devices you have found one of is that they
introduce turbulence into the airstream, by putting fins in the path of
the air and diverting it into a swirling stream.  Rather than giving the
air the shortest path, by angling it flow it makes the path longer (fill
in the blank...  "A straight line is the _________ distance between two
points"); rather than speeding the flow, they make it slower; and rather
than removing obstructions, they introduce one.  These should be the
*last* three things anyone interested in performance wants!!!!
Basically, they are worse than useless and do exactly the reverse of what
anyone interestd in improving the performance of their engine would want.
