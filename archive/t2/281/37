Also before you install it - take a look in the Bentley and a few other
shop manuals to see which way it is supposed to be oriented - the gap I mean.

The engine seal in the donor vehicle might have been removed and
reinstalled differently from the factory.  I put my foam back in just like
it was when I got the bus, so mine could be wrong too.

    ...as I understood it,the foam seal should be positioned such that the gap
   (although there shouldn't be a gap as such) is in the centre at the rear of
   the engine bay...no?...although I wondered why since the opposite way
   would position the gap above the gearbox,potentially letting in less heat
   than above the muffler.

   I use a cable tie threaded thru both halves of the seal where they meet
   in order to keep them snugly together...
