Make sure that the cross arm has not drifted sideways a bit. I toasted 3 
bearing when I first got involved with aircooled VW's on a '70 Westy. 
Bearing would be fine for 5 miles or so and then it would seize. Turns out 
the arm had drifted towards the driver's side about 1/8" so the bearing was 
scrubbing on the pressure plate.

We fixed that and about a week later the shaft broke (factory spot welds 
failed)! Lots of cussing, replaced it and no more troubles ever.
