Andrew,

<big sigh>

2 answers possible......

1:  TANSTAAFL
	There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch

2:  (if you are rich)..buy one and let us know!<big grin>
	IF it worked,  then everyone would have one.....from the factory


Just read an article in the paper the other day that the "fleet" MPG
	is way down...mostly from people buying SUV's......If the factory
	folks thought it worked then there would be on on every new SUV.

Sorry to burst that bubble, but the infomercial people are in it for the 
	rip-off potential...*not* to make the world a better place....and 
	your car a better performer for cheap...

Another  <very big sigh>

Yes, I *have* bought Ginsu knives<grin> and they still cut marble *and*
	tomatoes!

I want peace on earth and good will toward all for Christmas too!!!!

Cheers, dave
