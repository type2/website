Hiya John,

Just a well-meant word of caution here...........

In all likelihood you HAVE found the culprit.  However, do take the time to 
be sure that your charcoal canister is functioning as it should.  It can get 
VERY plugged up and possibly have the same general effect as a kinked vent 
line.  

Pull your charcoal canister off and blow through it.  Blow through the big 
hole on the vent hook-up side.  It should be easy for you to do this.  If you 
meet with a lot of resistance or the canister seems entirely plugged, you 
need to find a new canister or clean out the old one.  If you need some 
guidelines on cleaning out your old one, zap me an e-mail and I'll give you 
the details.
