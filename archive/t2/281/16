Subject: NOS Bumper Guards 73 and later type 2

   I just recieved  a shippment of NOS parts and found something that might
be of interest to all you late Bay window owners.

   Complete set of 4 front and rear bumper accessory bumper guards with the
rubber . These are NOS  ZVW-151-806 number on instructions or ZVW 151 802
number on boxes.
   
  They appear to be powder painted an off white
    
   These are NEW in the boxes with installation instructions and all parts
to install.

I just went out and fit them on a 73 bus in the shop and they look nice
(only 9 sets left)

I have 10 sets available at $75.00 dollars a set

I am posting this to the list first befor I put them on The Samba.


ronnie,  still looking through all the other boxes to see what other goodies
I got.
