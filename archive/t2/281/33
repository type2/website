Yes and yes. I recommend the epoxy high build primers for the top. I 
removed the top, sanded it to smooth it up (the fibers were exposed). 
Sealed it with epoxy primer after I fixed a couple of cracks in the luggage 
rack. Fixed them with fiberglass cloth and resin on the bottom and filled 
the cracks from the top with typical body filler.

Terry K. can elaborate on this as he is our resident list paint expert 
(being a pro).

Spray it all at about the same time. You might out to research the base 
coat / clear coat paints. They are nice. Mine I sprayed with acrylic enamel 
+ some hardener. I did the work myself, beginner's job, and the bus is a 
driver so I did not want to invest alot of $$$ in the paint. Next time...

Good name by the way - it's served me well.
