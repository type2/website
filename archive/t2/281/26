Subject: Carb Preheat Host Questions

I've been trying to figure out how to hook up the carb preheater hose.
Specifically, how does the hose attach where it meets the rearmost engine tin?
I gather that the air is warmed by the exhaust, is this correct?  Also, my
aircleaner does not have the thermostatic element any more.  Is there even any
reason to hook up the preheat hose?
Thanks once again,
Hal Landvoigt
