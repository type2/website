Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Problem

Chris, sorry to say but it sounds to me like you have
the same problem that I had about two months ago and
it requires an engine drop.  I had the exact same
symptoms.  I think your pilot bearing is gone.  It is
the bearing that sits inside the end of the crankshaft
and allows the end of the driveshaft.  It is a roller
bearing and when I split the tranny from the engine, I
found mine sitting there with a pile of rollers.  What
happens is if the rollers are popped out of the
bearing it causes the crankshaft to always spin the
driveshaft on your tranny, so that even if your clutch
is engaging properly, the end of the driveshaft is
still spinning.  I had to start my bus up in gear and
stay in 1st to get me home.  Anyway, I would bet my
bottom dollar this is your dilema.  the good thing is
that the part is only about four bucks, and you can
replace your clutch plate while you have the engine
out.  hope this helps
