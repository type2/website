Subject: Need advice on California SMOG for 1977 Bus

Please help me collect information so that I can make
a decision of what to do with my newly-acquired 1977
VW Bus with emissions systems that have been heavily
modified by the previous owner.

My three choices are:
  1) sell at to a person cheaply after I fully
disclose my problems with the exhaust system
  2) buy another van for parts
  3) fix the van and try to pass smog

Please click on the above link for information I've
collected thus far from the VW bus community (which I
really want to be a part of because it seems so fun).

My van is a pop-top with full camper equipment, sink,
stove, refridgerator.  So, there is some value to the
interior components. Also, there is almost no rust,
but the van needs a paint job. 

Advice and opinions would be very much appreciated.

Regards,
Craig
