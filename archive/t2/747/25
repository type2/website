First, I haven't bought from these places but found them in some quick 
searches (they seem to list some transmission seals)....

requires Java  -  https://www.rockauto.com/dbphp/mak,VOLKSWAGEN

Also, according to:

http://www.gowesty.com/AT_failure2.htm

the AT section hasn't changed since '72 and the designation is "010" and 
was used in Audis and VWs until '93.

A full rebuild kit is listed for $195 here:

Hope this helps...
