Take a photo of it...is it the best model ever? :-)

The basics of most models are:

V - DC volts (testing the battery, electricals)

~V - AC volts (useless for the car unless you've got the alternator apart)

 (greek symbol omega)- ohms (measuring resistance)

- you have to disconnect the battery before you can measure resistance.

A - DC amps (only good for milliamp measurements)

- sometimes there is a second banana plug connect with a 10A fuse but you'll
blow it if you try to measure the starter or the wiring harness umbillical (
lots of amps).

~A - AC amps (not useful on the car)

To measure volts you put the red probe at the positive connection and the
black probe negative. To measure amps you have to put the meter inline with
the current which is why it blows when the amps are too much for it. If
there is not fuse, it melts.

It's a good idea to disconnect the probes before changing the setting on the
meter. You never know how it's constructed inside. If it's analog this will
also prevent the needle from pegging itself.

When my last one broke after 15 years of service I bought a Fluke 179 and
I've never been happier. Autoranging!
