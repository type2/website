Hiya Ron,

Anything you find out there will almost certainly be aftermarket parts.  
Beware!  They are shoddy goods at best.  You are MUCH better off by going out to a 
boneyard and finding a 1970 with its original 887A lock housing.  You can 
remove the keylock from that unit OR do a little rehabbing (read:  disassemble, 
clean, lube, reassemble) and have a unit specifically made for your 
application.  And, by the way, if you do a little routine maintenance on the 887A it will 
last forever.  The thing is durn near bulletproof.

If you should need any further assistance, please don't hesitate to zap an 
e-mail my way.  I had to go through the intricacies of the 1970 ignition lock a 
couple of years ago and I learned two rather startling facts.  1.  The 887A is 
not listed in VW parts records (isn't that correct, Karl?).  No references to 
servicing this unit now exist (as far as I can determine).  2.  The online 
reference sources for rehabbing the ignition in a baywindow will not get you 
through doing an 887A.

Good luck!  I know all of this doesn't sound encouraging, but remember, if I 
could get through this, you can too.
