Subject: crapcase problem found... not nec. solved

it was pretty obscure - the reason #2 was pinching... was because #1 
had a dowel hole too deep!
what happened: due to poor machining,  the dowel on #1 sat in the 
hole  something like .5mm DEEPER than the other dowels. look at the 
top of a bearing dowel, or the dowel hole in a main bearing. see that 
bevel? that is roughly how much shorter  than the others #1 dowel 
sat. hard to see with eye - besides, these were the same dowel pins i 
used before... no worries, eh?   anyways, that dowel and the bevel on 
the bearing's dowel hole allowed #1 to slip a little, and FEEL 
SEATED, even tho the pin sat a bit to the side of the hole. 
obviously, as i torqued  the nuts, it lifted the bearing and the 
crank upwards, seizing the crank. #2 just showed it more. when i 
looked closely at #1, there is an impression of the dowel embossed 
into the back of the bearing, and a pinch mark on the inside directly 
above the dowel.
of course, i had NO luck getting the now-firmly-seated dowel out. so 
after failing to budge it, i shrugged. so i might spin #1 at some 
point. screw it, the case DESERVES it. had the brazillians been able 
to drill 4 holes the same depth this wouldn't have been an issue. 
there are sooooo many other things to worry about, this one ain't in 
the top 5. if i lived north of the 52 parallel, maybe.

anyways, unless someone has a sure-fire way of removing  a stuck 
dowel that DOES NOT involve $$, onward and upwards.
