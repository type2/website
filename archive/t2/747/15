Subject: Bus Depot doesn't carry it but I need it!

Hello all - 
 
I have a Vanagon 81 with Automatic.  I need a gasket for the final drive bottom pan, and I'm also leaking out the Govenor, so I need new gaskets for that.
 
Any idea where I can order such things?  The Bus Depot can't get them.
 
Thanks - 
 
Marc
