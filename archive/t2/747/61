Subject: Water Tank Woes

Anyone have any experience with a striped water tank outlets?

I found my leak - the outlet where the pump screws in is stripped.  The PO 
had some sort of blue stuff around the pump where it goes into the outlet - 
I suspect it was gasket stuff but ... I dunno.

I got a new pump and wrapped loads of Teflon tape around it and put it in 
but it doesn't seem to get very tight - it appears pretty much stripped. 
I'm wondering if it is possible to tap it and put some sort of bushing in 
there and then put the pump in - anyone ever try this?  Is it possible to 
pull the tank with the cabinet still installed?
