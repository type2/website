Subject: Re: [T2] Water Tank Woes

From john d:

 Anyone have any experience with a striped water tank outlets?

 I found my leak - the outlet where the pump screws in is stripped.  The PO
 had some sort of blue stuff around the pump where it goes into the outlet -
 I suspect it was gasket stuff but ... I dunno.

 I got a new pump and wrapped loads of Teflon tape around it and put it in
 but it doesn't seem to get very tight - it appears pretty much stripped.
 I'm wondering if it is possible to tap it and put some sort of bushing in
 there and then put the pump in - anyone ever try this?  Is it possible to
 pull the tank with the cabinet still installed?

I am assuming you have a 76-79 Westy???????

The pump screws into the tank. After you screw it in with teflon tape and tighten the hose clamp on the neck 
of the tank where it screws in, does it still leak?  Or are you missing the clamp?

Yes, the tank comes out, but if it leaks with teflon tape and a tight clamp;
you need another tank.

To remove: Pull out the filler tube [carefully!].
Remove the large rubber baby bumpers.
You already have the false panel removed since you are playing with the pump.
Loosen the inner clamp and unscrew the drain hose.
Walk the tank out.
