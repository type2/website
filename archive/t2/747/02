Richard et.al.;

Please excuse my momentary (they're coming more often these days) lapse in
brain function.  In this case, my left hand didn't know what my right was
doing.  I meant to search for wiper/washer switch and searched for
directional signal switch and kept the error going on to my last post.

Again sorry for my confusion.  I hope you all have a great holiday weekend.

Regards,
