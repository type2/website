Without published data from the tire manufacture, you can get close with 
this:

actual (or max. expected) gross tire weight (or half the axle weight) / 
max. tire weight rating * tire max. inflation

In this case:

front   1399 / 1710 * 65 = 53
rear   1240 / 1710 * 65 = 47


Two questions:

What year is your van, Jamie? A quick glance at my '79 owner's manual 
shows a GVWR between 4960 (station wagon) and 5070 (kombi and delivery 
van). Looks like you may be outside that.

Why do you have so much weight in the front? Or are the numbers reversed?
