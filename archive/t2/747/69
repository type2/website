Smoke from inside is a Very Bad Sign.  You can't hurt a digital meter by
hooking it up backwards, but you can hurt it by setting it up for current
("A" dial setting or lead sockets) and then putting it across an unlimited
current source (like your battery)

Back in the analog meter days, my electronics instructor referred to this
as "turning your meter into a motor".  These days, most meters have a fuse
inside that blows if you screw things up, but that doesn't usually involve
smoke.  I was at a physics teacher workshop with a dozen well-educated and
supposedly savvy teachers.  Within two days we had  blown the fuses in
three of the meters.  Don't feel bad about it!

There are probably a few "how to use a  multimeter" pages out there if you
try a Google search.

Basically, you want to put the leads in the "common" and "voltage" sockets
and then set the dial to "20V".  At this point, there is nothing in a bus
that will hurt the meter with the exception of the high tension side of
the coil.
