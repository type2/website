Subject: Van won't start.

Hi,

 

My van didn't start today.  When turning the key the solenoid 'clicked'
repeatedly at quick intervals but the engine didn't turn.  Does anyone have
some ideas?   Starter?  Battery?  Something else?

 

It worked fine at last startup.  Any help much appreciated.

 

Best regards,

Shawn
