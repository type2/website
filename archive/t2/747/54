And if you let the smoke out of toast?? Yuck!

Here's some more information I found on the web about "Smoke Theory"....


According to this theory, it is smoke that makes components work
because every time you let the smoke out of a component, it stops
working. It seems the claim has been verified through extensive field
testing.

As with many great discoveries, this one had eluded the great minds
of our time by its very simplicity. Of course smoke makes all things
electrical work! Remember the last time the smoke escaped from your
Pertronix igniter? Didn't it quit working? On a system level, a bus's
wiring harness carries smoke from one device to another, and when the
harness springs a leak, it lets the smoke out of everything all at
once and then nothing works. Some of the systems on a VW bus (Like
the starter) require larger quantities of smoke to operate properly;
that's why the wires going to them are so big.

Expanding this hypothesis to the entire automobile industry, why are
Lucas electric systems more likely to leak smoke than, say. Bosch or
Delco? Aha! Lucas is British. Things British always leak! British
convertible tops leak water. British engines leak oil. British shock
absorbers leak fluid. Naturally, British electronics leak smoke.

Of course, there are aspects of the theory that require further
investigation. For example, one would think that persons who smoke
cigarettes would be much more healthy from ingesting all that smoke.
Experimental data seems to contradict that hypothesis. Perhaps
smokers are actually exhaling more smoke than the inhale
