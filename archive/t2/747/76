Don't meters come with manuals anymore?
Anyway here are 3 meters from $5 to $20.
I'd think that any of them would tell you if you have a ground or how many
volts you have at a terminal or the resistance of a spark plug wire and at
ten bucks you can afford an extra for the next time you cross the wires.
