Subject: wanagon camper 83 campers owner wanted

Hi guys,
When I bought my van , I had no manual of any kind.
Is anyone made a pdf file (or other format) of those manuals for a 
vanagon camper 83 ?
I guess there is one for the van , and one for how to use the camper.

Thanking you  in advance.   ;-)

Chris
