Subject: Oddness since carb rebuild

I had complained of low power after my carb rebuild. But I had
attributed it to the unbalanced carbs.

Now I'm not so sure.

Aside from spending most of the day in bed due to my back, I found my
Unisyn. My "ear" adjustment was pretty darn close. Only had to lean my
left carb a nudge to get the ball to sit (I balanced my new left carb
to the existing right one). So I think I'm ok there.

But it still has way less power than before my carb decided to dump
fuel out the throttle shaft.

One thing I did differently was attach the hot start valve doohickey
to the throttle plate. I only have one in the entire box of carbs so
it went on the new carb. I think that thing doesn't work because
symptom #2 is poor running when hot but the chokes haven't opened yet.
Like when you stop for gas. Missing and such out of the left pipe
(yes, true dual exhaust does have benefits!)

I'm going to pull that thing in the morning and see if that part is
resolved. But I'm wondering WTF is wrong with the power issue. I even
replaced all the ignition parts (was going to do that anyway) hoping
something would happen. Everything from the plugs to the coil got
swapped out for my Hyfire. All except for the distributor itself. In
fact, I'm half tempted to swap in my 009 just to see if that makes a
difference.

Anybody have any ideas? Try the distributor swap?
