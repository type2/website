Three answers...

1) Your buddy is not correct. There is plenty of garbage out there for
"ricers" as well (much of it from China).

2) Not all parts for late model cars are so good and cheap.  For every cheap
part, there's another that's "dealer-only" and $2500. (It may only have cost
$50 to make, but since it's dealer-only, the car manufacturer gets to set
the price.)

3) This is an unfair comparison. You are comparing a recent-model
mass-market vehicle to a "niche" vintage vehicle. There are huge differences
regarding economies of scale and supply/demand in terms of parts.

There are many more late-model Subaru's on the road than old busses. The
cost of entry to producing a part is relatively fixed. The fixed costs of
tooling up for 1000 of a given part are almost the same as for 20,000.  When
there are 20,000 being made, those costs are divided among all of them, so
the actual per-unit cost is far lower. What's more, since there is mass
market potential, multiple companies will tool up to make/sell the same
part, resulting in price competition. If twenty companies made the same
late-model Subaru part, and each got just 5% market share, each would still
sell far more units than if they had 100% market share of a comparable Bus
part. Obviously, parts suppliers want to go where the money is.  With such a
limited market potential, we're lucky if even one company bothers to make
the Bus part at all  If they do, they set the price high, not only because
they can (no competition), but because they must (high fixed cost in
relation to sales potential).

This becomes more of an issue as the original German tooling for old bus
parts wears out. The old tooling was paid for long ago, so as long as it
still works, the profit the manufacturer brings in using their ancient
tooling is "gravy" even if sales volume is dwindling. But eventually the
tooling wears out, and typically current sales volume simply does not
justify retooling for the part. So the original supplier simply discontinues
the part. The best case scenario at that point is that another factory
(usually in a developing country) decides that they can make enough money to
justify tooling up for it themselves... but only by selling their more
cheaply produced part for as much as the German one used to cost (or else it
wouldn't be a profitable to begin with). So we get a Chinese, Brazilian, or
Indian knockoff for the same price that the German part once cost. If that
happens we're lucky; the worst case scenario is that nobody deems it
profitable to produce the part again even under those conditions, and it
goes permanently obsolete.

The good news is that there is a large number of parts that are still
available using older tooling (since the Bus was made for so long in so many
different markets). So the very low cost of these parts largely offsets the
higher cost (or lower quality) of certain other parts. As a result, compared
to parts for other vehicles of their vintage (a more fair comparison), Bus
parts are still very cheap as a whole, and overall quality good.
