Subject: Re: [T2] Vehicle Weight and Tires

I had the chance to weigh my camper recently, so here is some info...

My 74 Westfalia Camper ....
Loaded, with the driver , and 1 passenger in the front,  about 400 lbs right
there !
2 passengers  in the rear... only about 200 lbs for both of them!

Scale Weight on Front:  2788 lbs......1399 lbs on each tire
Scale Weight on Back :  2480 lbs......1240 lbs on each tire
Total weight  5268 lbs
Tires:
Yokohama LT195/75R14  Load range "D"   M&S
1710 lbs max (-at-) 65 psi


So,, if I did the math right,, I should put 48 psi in the rear tires.. and 40 in
the front tires when I have this much load in the camper....
