And the replacement coil must have an internal ballast
resister. Without the ballast resister on the coil,
the voltage will EAT points.

One thing that people forget when switching coils is
that the coil and
condenser are a matched set.  The capacitance of the
condenser offsets
the inductance of the coil and prevents arcing at
the points.  If you
change the coil without putting in a matching
condensor, the points will
suffer!
