can you see a part number on the ign. switch housing?

for the early bays, which i believe is part # 211 905 889, there will be a
small hole which you must insert something such as a paper clip or piece of
wire.  doing this will depress a spring on the ignition switch & you should
be able to remove it.

it might help for you to remove the 4 bolts that hold the steering column
upright against the dash. if you pull the entire assembly towards you, it
might give you a better view of whats going on in there.

good luck,
