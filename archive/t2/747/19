Subject: RE: [T2] Tune-up Freq with Bruck 205; Bosch Qual Decl

Huh?
     
No.  Bruck is Bruck, and Bosch is Bosch.  They are
separate companies.  But the Bruck 205 is part-by-part
compatible with Bosch parts. 
    
With the Bruck 205 distributor, you have the choice of
using either Bruck Parts, or Bosch Parts.  Since I
prefer the reliability of the time-honored Bosch
brand, I have shown only the Bosch part numbers used
by the Bruck Distributor.  Besides, if you lookup
VWC-043-905-205 off an Internet search engine, then
look at the compatible cap, rotor, points, and
condensor, most sites will show either both Bruck &
Bosch, or just Bosch.
   
I point-out, the issue of this thread is why are
tune-ups required every 1500 (not 15000) miles.
     
:D
