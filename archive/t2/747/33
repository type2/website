Subject: car stereo power lead

Hi again , I have bought a brand new CD MP3 player for my van I can't 
wait to put in.

I don't have the owner manual so I don't have any info about the fuse 
box and how to connect the car cd player.
I already found all the wires, sp, ground lead ,Battery lead, but I have 
a question about  the power lead (which goes when  the IGN is on)

I have 2 questions:

- Its looks like that the previous owner used the Battery lead as the 
power lead , I though it could be annoying  because  it can  empty you 
battery if you don't pay attention . but after a second thought , you 
may also want to listen some jazz rock music while  having a glass of 
wine at you campground. Is it a common practice to do so ?
- I found two other wires  which where not connected and could be a 
power lead candidate (+12 with IGN). one of them is connected to the 
fuse box. Bentley manual concerning electronic is like Chinese to me. My 
problem  with those wires is that I don't know what they are doing , 
moreover I am confused , one give 14.25V (as the other + wires in 
general) the other give 12.75V, I just want to know if they's any  one 
wire which comes out of the fuse box which is dedicate to car stereo ? 
which fuse number it uses ?

My van is a vanagon   camper 83 Californian model

Thanks again, have a great WE

Chris
