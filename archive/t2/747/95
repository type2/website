I am not sure why everyone picks on Lucas. They do make something
that does not suck........       Vacuum cleaners.

Seriously, though. On newer Mercedes, 96 and up, Lucas makes some
of the brakes boosters and the brake calipers When the early E class [210 body]  had a high percentage of 
squeaky brake pedals when applying the brakes, it was a bad brake booster. It happened with Ate and Girling 
boosters, but never with Lucas boosters. I have not had to replace any Lucas brake part.
[you can have 3 identical E320's next to each other, and not all the brake parts suppliers match!]
