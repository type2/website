Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter fried?

Even if it smoked, there is still some hope: if you had it one the high amp
setting (20 A) or so, the internal fuse is basically a pretty heavy gauge
wire bridge. This thing will generate smoke it it blows. Easy test: does it
do anything when you turn it on (any non-current (A)) setting? If it still
measures resistance or voltage, it's a keeper. If not, it is bound for the
trash unless it it is a high quality unit (Fluke, Heathkit and the like).

There is nothing economical a TV Repair shop could do with a fried no-name
meter. Get one of the cheap Sunpro engine testers and you have a multimeter
that also does dwell and RPM. If you need instructions for a multimeter you
probably have no use for capacity, transistor testing and the like anyway.

Smoke from inside is a Very Bad Sign.  You can't hurt a digital meter by
hooking it up backwards, but you can hurt it by setting it up for current
("A" dial setting or lead sockets) and then putting it across an unlimited
current source (like your battery)
