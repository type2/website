Subject: 19th Annual Twin Cities Volkswagen Club Show

It's that time of the year again!  This years show is to be at the former 
site of Stephen's Buick, now part of the new car area of Westside Volkswagen in 
Saint Louis Park, Minnesota.  It is on the west side of Highway 100 and just a 
little south, about a block, from the old location.  There will be signs 
there.  This is on 5 June 2005 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and there is a class for 
Type IIs.  I won't have my '72 Westy there this year since I need a new 
cylinder head for it.

Hope to see you there!
