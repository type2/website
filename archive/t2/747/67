Just wanted to let you all know that Bear made it to
the MoKan show safe and sound, and the Hubcap rode
along!

I passed it along to Gary Jarrett who will be carrying
it to shows the next three or four weeks.

If someone would pass this to the Type2 list too, I'm
sure they'd be interested too.

David
