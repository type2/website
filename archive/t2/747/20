Reviewed the T2 Archives on the topic of "Ballast." 
An eye opener.
    
Ballast Resistor.  I've owned and maintained cars
where the ballast resistor failure would prevent the
engine from running.  And the Ballast Resistor for a
80 Volare was only $2.50.  But what a difference if
the old one was not operational.
    
Yes Don, I will measure the resistances at several
points in my ignition system and get back to you.  I'm
a little surprised that a Bosch Blue coil is not
necessary a Bosch Blue coil.  
    
So as it stands now, I either need to purchase an
external Ballast resistor for connection in-line with
the coil + connector, or I need to purchase a coil
with an internal ballast resistor already installed. 
Is that correct, should my resistance measurements
indicate so?
