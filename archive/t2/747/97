Subject: RE: [T2] 70 bus ignition

>>>Does anyone know who stocks the ignition lock (key part) for a 70 bus?<<<

from my experience, you are going to have to track one down used. ask around
& see if anyone is parting out an early bay. you might start by identifying
the part number of your ignition switch housing.

also, if you end up needing key/lock work i would highly recommend Steve's
Lock Shoppe! excellent customer service.

good luck,
