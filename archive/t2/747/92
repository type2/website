Nemo,

Lots of "how to" out there

Google for                  multimeter howto use

I personally prefer the analog meters for car work.  When my last one 
died, I bought one from Radio Shack(fairly recently) for about $20.00.

The secret is to get one with the largest "display" for the cheapest 
amount of money.  That way, when you are laying on your back under the 
dash, it is easier to read.

I too have an expensive digital one, but hardly ever get it out of the box 
unless I want to know *exactly* how much resistance in a resistor or 
*exactly*(to four decimal places) how much voltage the battery has in it.


Ususally, when you let the smoke out, it is because you had it set on the 
"resistance" scale and tried to measure voltage with it.  Most have a fuse 
built in that covers that, but old cheap ones did not.



Cheers, dave
