well they work by sensing the ohmage (or is it voltage) in any case there
is a winding on the sender and a wiper that slides over this as a float
goes up and down..   the windings will wear and start sending the wrong
reading... if it hasn't been changed and is original then it is at least
25 years old, a lot of up and down for the slider to wear thru.

I have a 78 with fuel injection, don't need to remove engine and my hands
are fairly small so it is a real contortion but I have changed it out and
will likely do it again soon as my guage shows 3/4 when full but gets more
accurate as it goes down with 0 being empty. probably can live with it for
a while but rarely let the tank get below 1/3 or so.
