Subject: [T2] Multimeter fried?

Forget the TV shop dudes... Before you pay an electronics tech to fix that 
multimeter, check the discount tool places like Horrible Freight 
(harborfreight.com).... you should find digital multimeters for under ten 
bucks.  Some of the simpler ones go for two or three dollars when on promotion!

I hate the thought of sending more stuff to the landfill... I've got a coupla 
busted Simpson 260s waiting for a cold winter day when the mood for an indoor 
project strikes me.  At the prices of functional approximations, above, the 
Simpsons may wait quite a while ;-))

my multi meter broke also while back and after buying a new one it was 
suggested that i take my old one to a tv repair shop that they might be able to 
help me get my old one fixed as well..
maybe check with a tv repair shop first even though there was smoke involved...
 
i bought my multi meter at autozone after a extensive search from a wide 
distance they were the only ones to carry one..
i think i paid like 30 bucks for it..?
