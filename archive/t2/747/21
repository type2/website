You said "if I did the math right"... What math?  How does one calculate the
right tire pressure from the info you have?

 

TIA and have a great weekend.

I had the chance to weigh my camper recently, so here is some info...

 

My 74 Westfalia Camper ....

Loaded, with the driver , and 1 passenger in the front,  about 400 lbs right
there !

2 passengers  in the rear... only about 200 lbs for both of them!

 

Scale Weight on Front:  2788 lbs......1399 lbs on each tire Scale Weight on
Back :  2480 lbs......1240 lbs on each tire Total weight  5268 lbs

Tires:

Yokohama LT195/75R14  Load range "D"   M&S

1710 lbs max (-at-) 65 psi

 

So,, if I did the math right,, I should put 48 psi in the rear tires.. and
40 in the front tires when I have this much load in the camper....
