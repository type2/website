Hydraulic lifters all have a unique personalities. ;-)

Warm up the engine at 11pm the night before you do the adjustment to be sure they are pumped up in the morning. Take it for a drive if you can.

I read in the archives that the lifter travel was measured to be 4mm. Since the threads of the adjusting screws are 1mm pitch, 2 turns would put the lifter in the middle of it's travel, an adjustment that Bentley suggests.

I understand the logic but it would since metal expands when heated (pushrods) and this would push the lifter piston a little more off center. Another reason they used steel for the pushrods in hydraulic engines? Anyway, VW engineers weren't dummies so they must have considered this and I have to question the 4mm measurement.

I can tell you from experience that 1.5 turns is just as quiet as 2 turns, as least to my ear.
