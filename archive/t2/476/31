Are you saying that if you engine is completely warmed up it idles OK and
has no stumbling?  It only happens after the 15-20 shutdown then restart?
Offhand, I can't think how this would occur, thinking only of the AFM.  I
understand injectors can be subject to "heat soak" issues after a shutdown
because the temperatures there tends to climb quite a bit when the engine is
turned off.  Maybe this has something to do with it?

If you're thinking that simple wear on the resistive track is somehow the
cause of your problem then you have nothing to lose by opening up the AFM,
removing the board the strip rides on and slightly elongating the screw
holes in the board with a small file.  That'll allow you to reposition the
board slightly so the portion of the resistive strip being tracked is
"fresh."
