It acts as a voltage regulator. My guess is that without it the needle would bounce around as the gas sloshed around in the tank.

It's an expensive replacement part unless you find a working one at the junkyard. You basically need to hook it up to a gauge and sender to test it out.

I've found the later zener style give inaccurate gauge readings when they go bad (zener broken, bulb ok. Yes there is a small 5W bulb inside that acts as a big cheap resistor). With the metal can variety, when they fail the needle on the gauge will peg full and the can will get hot. At least that's my experience.
