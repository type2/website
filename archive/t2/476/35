Thanks....put it in the freezer for about 20-25 minutes.  Valve opened
a bit more, maybe double what it was, but not entirely open....I could 
still push it back further, probably 2-3 times as far, with screwdriver 
through the hose port.  

After sitting and warming up to
room temp it was back to where it was originally.....probably about
1/8 - 1/10th the circumference of the hose outlets.  Using a simple
piece of hose to connect the ports directly giving full flow, as I
said, it starts and idles okay.

I don't have a portable 12v source yet to test to see if the valve
would close but I think the freezer test indicates it isn't opening
far enough if

Thanks for mentioning this...reinforces that my method was sound.  I
thought I mentioned that this is what I did and the engine started and
idled okay this way.  I didn't leave it run long, minute or so, but it didn't quit on
its on.

On my first inspection seeing the valve WAS open I assumed that was
enough but I think it just isn't letting enough air through on cold
start.
