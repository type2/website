Subject: Coil Wiring

Hello everyone.

My quest for a fuel pump/coil relay for my 76 Bus has screeched to a halt.  
I guess there is no longer any such animal.  To reiterate, the relay is of 
the five pin variety, one wire goes from the battery to the relay, one wire 
goes from the relay to the fuel pump, one wire goes from the relay to the 
coil, and the other two disappear into a harness.  I assume one of the wires 
goes to the ignition switch.

Here's what I thought I'd do, run the wire from the battery through a 
switch(to be put on the dash) and then to the coil, no relay, same for the 
fuel pump.  It will look bad, not function optimally, but it will at least 
get the engine to run so I can drive the van until the correct part can be 
found.

Questions for the group.  Is a heavy duty switch(toggle or rocker) needed 
for either the coil or the fuel pump, and will it burn anything up running 
the wires direct like this?

Thanks much.

Mike
