Subject: Cooling air, gas heaters, and J tubes

Hey Y'all,
Very soon I will be installing a gas heater on my 71
Westy (stock 1600 DP).Here's my question: With gas
heat, I won't use the stock heating system so, If I
switch the heater boxes out with "J" tubes, and plug
the outlet holes in the fan shroud where the fresh air
heater hoses usually go, will this INCREASE cooling
air to the cylinders?? Will the additional air that
usually goes out these ports through the heat
exchangers be re-directed to cooling the cylinders,
thus lowering my running engine temps??

Peace, John Baker
