It does sound like a temperature related issue.  If you can keep it running
long enough for a complete warm-up and the problem goes away then you'll
know for sure.  Since it's starting up OK I wouldn't think it's a
thermo-time switch/cold start valve problem since these should only be
energized on startup and shouldn't have any effect once the key is in the
"run" position.  First things to check are the temp sensors.  Check 'em both
with the engine cold; do your check at the ECU plug since that'll check both
the sensors and the wiring up to the ECU.  The only other thing in the FI
system that's obviously temperature-affected is the aux air valve, though it
doesn't seem like the problem would lie there given the problem as you've
described it.
