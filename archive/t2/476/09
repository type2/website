Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky windshield seal

Let me set the record straight on the silicone and paint deterioration
around glass mounting rubber--.

It is a well known fact that Mack R model, U model, and DM model trucks
have a severe water retention problem around the windshield and rear
window area--- the very same problem VW Buses have--- and if not
attacked with some sort of permanent sealer they will rust up bad and
quick in these area's-- I've painted thousands of them, and seen this
happen.

A good Silicone is the only answer--

It does not have the capacity to eat into or deteriorate the paint--
it'll just lay on top and adhere to it and the rubber--

Now---there is a problem with silicone and new paint application--this
is a fact--
The Paint will "fisheye" any where the silicone is--

This is why upon the sealing of any glass area , you would want to take
mineral spirits and wipe the access silicone back to the edge of the
rubber moulding--and do a good job using copious amount of the mineral
spirits and a bunch of clean rags--

If there is big gaps in the rubber--either mask off to the edge of the
area you want to replace with the silicone--or get a new moulding and
silicone it into the window frame--

I've got trucks on the road that I painted 20 years ago--and the
windshield and back window area's have not had a          reoccurring
corrosion or rust problem in those area's, because I use a good 30 year
black silicone--

EVERY truck I paint gets the same treatment---I don't want it comng
back--

The silicone seal is not even noticeable--it blends in with the black
rubber well.  

The BEST time to do this job is either right after a vehicle is
painted--OR--right after a leak is noticed on a good existing paint
job--

Roofing tar is NOT the answer

 This is from a professional standpoint, not hearsay--

Later,

Terry

I am not a body man, but I have been told that SILICONE wreaks havoc on
new paint applications... it causes small area's that resist paint,,
called fisheye, something like finger painting over crayon on paper 
I have been told that silicone is an acid, and will speed up metal
deteriation... I dunno for sure 
I have used roof tar 
it applies and removes easy,, and if you end up leaving it ,, whenever
the
sun shines on it, it gets soft and reseals itself 
hope that helps
