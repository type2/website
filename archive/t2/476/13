I must say no, not possible. There is a cross tube that is attached to 
chassis above with a clip. Pull the front wheels. Hose off the dust from 
the top of tank from both sides before going further. Reach in from each 
side and find the fitting at the ends of the cross tube and pop it out of 
the grommets in the tank. Disconnect the vent hoses.  For the fill tube, 
just remove the screws then twist the collar and it comes right out. Then 
you can drop the tank a ways and reach in and remove the sender 
connections. Now you can drop the tank and service everything. Compared to 
a Bus, the Vanagon tank is not at all difficult to pull. A thin film of 
silicon paste on the grommets will ease popping the fittings back it. I 
then remove the clip holding the cross tube and leave it off for 
replacement. I just can't see why it is necessary. I then replace all the 
vent hoses one at a time clipping new hoses same length as each old piece. 
It is also a good procedure to remove the vent tanks behind the front 
wheels for a proper cleaning. Amazing how much rust promoting junk gets 
trapped behind them. Getting them snapped back into place is the most 
difficult part of the whole procedure. They pop out a whole lot easier then 
they pop back in.
