You can block the holes in your fan shroud with no damage to the heat
exchanger. There are mushrooms on the top of the heat exchangers that
vent the heat. As far as the thermostat goes you need to make sure all
of the pieces are there for the flaps and that when you disconnect the
thermostat and push up on the rod everything moves freely. I have seen a
lot of thermostat levers that had been bent and were binding through the
hole on the head. If it doesn't move freely, your thermostat can't
operate the cooling air flaps correctly. The thermostat can be tested by
placing it in a pan of hot water and then putting it on to boil. if it
expands a lot it still works, if a little, you need to replace it. I am
a thermostatic flap believer and when others are throwing away that
stuff I am collecting it and using it!

Eric,

So, you're saying its OK to block the holes. But does that mean that if
you block the shroud holes that you must remove the heat exchangers to
prevent overheating?  What about the thermostat?  The previous owner of
my splittie removed it. I'm a bit shaky on how the thermostat is used
with the fan.
