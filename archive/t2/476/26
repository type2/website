Subject: Re: [T2] still have ? on testing aux. air valve on '80

Put it in the freezer for 20 minutes. Is it fully open or near so?? Yes?? 
Feed it 12v. Does it close slowly in several minutes?? Yes?? It is working. 
The value can stick. If it looks like it has varnish deposits, hand clean 
and flush with solvent without soaking the electrical connector. Throttle 
body/carb cleaner works good. Eye protection please, this stuff is bad news 
in the eyes from splash.
