Subject: Exhaust sensor - do I need it for my CA fuel injection system

I have a 83 aircooled Vanagon california emissions. 
there is a sensor that connects to my wiring harness
that is literally screwed into the exhaust system just
before the catalytic converter.  I am transfering my
emissions over to an earlier no CA model exhaust - do
I need the exhaust sensor to be connected to run
right? if so, i will have to drill in a hole in my
exhaust pipe.
