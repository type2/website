Den,

This is probably an after market stub axle designed for this application 
(Bus CV into a Bug IRS).  I'm about to do the same thing except with 930 
CVs (a little more angle available) for my Baja.

Take a look at the ads in Hot VWs and you will find several vendors that 
sell these.   Especially the ones that deal with off road.  You might 
try a web search using the words stub axle or maybe CV and VW.  It seems 
to me I found a lot when I used 930 CV VW.

Give that a try and if it doesn't work out, email me.
