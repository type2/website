Subject: Mr Scissor hand goes wild... Dreaded cut engine wires

Hello,

I am about to tackle a serious cases of "Mr..Scissor Hand" going wild in the 
engine compartment. The previous owner obviously was not to impressed with 
VW's way of wiring. Some wires are cut at the firewall, others are a little 
more accessible.

So before I started is there any advice on "does and don'ts"? I have a donor 
wiring harness that I will be using so at least the wire color and size will 
be the same. Should I pick up new connectors for splicing wires and a 
crimper? Any good connectors and crimpers recommended? or Are they fairly 
standard?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
