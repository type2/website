If the lifters have been sitting without any load on them, i.e., the
pushrods and rockers have been out all this time, then they probably haven't
bled down to any significant extent.  If they've been sitting around with
everything installed then, yes, there's a chance that some of them will have
bled down.  But, that's no big deal.  You adjust them in the normal fashion,
putting as many "turns" on them after contact - or even leaving a .006 gap -
depending on your particular religion.
