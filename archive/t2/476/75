Eric,

So, you're saying its OK to block the holes. But does that mean that if you
block the shroud holes that you must remove the heat exchangers to prevent
overheating?  What about the thermostat?  The previous owner of my splittie
removed it. I'm a bit shaky on how the thermostat is used with the fan.
