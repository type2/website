Subject: Fitting Heat Exchangers to new heads?

Hi All:

I am getting ready to fit the heat exchangers to the AMC heads on my new
engine 2.0L type IV. Of course the holes on the old heat exchangers do
not line up with the studs on the new heads. Other than reaming out the
mounting holes in the heat exchangers, any other suggestions for dealing
with this problem?

What is the best method to ensure a leak proof seal between heat
exchanger and head?

Regards,
