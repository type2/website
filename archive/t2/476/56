Subject: Back registration?  CA CMV

Anyone here have any wisdom on how to straighten out back reg fees on a
nonop vehicle that never had a nonop filed?  A friend of mine acquired a
vehicle that hasn't been regged since 2000, but since a nonop was never
filed, dmv wants something like $1200 to make it current.  The title
never changed hands thru 3 physical owners, and it's just been sitting.

Maybe an afadavit from the storage place, it's been paid for monthly, so
there should be a paper trail there...
