Hi Folks,

What about the turn signal canceling mechanism?  I know my '79 makes a 
clicking noise when it's really quiet (like trying to push-start it or 
parallel park it), but it's barely nocticeable and would easily be drowned 
out by any road noise.

Either that or it could be a foreign object jammed into some part of the 
steering linkage...

Good luck!
