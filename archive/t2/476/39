Yes, mount the exchangers to the heads *without* reaming on the holes.  I'd
guess it's almost always possible to fit the exchangers to the head without
resorting to such drastic measures.  I know I've never yet had an exchanger
just "slide" on to a head.  You have to jiggle and tease; just *barely* get
one set of studs/holes started and then push/shove the other side on.  This
is a case where having someone to help would probably be beneficial, yet
I've managed to get probably a dozen or so heads on various engines
single-handed.
