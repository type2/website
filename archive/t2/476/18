Does anyone have a picture of the wiring of a bn4 heater, the wiring diagram 
I found online does not match. Need help please, also how can you tell what 
year BN4 heater you have. I am looking at a bn4 with tag numbers that read:  
181261105, this is listed on the bottom of the tag, on the tag it says in German: 
ausfuhrung# 201419. Does anyone have any idea thanks Dylan
