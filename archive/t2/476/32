Yah, I was pretty amazed at the size of the gap, myself.

Yah, I thought the seal was uniform all the way around...

Eek!  How did you repair that?  Fiberglass?

Sigh, perhaps the rust is worse than I thought ... today I was running 
an errand over in Berkeley, and I noticed something "funny" with the 
electricals ... the brake warning light would pulse brightly once if I 
stepped on the gas, and the flasher would "BZZZT" if the signal was on 
when I did that (I noticed this when pulling out of a parking spot onto 
San Pablo), and doing this would also cause the radio to power-cycle.

I guess I must have gotten some water into the instrument cluster/fuse 
panel?  All of the symptoms were gone about 1/2 across the Bay Bridge.  
I only noticed this happening after that hard raid we had yesterday.
