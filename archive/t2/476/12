Subject: Re: [T2] Dropping a Vanagon gas tank

I don't think it's possible to only drop one side of the tank.  Besides, if
that's an original fuel sender (metal flange instead of the plastic flanges
of the newer senders) then getting that thing off the tank can be a PITA in
and of itself and you'll want the tank on the ground so you're not dealing
with the removal "blind."

Here's the link

for my write up of the procedure.
