Subject: Deluxe Bus trim clips?

Hello, it is good to be back! (I have been off the list for almost the last 
two years, but I am coming back to the bus...)

I have a 71 7 passenger deluxe. I am working on the window sills and other 
"white" parts in prep for painting in the spring. But, one part that I have 
been unable to find is the clips that hold on the aluminum trim around the 
beltline. They are springy metal that looks like an "M", about 3/4 of an 
inch wide. No shop seems to carry them. Almost all of mine are so rusted 
out they just break when I try to get the trim off of them.

Are they still available? Or, is there another cars clips that can be 
modified to fit?
