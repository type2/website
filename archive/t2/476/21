Here are a couple of photos:

I think it's clear from the photos that the metal underneath is 
basically OK (there is a little rust in there, but it appears to be 
minor).  I think you're right, that the glass is short.  There's quite 
a gap to load up with silicone :-)

Here is a photo of the brand markings on the glass:
