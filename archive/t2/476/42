Subject: Torsion arm bearings?

Anybody got a supplier for the torsion arm bearings (76 Westy)? I ordered 
some from BD and they called and said they could no longer get them. The only 
place I've found them was the dealer and they wanted $60 ea (OUCH). I'm gonna 
send them to a place called Bearing Distributors to see if they can match 
them up because I already talked to them on the phone and they said that the 
numbers on the bearings meant nothing to them after trying to crossreference 
them. Something out there's got to use the same bearing, hopefully.

Also has anybody removed the plastic insert inside the front axle with any 
success in replacing it? I want to powder coat my axle and I'm afraid that 
the insert will melt in the process.
