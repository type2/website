Good grief. If you had not have posted the shot of the bottom I might have
wondered if the seal was inside out.

Volks, does it matter if the seam of the seal goes at the bottom? You
wouldn't think so.

The bottom of the windshield rusts from the inside out, not the other way
around. By the time a tiny bits of rust appears there's a lot of cancer
under there. Even with no visible sign it's usually pretty bad as you find
out when you replace the windshield. For example...
