I am not a body man, but I have been told that SILICONE wreaks havoc on
new paint applications... it causes small area's that resist paint,,
called fisheye, something like finger painting over crayon on paper

I have been told that silicone is an acid, and will speed up metal
deteriation... I dunno for sure

I have used roof tar
it applies and removes easy,, and if you end up leaving it ,, whenever the
sun shines on it, it gets soft and reseals itself

hope that helps
