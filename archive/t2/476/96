Subject: Coil Wiring

"Here's what I thought I'd do, run the wire from the battery through a
switch(to be put on the dash) and then to the coil, no relay, same for the
fuel pump.  It will look bad, not function optimally, but it will at least
get the engine to run so I can drive the van until the correct part can be
found.

Questions for the group.  Is a heavy duty switch(toggle or rocker) needed
for either the coil or the fuel pump, and will it burn anything up running
the wires direct like this?"

Why not just run a wire from the + terminal on the coil to the pump?
Assuming your bus runs well enough and that the fuel pressure is regulated
you should be fine, until the right part can be obtained. I used to have my
72 set up this way when I ran an electric pump to the 2bbl progessive
nightmare I called a carb. You will only supply juice to the pump when the
ignition is on this way. You could get fancy and somehow incorporate the
oil pressure switch into the system so if your oil pressure ever dropped it
would kill the pump but thats another story.
