Hey Gang,

  I tried the welding method, but it was more than a simple crack.  The
crack welded nicely, but the top threads where the cap seals the deal
were 1/3 missing in action.  When I was screwing the cap back on the
remainder decided to jump ship too.

  I am toying with the idea of putting threads on the little shaft and
fabricating some other type of reseviour to go atop it.

  I have a weird year bus.

Thanks for your help and ideas,
Jennifer
