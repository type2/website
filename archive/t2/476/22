Subject: re: BN4

sounds like you have a late model BN4.
I recently ordered and rec'd a manual for that heater from espar, they'll send 
you a quality photo copy free, just hit their web site.
The fan speed does not change with these heaters.  You turn it on, the fan 
starts, the glow plug(yours is integrated) warms up, it fires up and sounds 
like a furnace.  When one of the three detectors thinks it's too hot or you 
turn it off, the spark/glow plug and fuel pump stops, the fan keeps blowing for 
approx three minutes to dispel the remaining heat and gases then it all stops.
if you have more questions let me know.
