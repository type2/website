Sounds like the Fuel Pump Relay is bad. ??? Assuming
the Fuel Pump Relay AKA Dual Relay is getting the
source power required, doesn't Bentley`s say of the
Dual Relay, crank engine and test for voltage on [86a]
 If none during cranking, replace relay?  Back up a
step or two in Bentley to confirm the source power is
present.  If not, then the problem is electrically
higher in the wiring path.
    
Having a WR1 does insert another diagnostic step or
two into your diagnosis.  Confirm your dual relay is
getting it's source power.
    
On the other hand, installing a replacement dual
relay.... see if it will start cold.  If it does, then
you have found the problem.
