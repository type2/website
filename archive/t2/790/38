Subject: Moustache bar..Where do the 3 bolts mount?

I have been looking at the bar and the engine I have and can not seem to 
find where it actually bolts to it.  I have checked a couple of the 
books I have and can not find a good picture to show me where it bolts.

I finally was able to remove the right side mount that the bar/motor 
mount bolts too with only a little destruction of the frame side. 
Hoping I can get the new ones tacked in this week.

Thanks,
Stephen
