Heat risers have been know to burn thru <rust thru>  into the intake manifold
and that is allowing exhaust gas to blow into the intake .....

The heat riser is <supposed to be> a hollow tube that allows exhaust gas to
travel from one side of the engine exhaust, past the intake,, warming the
intake.. then exiting back into the exhaust on the other side of the engine..
The heat riser can be plugged with carbon.. or can have a hole in it into the
intake, or out to the atmosphere..
