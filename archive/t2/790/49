That's what I did.  I took the belts out of a late beetle and cobbled a
bracket for the inertia reel.  Many VWs and Audis used the same inertia
reels and they are commonly available at the wrecker.

I suggest getting the passenger seat belts out of two cars, as they have
much less wear and tear than left seat belts.  Left and right inertia
reels are the same, but the brackets are different.

Before the warning about using old belts, please keep in mind that the
orignal belts weren't exactly pristine.  I also made sure that the donor
cars weren't hit hard.
