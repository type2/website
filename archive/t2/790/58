Subject: Installing a 1978 2.0 into a 74 westy

Ok, I've checked the achrives and there is a lot of good article and replies 
but I still have some questions.  I also recieved some conflicting information 
that I would like some clearification.  Some back ground, I just recently 
purchased a 1974 Westy.  It has no engine but the tranny is there.  It is a 5 rib 
tranny, don't know if it is original or not.  My vin is 2342054606, 11/73 is 
the manufacture date.  also it is typ 23-517.  So, I would like to put the 
eninge from my current sunroof bus into this bus.  I understand that there is two 
tranny types (or three depending on source) the 002 and 091.  I was hoping 
that someone could give a more detailed explaination of which is easiest.  My 
option appear to be, change the bell housing from the 091 and install it on the 
002 with starter.....sounds easy but is it? or should i change the tranny 
completely?? from what i read i would then need to change the shift rod and tranny 
hanger.  The shift rod is the part I don't understand at all???  what hole 
needs to be drilled, how to align it and so on....please help...I could use a 
good source or a great description explaining my options.....unless someone has 
a 1800cc to trade for 1600cc in Rhode Island....by the way the PO had a 1600cc 
in the bus prior....sorry its so long...

ps no time to proof read so sorry for mistakes.
