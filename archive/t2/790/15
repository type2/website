Hi John,

This summer I developed a voice-activated system for opening and  
closing the pop-top on the westfakia.

The "Matthew, open the westy roof please" system works quite well, I  
use it whenever I'm camping with the family. The  system was a lot of  
fun to create and develope, but the maintenance costs are pretty  
steep. ;-P
