Sounds like a wiring problem.  You had to wiggle the
steering wheel to get it to start(might have to
replace the electric portion of the ignition switch).
also you had to wiggle the battery terminal, this
shows bad connections.  Sounds like a great time to
clean all electrical connections(hot wires &
grounds)and terminals. Clean all the connectors on the
starter. Phil
