Subject: exhaust fumes

I have been having problems with my bus getting exhaust fumes back into the
cab area. I am thinking that it is because if the fumes behind the bus being
pushed back through the back door. I have a new stock exhaust going on today,
so I am hoping that it will help.

I am going to order a new seal for the rear cargo door since mine is not in
real good shape. Where else could I be getting fumes from? I do have a hole in
the tin above the left heater box and fumes could be coming in there, but I
doubt it when the bus is moving and the heat is off.

Any ideas on other places to look or is the rear seal most likely the problem?
I have a 73.

Thanks,
Corbett
