THIS IS AN UNDERSTATMENT IF THERE EVER WAS ONE!!! ONE DROP CAN CAUSE
PERMANENT BLINDNESS!!!   THIS IS NASTY STUFF TAKE HEED ANY CAUTION SHOULD
BE FOLLOWED>>>>>> sorry to yell but I have seen some pretty casual usage
and having seen first hand some results of misuse the stuff scares the
heck out of my... I have face mask, goggles, NITRILE gloves with high
cuffs, and a tyvek body suit that covers my head too.

it works but it is nasty stuff, bakeing soda is not a true neutralizer,
only lot and lots and lots of water will truely make it safe. make sure a
working garden hose is at hand.
