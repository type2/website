Subject: RE: '71 seats

Based on what I found in a couple of '71s I've owned, I think the very
earliest US '71s came without head rests and only had manual seat belts.  The
later versions in that same year had the seat backs that could take the rests
and also had automatic belts. My 71 with a VIN of 2212226198 had them while
another with a VIN of 2212119775 didn't (while both have 1600 DP and front
disk brakes with the reservoir behind the driver's seat, the earlier one has
stock moon type hubcaps like you see on 68-70s.  very odd...).  I suppose it
is possible that the safety upgrades were options rather than across-the-board
standard equipment but that doesn't seem likely (I don't think there is a
mount for the part of the automatic seat belt mechanism in the earlier one
that I have).  In any event, the seat rails for both versions are exactly the
same, at least for this same model year.  You should be able to swap in a new
seat without a hitch.

My wife has been after me to replace the seats in our 71 camper with
seats that have head rests, for safety reasons.  Does anyone know of any
seats, with head rests, that will fit the '71 seat rails?  Another thought
was that maybe there is a seat back from another year bus, with head rests,
that would be a direct replacement for the 71 seat backs....
