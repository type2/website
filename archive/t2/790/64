I gather from your comments that you have the gearbox that came with the 78 
2l? (an 091 gearbox) If I were you I would swap both the engine and gearbox 
b/c the ratios in the 091 are better suited to the 2l engine than those in 
the 002 gearbox. These gearboxes are interchangeable with the caveat that 
you need to use the 091 bellhousing if you want to use the 002 gearbox with 
the 2l engine b/c this engine has a wider flywheel. Other than that they 
bolt right up. The only issue is that the 091 is slightly longer (IIRC) 
than the 002 gearbox which will move your gear lever towards you, all else 
being equal. I had the opposite occur with a temporary 002 'box and didn't 
have too much hassle with the gear lever being further away. (This was in a 
'76 so the linkages were correct for the longer 091).

HTH,

Martin
