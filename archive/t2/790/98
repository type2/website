Honestly,

I think a lot of us are....not too worried about the gas prices, but I am 
indeed worried about a 50% increase in natural gas prices for heating.

Seriously looking at fireplace inserts so as to improve my fireplace 
efficiency...I have all the wood I am willing to cut and haul.


Bus content:  I'll bring home the insert in my 78 and am hoping to get
my DC running so as to be able to haul a little wood up from the "woods" 
in it before making it all "nice".

It might be a long expensive winter for all of us...<sigh>....and that 
would irritate me cause it cuts into the money for parts for my VW's!

Cheers, dave

and enough/gas to get through the winter... <grin!> 
 
 Scared of the coming prices honestly...
