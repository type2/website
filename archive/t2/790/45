Subject: Firewall 'nudging' engine in situ? 1970

Is it at all possible to consider unscrewing the firewall screws (perhaps
access is already not possible), and moving the firewall to the driver side
on a 1970 bus enough to access the fuel filler hose connection?I do not seek
to remove the entire firewall, just move it enough.. Or is this notion an
impossibility and engine removal is required first? I guess I am
marginalizing trying to save a couple hours only to find them in some
frustration instead....... :)
Thanks,
Al
