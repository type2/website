Are you sure he isn't talking about the half moon
packings around the heat risor pipe where it rests
against the cylinder tin and has a small piece of tin
bolted on? If yes, then it will cause no intake or
exhaust leaks. That packing is just insulation for
heat.

 it should not. although it will cause an exhaust
 leak.
