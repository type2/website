Have you tried to verify the fuel pressure?

Terminal 30.

That is how the starter gets power. The case is the ground.

The solenoid needs at least 7V to kick over. There should be a voltage drop at the battery while the starter is operating and since everything is tied to terminal 30 I would expect to see the cranking voltages you saw if there was high resistance in the wiring. It's a big wire so I would check your battery and starter terminals for cleanliness.

During cranking, the flap in the AFM oscillates as the pistons pump and this deflects the needle. I'm not sure if it's enough to provide constant voltage to the fuel pump for startup all vacuum levels (engine condition) but I suspect it might for most.

That sounds like a short to me.

There are two spaded terminals at 50 but they are connected to each other.
