Bus content: My bus has gotten really hard to shift into 1/2 and sometimes 3/4

I have replaced the front bushing, the coupler at the tranny nose and some
bearing (by my mechanic) inside the nosecone recently, so I'm not fearing the
worst.  Will begin with standard shift lever adjustment procedure, maybe
tonight.  Wait, wife's birthday, maybe not.
