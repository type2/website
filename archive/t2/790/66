Subject: Yay! Working Alt!

Troy showed up at my work with an alt today. He gave me a ride to where the
bus broke down this morning (about 3-4 miles away.. I walked to work from
there this morn), and we installed it. Took about an hour total, and it
fired up and charged at 13.5 or so.

Yay! And yay for cool bus people who are willing to help lots!
