Fellow BayWindow Volks,
We have known BustedBus.com to be a #1 supplier of used parts for your bus for the last 5 years.  Joe Mitchell has established a business that we, in the bus community, have depended on.  As Joe has decided to further his engineering career, he asked that someone step up to keep the business alive.
 
I'd like to introduce myself as that man!  I'm Chris Flesher and I've been in the BayWindow community for a few years now.  In that time, I've done a couple full restorations, established some awesome friends, and been bitten by the bug, er...bus!
I'm ecstatic to be relocating my family to beautiful Boulder, Colorado to take things over for Joe.  Our focus will continue to be on used and rebuilt parts for you, the BayWindow community.  We have an enormous amount of parts and many parts busses, including some for restoration.  We ship worldwide and offer a great website with a comprehensive database of our parts.
There will still be many improvements, including a revamped website with one-stop-shopping.  In the meantime and during the transition and my move, Joe and I ask for your patience.  We may be a little delayed on returning your messages and emails.  Trust that we do have your part and will be able to get it to you.
 
More updates to follow!  Thanks to all for your support! I look forward to helping each and every one of us.


Chris- BustedBus!
