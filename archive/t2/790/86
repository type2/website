and they can be a pain to line up with exhaust pipes.

on the most recent VW that I put back together,
the heat riser tube ends wouldn't get close enough
to the exhaust to bolt up.

I looked through my box of parts and found
blockoffs for the exhaust.  I cut the heat
riser tube ends off the intake manifold with a
sawzall and blocked the exhaust.
