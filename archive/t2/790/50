I was using it to remove the rust from the battery trays. I bought some muratic acid from Home Depot in the pool cleaning section. If you can find a smaller container than 1 gallon I would go for that instead. They tend to sell you 2 gallons for about $7 which is a lot of acid.

I mixed the acid to water (not the other way around!) 1:1 and poured it onto the battery tray and let it steam for about 10 seconds. I then shook some baking soda over it until I saw the acid reaction abate and then used a steel wire brush to break up and remove the rust:

The acid is extremely dangerous so I can't stress enough the need for clothing and breathing and eyesight protection while working with it.

I had to paint the battery trays afterward.
