Subject: acid rust removal

I was reading with interest on Richards site about using acid as a rust
treatment on the body sheetmetal. I am considering doing the same thing with
my '78, only I would like a little more detail on acid used, strength, time
applied before neutralizing, etc. I would also appreciate any comments from
those that have done this type of rust treatement as to how it has held up
over time.

Many thanks,
Ron
