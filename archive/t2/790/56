I wonder if this is a state regulation of legal or if they are slowly phasing it out? I saw it just last weekend.

Even so, 2 gallon of this stuff is way too much so I've been buying quart sized bottles from OSH. The fumes from this acid will rust your chinese tools overnight so keep that in mind when you are working with it in the garage.

I forgot to mention I added water and baking soda before I started scrubbing.

Nothing cleans rusted metal at this price like muratic acid. I've used it on battery trays, gas tanks, seat frames. I've even used it to clean electrical contacts. Once the surface is truly clean, you can use a phosphoric acid solution to etch the metal before priming/painting.

It's no fun to use and dispose but I works so well I'll continue to rely on it until something better comes along.
