<wonder if the T-5 will ever reach this side of the pond....saw a VW Rialto
camper on I-95 Friday,,,,,.....$$$$$$$ I'm sure but it looked nice at
55mph going the other way anyway

Thanh and I looked into of those Rialtos at an RV place while we were in 
Rochester a couple summers ago...very, very nice. If I recall the shower 
slides out of the wall.  Too much luxury for me...

Who'd service it? The VW dealer would probably have a heart attack if you 
pulled in in one of those...
