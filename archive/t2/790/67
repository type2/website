Subject: Re: [T2] acid rust removal

I've used it to soak rusty engine tin in. Works great but don't soak 
stainless steel. The acid will at least pit it or disintegrate it very 
quickly. I don't know what kind of metal the bails that hold valve covers on 
is made of but they are highly susceptible to acid erosion. If you are going 
to soak something in diluted muratic acid make sure it's not made of 
unobtainium.
