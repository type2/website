Subject: Re: [T2] stripped exhaust header bolt/case threads

Hi
I have a 1700 fi 914 heads automatic 74 westie.
Your right, the stripped threads are in the head.
I wasn't thinking straight on that.
I think I will take the bus into the shop and let Todd do it.
I don't have the necessary tools to tap it and he would
have it done quick.

I rebuilt the motor last summer.
I run the auto tranny off of vacumm from the setup (fuel inj)
Runs good.
I removed the heater boxes a couple weeks ago since one was
rusted and replaced it with a custom exhaust with small bottles.
No more rusted VW exhaust to worry about in the future.

Offhand not sure what else I could add :)

Hi, James...  I cannot see your email address, so I have to ask you up 
front, where are you hailing from???
I ask this because you talk about a type IV 1700 Fuel Injected engine, and I 
am sure you have a story on that setup you couuld share.
