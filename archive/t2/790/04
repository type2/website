I only have one real suggestion, and that's to not floor the throttle going
up hills. If you have to floor it for more than 20 seconds drop a gear and
let up on the throttle.

If everything's in perfect shape, flooring it won't do immediate damage, but
there's always the risk.

I drove from Cali to Denver back in Feb and loved the trip. Took my time and
enjoyed every minute of it (except when I got the flu in Williams).
