ingredient
in most (if not all) of the rust converters/killers/bullets/etc...A lightly 
rusted steel
can be "treated" with phosphoric acid to convert the iron oxide to iron 
phosphate,
a compound that "shouldn't" continue to rust, especially if cleaned after 
treat-
ment and primed and top coated with decent paint...:-)
 An alternative is a commercial paint store that carries Benjamin Moore 
paints.
Moore has two industrial products that can be used for this...One is (I'm 
told
by the local dealer) a straight phosphoric acid solution and the other is a 
mix-
ture of phosphoric acid and a latex "sealer" to prevent further 
rusting...Follow
the directions...Allow the sealer time to cure, not just dry, before priming 
and
top coating...I'm sure other manufacturers have similar products, you just 
have
to go to a store that specializes in paints and coatings, not just Home 
Depot,
whose product lines are miles wide but only inches deep... :-(
