Subject: Re: [T2] acid rust removal

There are OTC products such as RUST FREE which contain hydrofluoric 
acid- does a great job of removing rust rings from our counter 
tops-where does this acid fit in between HCL and Sulphric acid for rust 
removal?  I did notice that it etched our glazed tile countertop?
