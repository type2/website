That is strange John

The automatic starter,,, SR17 ,, will NOT mate with the "bigger" flywheel
<228mm>
The input shaft needs to be shorter for a 1600cc,, than a 2.0 liter,, so I would
have thought that would need to be changed back as well....

Can you clarify what parts were actually used in this conversion?


The 1972 Trans is supposed to be a 002.  this bellhousing accepts 215mm and
smaller flywheels.. 200mm , 210mm and 215mm flywheels will work with the SR17
starter <A/T> .. or the SR15 <M/T>

The later model 091 trans uses a deeper starter ,, the SR87.. which only mates
with the 228mm flywheel.. and 091 bellhousing

you can not put a SR87 starter in a 002 bellhousing
I have never tried to clearance for a 228mm flywheel in a 002 bellhousing, but
the starter is tooo long and won't fit the 002 bellhousing even if you did get
the 228mm flywheel in .... afaik
