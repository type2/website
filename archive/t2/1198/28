What year is yours?  My '72 Westy has one that is like the two on the rear
seat.

Greetings-

Is there such a thing as a seat belt for the rear-facing seat?  O.K.,
anything can be developed, but looking for the most elegant solution.

P.S.  I'm waiting for someone to describe how a completely new seat frame
will be required.
