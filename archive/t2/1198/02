usually nothing.
but that is easy to check, no spark
I had a pertronix fail like that
but I have crane now, but it is optical so I guess the light could fail or 
something, I keep an old 009 ready to go in the parts box in my bus when I 
travel so I can plug it in and limp home if need be.

as always
YMMV
