Subject: Re: [VB] Gauge mounting on my 64

Thanks Eric and Barb,
Another good idea. I will look at that. I already fabbed a bracket to 
mount under the dash. The acrylic parts just happen to fit the space 
between the dash and parcel tray under the radio. So far 2 options. 
Your idea is the 3rd.

Thanks for all the great ideas everyone. Keep'em coming. The gauges 
are not mounted yet.

Hi Chris,
Just build one for the ash tray spot on the dash.  Made one for three 
gauges
(volt, oil pressure and temp) in triangle shape and love it.  Both 
driver and
passenger can easily see the gauges which means more likely to catch 
engine
problem before a rebuild is required.
  Have had fellow VW owners in the passenger seat and they find it 
very
interesting to see oil pressure changes as the relief valves open and 
close!
