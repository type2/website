Yep - you're missing something.   You don't need to remove the backing 
plate for brake work.  Only if the backing plate itself is beyond tweaking 
back into shape, or if you need to replace the bearings in the carrier.

To remove the shoes, just twist the cap on the springs that hold the pins 
in on each side to pop them loose.   Pull the other springs, and wiggle 
the shoes out.

To replace the wheel cyl, it just unbolts from the line and from the 
bearing carrier.

Assembly is the reverse of disassembly pretty much.
