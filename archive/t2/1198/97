I'm always worrying about that hammer tool - I used the one I own once 
and I was chipping paint on the wheel, and narrowly missing the bodywork.

I have an electric and air impact wrench and they both only put out 
~150-175 ft-lbs of torque and it isn't enough to loosen up the rear axle 
nuts.

I went to Northern Tool (was it Harbor Freight?) and bought a 
socket/short extension with a sliding T-handle. It took a four ft pipe 
plus myself and my son gently bouncing on it to loosen up the axle nut 
after over a decade of being in place. It was tighter I think than the 
~350 ft-lbs that the manual specifies (going from dusty memories on that 
spec).

The socket was a 3/4" or 1" drive.
