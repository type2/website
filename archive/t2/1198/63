I use 8ft cheater bar as needed

I have also used the weight of the van, lifting it, placing wrench 
CAREFULLY so it is against the ground, then slowlly lowering the van 
putting about 1,000lbs or so on the wrench, adding weight of human(s) as 
needed.   I have always been reluctant to use impact wrench on that nut 
because it is attached to tranny and the vibrational transmission of 
energy. also make sure when doing this someone is in drivers seat holding 
brakes down as hard as possible so torque is not going thru shaft.

just my opinion and worth what you paid for it

YMMV
