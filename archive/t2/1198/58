Subject: Hydraulic lifters and rocker geometry

Hi,

Regarding my T4 2.0L rebuild, its new cam/ hydraulic lifters and rocker
geometry - I feel that pushrod length is less crucial for hydraulics with
regards to lash, but I am not sure how I can check the geometry...

I thought I might use a solid lifter, but until I get my hands on one, I'm
not sure if they are the same height, thought I know the stock pushrods are
different lengths from solid to hydraulic. Since I've changed the cam to
non-stock, perhaps I'll have to measure for length regardless. Or am I
over-thinking this aspect?

Thanks, Mike
