That is really interesting, I always swore by PB blaster-based on a
recommendation from a mechanic, and then personal use. Good to know there is
better stuff.Am I reading this post correctly? Liquid wrench is almost twice
as good as PB Blaster?

 

Also I assume this is LW Penetrating oil, as I'm sure they have a bunch of
different products.

 

The one thing about mixing your own stuff - how do you get a good sprayer? I
like the PB blaster - direct spray, it shoots in a nice line.
