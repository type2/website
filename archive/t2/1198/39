You forgot to mention what year the new camper is... ;)

Thin as in from the seating surface to the board/bus floor?  Late westies 
went for a thinner foam (like ~2-3 inches?) with the new generation of 
interiors in '74.  The earlier (68-73) interior used a thicker (4-5 
inches?) foam, and the so-42's in the splits used a similar foam over the 
wayback, but hair (ok, coconut, but) pads over springs for the seat part 
of the bed.

If not that, describe better what you mean? :)


And congrats on the new ride!
