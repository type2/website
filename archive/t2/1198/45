when i redid my foam,, the lady at the store recommended a certain density.. 
and I didnt feel it was dense enough,, so I made a place to lay down and 
asked if I could try a harder form.. she went up one grade... still didn't 
like it... when I was finally happy with the density,, she was flipping mad! 
,,, lol,, didn't even want to sell it to me... but I insisted... I am glad I 
did as the foam they wanted to sell was way too soft.. this foam is just 
right.
it is in my 74, so it is the thin bed..
my comments are in the archive per density, I can't seach it right now..
