Subject: New westy, and got some questions...

So here is the 2nd email.with my first questions about my new bus

 

1-the water pump works, but the switch is a bit wonky. You need to push it a
certain way for it to work. Is this a serviceable item, or should it just be
replaced? And can it be replaced? I see bus-boys have part # 230-1006. Just
wondering if that is the best way to go.

 

2-the seats and bedding were reupholstered at some point. The padding seems
really thin on the pull-out bed/bench seat & armrest. So thin, that there is
a bit of a gap between the passenger side armrest and the bench seat. This
doesn't seem right, but without one to compare, I can't quite tell.
