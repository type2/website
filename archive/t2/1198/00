The newer the bus, the more safe it is generally speaking. Also the 
complexity goes up. And the comfort goes up. So does the price tag... ;)

We have a '78 Westy and I'll be reworking the camper portion a little. 
We have more need to seat and sleep the family than we do to cook inside 
the van - which sometimes makes the interior smell like whatever you 
cooked for several days. I'd rather cook under an awning. Less chance of 
fires too. I guess if we lived somewhere with alot of wind and storms 
I'd want to cook inside but maybe we'd reduce our meal plans to coffee 
and/or sandwiches or just add hot water type meals.

I'm considering taking the stove unit out and building a second rear 
facing bench that looks like the rear bench. Then make sure that it can 
be lifted out easily and a stove cabinet lifted in and tightened down to 
the floor using the same hardware as the seat just removed. Just not 
sure. Another option was to leave the Westy package as is and build a 
2/3 width seat that snuggles up to the stove cabinet and the sliding 
door on the other end. Removable. That would add seating for two.

The smog stuff on my van was an EGR valve what leaked plus an EGR filter 
that was long missing. My carbon canister for the gas tank evap is 
intact. The EGV valve was not being reproduced at the time I bought my 
van in '97. I think the EGR filter was. I simply blocked it off b/c if 
it wasn't - it simply acted like a big vacuum leak and the engine would 
not run. Other vans like the CA had catalytic converters too and air 
injection pumps. I have no idea of what you can buy new or used or 
rebuild with cats or air pumps.
