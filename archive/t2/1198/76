Subject: losing fuel efficiency

I got a new Mexi-motor about 54,000 miles ago. I put a SVDA distributor, a
34-PICT3 carburetor and a Thunderbird QP header on it. I was getting 17-18 MPG
and gas was about $2.60/gal.

Now I am getting about 13 MPG and gas is about $3.60/gal.

The trend seemed to go downward when I replaced the extractor with an OEM
style muffler about 10,000 miles ago. (Incidentally, the head temp also
trended upward).

I have pursued other avenues for a solution.
I found two vacuum leaks; 1) replaced the brake servo; 2) replaced the
carburetor.  That was about 3,000 miles ago. I now have a 31-PICT3.

I have put the 009 distributor back in, but I dont have enough data points
yet to see if there is an improvement.

Today I did a tune-up and oil change and found the oil blacker and more
aromatic than usual.  The viscosity seemed OK, but it MIGHT have been thinner
than usual.

I am now adjusting the valves a little tighter.  They grab the feeler blade,
but there is still movement, just a little stiffer than before.

Im thinking I had better go back to a header.  I like the Tri-Mil thats on
my squareback, so I might go with that brand for the bus.

What else might I try?
