Subject: Re: [T2] Gauge mounting on my 64

I would love to install something like this

with this speedo

-or-

http://www.classicinstruments.com/gaugeselector.aspx?ProductCode=TR03SLF&SeriesCode=TR

These guys have a ton of options that would look great in a bus.  I saw a
similar installation somewhere on the web, but I can't find it this morning.
