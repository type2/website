and unless I'm missing something the castle nut need to be removed to
get the backing plate off to get to the brakes.

My 72 and all late bays have a small short bolt that holds the drum on the
hub. It frankly is not needed so sometimes it gets left off. That is
stock.

Remove the bolt and back off the brake shoes a bit and if it doesn't just
pull off, whack it a few times with a medium big hammer to loosen it. Very
rarely but sometimes, it can be quite well bonded and needs a bit of
penetrant between the hub and drum and time, then the sledge treatment.

However, removing the drum and hub gives much more access to R&R the
shoes. You don't HAVE to remove the hub to replace the shoes or wheel
cylinder. Just a bit more difficult to do the job with the hub in place.

Always feel for play in the bearings before you remove anything. If more
than just a bit at a minimum you need to retourqe that castle nut anyway
and retest for play. So in this case bite the bullet, get the tools
required, and pull the bit nut and hub. You still might need to back off
the shoes a bit due to a wear ridge on the drum.

Never loosen or tighten that big nut without the weight on the tire, e
brake on, reverse gear, and even a wheel chalk. So if you first find play
in the bearings, lower it and do the big nut dance. Then jack it back and
recheck the play. Only now you will know if it's just brake work, or
bearings as well. Those rear bearings last huge miles, but sooner or later
they will show wear. In fact, if you don't put enough torque on that big
nut, you can wear them out very fast.
