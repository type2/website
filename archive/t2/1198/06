The second is something that will leave you stranded. When you are installing the unit on a distributor it is very easy to make slack in the wires inside the dizzy too loose, too short, or not secured in the hole in the dizzy. If you make them too long, they can rub on things shorting them out. If you make them too short, they will rub on the shaft and eventually short them out. They can also restrict the advance and retard movements if they are not the correct length and strain relieved at the dizzy hole with the correct grommet.

add one to that, I put a high output coil on and forgot to put the 
resistor in line, fried it in about 15minutes just long enough to be on 
your first test drive.. wife had to tow me home 3 blocks
