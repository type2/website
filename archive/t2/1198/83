Subject: Re: [T2] Side wing window frames

wing frames,,, for the cabin doors?  or the rear of the Bus?
the front cabin doors arn't that hard to find... try bustedbus.com
the rear can be tough... if you want the left rear wing,, black.. you will 
have to search..
the right side wings can be found a little easier..
but you can pull them right out, and put in solid one piece glass to 
eliminate the wing.
That is what I did for my drivers side rear wing.. gone!
