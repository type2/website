Subject: San Diego to Grand Canyon and all the way home

I finally made it from San Diego to Grand Canyon and all the way home  
in a bus named Peregrine!

This trip was mostly unremarkable. I say mostly because on the first  
leg of the journey, while crossing Anza Borrego, the bus coughed up  
one of the bellows to a heat exchanger flapper valve! I stopped, went  
back, and picket it up from the middle of the road. Good thing I  
didn't need heat! (If I had, I'd have gotten some new clamps and  
climbed under.) I'm perplexed as to why this happened.

I got 22 miles to the gallon, which means (I think) that it ought to  
be running a tiny bit richer, the better to climb without heating up.  
But with a lot of downshifting and some careful stopping I managed to  
all the climbing in good order.

Three nights at the canyon, camped. It was 11 degrees the first night.  
None of the water in the tank or jugs froze. I was with a class I  
teach. I also spend one night at Arcosanti and two nights at Taliesin  
West.

I think the CV joints are a little dry. That's my next fix.

But meanwhile: whoot!
