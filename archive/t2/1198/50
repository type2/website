My 68 is yellow/white, a change from the original white/white and an even
bigger change from the green/mustard/different green/red when I got it.

There are, seemingly, a million shades of gray.  Or yellow.  But I went
with the yellow/white combination from the mid 2000's Mini Cooper.  It's
tricky, as the newer yellows are hideous, and you have to get the correct
white (I believe it is actually called "white").  I think 2005 is a good
year for the colors.  I'm very satisfied with this combination.
