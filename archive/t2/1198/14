Subject: Re: [T2] Front door window swap

If I remember correctly, it was only the side vent, side windows,
passenger, rear, etc that were green tinted on later buses. I have seen a
lot of original VW windshields and they have all been clear.

I get PPC windshield glass for customer bus projects (and personal). I have
the option of clear, ,green tinted throughout the glass or with a top
striped tint. I always get the green tinted as it seems to mellow the very
harsh sunlight here in Colorado. The top-tint band drives me crazy. I am
too tall, or at least my torso is. But that is just me. :)

One customer had some weird Acura seats in his bus with a dark aftermarket
banded tint windshield. I literally could not see out of the bus without
hunkering down. I asked him what he thought of it. He never realized it and
said, "so that is why driving this bus hurts my neck so much"! We got him a
regular window and some nice recovered stock seats and he was happy as a
clam.
