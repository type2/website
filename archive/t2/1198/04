Subject: Re: [T2] electronic ign failure?

I have had the pertronix units fail before. There are 2 common causes. The
first is plugging the wires backwards on the coil. This will fry it every
time. The second is something that will leave you stranded. When you are
installing the unit on a distributor it is very easy to make slack in the
wires inside the dizzy too loose, too short, or not secured in the hole in the
dizzy. If you make them too long, they can rub on things shorting them out. If
you make them too short, they will rub on the shaft and eventually short them
out. They can also restrict the advance and retard movements if they are not
the correct length and strain relieved at the dizzy hole with the correct
grommet.

It is always a good idea to take your time when installing these. Make sure to
exercise the retard/advance plate to make sure you are happy with the way the
wires lay. Also, oil the distributor while you have it out by pouring a little
oil down the shaft where the felt plug is.  Also, if the bearings are gone and
the shaft is out of tolerance, your VW will still run rough even with the
fancy new Pertronix.
