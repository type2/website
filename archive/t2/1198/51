    Mike, In my opinion, you should never change the original color. Adding 
a contrasting color to the top. is ok but I would not change a color 
totally.  For one thing you can never cover all the old color without an 
almost complete dissemble, removing the weather-stripping, chrome, etc!  Or 
when you open a door or deck lid you get the mulit-color tie died look. If 
the factory color tag is still there, it is a silver tag somewhat like a 
piece of tape 1/2 inch wide about 2 to 2 1/2 inches lone with a code stamped 
on it in black block letters and numbers. Places to look, drivers door jam, 
under/around drivers seat, engine compartment. If its not there you will 
find the PPG guys have a catalog with color chips in it. Always take them 
outside on a cloudless day to make your choice. Light bulbs are just not the 
same as old Sol!  I think The Samba has the color codes posted on there site 
somewhere, or I'm sure many list members have one.

Good luck

Howard
