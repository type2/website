Subject: RE: [T2] New westy, and got some questions...

1-the water pump works, but the switch is a bit wonky. You need to push it a
certain way for it to work. Is this a serviceable item, or should it just be
replaced? And can it be replaced? I see bus-boys have part # 230-1006. Just
wondering if that is the best way to go.

I don't know about this.

 
2-the seats and bedding were reupholstered at some point. The padding seems
really thin on the pull-out bed/bench seat & armrest. So thin, that there is
a bit of a gap between the passenger side armrest and the bench seat. This
doesn't seem right, but without one to compare, I can't quite tell. 

 > what year is your  bus? I think it's a 78....

My 71 Westy the seat width on the bed is 46 inches wide and the depth of the
seat is 6 inches (5 inchs for the foam and 1 inch for the wood base) same
for the Rear Top part that folds into the middle of the bad.I have about a
1/2 inch gap of both side just enough for my ipad to slide down on my closet
side.. Ugh (that was a pain fishing out without talking the bed and closet
out)

Congrats on the bus!
