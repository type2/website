With an impact wrench, yes - with all the normal warnings about working on 
a jack stand!     DO NOT do it with a breaker bar though!

I doubt you'll find an electric wrench that will do the job.   Assuming 
you weight in the 200lb ballpark and put full weight at the far end of 
the bar with it parallel to the ground, you already hung 800ft/lbs of 
torque on the nut.  More if you bounced up and down!

You need an air wrench, but you also need a compressor big enough to run 
it.  When they get tough, I end up cranking the line pressure up to 
120-150 psi for the task, and banging on them with my big 1/2" impacts. 
(capable of around 1000-1200ft/lbs I suppose) But this takes a LOT of air. 
My 20cfm pump runs pretty much full time for this.   I'd have better luck 
if I switched to a larger hose (3/4+ instead of the 1/2" line that gets 
over to my lift).


Really the best bet is to drive by any place that works on (big) trucks or 
RVs and get them to knock it loose.  I bet they'll even have a torque 
wrench to snug it back up to spec with.  Drive it home, it'll come off 
fine with your tools.

Shoot, the tool rental place might even do it for you if you bring your 
own socket.


If the bus isn't mobile, get a longer bar.... but it's very possible to 
break the heads off flex handles and bend the handles on slide bars.  I've 
returned probably 10+ spiraled 3/4" slide handles to sears over the 
years


since this is t2, and not vb, you can also remove the entire rear hub from 
the spring plate and axle and take it somewhere.  (not so easy for a redux 
box! :)
