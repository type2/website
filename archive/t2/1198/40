Subject: Re:New westy, and got some questions...

Sorry I forgot to give the year, and I also forgot to update my signature!
My new ride is a '78 westy. As far as thin cushions - the upper cushions
seem thin, as in maybe 1.5" thick? I got a piece of that egg crate foam or
memory foam type stuff to put on top-to make for a softer bed.  I sort of
expected this, as I vaguely remember when we rented a '79 a few years ago
that the upper bed was pretty thin in the pad dept. 

 

The lower bed - overall the cushions seem too thin to me, but I'm used to my
'65 ez-camper, which uses ~4" foam. I slept on this westy foam ok for a
night, but longer term I'd probably want a thicker foam. Also if I look at
the bench seat - there is a pretty big gap between it and the cushion
armrest on the passenger side. Large enough that I think my son could fall
through while crawling around the bus. I'm sure he won't get hurt, and he
may learn his lesson, but I also imagine lots of large stuff falling down
this crack. I'll see if I can post a pic to thesamba about it. 

 

He has not been in it yet-as the bus is still on the west coast, and we are
on the east. But one thing I like to do with my son and dog-is hang out in
my ez-camper when the weather is nice. My dog loves to sit on the rear
bench, and my son loves to crawl all over the bus seats, and over my dog. It
is like a large romper room for him.
