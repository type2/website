You might be very wise to drive to a VERY large truck facility,, and ask a 
mechanic to blow it off with their 1" air impact...
if that doesn't budge it, they can warm it up with a torch... and zip it 
off...
if that doesn't work...  prepare to cut the nut in half..
torch,, grinder, sawsall..  but you might not want to finish the rest of the 
job at the truck facility parking lot..

or you can try a torque multilplier...

I go to the BIG tools ... boom,, done!  ...
