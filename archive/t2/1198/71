I hope I am not stating the obvious.  There are two bolts that hold the
drums on and you will need an 11mm wrench to remove them.  Once they are
removed then you can remove the drums.  Sometimes the drums will need a
little persuasion to get them off.  Other times they will need a lot of
persuasion.

Hi David,
It's a 1972 (I've heard them referred to as late bays and early bays) and
unless I'm missing something the castle nut need to be removed to get the
backing plate off to get to the brakes.
