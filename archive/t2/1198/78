well, an early 72 is an early bay,, a late 72 is a late bay.... and then 
there are zwitters

it seems they didn't split the year on purpose... so when it comes to 
certain items,, they can be mixed up

early vs late
oval tail lights vs rectangle
round bumpers vs square
wide five wheels vs small 5
type1 engine vs T4 engine

etc etc
