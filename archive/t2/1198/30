Subject: Old Bosch points

Well, out working on the Vanagon today and going through 30 years of old
parts. came across an old set of points from my "shop" days
of the early eighties while I was waiting to get into Nursing school. the
numbers on the box reference to a cold start valve, but they are NOS
Points made in Stuttgart?  first person who gives me an address gets them.
will have more small parts to share later. to keep with the list
requirements
I have been keeping an eye on a 75 westy at the local pick and pull. may
pull the trigger. (yes I know, don't do it it's rough but complete).
Please email me direct and be patient as I am out of town next week. I can
email picture of box. Thomas
