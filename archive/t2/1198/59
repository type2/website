Subject: Castellated Nut and Impact Wrenches - '72 Weekender

My attempts to remove the castle nut from the rear axle provedB futile - ample
amounts of PB Blaster, a 4' cheater bar, a friend, etc. didnbt work. An
easier way seems toB be rentingB an impact wrench from the local hardware
store for $12/half day. Questions:
-B B B B B B B B B  Is it safe to remove the nut while the bus is on jack
stands?
-B B B B B B B B B  Will an electric wrench deliver the torque I need? Or will
I need an air wrench?
-B B B B B B B B B  Any other suggestions?
Thanks, and happy spring.
