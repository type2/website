Subject: Re: [T2] Castellated Nut and Impact Wrenches - '72 Weekender

I had mixed results using a pipe wrench. The teeth in the wrench galled groves
in the nuts and would actually compress the nut causing it to be harder to
turn.  I had to use a sledge and and beat them into submission. On the bright
side, it finally worked. On the dark side, I had to replace the castle nuts. I
should have bought a 6 point socket and the longest breaker bar I could find.
Good luck. There are a lot of ways you hurt yourself doing this.
