Thanks for all this information. I think the first step is to get a larger
cheater bar (6-8feet). The one I used was only 3-4 feet long.

But the rear brakes are a mess. The passenger-side lining fell off the lining
table when I removed the drum and the other side crumbled into a pile of dust.
(Probably explains why the braking was so dismal.)

But for what itbs worth, it is a Washington bus with minimal rust so the
only real issue (I think) is that the nut has never been removed, or was
removed decades ago. Before I take this to the next level, Ibll replace the
wheels, give it another liberal dose of PB Blaster and get a longer cheater
bar.

And does that torque multiplier work on the 46mm? I thought it was only 36mm.
