Subject: Gauge mounting on my 64

Hi,
Trying to figure out where and how I should mount a couple of gauges 
on my dash.
Where/how have any of you folks mounted yours?
I have a wide band and a cylinder head temperature gauge.

I looked at possibly on the fresh air panel overhead, wiring is a 
little difficult as I would need to remove half my Kamper Kit to 
remove the driver or passenger side roof panel. ( I have a converted 
delivery van) Don't want to do this.

Under the parcel tray. I have tried this, but the visibility is poor.

There are a variety of bezels and mounts available for 2 gauges, but I 
haven't seen one that says "buy me". I have some capability to 
fabricate from aluminum.

What I really need is one of those 3D printers. I could design up a 
nice looking piece and simply make it. On the other hand if I had a 
few spare hundred dollars I could send out to a quick fab house and 
have it made.

Ideas?? Any Photos?

Thanks,
Chris
