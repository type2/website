Subject: gauge mounting ->Multiple CHT gauge

Look in the magazines devoted to rice rockets.  Lots of pillar mount options. 

I get gauge assemblies out of Audis and W/C VW's at the pick and pull.  3 hole
with gauges for $15 or so.  Have to fab a shroud or buy one.

On a slightly different topic here is a nice samba thread on CHT probe
mounting.  Plenty of back and forth.  IMHO the "hole in the head next to the
spark plug" with epoxy set up is plenty good, and a much better solution than
the ring terminal under the plug.

Excellent price on long, welded, thermocouple probes.
