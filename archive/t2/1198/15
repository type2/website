Subject: Re: [T2] Front door window swap

When I bought my Camper... it had a black tint strip with the word BUS glued 
across the top 4" of the windshield... it took me about an hour of driving 
to reach up and grab a corner.. and YANK.. it was gone! I was real happy it 
came off in one piece that easy!

I have since replaced the clear windsheild sans bus sign with a tint top 
glass.. that works like sunglasses for me.. as I look thru the top 2" off 
the glass

Also, I put in the factory green tint vent wings, and door glass you refered 
to.... as it matches quite nicely... to the limo tint I have on all the back 
windows..

nice thing about the tint.....   cotton curtains last longer without sun 
fade or disintegrating .. the cotton ones I just took out were from circa 
1993
