My '72 Westy, built 6 June 1972, has high front turn signals.  As far as I
can tell, having had the paint on the front sanded down to bare metal, this
is the original front end.

> It's a 1972 (I've heard them referred to as late bays and early bays)


well, an early 72 is an early bay,, a late 72 is a late bay.... and then
there are zwitters

it seems they didn't split the year on purpose... so when it comes to
certain items,, they can be mixed up

early vs late
oval tail lights vs rectangle
round bumpers vs square
wide five wheels vs small 5
type1 engine vs T4 engine

etc etc
