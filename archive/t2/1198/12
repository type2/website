To clarify, I'm almost certain Type 2b deluxe buses had green tinted glass.
I'm not sure exactly when they started offering it, but I don't *think*
U.S. Spec Type 2a buses were available with green tint. I have never seen a
pre-'72 with it but...?

I know I have far more green tinted glass out of T2b buses than clear.
