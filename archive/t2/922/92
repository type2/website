Subject: Re: [T2] jets on weber idf 40mm

your jetting is a joke.

With 40 IDFs (duals) at 2500 feet with 28mm venturis (stock size) you should 
have

F11
47.5-50 idle
115 main
180-200 air.

most shops will "recommend" pig rich jetting so you stop calling back 
bugging them, since being too rich "runs fine". They just fail to mention 
you have a hydrocarbon spewing mosquito fogger masquerading as a VW. 
Customers rarely complain about mpg, they always complain about spitting and 
hesitation, which is why most shops will recommend you "too rich" to get rid 
of you
