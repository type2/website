Well, it would depend upon the kind of roads that you travel.  If you are
on well-travelled highways with major civilization nearby, the standard
spare will do nicely.

OTOH, if you travel in rural areas where a 185R14
load range D tire is something that will come in with the weekly shipment
to the only tire store in town a second spare might be a way to avoid a
long wait in a not-so-pictureesque place.

If you travel somewhere like here:

Where the nearest paved road is 40 miles and two mountain ranges away and
another car might come by every few days, that second spare might be
a lifesaver.

The more off the beaten path you get, the more likely it is that a tire
will fail, fail in an unrepairable way, and the less likely a replacement
will be readily available.

To me, a second spare is cheap insurance, just like the second carb, coil,
plug wires, fuel pump and distributor that I always carry and have never
needed.
