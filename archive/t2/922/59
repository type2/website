Subject: Better gas mileage by attaching a metal garbage can lid to

Hi,

Some years ago, a bus owner told me that he had attached a metal
garbage can lid to his front mounted spare, and it increased his
gas mileage.  Has anybody tried this?

I am guessing that the principle would be similar to the bulbous
submerged part of the bow on (some?) supertankers.
