Hi Kevin,

The VW bus was not designed for rural or recreational use. It was  
designed as an all-purpose vehicle from 1968-79. It was even branded  
as a "Station Wagon". There were no sport-utes back then, and the  
market was pretty simple: Sports cars, Jeeps,  Muscle Cars, and  
everything else. The VW Bus was very much an "Everything Else"  
vehicle, and was just as useful in the suburbs as out on the farm.

You don't need to be "extra careful" in a VW bus, you only need to be  
"careful enough". But for some reason that seems to be too much to  
ask these days from drivers of modern appliances. You don't have to  
watch where you're going if you have an airbag, right? Personally, I  
feel that airbags are dangerous. They have killed children in  
situations where no injury should have occurred. But they're  
federally mandated, so we're stuck with them, even though they raise  
the price of insurance and increase the likelyhood of a write-off  
when an accident does occur.

Happy Trails,
