Hmmm... that's a lot of weight to be mounted up that high.

Bah.  I have driven with a spare on the front for 18 years and it has 
never touched another vehicle.  It would have to be a pretty tall, flat 
vehicle to hit the spare anyway.  Something like an H-2.

I agree with those who say space inside is much to precious to use up 
storing a spare.
