Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

My question is after reading two days of doom & gloom regarding a
frontal impact with a front mounted spare tire on a Type 2 Bus---

What in the hell do you guys think would happen with a direct blast
without the spare tire mount?

Whatever you hit would be in your lap---
Or the nose sheet metal & dash board  would most certainly be anyway.

If your looking for a safe ride--any VW  isn't on top of the list of "I
walked away from it" catagory.
If your worried about this possibility--better start looking for a late
40's to late 50's Power Wagon, or maybe a 59-60 Olds Fiesta wagon

Frontal impact at any speed with or without a spare mounted ain't gonna
be pretty.

Contact Alfred E. Neuman if this ugly thought linger's---
