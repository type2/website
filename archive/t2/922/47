	What a fine mutual admiration society
we've evolved here, at least regarding crash
avoidance.  I used to drift my '57 Splittie on
winding public roads (I was younger & even more
reckless then).  The old  5.60" tyres and crude
Renault-type swing-axle rear suspension oddly
worked OK.  I never went past the crucial 150 of
tail-wag.  I've not yet got around to practising
with the noo-fangled T2 suspension and fatter 185
tyres, but thanx for the reminder to do so.
	My country has just been invaded by the
S. Africa saloon-car champ  -  Renault 8 Gordini
1255cc >105bhp.  (I fully expect him to clean up
the 7-litre Mustangs and other brutalisms here,
especially as I've become his water-injection
consultant  ;-} .)  He makes the point "oversteer
is in principle controllable"; we're not so sure
that understeer is.
	Steer into the skid; as Guac says, get
some experience with skidding in rehearsal, and
you'll have a far better chance of evading
crashes.
