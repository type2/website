Well, it the area IS designed to hold luggage, which I am sure would  
weigh more than my wheel and tire. And, the High Top's luggage area  
is recessed lower...so it doesn't sit all the way at the very top.

I'm happy yours hasn't been hit. The images that I saw from other  
buses involved in very minor collisions (ones with spares in front)  
convinced me otherwise. Plus, spending more than 5 years publishing a  
bodyshop trade magazine gave me plenty of insight into the potential  
for damage...as well as access to quite a few collision repair guys  
who thought it was a bad idea.

Besides, have you been to Charleston, SC lately? Nothing but  
ginormous SUVs and trucks on tall tires. The first thing they'd hit  
is the wheel, and not the bumpers.

And as I originally wrote, YMMV.
