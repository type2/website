Subject: Weld in vs. Easy slip on inner rocker panels???

www.CIP1.ca  shows two types of inner rocker panels for my 77 Westy, a 'full
weld in' version
http://www.cip1.ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=TAB%2D402%2D411
, and the 'easy fit' version
http://www.cip1.ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=TAB%2D402%2D431. Has anyone
tried these easy fit ones? They appear to have notches cut out of them to fit
around the frame members of the body. Just curious.
