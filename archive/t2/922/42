That just is NOT true.  I was in a parking lot a couple of winters ago and a 
guy ran a stop sign - I hit him at maybe 20 kph (I was actually on a road 
between two parking lots) - he was in some late 80's car (they all look the 
same to me) - the impact caused $3,500.00 in damage required a new nose, 
headlights etc.... You could see exactly the impression maybe by the spare - 
the spare sticks out farther than the bumper - you could exactly see that 
the vast majority of the damage was caused by having the spare there - I do 
have pics if anyone cares. Fortunately for me - my bus was otherwise mint so 
the insurance company paid up.

Now - I don't carry a spare - I have good tires and two cans of fix-a-flat 
stuff - and a 12 volt compressor - so far so good (I keep my fingers 
crossed)
