<<I had the Dodge version ("rocking horse") and in the rain/light snow
the thing had maybe the worst handling I've ever experienced... ;-(>>

The Slant 6 Mopar was a forever engine---and if you had a 318 the Van
flew.
The shifter for the automatic was on the dash--neat.

Two of the Chevy's I had had 250's in them the later model 68 had a 327
/
 powerglide.

It flew--

However, all of them in the rain and snow you did do some extreme
highway surfing---

But--Cheap parts, and easy to work on---in the winter flip up the engine
cover and you could stay half assed warm and tuned her up --whatever---

BUT--still death traps on a nose to nose deal as the VW Buses / Van's
are.

Just saw a Falcon PU truck yesterday--not an Econoline--but a Falcon.

Pretty rare ride.
