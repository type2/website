Subject: jets on weber idf 40mm

folks, 
i have a 1800 in my 72 with weber idf 40 carbs. 500
miles on new engine. It came with what was supposedly
the correct 130 jets. It would stall when it came off
idle, so i put in 125s. It is much better, but still
likes to stumble and occasionally backfire at low rpm
off idle. It has very poor low-end power right now. 
is it unreasonable to put in 120s? I live at 2500'
elevation. I am told the 130s are perfect for sea
level.

I spoke with CB performance (where the carbs came
from) and they happily sold me more jets. They said
the other jets (air, idle) were OK for the range i was
messing with.

So before i put in 120s... am i misssing something?
thanks
matthew
