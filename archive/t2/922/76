Hi Sam,

You're right, but you're missing the point of the original post,  
which was asking how to prevent the damage done to the vehicle during  
the break-in. Leaving that vehicle unlocked would have prevented that  
damage, which was of a much higher cost than the stereo they were after.

Perhaps the post should have read "Locks only keep "Theft of  
opportunity" from occurring. There's simply no stopping a well- 
prepared and determined thief. They'll haul the whole vehicle away if  
the stakes are high enough. And I have heard of dumb(-at-)$$ thiefs who  
broke the windows on an unlocked car to get inside.

Leaving the keys in the ignition is another matter though.... Might  
as well put a sign on it saying "Free ride".\

Happy Trails,
