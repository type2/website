I think it depends on where you are driving. 
There are sharp volcanic rocks everywhere in
Arizona.  I've heard most of Mexico is the same. 
I also heard the Alcan and surrounding area was
horrible on tires.  Surprised you so no problem. 
Hope your luck continues.  I carry a box of fix a
flat, a small compressor, and those little plug
things too, but they only do so much.  

Happy bussin'
