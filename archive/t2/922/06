THAT is the best part of road-trips.  I love taking every random road I 
can to find neat and interesting routes, take in the country, enjoy the 
views and hang out w/ the locals.  You often find that your destination 
changes from day to day ;)

Also, don't forget that the bus is offroad capable!!  It's probably for 
the more daring, but I've done a ton of offroading when I was up in 
Oregon 1000 miles away from home and camped out in the middle of 
nowhere.  Still kinda amazed I made it back as I ended up burning up a 
clutch somewhere around SF.. hehehe

Btw, you might want to get yourself a tire patch kit and an electric 12v 
pump.  That way you can fix those simple nail holes and still fill up 
your tire if you're out in the middle of BFE.  Also, if you happen to 
get stuck in sand or rocks and can't get out (ask me how I know), you 
can deflate your tires to get more traction.

happy trails!
Mike
