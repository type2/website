Saturday, October 14th update.

Jerry was moved to a regular room this afternoon from
ICU.
  There will be more tests. I don't know when 
he
will be getting out of the hospital. 

Speaking for my self,And I think! I can include all
the PNW VW community. We send our thoughts & Prayers
to you, & Jerry. God Bless.
