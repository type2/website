Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

I have a 1974 High Top and asked around about the best location to  
place the tire, and decided I will mount it up in the luggage rack at  
the back of the High Top.

Everyone I spoke with (all bus mechanics and body people) said that  
mounting on the nose would cause severe damage even if someone only  
bumped into you at 5 mph. Or if I bumped into someone, of course. I  
even have the bumper over-riders in front, and they wouldn't stop an  
impact on the nose-mounted wheel.

While it may look cool, given the lack of driving skills for many  
road warrior-wannabes here in Charleston, I just don't want to deal  
with the potential hassle.

Just my 2.777 centavos. YMMV.

PS: I like Kevin's idea though! Now if only I could find someone who  
knows how to paint an EWI.
