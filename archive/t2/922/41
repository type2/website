You're right about under-body tire mounts being a pain
to access. As it was, the only place I could mount it
was behind the front left wheel and because it
wouldn't fit between the frame rails or between the
frame and body edge, I had to mount it below the rail
which gave me about 4" of ground clearance! I could
live with that near an axle centerline, but amidships
is just too vulnerable. It now resides in the
passenger footwell, jammed against the dashboard. The
passenger seat is long gone - that is my pantry now!
