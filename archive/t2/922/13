Subject: VW Bus designed for...

To be sure, one of the funniest sites I remember seeing as a kid  
growing up in Europe was a 70-something Westy struggling to stay on  
the Autobahn in the far right lane as big Mercedes and even some  
trucks went zooming by at triple-digit (MPH, not KPH) speeds. We had  
a 1972 BMW Bavaria that was a dragster compared to any bus.

Suburbs...funny term for someone who grew up across the pond!

I wonder how weird it would look if I put a window in the top/front  
of my High Top to give it that great "Olds Vista Cruiser" look to it.

Or is that considered blasphemous?
