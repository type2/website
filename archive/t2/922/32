That makes some sense, actually.  Never thought of it before but I  don't work in stock car racing.  Yet.  Thanks...KR

tried mounting underneath with a chain capstan from a
pickup truck, but was unable to really get it where I
wanted it due to obstructions. I'd like to mount it
underneath the nose. It's possible but I never got too
into it  with all the plumbing I have up there now.
