Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

I bungied the spare up in the lugage rack. It's out of the way up there.

When the spare was mounted on the nose, I backed into it with my Honda
CRV in the driveway while backing up about as slow as a sane person
does in their own driveway. It made a nice half round bullseye on the
nose. Man, was I pi*#!d off! But my stupid mistake!

It doesn't take much force to center punch the wheel into the nose. I
thought I'd hit the bumper, but noooooooo way!

As far as aerodynamics go, I suspect if the air that hits the nose is
disturbed by something, a spare or maybe a bicycle on a Jamie Rivers
front hitch, (shameless plug) the disturbed air in front of the nose
could more easily find its way around the body instead of hitting the
nose head on.

 I am not an aerodynamicist but have built Formula Ford race car bodies.

Just my .02$
