Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

There is an alternative: http://marcusschaper.de/en/cars/vw.htm. Scroll to
the bottom of the page. This type front mounted spare moves the spare behind
the bumper and INSIDE of the extended front frame.

I haven't seen one of these in a crash yet. But my previous bus had the
regular front spare, too, and after I t-boned a VW Polo (not my fault) at 40
kph the nose was severely dented - mostly because of the spare. However, the
bus was still drivable, the Polo was a pile of scrap.
