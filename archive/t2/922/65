That's right Tonny---
It's made to drive through whatever you smack---

I'd put my money on the guy in the Olds vs. the guy in the Bus in deer
attack---: )

A flat sheet metal & glass barrier in front of me just doesn't stop
much. 

"Hello Deere"

One day I'll have to tell ya about my Pink 57 Pontiac wagon and an new
87 Olds 98 4 dr. that made a big mistake and made a left turn in front
of me.

I backed outa him, and parked the Tin Indain.

His car was toataled--a dead center wack from the pink panther.

Frame & mass amounts of sheet metal win every time.
