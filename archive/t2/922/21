	Right (as they used to intone in the late '60s) on, Kev.
	Nader was right that, once you get in a head-on crash, a Type 
2 offers minimal protection.  I have my spare wheel on a 'bull bar' 
(as they're called in Australasia) bolted a foot rearwards onto the 
'chassis', and happily accept whatever small drag it creates; but I 
remain convinced that the main thing is to keep out of head-ons.  You 
can't do much about the scale of damage in the event; your big 
opportunity is in minimising the risk, i.e the probability that the 
event will occur.  Around the time Nader made his point, I began 
rehearsing in my imagination the deliberate taking to the countryside 
when confronted with an imminent head-on.  I'd much rather roll on 
e.g pasture than take a head-on.
	Much more recently I've become biased in further favour of 
this theory by the actual experience of a head-on in a Nissan C20 
vanette ( cab-over  -  no better than a naked Type 2's frontal 
protection).  I can confirm this is a type of crash capable of 
causing serious injury.  (No opportunity to take to countryside in 
that case.)
	So please take it from Unca Robt, picanninies  -  be ready to 
actuate that sub-routine in which you deliberately steer where you 
normally wouldn't, even if likely to roll, to stay out of a head-on.
