We had an Olds Vista Cruiser (prior to leaving the U.S.) right after  
we sold our '69 Westy Hardtop.

Mom and dad bought a Shasta Motorhome to replace the VW since my  
brother and I outgrew the bus.

Crazy...what comes around, goes around!

I believe my wife's family had one as well...gotta check. Small world.
