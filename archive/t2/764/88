Mechanical advance dizzies should be timed to 27 to 32 degrees BTDC
depending upon your engine's tolerance for advance at 3500 RPM. You
might start at 27 to be conservative and gradually advance it to check
tolerance for heat and pinging.

 I have a new 050 dist - I have never installed it but carry it around as a

 a back up if I have never tried it

 Anybody know much about these ? From what I gather the are pure mechanical
but
 a better choice then the 009
