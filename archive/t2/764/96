Don,

Ditto from me also on the flywheel, but if it was done correctly, it would 
have been balanced while installed with the crank and pulley.

Gene berg sells a heavier pulley for folks with light weight 
flywheeels....you can read his take on why you need it and make your own 
decision.

I have a lightweight flywheel in a 68 bug.  I will never build a daily 
driver with one again....even though the 68 runs and drives like a top.


Cheers, dave

 Personally, I'd swap to a standard-weight flywheel unless the lightened 
 one was dynamically balanced to the crank .. this is a *Bus* not a 
 racecar and low-end grunt is more important than high RPMs.
