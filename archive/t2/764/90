Barry,
Do not look any further. With the bleeder screw at the bottom of the
caliper, you cannot bleed them properly. The air stays at the top
while you bleed the heck out of the lower bleeder screw.

You can either unscrew the calipers to bleed them while the bleeder is
at the top or give a hard time to the shop that sold you wrong
calipers and get the right one (that is the only track I'd consider,
since I'd get way too angry every time I bleed the brakes otherwise)

Alternatively you can try to install the left caliper on the right and
vice versa. I *think* they are symmetric for 71-72 but not positive.
Others please correct me.

It took me, a great VW guy and 7 orders before I got a caliper that I
could use on the bus. Yet the 7th caliper had the piston cutouts
facing up and I had to turn them before installing.
You might want to search for "caliper arnaud" in the archives and it
will tell you this story

Please do not drive like that - it can kill.
