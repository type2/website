Subject: VWs in CO? (was: Safare for Sale)

> Sorry folks, the bus is in Fort Collins, Colorado


What's up with all the VWs for sale in Colorado? Are folks just
getting them out of winter storage or something? Or maybe it's the 90+
degree heat lately?

Just seems strange that I see so few around here, yet there seem to be
great VWs for sale in every website and newspaper.

Here's another example, though it's not a bus:

I drooled over that one, and I don't even normally like the "rat" look.

I sincerely hope these vehicles stay here in CO. I'd love to see more
on the road...
