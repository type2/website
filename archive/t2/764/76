Thanks, David.  You have given me the answer to the 'long pull on emergency 
brake handle' question.

My two emergency brake cables are attached to my single cable that goes to 
the emergency brake handle at a 'yoke'  This yoke is designed to create an 
even pull on the two emergency brake cable with the single cable .

I noticed that my yoke was not  perpendicular to the emergency brake 
handle's cable.  Probably one of the two emergency brake cables has 
stretched quite a bit so that the yoke is sitting at a non-perpendicular 
angle to maintain the even pull on the two cables.

This sounds like a job for the  'cable man!!'.

And when I release the emergency brake cables, I will check/adjust the rear 
brakes again to see if this has anything to do with the long brake pedal 
travel.
