Don, the seller is "Al Bugs Me," a VW shop in Ft. Collins focused primarily 
on bugs. Great shop. Al doesn't care much for busses, though. He has a guy 
that works there that handles all of his bus business, and they sell a lot 
of busses and parts and such. Al's quite the character and tells great 
stories.
