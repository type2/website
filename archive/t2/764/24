Subject: Fuel pump stopped working at in intersection

I was on my way home from work listening to my radio when suddenly the car 
turned off. I just had it tuned up a week ago today and that was very strange. 
So I tried to start it again and it didnt go. The engine turns over but there 
is no gas going in. I figured this out because I could not hear the fuel pump 
working. I tried adjusting some wires but nothing worked.(while waiting for my 
light to turn green) So I waited about an hour until there was no more traffic 
and then pushed my car a block to my house.(never new i could push a car by 
myself all the way home) So I parked her but it was too dark to even begin to 
see what was there now. So im not really sure were to start tomorrow morning. 
Does anybody have any suggestions. I was just about to buy some new tires 
tomorrow also.
