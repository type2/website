Subject: Florescent light and stuff.

I've read a number of postings that mention a florescent light in their
Westys. 

 

I have a '79 Westy and don't have a florescent light - mine has a three bulb
incandescent light fixture with a low (one bulb lit), medium (two bulbs lit)
and high (three bulbs lit) switch.   Is this correct for my bus?  If not,
does anyone out there have a correct florescent light that they are willing
to part with?

 

I am also in need of the little piece of plastic that clips on the male end
of one of the seat belts in the rear seat.

 

Talking about seat belts (I guess that was me talking about seat belts :).
I've been thinking about putting retractable 3-point belts in the front of
my Westy. I've seen a bunch of auctions on eBay for these for around $59 -
has anyone had any experience with these?  Or others for that matter?

 

As always - thanks in advance for your help.
