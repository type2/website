Subject: dome light

ok, the dome light on my 70 is acting up again...  went out to get 
something from the car, and noticed the light was on. front door 
firmly shut; switch in 2nd (of 3) positions on the light - the proper 
setting for 'go on only when door opens.'

now, this light, like many old items, had a slight bodge: i had to 
take a wire and wrap one end around the 'ground' side of the spring 
holding the light bulb in, and wrap the other to the actual 'ground' 
wire... the brass parts on the switch had apparently corroded too 
much to allow sufficient ground all by themselves. it worked like 
this for many years.

when i pull this additional wire, the light won't work at all; with 
it in, light stays lit, but oddly gets DIMMER when the front door is 
opened.   light will also not turn off in  switch position #1, 'off 
at all times.; so i have a short somewhere - but where?

anyone have a known good, 3-position, chrome bezel dome light they wanna sell?
