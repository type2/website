Subject: Re: [T2] Press required for CV joints?

hello Jack   I have never used a press to remove the CV joints  take the 
circlip off the end of the shafts and use a hammer and punch to litley remove the 
joint  be careful not to knock the joint apart hit on the inner section only  
later and have fun Mark Dearing
