Subject: Timing an 050 Distributer

I have a new 050 dist - I have never installed it but carry it around as a
back up - what should this unit be timed at in my 1.8 l type IV - not much of
a back up if I have never tried it

Anybody know much about these ? From what I gather the are pure mechanical but
a better choice then the 009
