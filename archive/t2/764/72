Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal => Excessive Travel

Barry,

this was the problem that i just dealt with on my 78.  I had adjusted
the brakes and had no pedal.

what fixed it for me was unhooking the emergency cable at the bottom
of the arm near the drivers feet.  there is 1 pin there that makes it
really easy.  then I went in and re adjusted the brakes.  then hooked
up the cable again and all was much better.

>it is usually the long pull on the emergency brake handle that
>develops over time that causes me to give the rear brakes some
attention...

The long pull on the ebrake that develops is also attributed to the
stretching of the cables.  they make a triangle thingy that clips on
to the cable to take up that slack.

Hope this helps,

David.
