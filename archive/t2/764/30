Subject: engine rebuild failure

spent all day putting the engine back in
1600 dual port, in a 71 bus....

new crank bearings, new cam bearings,
new heads, new flywheel, new pushrod tubes.

put it all back together myself.  every step
in the manual was followed..

Put the engine back in myself.  hooked
everything up.  fired it up.  Ran GREAT...

after about 45 seconds the front bearing
seized to the crank.  Ruined another engine.

Oil was getting pumped to heads, all other
bearings.  It appears as if the front bearing
was not getting oil....

any ideas of another non VW engine I could
buy cheap for this bus?  I have welders,
drill press, and a milling machine, so I can
make adaptor brackets.
