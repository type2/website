Subject: Accelerator cable length

I have been slowly getting the parts together to fit a set of weber icts to 
my 76 bus (it's Australian so it would have had carbs as stock). I got the 
set secondhand from the samba that included everything except the hoses and 
the hex bar (I made my own from a length of aluminium pipe - what a labour 
of love that was!). Last weekend was the moment of truth when it all came 
together. Big problem was that the accelerator cable is about 2 inches too 
short. The carbs are replacing a single weber progressive. (The cable was 
plenty long for the progressive.) My question is what accelerator cable 
should I get to join to the weber ict linkage? I discovered on bughaus.com 
that there are at least 8 different length accelerator cables. Should I 
just get the longest? Do they all have the same end at the cabin end of the 
cable?

Help....!

Cheers,

Martin.
