Subject: Slightly OT: Stranded and need VW diesel mech. in Nashville

Guys-

A dear friend of mine and his wife are stranded in Nashville tonight;
their '91 Jetta diesel began running very poorly enroute to OK from
NC. The car had been in storage for more than a year, and I suspect
there's a timing issue with the injector pump. I'm no diesel mechanic,
however, and I'm nine hours away. Do any of you Nashville listers know
of a capable mechanic who can help them get back on the road? They're
in a motel for the evening so at least they're safe, but any help you
guys could provide would be much appreciated. If you'd like, call me
directly on my mobile at 405.245.0912. Thanks in advance-

Jon Joyce
Edmond, OK
