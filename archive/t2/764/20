Why do you want to torque only half the head? I would agree that loose nuts are no good but otherwise, why?

If you look at the area where the the nuts go, VW used a thick washer and spot faced the contact area to ensure that the heads torque just right. On top of that, there is the recommended torque pattern.

Pretty good.

Group 41 (large) and 42 (smaller) are just the stock sizes with the terminals reversed and are supposed fit the battery clamp.

Turn the battery around or use another size and well, you know, ymmv.
