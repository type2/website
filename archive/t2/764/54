Subject: Free camper parts - Northern Virginia

I was cleaning more out of my shed and I found some camper parts. I don't 
know the year, but it is at least a '72 as it came from a camper with a 
type IV engine.

I found the following:
1) a folding table, woodgrain masonite with a white border. It is the kind 
with the folding leg that snaps to the bottom. It has the leg and all 
hardware. It's in great shape, but dirty.
2) The oval door under the rear seat, plus what I think is the white border 
that went inside the hole. Plus a baggie of hardware, looks to be more than 
needed for the door, but prob. all camper bits.
3) the wooden backer pieces for the bed base and back part. That heavy 1 
1/4 inch plywood with the cutouts for the handholds. No foam attached. In 
case you have termites or something.

I really don't want to ship any of this stuff. The cost is a donation to 
the type2 list in any amount you consider appropriate.

I live in Falls Church, VA, just outside of DC. I need these picked up by 
the first of August or they will go on the truck to the dump.

PS: I have the front hood, rear hood and a bumper for a late model type III 
as well, if anyone knows someone who might want them. Same conditions.

Chris
