The cutoff came on some 72-74 buses. It required a switch on the
transmission to activate it in 4th gear. If you don't have that nosecone
there's no point in hooking it up.

However, that device makes the engine run hot by eliminating advance in the
lower 3 gears. Bad idea.

You'll need to block the retard port on the carb with a rubber cover.
