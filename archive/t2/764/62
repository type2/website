Caught yer corrected post about 30 months.  Not bad, but I've gotta
side with Mark Dearing on the Crane units, even if they only come with
a year's warranty.  Before Crane bought them out, they were known as
Allison XR-700 and they are the BEST.  I've ran them in various VWs
from the early 70s (Ran one on my ex-67 Bus for 18 years) and they're
worth every penny.  Had a Lifetime Warranty until they were absorbed
by Crane, but the quality's still up there in the stratosphere.  I've
tried Pertronix, Compu-Fire and a few others, but I've always come
back to an Allison/Crane Unit.  No crazy Hall or Magnetics to fool
with, just good ole reliable infared trigger.

No, I don't work for 'em either.
