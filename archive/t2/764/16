Subject: Re: [T2] Florescent light and stuff.

The florescent light thing is a piece of cake.  Easily
added.  My ASI/Riviera had 1 in the galley when I
bought it.  Now I have added 3 more...one more in the
galley, and 2 above the engine hatch.  I`m 52 y.o. and
need light to see clearly, and to read.  For a common
popular 12v florescent light brand, go to
http://www.campingworld.com/browse/products/index.cfm?prodID=1445&src=SRQB
to view various RV type "Thin-Lite" Florescent
fixtures.   They all work on 12 volts, consume 8 to 12
watts for 1 tube, or 16 to 24 watts for dual tubes. 
The tubes are 120v type, but the lights readily work
on 12 volts.  And, they kick-out the light.
  
A couple of years ago, when my florescent was wired to
the main battery of my T2, we moved some equipment in
and out of the T2 on a weekend and accidentally left
the florescent light burning.  On Thursday, aka 4 or 5
days later, I found the florescent still shining.  I
shut it off, and to my surprise, the engine
turned-over and started with no problem.  Go figure.
