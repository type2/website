Chris,

One or two Inside splines or outside splines?

Just asked this question to the vintage vw folks(sedans)...

Here are the rule of thumb answers(for a SEDAN)
1 outside spline = around 1 1/4"(from John Connaly)

I believe the minimum adjustment is about 1/4"...this is for *each* 
*minimum* adjustment...read bently to learn that one...

I think in the link below, 1 inside spline was = to about 2"

and a link to a SEDAN calculator

Here is a link to a good discussion on STF regarding adjusting torsion 
bars.  Also includes a link to a
program for calc'ing how much of an adjustment you need.

YMMV!!!!!

If the bus torsion bars have the same number of inner and outer splines as 
the sedans, the calculator should work 
correctly(mathematically)....however....all bets for reality are off.

Cheers, dave

 I'm going to add a bit of twist to my torsion bars - 
like 1 notch to compensate for the Corvair drivetrain (75 pounds heavier) 
and 1 more notch to give it some extra suspension height since I tend to tow or carry cargo in the van.
