Subject: Sunroof Questions

Hello again y'all. Well....I didn't get a response last time, so here I
goes again: can anybody with a sliding sunroof bus tell me if there is
anything sandwiched between the aluminum guide rails and their mounts.
When I lay the rails in their respective positions, they do not sit
horizontal, but are tilted slightly up towards the center of the bus. Is
that the correct orientation? Also, does anybody have any leads on used
parts, specifically: one front slider guide and a left side cable?
Thanks, Timo
