Thanks for the suggestions Todd, It is a mechanical fuel pump, near the
engine.  The lines have been replaced, albeit with rubber hoses.  I really
like your suggestion to use steel.  I guess my symptoms would make sense if
air is getting in somewhere.  I'll have to check hoses again.  They're
approximately 4 yrs old.  Could air cause the gas to leak out of the tank
though?  That's a real mystery to me.   What is that small tube coming out
of the bottom of the tank anyway?
