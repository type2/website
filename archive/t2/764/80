It's a universal case. I haven't looked for the holes for the bar
personally, but I'm going to assume "yes" until I find otherwise.

As for Tony's suggestion of a 289... =D

I'm still thinking about a watercooled engine for the 73 when my 1700
gives up the ghost. Since the body is so rotted I don't mind cutting
it up and making it completely non-stock. ;-) Prolly never happen but
it's nice to think about...
