Mark or anyone else,

Has anyone run the crane unit on a stock vacuum advance distributor? According
to the crane website the 700-0226 unit can be used in the bosch 009
distributor, what about the stock distributor? What coil do you use with this
unit, the crane unit or another brand (stock)?

Thanks,
Corbett
