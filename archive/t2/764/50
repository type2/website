Subject: Vaccum advance cutoff

Hi,

Like many others I have a bus which is made up of other buses.

1) 77 body
2) 74 1800 engine
3) 77 trany

I have a new vaccum advance dizzy from cip1 and am trying to figure
out the vaccum advance cut off. Di I have one, did I not? Where should
I be looking, are there any pictures on the web?

Re fitted carbs, pdsit 2/3, will be arriving soon, where does the
retard port connect to?

Charles
