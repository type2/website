and naturally for every bad one there is a PITA owner (me) that has
had zero problems with them. My experience with three units from
Pertronix has been very good. Based on Mark's experience I very well
might go w/ the Crane unit if mine ever gives up the ghost, but for
now I would say that I have been very pleased with the Pertronix. I am
not one of those guys (Dolan) who LIKES setting points. Valves don't
scare me, but I HATE setting points ;)
