Subject: alternate FI controllers

Hi Everyone,

I'm curious if anyone has explored other options of FI controllers for
their bus?

I just came across:  http://www.megasquirt.info/

It has alot of appeal to me b/c I'm a computer geek, but also b/c it's
alot cheaper then replacing the current FI controller on my '79.

Cheers,
Harry
