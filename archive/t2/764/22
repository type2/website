Thanks guys for your feedback. You have me thinking... maybe I do on have
off, low and high.  I'll have to check it when I get the battery back in the
bus... but it is good to know that it is the correct light!

Karl, I check on the part number tomorrow and get back to you - thanks
again.

Have a great week.

From Wayne:

>I've read a number of postings that mention a florescent light in their
Westys.
 I have a '79 Westy and don't have a florescent light - mine has a three
bulb incandescent light fixture with 
a low (one bulb lit), medium (two bulbs lit) and high (three bulbs lit)
switch.   Is this correct for my bus? 
If not, does anyone out there have a correct florescent light that they are
willing to part with?

I am a little puzzled on how you get 1 bulb, 2 bulb, 3 bulbs lit on a 3
position switch?

You should have off, 1 bulb, and 3 bulbs.

Yes, that is the correct light for the 79. Go here:

and click on page 9.

This is the 78 Westy owners manual. I have not seen this bulb unit in a 78,
only 79's. I have a 77 and a 78 
Westy and both have flourescents.

of one of the seat belts in the rear seat.

I believe the one you want is the narrow one?   What is the number on one
you have?  I have an extra one 
around here somewhere.....
