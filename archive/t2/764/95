Personally, I'd swap to a standard-weight flywheel unless the lightened 
one was dynamically balanced to the crank .. this is a *Bus* not a 
racecar and low-end grunt is more important than high RPMs.

Stock pulley can be used; I had a 12.5lb flywheel and stock pulley in my
Bug for years with no problems.  Tried one of the fancy aluminum ones,
went back to stock a few months later when it self-destructed from rubbing
against the filterpump (OEM, not CB)
