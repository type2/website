Hi All!

I need to let go of my 76 High Roof, we have had many fun adventures  
(and a few not so fun :) but I think it is time.  My homeowners  
association is always on the look out for it to go non-operational  
and I have had enough.  I think I will be focusing on the 79 standard  
bus in the garage for a while.

Anyway,  The bus is a 76, has a 79 engine and is in good shape for  
the age.  Couple of oil leaks, etc but over all is working well.  The  
only significant rust is the battery tray (needs a new one).  The  
interior is super nice and it looks good.

I would like to get $3500 for it but I am open to offers/possible  
trades (I'm a sucker for homeless VW's).

Send pmail or give me a call at 970-690-1172

Pictures are available upon request.

Thanks!

Dave Williams
