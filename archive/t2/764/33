Subject: Battery specs: was Chunder in right valve cover - what is it?

Thanks, Bob!

Ultimately,  I'll get a battery with:

1) the proper dimensions so that I can clamp it down
2) the posts on the inboard side of the battery (+ being forward, - 
being aft) so that they're easily accesible

I usually don't have problems cranking in cold weather, but I guess 
that with greater CCA's, there is more reserve should I partially 
discharge the battery whilst camping.

1) What battery (specs) do you use?
2) What battery matches the criteria noted above?
