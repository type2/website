Subject: Re: [T2} Vanagon Intermittent Ignition Problem FIXED!

Thanks for that info Jim, I knew I had seen it somewhere. Lots of good stuff
on that Old Volks website. I got back up to Kohala today and did some more
poking around the Vanagon. I was going to swap the fuel filter as you had
suggested, but some PO has bodged in a huge aftermarket filter [i]after[/i]
the pump with hoses on top of hoses. I will fix that Sunday. I considered
doing the diagnostic of the existing ICU, but swapped in a know good ICU
instead, took it for a long ride, and it seems to have fixed the problem. It's
good to know there are so many other fixes to try should it start acting up
again. Thanks again for your help, you all, Timo
