Spraying carb cleaner increasing the engine revs = vacuum leak!

    > 1. How difficult would it be to remove the carbs and the pipe below it
(is that the intake manifold?) to change the gasket?  It's rather tight, is
that something you have to pull the engine to do?

Do you have a manual? Do you have a good set of tools? I would also take
photos to give you a reference for reassembly. The hardest bit I have found
with the manifolds are the nuts at the bottom. You don't need to pull the
engine to do it.

    > 2. Once, God willing, I fix the leak ... will I have to re-balance the
carbs?

Yes.

   > 3. Is this something a novice like myself should even attempt?

Hard to answer that. I guess it is the only way to learn!
