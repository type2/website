Subject: Differences in pieces to use a 55amp instead of my 70amp alt.?

I'm going to be looking for a spare alt. for my "travel parts" for the summer trips. My 70amp starter is looking like it's made from unobtanium these days, so figured I'd grab a 55amp one off the samba. I need to know what else has to be changed out to use the 55amp when that time comes re: grommets, etc?
Thanks,
Courtney
