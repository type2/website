Aren't we supposed to ask you this kind of question man?
 
I don't know, that Jesmond to Dog Creek section doesn't show on some maps. 
The obvious guy to ask for this, being syncro nut extraordinaire from just up
the road in Quesnel would be David Marshall, I'll lay money he has done it,
and if he has he'll tell you what sort of vehicle it will take.

He might still follow on Vanagon or syncro, but has contact info with email
and skype account names on the contact section of the site above.  Oh for when
there was just one happy list.

This road looks very interesting, apparently all dirt/gravel but quite
passable. Has anyone driven this B.C. backroad?
