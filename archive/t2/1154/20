Subject: Surging at Idle

71 Westfalia, Stock 1600DP, stock dizzy with new dual vacuum unit and I  
just relubed the breaker plate, rebuilt PICT 34 with throttle shafts rebushed 
by  Rimco, all new vacuum & fuel hoses, relatively new manifold boots - soft 
and  pliable, good compression, valves adjusted and adjustment is stable, 
dwell &  timing spot on....what else can I think of?
 
I just tore down the carb and totally cleaned everything of winter crap  
buildup.  
 
Most of the time it idles perfectly at 850 RPM, but  sometimes, seems to be 
always when the engine is fully warmed up, the  idle speed will race up to 
about 1500 or more, hang there for a while, and then  settle back to 850. 
It's did this all last summer, and the summer before, I  think.  My foot never 
touches the pedal - and I loosened up on the throttle  cable adjustment, 
too.  Throttle is not sticking...as far as I can  tell.
 
Don't know what else to do....any suggestions?
 
TIA,
 
Rusty
