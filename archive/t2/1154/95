Subject: Ontario Canada to HCBF ? July 27-31 

Is anyone planning on going to HCBF ? July 27-31 from the Southern Ontario
Canada area?
at this point , I don't think I can make it... it will be very last minute
if we do get away!

I have a T1 beetle engine that I'd like to send to HCBF,, and then Troy
Wical has offered to take it to Denver.  From there.. I still have to find a
ride for it from Denver to Downey Cali.

A few years ago, i put the same style engine on the roof rack luggage
carrier on my 74 westfalia to deliver to North Carolina... and it was a
piece of cake.
