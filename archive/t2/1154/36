I'll be at both as well.  I've been seriously jonesing for a VW fix!

Still no car though.  The Syncro gets finished first, then the crew cab,
then the Chevy, then the Ford!  There is order to all things!!

Howdy Campers!

Who will be headed over to the OCTO show next Saturday?
I'll be there with my 64DD Kamper.
Show flier at:  http://www.octo.org/files/index.php?id=15

I'll also be at The Classic at the Verizon Amphitheater on Sunday June 12.

Chime in, let's see how many listees are going to the shows.
