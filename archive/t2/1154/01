I can personally attest to the how quickly a cam can fail. Mine did,
catastrophically, in less than 20 minutes.

A few months after I bought my '71 high top I was driving South through
Oregon on I-5. It was about 1am in early January and close to 20 degrees
out. After stopping for some coffee near Salem, I was on the road for about
15min when I started losing power. I checked my gauges and the oil was
getting a bit hot, about 220. I slowed down from 65 to 55, held ok there for
about 2 minutes but then the motor took a dive. Started running rough,
losing lots of power. Luckily a weigh station was just ahead and I was able
to coast/crawl into the parking area. I fired it up in the lot, ran back and
peeked into the engine compartment and the motor was not happy, kickin' and
moanin' and garglin', all kinds of fuss. Had a friend nearby so stayed the
night there.

My platinum AAA came in handy for the 50 mile tow to Corvallis the next
morning. Took it to Autowerks, very good VW shop there. Turned out the lobes
on 1 and 3 had entirely disintegrated. Worn clean down to the shaft. No sign
of a lobe at all really. The mechanic who pulled it, a 25 year air cooled
vet, had seen this kind of thing before and attributed it to a poorly
hardened cam. Not knowing the full history of the motor I can't say what
caused it, or where the cam came from. Was running dino 10w-40 at the time I
think.
