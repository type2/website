Subject: Re: [T2] Intake maifold gaskets

Steve - I've always installed the metal gaskets on dry with never a
vacuum leak problem on my ex-73 panel van, but there is a caveat - the
mounting surfaces should be smooth to enable a good seal with the
single-use "crush" metal gasket.  I would use sealer myself.

The 022 129 707 F gasket is really two gaskets with a phenolic block
in-between, thus raising the manifold(s) up.  That plays havoc with
your carb linkage.  This gasket/block is designed for use with ONLY
fuel injection air runners.

Now, with that said, there is a paper/composition gasket made by EMPI
that looks like the 022 129 707 F, but without the phenolic block -
EMPI # 00-3227-0, sold in pairs and are perfect for those who don't
like the original metal gaskets.  About $2.50 a pair, a good buggy
shop probably has 'em on a skinpack card on the wall or can readily
get 'em for you.

> Ratwell, BusBoys and others say that the 2 gaskets between the engine and
the intake maifolds are metal for the dual carb, 1974 1800 engine. But I've
also read that there is a 1 piece gasket made of something else which is
better.  Bus Depot has this 1 piece gasket
(http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=022129707F) but I usually see
it associated with FI engines.
