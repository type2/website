Subject: Exhaust stud

I need to replace an exhaust stud on my '79 westy 2.0L square port.   
The M8 threads holding the heat exchanger to the head are stripped,  
however the threads in the heat itself (I believe they are M9) are fine.
1.  Can someone give me the specifications on this stud?
2.  Where can I purchase these?

Thanks

Tim
'79 Westy
