Tim -

The biggest difference in the 205K distributor and the 80-83 Calif
distributor is the particular Hall Unit installed.  Otherwise the
mechanical timing curve is essentially the same.  The Vacuum Advance
and Retard is very different on any of the 3 models and may make
difference in overall running.  This is probably because of the
temperature dynamics of the Air Cooled verses the Wasserboxer engines.

All used Dual Diaphragm Vacuum Cans.  Only speculating here, but if
you swapped the vacuum cans, it *might* work.

Another thing to consider is that the Vanagon Hall Ignitions are
designed to work in concert with the Fuel Injection ECU, even moreso
on the 1985 model (that's where the phrase "Dijiget" FI comes from)
because of it's inter-connection.
