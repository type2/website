Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Intermittent Ignition Problem

Well, I thank you all for the many informative emails on and off the list,
lots of possibilities to try. I haven't gotten back to the Vanagon yet because
of our mismatched schedules, but I did find a good used wiring harness, ICU
and distributor at a used parts vendor. My question for the day: I know this
is out there, but would it be possible to run this electronic ignition setup
in a 1600cc Bug? I'm not sure if the advance curve and total advance would
work. Does anyone know the specs for a Bosch "Z 415 / 0 237 022 045 / 025 905
205 K"  distributor and if this is the same as the California 80-83 Vanagon?
Also are the 1000 ohm resistor spark plug wires a requirement for this system
to work? The ones in the Vanagon are just stock VW wires without the 90 degree
ends. Thanks, Timo
