Subject: Re: [T2] Seat belts : Drilling a hole through bus

Those mounts are what I was refering to that I installed a vanagon mount tab
in which I attached my rear tether too.  I don't have a passenger bus at hand,
but I don't think those are seatbelt mounts (although the same thread) aren't
they for the post for late rear folding seat?  I sort of worry that they are
very low, I do feel the GoWesty location is better from an angle standpoint
(particularly for an adult) but no doubt this location is much more solid than
the hokey big washer, with the 3 feet of belt running along.  Anyway they
are present in my '77 as well, probably not in the '69 though.  As I'm going
to upgrade the fronts to retractors from Bus Depot, perhaps I'll just play
with a front 3 point mounted back there.

On my 78 camper there are stock seatbelt mounts just under the window behind
the seat on both sides. -Used vw belts from a Dasher?  There is no reel, just
a
pull end of the belt.  I can send pics.
