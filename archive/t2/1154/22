Most of the time it idles perfectly at 850 RPM, but  sometimes, seems to be
always when the engine is fully warmed up, the  idle speed will race up to
about 1500 or more, hang there for a while, and then  settle back to 850.

Just went through this myself.  Turns out it was a vacuum leak - double check
all your hoses, plugs, and seals.
