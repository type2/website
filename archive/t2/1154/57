See that is what I recall was factory in my '90 but it has been so long I
can't swear to it.  I thought some sort of contraption went top to bottom just
behind the seat, which improved the angle for a seated adult, or for that
matter for a carseat.  A child might be safer without a carseat if the low
location is used I almost wonder.

I've seen an adapter used that elevates the belt to mid-window so it has a
better angle when coming across the top of the rear seat.
