Hi John,
         I just received a quote for my '83 westfalia.  Regular insurance
through Geico  $202/6months, $500 deduct, comprehensive, with roadside service
and rental car. $134 for just liability etc.  Seemed like an ok deal to me,
pretty much the same $ as for my DD Toy truck.  I did not ask about "agreed or
stated value" policy.  Perhaps I should.  I too used to use Nationwide before
moving back to AK. jon

Or, why can't I insure the '77 for $200/year for minimal real use???

So on the '77 Westy, now up here in AK, first outing last weekend.  I was
forced to put only liability through my useless regular insurance ($380 for 6
months.)

policy through Horace Mann on a car older than 25 years though.)
