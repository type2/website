Subject: '74 1.8L carbbed, 'dizzy' question

I have a 1.8 L motor in my '74 Westy, and due to an 'interference", between
the 'stock "dizy" and the 'stalk' that I had to implant, for the oil temp, and
oil pressure senders, I will have to 'rotate' the dizzy body with vacuum
advance, to clear,...so I figure, I can move the 'dizzy' body, to clear those
problems, and just 'realign' the position for #1 on the cap, and go from
there, it is just moving the 'dizzy' body, and cap, and bringing #1, to a new
place...yes?
