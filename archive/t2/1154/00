Subject: Re:Removing disintegrated engine seal from heads?

John:

The engine seal on my bus is approximately 6-7 years old and  
disintegrated significantly over the past year in particular - to the  
point where I started losing small sections of it toward the end of  
last season.  In doing some preventative maintenance recently on upper  
gas tank fuel lines, I've had the occasion to have the engine out and  
expose my cylinders/heads so that I could retorque "while I'm there".   
There was absolutely no build-up of engine seal material anywhere in  
sight; not even the oil cooler.  I do have the plastic screen in place  
in front of the fan.

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) the  
last couple of aftermarket engine seals that I've purchased  
deteriorated rather quickly as compared with the original one on my  
bus that lasted 18 years.  My experience is that when they  
deteriorate, the basically disintegrate into small pieces - almost  
like a granular powder.  I suspect that as long as you have a  
reasonably dry engine,  this granular stuff blows right through the  
cooling passages of the engine.  It might build up however if you have  
oil or other gunk that might catch this material and cause it to  
collect.

YMMV
