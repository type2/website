>On pickup, they said the trans was full of loose metal and they put the
plug back and topped it up, claiming it can make the tranny fail faster
if the oil is fully changed. Has anyone heard of this lore? The tranny
does pop out of reverse on a hill and has poor synchro from 3rd to 4th
and seems to be noisy if yolu siyt in the back (I thought it was a CV,
but changed those).

Sounds like BS to me! Did they describe the metal? Colour? Size?
Quantity?

From your description the tranny does not sound good. I wonder though if
any of those conditions could reflect problems in the various linkages
leading from the gearstick back and including in the nose cone?
