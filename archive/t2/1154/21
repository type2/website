That would certainly be the lazy man's way of doing it.  It would be 
much better to pull the intake runners and use high temperature silicone 
on both sides of the spacer to seal it, or with carburetors to just seal 
the runners to the head with silicone, eliminating the gasket entirely.

Is there a reason NOT to do something like that?  I'll ask at the auto parts store but I don't always trust their advice.
