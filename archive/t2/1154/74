OK, I'm (err I was...) an electrician, not an electrical engineer. But,
from what I know, once a generator starts generating it is "self
exciting" and an unregulated DC generator will put out upwards of 3X
it's rated, regulated, output voltage. That means your 12 Volt
generator can put out up to 36 volts at the D+ and that's just fine. It
is the job of the regulator to use the reference voltage to control the
size of the magnetic field and reduce the output to acceptable levels.
A bit like he wall-wart you use to charge your cell phone -- there's
120VAC going into that little brick but only about 5VDC coming out.

Did you test it with your old regulator installed?

That being said. I am almost 100% certain that the regulator the FLAPS
sold you is a 30 amp regulator for a beetle generator. If your wife's
camper has it's original generator then it is a *38* amp generator. If
the new battery wasn't FULLY charged plus you were running other things
like lights, etc then you may have been pulling over 30 amps through
the regulator and toasted it. I have searched EVERYWHERE for a *new* 38
amp regulator for my '70 Campmobile to put on the shelf as a spare. No
luck so far. I have a spare 38 amp bus-only generator I picked up at a
swap but no regulator. I am currently investigating what is required to
build one. Size and location of the coils in an electromechanical
regulator appears to be critical to keep them Henrys from talking to
each other.
