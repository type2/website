VW went to a large canister filter after the pump on their newer 
Vanagons.  This system gives far fewer problems than the earlier system 
with the undersized cube filter.  Figure out what the PO did and neaten 
it up so that it is the same as later Vanagon and leave the little 
prefilter out unless you have a tank that is a rust bucket.  If the tank 
is a mess then you will save yourself many headaches by replacing the 
tank with a later model one in good condition.
