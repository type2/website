Subject: 195R14 tires instead of 185R14 on a 1983 camper !!!

Hi guys,
I would like your opinion about putting 195R14 tires on my van (vanagon 
1983 camper) instead of 185R14.
I urgently need to replace the front tire (was lucky to be alive from 
Yosemite with such a tire actually!) Somebody proposed me two pairs of 
195R14.   would it be OK to mix 195R15 tires in the front and my "great 
new" agilis 81 in the back ? What about the 4 tires being 195R14, 
downside upside ?

Thanks for any help

Chris
