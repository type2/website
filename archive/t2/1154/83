Subject: Generator stumping issue - Complete message

Allright, I have been told that it is not possible for the generator on the wife's 70 westy to put out enough voltage to fry regulators...HOWEVER, I am telling you all that I have run the following test for maximum output multiple times with the same results (I even tested another bus to make sure I was doing the test right, and those reults were fine).... AFter working perfectly in the bus for 2 years, this generator is generating up to 60 VOLTS AT IDLE AND 100 VOLTS AT HIGH RPMS!!  Has anyone EVER heard of this issue happening before and why???
Here's the test I ran:

Check the Maximum Voltage of the Generator -


Disconnect the generator from the regulator (both the DF and D+ wires).


Use a jumper lead to connect DF to the generator frame (grounding the DF connection).


Now start the engine and test the voltage between D+ and the generator frame.


The voltage should increase with rpm up to about 35 volts (20 volts or so for the 6-volt generator).


If the generator passes this test, it's working okay.






PEACE!
