Subject: Re: [T2] 195R14 tires instead of 185R14 on a 1983 camper !!!

I just took a set of 195R14 Nokian CQs off. With them on, the speedo  
was about 1% slow. The odometer was about 4% slow. I went back to  
185R14 Nokian CSs. Van feels a touch more stable, but I'd not hesitate  
to run the 195s again. (Anyone have one or two 195R14 Hakkapeliitta  
CQs that they want to part with?)
