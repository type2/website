Subject: Re: [T2] Phosphoric acid

Autozone had it when I left, but that 5 years ago, no Autozone in AK.  Was in
the paint prep section as "metal etch or prep or converter" in 1 qt bottles,
when you read it was phosphoric acid.  Price was better (about half) than in
an auto paint supply store which is the other alternative that comes to
mind.  Naval jelley is a fine option, I like it in places actually but the
carrier can leave a sticky residue.

spray Rust Bullet in this area. I'll attend to the same problems as I work
forward. Does anyone know were I can find phosphoric acid locally? I checked
