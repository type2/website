The battery in my wife's 70 Westy has gone dead twice.  So I am troubleshooting the charging system.  WHen I hook up the voltmeter with engine OFF I get 12.8 volts. OK. Then at idle I get 13.5-14.5 volts, that seems a bit too high, right!? Then, when I rev-up the engine I am expecting this reading to go even a little higher,,,,but the reading actually decreases to 12.5-12.6 with the engine revving....WTF!?! That ain't right!

So.... Does this sound like a regulator issue or maybe even a funky battery...or both?!

PEACE!
