Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust stud

Scott (-at-) German Supply said on the list a few months ago he had 'em.
But a recent look at his page shows he's out of stock.  I've tried
getting more from Europe, but it's no go for now.  When I queried the
manufacturer, they said sure, we'll make 'em, but ya gotta buy 100,000
pieces, otherwise they weren't interested because of slow sales
movement on them.  I didn't stick around

(copy and paste if url is too long)

I'm working on having them reproduced elsewhere.  ETA Unknown.
