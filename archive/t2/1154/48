Subject: Re: [T2] Seat belts : Drilling a hole through bus

Hi John and Greg,

Not exactly what was requested, but I'll probably try these folks if I buy
newish:  http://www.mtmfg.com/vw/1306/Volkswagen-Bus-Vanagon-Seat-Belts

Wolfsburg West also has some VW-specific.

These folks - http://www.gotbelts.com/ - also have aftermarket products not
specific to individual year/ make/ model vehicles.

Spent a fair amount of time reading on this recently, and just added a rear
belt for a child in a booster seat, using a Vanagon inertia reel, and the
threaded, reinforced mount already present in my 79 (perhaps not present in
Greg's 69). Should work fine for an adult as well. There seems to be valid
concern for the GoWesty anchor, but as John mentioned, it seems less a
concern for child-sized weights. Otherwise, there are some clever ideas out
there (and on Samba) for ways around mounting to that non-reinforced metal,
but they aren't as simple as that placement.

Cheers, Mike
