Subject: loose metal in 38K tranny rebuild + loose ball joints.

38K miles ago I had an ex-VW Mechanic in Northern NJ rebuild  my 
250,000mi engine, put in new ball joints, brakes, swing lever bushing, 
etc.  and he gave the trans to a local rebuilder.  Now when I had a 
reputable shop replace the noncharging alternator I asked them to change 
the trans oil.  On pickup, they said the trans was full of loose metal 
and they put the plug back and topped it up, claiming it can make the 
tranny fail faster if the oil is fully changed.  Has anyone heard of 
this lore?  The tranny does pop out of reverse on a hill and has poor 
synchro from 3rd to 4th and seems to be noisy if yolu siyt in the back 
(I thought it was a CV, but changed those).
    Re the ball joints, they have play (sounds  loose going over bumps) 
and the swing lever does go up and down when wheel is turned back and 
forth.  When front is lifted, the steering seems tight (resistant). 
Should these problems arise in only 38K miles?
