Subject: Re: [VB] Collector Car Insurance on Westy (for real use.)

I was told by Hagerty that they do not insure vehicles with built-in  
stoves. A '77 Westy most likely has a stove and even a propane  
cooler. I've used Hagerty for some time now and all has gone ok so  
far. I have not made any claims and my drivers record is good. I  
hardly ever drive the vehicles I have insured with them. You also  
need to have a "normal" car with regular insurance as a daily  
driver.  I have a friend in the Phoenix area who tried to get  
collector's insurance on her '66 bus (not from Hagerty) and was  
denied. She said that she had a garage for storage and the company  
sent somebody out and discovered that there was only a driveway for  
parking....

Good luck!  Gary
