Subject: "Seal" vacuum leak with ... sealant?

Rather than take off the intake manifold to replace the gasket that I think is the source of my vacuum leak, I was thinking that maybe I could run a bead of some sort of sealant along the seam.  Is there a reason NOT to do something like that?  I'll ask at the auto parts store but I don't always trust their advice.

Thanks
