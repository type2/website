Yeah, I was a real Einstein on that one, mumble mumble.

Unfortunately not.  The wear is on the nose, where there is pressure applied
(the cam lifting the valve against the valve spring) not on the heel at the
base circle where you are adjusting the lifters, you will "never" see any 
cam
wear there (well not unless things have gone very, very awry.)  The only way
to assess would be to assess valve lift with a dial indicator if you knew
accurately the baseline, and follow it over time or compare between
cylinders.  Or as I've said many times over the years, pull the lifters and
have a look the next time you re-seal your push-rod tubes, gross wear will 
be
obvious, but hopefully not until you got 125k+ on the thing, or even 
150-175k
if in a light non Westy bus if you have been good with maintenance and 
lucky.

Those of us with solid lifter should see a lot of valve adjustment if our
cams are wearing.
