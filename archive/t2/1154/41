I have found the navel jelly works well, but if it dries out, it quits
working. What I do is first wore brush the area really well. then I apply the
navel jelly. Next I put a layer of plastic wrap over it. It won't disolve the
plastic so dont worry. It will keep it wet longer. I usually let it set over
night then remove the plastic and wire brush it again. That works really well
for me. I don't know where to get plain phosphoric acid.,
Take care,

 Naval jelley is a fine option, I like it in places actually but the
carrier can leave a sticky residue.
