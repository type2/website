I see what you are saying, John. That's why I get as much as I can off
before treatment. Where rust is hard to eliminate 100% is in pitting.

What I hate even about Rust Bullet is that they are so proprietary
that their literature really tells you nothing about the chemistry,
but having a degree in chemistry myself, I can read between the lines
and see what they are saying that is different from the others.

Rust Bullet is also used by the US Navy and has a mil spec. Of course,
so does Slick 50, so I guess that means you can't always put too much
weight on mil spec equipment. But our local Rust Bullet distributor is
a former Canadian navy corrosion control officer and I trust him, so
I'm decided this is my product of choice for now.
