This is one place where you can do a little tuning.  Where do you live 
and how hot does it get?  Conversely, what are the coldest temperatures 
you will commonly drive in?

The metal gaskets, or no gaskets and just silicone let far more heat up 
into the manifolds than do the insulating phenolic gaskets used with 
fuel injection.  The hotter the conditions you drive in the less heat 
you need and want getting to your carbs.

But I've also read that there is a 1 piece gasket made of something else which is better.  Bus Depot has this 1 piece gasket (http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=022129707F) but I usually see it associated with FI engines.
