Subject: Phosphoric acid

Hi all,

I'm starting to prepare the engine compartment for paint. I am planning to
wire wheel as much rust, scale and loose paint as I can and go over these
areas with phosphoric acid. Once I take care of the rust, I'm planning to
spray Rust Bullet in this area. I'll attend to the same problems as I work
forward. Does anyone know were I can find phosphoric acid locally? I checked
the local Home Depot and Lowes and they don't carry it. I bought some Navy
Jelly to tide myself over as I don't want to stop what I'm doing cus' I'm on
a roll.

Bob
