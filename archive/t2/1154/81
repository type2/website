Subject: Is everybody stumped with my Gen issue?!?!?

Allright, I have been told that it is not possible for the generator on the wife's 70 westy to put out enough voltage to fry regulators...HOWEVER, I am telling you all that I have run the following test for maximum output multiple times with the same results.... AFter working perfectly in the bus for 2 years, this generator is generating up to 60 volts at idle and 100 volts at
PEACE!
