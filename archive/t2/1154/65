it is true..  you should get lots of milage out of that oil..

I have experienced oil that foams,, and blows out the input shaft seal.
this can happen, and usually does happen in the first 100miles..
... oil that is slippery on the yellow metals ,, and wears them rapidly...
and this can happen in less than 10k miles

this was the thread recently,, Re: [T2] brand name of 80/90 to use

you need to specify what "metal" is loose... is it gold flaky sparkles
stuff.... or silver sparkles ,, or pieces of a gear,, and ball bearings,,,
