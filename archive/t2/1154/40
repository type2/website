Subject: Seat belts : Drilling a hole through bus

Hi All,

68 VW Riviera.

I am updating the rear seat, side seat belts from lap belt to 3-point harness.
I bought the kits from GoWesty some time ago.

I am getting to the point of having to drill the holes for the mounting of the
retracting units.  They go behind the side windows, and need a 7/16" hole
drilled through the bus in the side scoop air vent area.

There are pictures of installed item on a Bus on GoWesty website

You have to scroll down to the bottom of the page.

I'm looking for opinions on how to go about drilling the holes.  From inside?
Outside?  I plan to do a small pilot hole first, and then go bigger.

Other thoughts?

Thanks,
Greg
