Hi Martin,

You can actually do that provided you rinse the syrup off when you are
finished. A high school teacher used to tell of a chem lab experiment
putting rusty nails in Coke to demonstrate the acid effect to
discourage the kids from drinking it.

But that's carbonic acid, not phosphoric acid. So while it will do in
a pinch on a non-critical component you might want to clean before
putting it on, and you don't want to take the time out to go buy acid,
you won't get far on body rust.
