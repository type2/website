Subject: Intake maifold gaskets

OK, last question hopefully before I take off the intake maifold to fix the vacuum leak.

Ratwell, BusBoys and others say that the 2 gaskets between the engine and the intake maifolds are metal for the dual carb, 1974 1800 engine. But I've also read that there is a 1 piece gasket made of something else which is better.  Bus Depot has this 1 piece gasket (http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=022129707F) but I usually see it associated with FI engines.  

If I use the crush metal gaskets, could I put some silicone or something around the outer edges to get a better seal?
