Subject: Prying off the Intake Manifol Spacer

The '75 1800 FI has a spacer (aprox 1/4") between the intake manifold and the head.  Talking with Jim on the list, I have decided that though I have a '74 bus, I think I have a '75 FI engine running dual carbs.  Engine number is AW033868

I am going to replace the spacer and the gaskets to fix a vacuum leak. Before I do, I would like to ask if the '74 1800 w/ carbs have a "lip" on the head where the intake manifold connects?  Here's a picture: http://www.strengths.com/Intake_Gasket.jpg

The thing is stuck pretty good and I would really hate to pry the thing off if its actually part of the dang engine :)

Thanks for any help.

Steve
