Probably rather regional.  If your HD/Lowes doesn't have real TSP, and your
dishwashing detergent is worthless phosphate free crap that can't clean
anything, I'll bet it is hard to find something evil like phosphoric acid on a
store shelf.  This less you do something evil like let it run off down a drain
with some water to enhance the growth of some small green micro-organism. 
Both the TSP and good ole dishwashing detergent with hot water are of course
great de-rusting agents for small parts.  Here in AK I can still get TSP, but
alas all our dishwashing detergent is imported through Washington state, where
people do border runs into Oregon to get something capable of washing dishes.

That's crazy.  I recently bought a gallon at my local Home Depot.  It is
called Phosporus Prep & Etch by Kleen-Strip.
