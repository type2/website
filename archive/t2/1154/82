Subject: High Country Bus Festival, July 27-31

There are only 46 days until the fifthteenth anniversary of High  
Country Bus Festival. Come camp with fellow bus lovers, enjoy the  
camaraderie, the New River and the music at Twin Rivers Family  
Campground in Crumpler North Carolina. Information can be found at http://www.highcountrybusfestival.com 
.
We have a very nice T-shirt this year for the anniversary. It's best  
to pre-order and information and the pictures for the design can be  
found at http://www.highcountrybusfestival.com/TShirts.html.  Hope to  
see you the last weekend in July!
