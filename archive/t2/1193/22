As Charles Kettering said, "Parts left out cost nothing and have an  
infinite service life."

VW went to all the effort and spent all that money to design and  
install a rear engine mount for the upright (and follow ons) in a bay  
bus.  I suspect that they and their engineers believed it was  
necessary. They were even able to convince the finance folks to pay  
for it. You think what you want. Engineering says it's necessary.
