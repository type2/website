Richard - I'd start to be very worried about this motor - if someone 
blocked off the original oil pressure sender port, as seems to be the 
case, I'd really really really wonder about what else they've done to it. 
Like run it with low oil pressure.....

Grab a can of brake parts cleaner and spray down in the hole - see if you 
can blast away the grime - it's possible there's a plug in the hole, and 
all you need to do is figure out the right tool (probably an allen key, 
preferably on a socket) to pull it out.

It doesn't look welded up - at worst it's maybe jbweld or something.   But 
I personally wouldn't want to run it any more until I'd spit the case to 
figure out what else has been monkeyed with......


So what's the story?  How long have you had the bus+motor?  Have you been 
driving it this way, and just got tired of looking at the light? :)
