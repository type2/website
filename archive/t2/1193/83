Subject: Re: [T2] Shifter rod rebuild - out the front ?

Mornin' Michael,

At least on the later Bays (and to the best of my knowledge) it can only be
done by removing the tranny. The aft end of the rod bends slightly and has
a barrel at the end for attaching the shift coupler, making it difficult/
impossible to get forward through the housing where the bushings are at
work.

Otherwise, a pretty simple repair; I just did all 3 bushings, coupler, and
added the grommet I was missing. I imagine it will shift smoothly if I ever
get an engine in...!  Mike
