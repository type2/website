Basically just a rebuild of the jump seat and sink/icebox to get a
slightly taller storage area underneath for the batteries. Plus delete
the icebox and turn that space under the sink into a liquor/storage
cabinet.

I haven't taken many photos since I was doing the cleanup and haven't
indexed the ones I have taken. So the last ones I took were in 2011 when
I mounted the bumper hoops to carry my 1973 Honda CT-90 on trips.

All of the pics I've posted up since I bought it:
