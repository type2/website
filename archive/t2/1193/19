There's a BIG difference. The splits had swing axles, which sort of held
everything in alignment. With a Bay, the CV axles allow all kinds of swinging
motion. I did this conversion to my 77 Kombi and watched the engine trough the
upper access door while going through turns ( a friend was driving). The
engine had LOTS of movement left and right. Kind of scary thinking how it
might break off and the consequences thereof... What I did was mount a 68-70
mustache bar to the engine, and had some plates welded to the stock later
style mounting plate so I could use the stock rubber mounts for the mustache
bar. Works like a champ for may years now. Someone mentioned it, but I'll sa y
again. You'll need to shorten the trans input shaft by about 1/2" If anyone
wants, I can take some photos of my mounts and post them. Hope this helps,
