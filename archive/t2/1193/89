Subject: Re: [T2] Bus count (remote control bus)

I have one of those and the kids and I have a great time with it.  Got it as a
gift a few years ago (maybe 4) and can tell you the person who gave it to me
would never have spent that much on me.  Maybe you can find a generic
controller for it at an RC hobby shop.

Forgot that while
visiting SIL I  got a Maisto/Audiobahn bus 1:10 scale at a family used shop
for $3-no remote but supposed to be radio controlled and it does play mp3's or
cassette player and has lights. Gouging price on Amazon for new is $198!!
Supposed to be $75 list, one seller has it for $54  Before that my "biggest"
model was the cookie jar bus.
