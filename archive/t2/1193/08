hmm,, I am going to guess you mean a rear engine support... as in near the oil
pump, or fan pully..
the front engine support is actually the transmission hanger above, and the
nosecone of the trans..
remember that the front of the vehicle is the front ... when  you are looking
at the engine thru the hatch.. that is the rear of the engine..

you don't NEED a rear hanger, engine support, but some folks have had bad
experience with things breaking... so it may save you having an engine fall
out on the road one day... altho imho, that must be pretty rare!

it isn't tooo hard to put a support in place,,  I have seen chains and
turnbuckles used,, from above... I have seen the original T4 bar with a sponge
hockey puck shimmed in between it and the bottom of the engine case .. held in
place with cable ties... just to give a little extra support
