At the moment I'm rather thin with just the '69 SC and the '77 Westy.  There
is a derelict '87 Syncro shed sitting in the yard but I don't think it counts,
although I could probably get it to run if I had to if my life depended on it.

Hello Volks!

An interesting question just occurred
to me:

How many of you have more than one bus, and if so, how many do you
have?

As for me: I have a '71 and a '67...
