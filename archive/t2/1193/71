Forgot that while visiting SIL I  got a Maisto/Audiobahn bus 1:10 scale 
at a family used shop for $3-no remote but supposed to be radio 
controlled and it does play mp3's or cassette player and has lights. 
Gouging price on Amazon for new is $198!! Supposed to be $75 list, one 
seller has it for $54  Before that my "biggest" model was the cookie jar 
bus.
