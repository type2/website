I love Jay Leno's Garage. I have an older WinXP computer hooked to our 
TV and run Easy Peasy Linux on the computer.

Allows me to get "like new" performance out of this old computer (no 
antivirus required) and we get to watch all those cool old cars. If I 
were rich that is what I'd do with my money... ;)

Well, time to order new U-joints for my CR-V. MAYBE I'll get to work on 
the Westy this afternoon.
