'70 Westy Custom cabinets to hide the 4 aux batteries. 3rd owner. Daily
driver. Rusted out under the windscreen, bad rust in driver floor, both
battery tray areas at rear rusted through. 1600 SP with a MSD 6A (6200)
providing fire.

'73 Riviera lots of rust. Messed up right rear spring plate from losing
an axle nut/wheel while towing. Might measure to see if the Riviera top
will transplant to the '70 cleanly. 10 year old Raby engine with about
1000 miles on it is hanging in the bay. It will be moved to the '74.

'74 Kombi. Stripped for restore. One small patch of rust in the
passenger floor, otherwise good.

'66 beetle. lowered. Adjustable front beam. Busted transaxle nose cone
mount.

'69 beetle that is bending in the middle from rusted out heater
channels. Have owned it since '96 and drove the snot out of it. Body
will be scrapped and the ...

'74(?3?) Bradley GT body will go on the '69 frame
