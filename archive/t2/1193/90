Subject: Oil pressure switch options

I have a 74 Auto Westy with a 1800 in it.   This a original very low mileage
bus.  Everything appears, to never have been touched, but that could be
deceiving.
 The place where the oil pressure switch should go isn't drilled out.  I need
to have a oil pressure switch.  I don't want to tear down the engine to drill
and tap it.  What else could I do to be able to read oil pressure?

Thanks!

Richard
