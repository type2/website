Subject: Re: [T2] rear engine support bracket

OK, here's a couple pics of the modified mount bracket and engine tin. I
actually used some original pieces cut off an early Bay to save fabrication
time, and had them welded to the stock body brackets that were on my 77 Kombi.
The engine tin is a threshold plate from an early Bay with everything hanging
underneath it removed, so just the top tin remained. I didn't want to cut the
plate with the VIN # off the body, so I cut a vertical notch in it and folded
it down so the early threshold plate would fit. While there are a couple
pieces of galvanized tin used to fill the gap next to the valve covers, but I
didn't use the front tin above the flywheel. It gets a bit dusty over time,
but the engine runs very cool with this arrangement. Also note: if you need a
vacuum takeoff for the power assist brakes: I used one of the spacers
available for replacing the governor on 1600cc motors, and drilled and tapped
it for a pipe fitting, see photo. Hope this helps, Timo not sure if these
photos will show up here, if not just go to my pbase acct and view them there:
