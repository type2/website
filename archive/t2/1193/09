If you're hanging a type1 upright in a bus built for a type4 engine, don't 
kid yourself - you're rigging things. ;)

Yes - you should use a universal or bus engine case w/ bosses for a rear 
support bar, and you'll need to fabricate a support - starting with a 
68-71 rear hanger would probably be a good start.

You -can- just let it hang by the rear (FIF) transmission support bracket 
- but that's definitely been known to crack or break bellhousings in the 
long haul.

Don't forget all of the sheetmetal and heater box hookups you'll have to 
rig as well.

FWIW.
