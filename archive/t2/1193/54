Subject: Old VW Engine Parts: Scrap?

Hey Volks,

I'm spending the day cleaning out my garage and I find that I have more 
VW engine parts than I'll ever use: used heads, old crankshafts, brake 
drums, etc.

Is this stuff worth anything to the community, or are there so many of 
these out there that they're just scrap metal at this point?

I mean, I hate to scrap it if it's useful (and I'm keeping all the 
fasteners for that very reason), but an old case that's probably been 
align bored twice, or single port heads that need to be completely 
rebuilt just seem like they're going to waste here when I have a half 
dozen refurb'd heads sitting in a box already..

Thoughts?

Cheers,
