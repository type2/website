Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure switch options

too bad it wasn't a hi-rez picture,, but it sure looks like someone plugged 
the factory port..
it can be fixed in place,,
i have drilled cases before with no issues,, use a vacuum with a small hose 
attached to get all the drill cuttings,
then I put a foam ear plug in the hole while I use the tap to cut the 
threads,,
when you pull the foam out, it cleans the hole very well...
question remains,,, what size to tap it to.. probably oversize, then install 
a reducer...
 or,, leave it .. and put a oil filter adapter on for a remote cooler.. and 
put the pressure switch in that ..
