Re:- log book,

 

I just use a small spiral bound pad I keep under the dash. I'm on my 2nd one
now, and have started taking notes on activities more than just
maintenance/fuel stuff. It is interesting to look back, to remember the
places you go, and what you do in your vehicle. My wife says there must be
an app for that, but I like the paper log. It never runs out of batteries,
and when the bus leaks-the ink runs, but I can still sort of read it.
