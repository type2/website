Yeah.  No offense, but that's just not possible.  That would mean the bus

Sounds like you're looking in the wrong place.  Pics of where you think it

It should be, if my 16+ year old memories are right, to the drivers side 
of the distributor down in a hole in the tinwork.  with a wire attached.  and a grommet around 
it.
