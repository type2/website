I've seen a "T4" engine bus that had gone for years with a 1600 upright
hanging off the tranny, with bug tin of course, don't want to be sloppy...  I
bought it for parts and the kid I got it from had driven it 15000 miles by his
report that way.  You could take exhaust valve tips and rock them back about
3/16" WITH THE SPRINGS in place.  The guides were that worn.  But it amazingly
hadn't dropped a valve, and still had enough compression to start and guts for
me to drive it home 45 miles to strip it for it's mint interior.
 
I'm not
saying it was smart, or practical, but it was there.

I.ve seen a T4 *with* the hanger bar break off at the trans.. but I have seen
buses that only drive a short distance.. with no hanger bar, and no tin or
seals go for years... YMMV
