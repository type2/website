Subject: Bus Count (also F/S)

1 and counting down. I have been driving a bus as a daily driver for over
20 years. First one, a '71 passenger bus, lasted 14 years before getting
tagged from the side by a car failing to yield causing the bus to lay down
on her side and slide 100ft. Replaced a couple months later with a '71
non-poptop Westy also my daily driver for the last 8 years until last week.

I have anguished for months about keeping my bus hobby but decided I have
higher priorities on the use of my time (as I have gotten older, time has
become more valuable). I purchased a new Tacoma and I'm getting rid of the
bus and all related parts and tools.

So in a few weeks I will put up my daily driver '71 non-poptop Westy for
sale. Lots of rust (live on the coast), body rough, needs ball joints/tie
rods but I also include a low mileage rebuilt front beam ready to install,
needs muffler, calipers, new German master cyl already installed. Engine
solid, 30k on a professional rebuild, full flow filter / external cooler
with thermostatic bypass valve plumbed with all SS crimped hoses, extended
pushrods tubes (no more losing oil pressure on those long curving freeway
on ramps), sand seal, otherwise stock. Alternator, distributor and
5 Hankook tires about a year old.

Also includes an engine stand, other specialized VW tools. Lots of
uninstalled new parts and spares including a extra tranny (works but pops
out of 4th). Basically a complete VW bus hobby for sale. I'm starting at
$2K for everything. It will officially go on sale in a week or so after I
gather everything up. Located in Oceanside, CA. If you're serious I can
reached at type2(at)rayh.com.

I'll miss the VW community. I had some great times, met some great people
and enjoyed being a standout while driving down the road.
