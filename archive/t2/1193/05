I'm with Kevin. I look back at trips we wrote about in the book, and it
spurs memories that would have been lost. Had to start a new one when I got
married as my wife didn't like seeing all the trip reports written by old
girlfriends. Been doing it since '95. My bus is patiently awaiting me to
put her back together after a complete round of body work and a new paint
job. My son is one, so time is limited, but hopefully I'll be ready to camp
with him in a couple of years. That will be a whole new logbook...
