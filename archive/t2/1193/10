VW did it with proper mounting hardware and transmissions geared 
appropriately.  In a US market bus, it's still a hack.   If you have to 
ask if you should still have a front (...or rear) mount, you're obviously 
not using the factory parts.

Don't forget about transmission input shaft length issues - after 
somewhere around '76 it's not just a bolt-on to the trans.
