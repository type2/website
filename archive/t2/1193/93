None taken.  I agree it's not right, the reason I'm trying to fix it.

I'm trying to post a pic.  The pic angle, really looks like it's filled with
something.

In any case, I have the same problem.

I could be completely wrong, which would make me over joyed.  That way it
could be a easy fix.

I'm still working on posting a pic.  Online that I can link to.  I've never
done that before, so may take me a few minutes.
