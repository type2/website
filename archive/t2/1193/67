Black edging: AutoZone. Generic door edging.

Color: Those are actually just "templates" (that I've been using for 3+
years LOL). I slapped them together in a few days and have never even
put polyurethane on them (I urethaned the floor). I plan to re do
everything when I can get some of the rust repaired. It being my daily
driver makes it difficult. I'm looking at getting the '66 Beetle back
on the road this coming year to somewhat alleviate that problem. My dog
won't be too happy about that though. {grin}

Also, the side panels and headliner are done in the same Baltic birch.

The Z-bed I just did with a piece of plywood for now (the original
front was water trashed). I plan to re do it with Cedar later. There
are 2 10" subs in  box under that seat.

I'm planning to build a new side cabinet out of he same wood. I'm
thinking about dropping it low enough to clear the back window and
maybe build a mirror cabinet on the other side to get the storage space
back. If I do that I'll have to shorten the Z-bed to fit between the
cabinets.
