Subject: Shifter rod rebuild - out the front ?

Has anyone removed and rebuilt the shifting rod (all the way to the tranny)
without removing the transmission ? Can it be removed out the front ? Or taken
out and reinstalled in pieces underneath ? I checked the Samba for hours with
no luck on a article or blog
