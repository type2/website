I'd just use a spreadsheet with columns for each kind of data that you 
need to record.

LibreOffice-Calc can do it for free.

So can Gnumeric (also very free).

You might also setup a data base in LibreOffice-Base too.

Naturally you can search for tutorials on your favorite search engine. 
Look for "libreoffice calc tutorials" or "gnumeric tutorials".

I don't think I'd try to weld your part. I'd just replace it. I suspect 
the part is cheap used b/c pedals just aren't sexy enough to rescue 
before the car is crushed. As I recall the part is aluminum and 
personally I've not had good luck having anything aluminum welded and 
last. I do some aluminum welding TIG and MIG spoolgun too.
