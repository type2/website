Hi Kevin,
   The 5 watt ones can be left on all the time but may not work as well in NY
as they do in CA.  I use a package from your neck of the woods, bigger and
more expensive for sure, but I also use it to keep my batteries up when
camping for extended periods so I don't have to run the engine.  I really like
the pulse chargers for keeping batteries de-sulphated.  YMMV.

http://batteryminders.com/details.php?prod=SCC-015-AA-S3  Price is better from
other sources, e.e Northern Supply, but if you call them they will give you a
deal.  Alternately one can buy just the charge controller from them, and any
panel up to 180w from other places.  I ended up buying this package as it
fits, in its shipping box, in the empty space behind my upper folded
mattress.  Small panels are priced much higher per watt than the larger
house-size ones.

Sometimes you can get the small 5w ones from vehicle importers.  They use them
to keep the batteries up in the huge parking lots while the vehicles wait to
be sent to the dealers.
