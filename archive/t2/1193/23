Subject: A Xmas Gift from the late Bob Hoover

Many years ago, we had a storyteller in the VW community. You may have
heard of him. Bob Hoover (no, not the airplane guy. The other one.)
Bob could really spin a tale.  He also was reasonably knowledgeable in
things mechanical. If you are inclined, you can read a bunch of his
stuff here:

Every December for over a decade, I would write Bob and ask his
permission to repost the following. It got to the point where he would
send permission before I remembered that it was time to ask.  (Really,
the asking was just a chance to catch up a bit. Bob lived in the part
of the world that I call "home" and we'd been chatting with one
another since he got stuck in the north country one Fall.) We lost Bob
to multiple myeloma a couple of years ago. I cant ask anymore.  I
miss that.

I never had his permission to publish it anywhere but on the
WetWesties mailing list, but I dont think Bob would mind that I
pointed you to his blog.

Go read the story.  Read it aloud to your kids.  They WILL remember.

A Xmas Gift from Bob Hoover:

Thanks Bob.



Merry Christmas my friends.
