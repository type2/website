Only one here, a 1972 Westfalia Pop-top that I bought on 25 August 1988 in
Indianapolis, IN when I was stationed at Fort Benjamin Harrison.  It's been
with me for my last three duty assignments and subsequent retirement.

Where it is snowing right now.  Snowing in Minnesota in the winter.  Big
surprise, eh?
