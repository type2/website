Subject: Re: [T2] FART - Spray cans of Paint

Wolfsburg West. But it's not cheap.

Some paint shops will mix cans of spray paint for you as well.

Personally, I'm currently more interested in REMOVING spray paint. The
71 I just got had the Neptune Blue paint covered in flat black spray
paint. Ugh. I've tried a couple things with no results so the next
thing to try is oven cleaner and a green weenie. =)
