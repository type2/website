Subject: RE: [T2] new engine update

Congratulations, Sam!  Exciting times!  I just spoke with AVP Worldwide
this morning, and my new 2.0L is shipping out from Sacramento this
afternoon or tomorrow morning, so I will have it next Tuesday or
Wednesday (ordered on 4/19).  Will be starting the project on Saturday
5/14.  I got the stock setup (non-hydraulic lifters) for my '76, but
part of me is wishing I had gone with hydraulics.  Oh well, just another
opportunity for me to become intimately familiar with the bus. ;)

I'm now busy putting together a checklist of all the tools, new parts,
supplies, etc., that I'll need for the swap.  Anybody have suggestions
for us swappers - obscure items that one might not think of whenever
installing that new engine?  (need some content for this slow list day!)

Thanks all, and good luck with yours, Sam!

Hey all well this afternoon (thrusday) after alot of
phone calls and thinking i made the call to Bob at
Boston engines. He is going to make me a long block
engine a 2.0L fuel infected engine. The only thing
different it is going to have hydralic lifters the
wait he said is going to be 30 days but i am willing
to wait that long because i heard of his reputation is incredible. Well
i will let the list know more information when it comes in take care to
all and happy driving.
