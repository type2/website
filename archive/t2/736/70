Subject: Power Loss - Might be fixed!!!

I tightened the housing screws on the fuel pump. No more leaks. (Did
that a while ago, forgot to post.) But still having power problems.

I tested the coil and the resistance values match the Bentley. Swapped
in Mallory (with a ballast resistor), still having power problems.

Started pulling plug wires again. Wait! #1 made no difference! How did
I miss that before?

I pull #1 plug, and there's blackening around the body of the plug.
Crap. I obviously didn't seat it properly when I last messed with it.
Clean, regap, reinstall. Pull the wire apart to check for corrosion
(FRIGGING BOSCH CRAP WIRES!!!) Yep. Corroded wire at the bakelite
boot. Snipped off corrosion, greased and reinstalled. I'm completely
unimpressed with the Bosch wires. Less than a year old, gray jacket
yellow insulator bought new from Autozone. I emailed Bosch and they
told me to call their warranty phone number. Grrr....

Test drive and all KINDS of power! Like when I first got the carbs
dialed in sort of a long time ago.

Also, I discussed this over on the samba, I replaced the electric air
valve on the left carb. The flat one. Idle is MUCH smoother since I
did that. I still wish I knew WTF it did, when it did it, and why it
did it. But it works, so I'll leave well enough alone. =)
