Subject: Pics of Nyssa's 75 bus/Westy

I see that the second generation vw bus owner (high school, now first 
year in art college) in the family posted pics of the 75 on her site, 
before and after painting-includes the poster painting all were invited 
to, the engine with trans drop on a motorcycle jack, and its final 
rebirth as a white bus/hardtop Westy. Nifty pics of her dash adornment.

\I like the pic of the bus dwarfed in the RV lot at Disneyworld- yes you 
get to park up close if you are an RV!
