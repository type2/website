Subject: 71 bus steering strangeness

Hello,

Harder to turn left than right.  Both
wheels spin freely when front end is
off ground (it isn't a brake problem)

When turning tight corners, either
direction, I reach a certain point
in turning the steering wheel, and
there is a "give point".  the wheel
feels strange at this point (turning
either direction, HARD).  This isn't
the absolute max of steering, so
I am not reaching limits.

turn wheel...  feel "bump" in wheel,
keep turning, bump is gone.  I feel
"bump" while turning back past
that point as well.

Anyone have recent experience with
steering problems?

Rich
