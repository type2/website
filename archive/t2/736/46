Subject: RE: [T2] 71 bus steering strangeness

yikes!

If it were me I would immediately get the entire front end up
off of the ground and on stands or something that you trust.
Get a helper to turn the wheel while you are under it, you
should be able to see whatever 'bump' you are feeling.  Sounds
like something is binding and then gives.  Whatever it is, you
won't be able to really check it out until the stress of the
vehicle weight is off of that front end.  Definately wear
safety glasses,.. God only knows what will fall into your face
while you are checking out the mechanicals.
