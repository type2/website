Never tried the brake cleaner trick on body panels, but the OG paint used on engine tin, brake backing plates and and chassis/suspension parts never seems to be seriously affected by it.

Ouch!  With that nastiness hiding under the black, maybe try some paint stripper, the old-school stuff with methylene chloride.  We've used that on fenders at the DDB shop, only thing it doesn't really touch is the OG primer.  Beats physical labor, faster than the two-week turnaround the local media blasting outfit has been giving us.
