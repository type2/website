Subject: [T2]spaghetti straps (pop top)

curious if anyone knows where to get the what i call spaghetti straps for the pop tops...?
well for mine anyways the penthouse campmobile....?
 
its the straps when you lift the top up that run from top of canvas to bottom of canvas and are stretchy like...?
 
there job..? is to keep the canvas and all squeezed up when you pull donw the top from inside it all comes down together so that you dont have to go outside and tuck it all under then latch it... 
 
i want to be able to pull it down from inside and crank up and leave if needed be...?? make sense...
say its pouring rain when we wake up we can just pull the top down and crank up not have to get out to do all the tucking to get the top to fasten....
make sense... hope so...?
peace
chris
heck i will even consider something someone has came up with...?not have to be the original straps for that matter....? tent camping store? fabric? cetain type of fabric elastic of some kind???


Peace and Love
Chris
