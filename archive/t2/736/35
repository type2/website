Subject: Re: [VB] [T2] You're Invited! Herbie & Friends Cruise Across

Damn, I would SOOO love to go on this with my Bus. I've done stuff like this with the Pontiac Fiero clubs and it's soo much fun. There's nothing like hitting the open road with a bunch of other car freaks.

That being said, my Bus is not running at the moment... and even if it was, my garage door broke so I wouldn't even be able to get it out.. (Yes, I know.. sad sad...)

That said, if you guys DO stop in Florida (where in Florida exactly??)

I've taken apart enough of my Bus that if I can offer my help during the weekend or after working hours, I'd be more than happy to. I live in Fort Lauderdale.  Or, if you guys will be "stopping" somewhere for a brief car show, I'd love to know about it so that I can show up.

I've got an open spot on my driveway for anyone that needs to park their VW?


Thanks,

Todd
