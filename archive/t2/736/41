Subject: Is Tampa a location for the Cruise?

Hello,

Fairly new to the list.  Caught word of the cruise across the country.  I
saw on the route that Orlando was one of the cities on the route.  Is
anything planned for the Tampa area?

Sunray bugs (VW Graveyard) in Dade City would be a interesting side trip for
people interested.  Anyway, I'm in the Tampa area (Land O' Lakes)

May take my 69 truck for a small leg of the cruise.
