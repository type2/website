Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Rust....Cover?

Hello,
Always trying to procet my bus. I used Wurth Rust Guard, then painted over it 
while it was still tacky.  I then used the Wurth Stonegaurd.  I did this a 
few years ago and it still looks great.  I also spay on a can or two of 
Boesheild T-9 before each winter.

Anyways,  my question is what year did buses have the protected cover for the 
gas heaters?  I once looked under a bus that had a complete sheet meatal 
covering under it's midsection.  I would really like to get one of these.  It 
looked like it added a lot of extra protection.

Just wondering.
