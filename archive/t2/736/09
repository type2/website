Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Additives (was: newby again)

Don, 
It is my understanding, anyone who knows better please correct me, that AC VW's 
and Porsche's have _never_ needed leaded fuel. AFAIK they had the hardened valve 
seats from the beginning. 

I once had a mechanic tell me I needed to run premium to stop my engine from 
dieseling, when I knew that it was caused by the baby dells lack of cut off 
solenoid. 
When I first met my wife, it took a while to convince her that higher grade gas 
was unnecesary for her truck. :)

When I first got my 73 when I lived in California I ran super unleaded.
Someone on this list said it wasn't needed, so I switched to the
bottom grade. Not a difference was seen!

I doubt any engine that's still running now needs those additives.
It's almost (note the "ALMOST") guaranteed that older engines have
been rebuilt, or at least the heads, with hardened seats, tougher
valves, etc.
