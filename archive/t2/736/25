hello Jules  to set the timming correctly you need to set the dwell first . 
Just gapping the points will get you in the ballpark,  the dwell will set it 
right  50 degrees plus or minus 3  50 is preferred. then you set the timing   
changing the point gap will change the timing  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
