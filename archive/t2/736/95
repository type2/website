> Ouch!  With that nastiness hiding under the black, maybe try some paint
stripper, the old-school stuff with methylene chloride.  We've used that on
fenders at the DDB shop, only thing it doesn't really touch is the OG primer.
Beats physical labor, faster than the two-week turnaround the local media
blasting outfit has been giving us.


Well, with that sanding job that looks like it's cut into metal in at
least a few places I'd feel better sanding to metal. Not terribly
difficult with my DA sander and I can make sure the metal is smooth.
Then with a high fill primer it should be good to go.

In the meantime, that spot I opened up has a splatter of Ford Engine
Blue on it to keep it from rusting. Hey, it's what was handy! heh
