Subject: Fluttering sound in vent increases puzzlement

Okay, this is getting weirder. Once we get above 45mph in the Wonderbus, 
a rattling, fluttering sound comes out of the driver's side fresh air 
vent on the dashboard. It sounds like a playing card rattling around.

If I close the vent, the sound stops. If I pull out the round vent the 
sound stops, but if I put my hand over the opening to provide a little 
back pressure, the sound occurs. So it's not the round vent assembly.

I have peered down the vent and can see nothing. I have opened up the 
part of the vent under the dash right by the door -- six fat screws -- 
and found nothing. I have pulled the front grille and the driver's side 
vent opening hatch (controlled by the fresh air lever on the dash) and 
found nothing. I have blown compressed air into the front, down the 
vent, through the tube under the dash and nothing happened.

The only part I have not opened is the more central stuff under the dash 
and behind the kickboard. So how tough of a job is it to open up 100% of 
the ventilation ducting? The noise is driving me nuts.
