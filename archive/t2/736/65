Subject: Special thanks to Troy Wical

Hi Volks- I would like to publicly thank Troy Wical for his efforts on
behalf of the type2/vintagebus list. Troy not only donated the shocks
that were auctioned off to raise money for the list, he also organized
and accounted for the auction. The money he raised for the list will
keep us going a looooong time. So, on behalf of the lists and everyone
that uses the information therein, a BIG THANK YOU to Troy for all of
his efforts.  Ted Finesman 

Don't take life to seriously- you'll never live though it....
