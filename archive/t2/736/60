Subject: Koni Shock Auction [UPDATE]

I am please to say that the winning bid for the shocks was US $551.  The
winner will remain anonymous for now but I'm sure I speak for others when I
say I am thankful for those that took place in the bidding.  This equals an
amount of roughly $835.00 for the list after combining 50% of the money
raised in the EB2005 raffle.

Thanks for everyone's help.
