I am surprised Peek doesn't have one. considering their prices they should
have everything.  THat's who I would have gone to first.

Desmond's in Baltimore "may" have one but he is the only other place in
the Baltimore metro area and over towards DC. I would
certainly call him first.  410-665-8787

good luck
