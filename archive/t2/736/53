Subject: Need moral support on '69 Westy

OK List, I need some moral support regarding my '69 Westy.

I've been messing with this Bus since I was 14 (I'm now 26) and finally was able to bring it out
of hiberation again this past fall and move it from my parent's house to my house.

It broke down on me on basically the first two trips out (lost an oil plate stud, and then blew a
brake line), so I parked it for the winter and repaired the oil plate stud and rebuilt the entire
brake system.  I then had to pull the engine to replace a slipping clutch, and then had to pull it
again last week to clean out a clogged heat riser on the intake manifold.

I had a chance to enjoy driving it for the past two days.  Then today, while backing out of a
parking spot, the part of the front beam that holds the swing arm in place decided it was time to
break off.  So now I'm looking at having to replace the front beam.

I'm at the point of wondering what to do next.  I understand that a front beam can be replaced, an
that used parts are out there, but what next?  Are there other spots on the undercarriage I should
look at to see if it's worth continuing to work on this bus, or should I give up?  Is there some
other critical component, that if it's rusted, the Bus is toast?

Sorry for the rant, but I just need some tummy comfort...
