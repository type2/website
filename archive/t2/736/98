Subject: Hi there... I'm new to the list

Just wanted to say hello... My wife and I recently purchased a
gorgeous '79 Westy with 75k original miles. We'll be picking it up
near Madison, WI over Memorial Day weekend and driving it back to
Oklahoma. This is actually our fifth bus, but all of the others have
been Vanagons save for a '70 Westy that never ran in my possession.
I've never taken such a long trip in a bus, so I'm in the process of
trying to figure out how much to prepare for the trip ahead of time
(we'll also be traveling with out three-month-old daughter!). I don't
want to go overboard with paranoia, either , so if any of you have any
helpful tips, especially about traveling with infants in Westy, I'd
love to hear them!

Further bulletins as events warrant...
