Subject: VW Busses in Miramar, FL?

Hey guys,

    I was trying to find my way to the FedEx drop-off center in Miramar,
Florida... I was using directions given to me by MapQuest.. and for some
reason, it sent me into a back alley in the middle of somewhere... I guess it
was focusing on the center of the ZIP code, and not the street address. I was
TOO frustrated to hang around, but what I did see there (off 100th Street of
Pembroke Rd.) was a tall chain link fence... gated area... that had about
10-12 Volkswagen Bay Window Busses... I even saw one Bus which I think I've
seen before. It was a white and red VW Bus... really nice shape. Most of the
busses looked rust free.

Do these belong to anyone? Is it a shop? I may try to check it out again...
since I remember where it was... but I was strapped for time, and really
getting mad so I didn't have time to stop...


Todd
