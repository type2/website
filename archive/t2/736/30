Hey all well this afternoon (thrusday) after alot of
phone calls and thinking i made the call to Bob at
Boston engines. He is going to make me a long block
engine a 2.0L fuel infected engine. The only thing
different it is going to have hydralic lifters the
wait he said is going to be 30 days but i am willing
to wait that long because i heard of his reputation is
incredible. Well i will let the list know more
information when it comes in take care to all and
happy driving.

sincerely sam
