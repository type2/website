Subject: Can you help me find Ron Van Ness?

Hello,

I'm trying to find Ron Van Ness. In 1997 our newsletter published a story 
of his: "Night of the '54 Barndoor." I'm working on an anthology of stories 
on VW Busing, and I wanted to ask his permission to reprint this one.

Thanks.

Tom Brouillette
