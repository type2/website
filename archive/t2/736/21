Subject: Bruck Distributor Install Update

Hi,

Nice day today so I went out to install my new SVDA distributor today.
This is the cheap Bruck model from cip1, it's basically an imitation
Bosch part as far as I can tell. The stamp on the body says "Bruck
Germany" but I can't find any "made in.." markings anywhere on this
part so who knows.

Before I started I decided to check the point gap as shipped from CIP1
and it was way off. So I regapped the points. Then I inscribed the
number one notch that the manufactured had somehow overlooked at
production time.

I turned the engine to TDC for #1 and pulled the 009.

I held the distributors side by side to look for any major
differences. I immediately noticed that the rotor on the new Bruck
distributor was 90 degrees from that of the 009.

I got the new distributor lined up and installed. The rotor now points
90 degrees clockwise of where it previously did. Also, when I try to
line the distributor body up with the new #1 notch I just made, the
vacuum can hits the intake manifold. So I was forced to make a second
#1 notch 90 degrees off from the first one.

Now I installed the new cap and rotated all the plug wires around 90
degrees, the #1 wire goes in what was the #4 position, #4 in the old
#3 position, etc...

I statically timed the engine to 0deg and turn the key. Yay! it works.

Now to go find a timing light that works and set the timing correctly.

I hear 30 degrees at 3000 RPM with the vacuum line disconnected. Sound
about right?

I'll post up some info on the performance of this part once I get my
new tires from the Bus Depot and can safely.

Peace
Jules


Oh, one more thing. I noticed that the Bruck Distributor seems to sit
a bit higher than the 009 did. I'm sure the drive teeth are engaged
but the distrutor just wont go down as far into the shaft as the old
one did. Thought?
