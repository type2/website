Subject: Re: [T2] source for heat shrink tubing in bulk?

Jay,

The best place I've found....

http://www.allelectronics.com/matrix/Heatshrinkable_Tubing.html

fer instance  1/4 tubing for $1.90 for 4 feet...and in colors!

They have lots of other terrific deals too!

For instance....12volt cpu fans that are just about the right size to fit 
into defroster tubing in a bug.


Cheers, dave

     I think they probably charge too much though.  Does anybody on the list 
 know of a place where I could buy a larger quantity of this stuff?  I did a 
 search on the net, and the number of options and carriers made my head hurt.
