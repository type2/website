I like the idea of listening to the radio without the key in on position, 
but I don't like the idea of it depleting my battery if it gets turned on 
accidentally (I know it can happen :-| )

I came up with a wiring that involves a relay and a push button switch (I 
can dig out the diagrams and send it if people are interested) so that when 
I turn off the engine the radio keeps playing if I pressed the push button 
switch, otherwise is turns off with the car. ( I was thinking rest stop 
after long drive, vs. parking and leaving the car) Once I turn off the 
radio, it will not turn on again unless I move the key to the on position. 
I could probably wire it so that you can turn it on by pressing the push 
button, but I like to have the key control (muahaha)
Some day I'll put a voltage level monitor in the loop so that it will shut 
off the radio when the battery voltage drops below a safety level. Right 
now I just keep monitoring my voltmeter...
