Yeah... the route that it told me to take was...

Starting from Pine Island.. take

- Pine Island SOUTH to Sheridan
- Turn RIGHT on Sheridan
- Turn Left on Palm Ave
- Turn Left on Pembroke Road
- Make your FIRST right, 100th S.W. Street.

It's right there at the end of the road... there's a new parking lot being
built behind it.

You can see the Busses REALLY clearly...
