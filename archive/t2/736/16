I think this is a clever way to wire the circuit, no extra switches. Jamie
Rivers told me how to do it this way:

For the switched power feed for the stereo, use the wire that goes to the
hot side of the key buzzer relay in the fuse box. This wire has 12V power
when the key is put in the ignition, but the key does not have to be turned.
This way, to listen to tunes, just stick the key in the ignition, but no
need to turn it. You will never "forget" about it this way, unless you are
prone to leaving your keys in the ignition. In fact, I AM prone to leaving
my keys behind, and this wiring trick actually helps prevent it, as the
radio stays on until the key is removed, sort of like a gentle reminder to
remove the key.
