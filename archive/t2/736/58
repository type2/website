Hi Volks!
I'm driving from Wilmington, NC to Asheville NC in two weeks. Is there a route that would be easier on the 1500? I understand that I-40 has a very steep grade right before Asheville. It's been suggested that I cut through South Carolina, and I've been told to simply take 74. Any suggestions? Mr. Knight and 'El Verde', I'm looking at you! :-)
I'm also curious about the effect of elevation on the carb --- is there a huge difference in performance?

Thanks!
