<Can you imagine the traffic jam that could create in the Rockies if there are some 36 or 40hp busses along for the ride? LOL :-)>

Well, Acme Tow Service of Denver has graciously donated their time and fuel to carry the 40 HP and less VW crowd over the Rockies on their fleet of roll-back trucks... They pick you up in Kansas and drop you off in Utah. One on top, one on a towbar per roll-back.

Apparently the Rocky Mountain State Trooper Department has warned they will issuing tickets for cruise vehicles who insist on going too SLOW... 

<grin!>

Maybe I can get it together soon and cruise from exit 286 to exit 301 of TN I-40...
