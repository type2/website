Subject: Need shop to adjust dual carbs around DC

Everyone,

I have given up on getting my dual Solex dialed in myself, so I am now
looking for shop recommendations around DC. I am looking for a shop that has
an exhaust gas analyzer (nothing fanzy - just reliable CO measuring) and
does not just tune "by ear". Furthermore, my carbs are Solex 40 PDSIT which
were not available in the US and are somewhat different from the regular
32-34 PDSIT. They do not have a central idle system and the tuning procedure
is somewhat different.

I have stopped by Peek Performance today and they do not have a gas
analyzer. Surprises me that they can build and tune racing engines without
one.

Any other suggestions?

I am heading out for a 3000 mile trip on 5/19 and want to have them tuned
right.

Thanks,
Marcus
