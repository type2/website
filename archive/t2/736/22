Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Role of Bowden tube

Here is the meat of that article:

Enter the bowden tube. How can you allow the engine/tranny to move 
relative to the body (and clutch pedal) yet keep the linear distance 
that the clutch cable has to travel from the pedal to the tranny 
constant?? With the bowden tube. If a flexible tube is used to carry the 
clutch cable between the end of the hard steel tube and the bracket on 
the tranny, and it has enough "extra length" to allow for the engine 
movement, the linear distance end to end will stay the same. Think about 
it. The distance through a flexible tube is the same no matter if it is 
bent or straight. Ingenious.

  Imagine that the bowden tube is not there, but the cable just shoots 
out of the back of the hard steel tube and goes straight, bare, to the 
clutch lever. Now you start the engine, put it in gear, and slowly start 
to let out the clutch. You hold the pedal and don't move it when it 
starts to engage and the car starts moving. The clutch engages, but 
immediately the engine torque's (rotates) on it's mounts. The distance 
between the end of the hard steel tube and the clutch lever increases 
slightly. That slight increases pulls your clutch lever forward some, 
the clutch disengages. The load on the engine drops now, the engine 
comes back to normal resting position on its mounts. The linear distance 
that the cable has to make is now back to normal, so the clutch starts 
to engage again. Engine torque's, distance increases, clutch disengages, 
distance goes back to normal, ....... It's a vicious cycle. This 
produces a sometimes violent shudder or what is often called "clutch 
chatter".
