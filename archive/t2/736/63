You speak of Black Mountain.  Roughly an hour East of Asheville.  Honestly,
I would think that you'll be fine over this pass.  Just stick it in second
and cruise.  The right lane will have trucks going slower than you most
likely anyways.  I think it's about 2+ miles up the East side?

Hi Volks!
I'm driving from Wilmington, NC to Asheville NC in two weeks. Is there a
route that would be easier on the 1500? I understand that I-40 has a very
steep grade right before Asheville.
