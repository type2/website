Type2 Folks, it is good to be back.

Some of you may remember me but I have been off the list for at least
4.5 years now so maybe not.  I was last active on the list in the mid
to late '90s around the time Charlie Ford was driving all over this
great land of hours.  How is Charlie doing these days anyway?  Is he
still on the list?

Me, I am currently bus-less but looking for an early bay window.  I'm
now living in SoCal so it should not be too difficult to find a solid
bus.

I'll be lurking.

- JT
