Subject: BRAKES

i put new wheel cylinder and brake shoes on the   rear of my 76 camper, the 
problem IM having is at the tot they are away from the wheel cylinder about 1/4 
inch on each side yet work if i put the drum on i thought maybe the emergency 
brake was not releasing enough i have a total knee replacement so it hard for 
me to get up and down any info would be great. thanks in advance. Neal 
IM looking for a web sight for the Bruce Myers Manx dune buggy club
