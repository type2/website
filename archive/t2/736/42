Subject: Re: [T2] Awning?

We used the one Camping World sells- Cataline 2500 by Dometic. It's been
on for 10 years and has been on since 150,000mi on our 245,000 Westy.  I
put rubber under the bracket clamps (go on the gutter), but it's rusting
a bit where it warped when  the awning once lifed up in a wind gust and
blew the awning over the top of the van- that taught us to ALWAYS fasten
the legs to the ground or tied under the tire footprint. These clamps
look like the Fiamme ones, but with a poptop you really can't fit the
ones that bolt to the roof- gotta be the gutter mount.
I added a mount to the roof rack of our 78 Westy and use the 12 foot
awning, as it shades the front door and lets us hang the stock tent
underneath and carry no poles:

(email me for site with large pics)-too many hits shuts it down.
The lightest ones I've seen I think is called a Sunbrella and used
fiberglass rods under tension to form a decent size awning that has no
poles and can bounce around without poles.
