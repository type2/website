Joe,

I am right there with you.  I have owned one of two buses for almost 15 
years and have only been able to put less 4000 miles total on them. 
Last weekend while drive to storage for the next year while I work on 
other thinks it dropped a valve.

Sigh, towed to storage until I have time to deal with it.

Can't comment on the body, but if the body is still good keep at it.  It 
will be a beauty some day.

Some of use just take longer to figure out what needs to be done.

Steve
