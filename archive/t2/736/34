Has anyone ever had a problem like this? After a long drive with 
headlights on, turning into my house, turn signal stops working. The 
repeater light on the dash comes on, and thats it. No clicking from the 
flasher. No flashing. Hazards too, not working.  Turn the headlights 
off, and normal operation resumes.

It doesn't happen when the lights are off, or if I just have them on for 
a short trip.

Other symptom includes idiot light glowing towards the end of the 
journey. No light at all for first 20 miles or so, then a slowly 
increasing (but dim) glow. Lights on much brighter (but still a bit dim) 
when I try the turn signals.

I figure it is a charging problem of some sort, but can't for the life 
of me make sense of the symptoms.

73 Westy - UK spec, so separate turn signals at the rear with a simpler 
flasher unit than the US models.
