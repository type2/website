Barry, I used www.paintscratch.com for some touch up for our Subaru.   
Expensive metallic paint, but looked great, and shipped in a week.
 
good luck!

Yes, another FART  [Frequent and Refreshing Thread, right??]

Again, who supplies paint  premixed in matching color for our buses.  I am 
looking for the '72  'orange' color, I think it is Sierra Gold    11-L

Thanks
Barry
