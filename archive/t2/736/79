Thanks for all the words of wisdom so far on this.  

I guess where I'm at now is trying to evaluate the rest of the condition of the Bus.  The interior
and camping equipment is in very good condition, as I don't believe the Bus has a whole lot of
miles on it (I think the 68K on the odometer is the original mileage).  I'm questionable on the
body.  At some point prior to my Dad purchasing it in 1980, it was hit on the front passenger
side.  Whoever repaired it used a lot of bondo and repainted the whole Bus without masking off the
window seals real well.  So a lot of sheet metal would have to be replaced.  Other than that, the
lower rocker panels on both sides are shot.  Most everything else is OK.

The one spot that has me worried is the rear beam (or whatever it's called).  It has some bad
looking rust on the driver's side where it is welded to the arm.  A picture is worth a thousand
words, so take a look at the link below and go to pictures 42 and 43 on the third page.  I'm not
sure what to make of it.

I took a bunch of other pictures of the Bus and welcome any comments, suggestions, horror stories
that you have.
