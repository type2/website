Steve:
I have the entire 82 at my disposal, so changing more parts is not that much of a
problem.
Regarding the metal cooling air intakes- I, too, now believe that feature extended
at least part way into 1981. The car I got the fried GEX engine from was an 81,
several other features including the serial number, but had the metal air intakes
as well.
Thanks,
