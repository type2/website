Subject: RE: [T2] Web site space for buses?

CystalTech.com is the best Windows 2000 web hosting company I have ever
used, but I am not sure they have a package for $10/month. I think they only
have a $20/month package. They do have the best support and uptime I have
ever seen in a private company and I have used many over the years, both NT
and Unix.

I have to get away from NBCI/Xoom & am temporarily camping at
freewbspace.com.
I hate the banners and can upgrade their site for $10 a month and get 100 
megs of space.

Do any of you webmeisters out there have suggestions for a better FTP site 
that can host webapges.
I really would not mind unobtrusive Bus list banners.
