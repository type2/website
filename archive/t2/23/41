Subject: no red light on fixed!!!!

I just want to say thanks to all who have responded with my charging system
troubles. I finally figured it out!!!!!!! I traced the wire coming out of
the voltage regulator that is on the lower right. The 12 volts that should
go to it. Anyway I found that the wire came of the regulator and instead of
going down to the starter it went into the rear seat and to nothing!!! I
think the PO wanted to run another battery under the rear seat, but didn't
get around to it. 
	Again thanks for your help,

Paul Saulsbury
