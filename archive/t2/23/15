Esteemed Members:
My gas gauge only operated when the tank was 1/4 empty or less. While 
cleaning before applying Kool Seal to my interior sheet metal, I noticed a 
cutout over the tank. A previous owner had cut the sheet metal for access to 
the tank level sending unit. I removed the unit and disassembled it. The 
central rod on which the float moved was corroded and rusty. I cleaned the 
rod with emery cloth and once again, the gauge is fully operational. If 
anyone has a similar symptom, I hope this info is of some help.
