I'll chime in and say that I have purchased engines from Ronnie for my '71
bus and '69 bug.  Both are running well.  The bus engine uses a 31pict
carb.  The power is a bit less than the mystery motor it replaced, but it
never pings no matter what the temperature or gasoline, which is a more
than even trade.

I installed it in stock condition, no guages, filters, or coolers.  The
valves need little adjustment, at most a thousandth off after 2000 miles.

You need to get a different box wrench for valve adjustments (15mm?).  The
plugs are long reach, which may indicate better head life.  I don't put
miles on like Chuck, but both engines don't drip, always start easily, and
run smoothly.

Ronnie's service is top notch.
