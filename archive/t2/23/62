Then explain why GEX is still in business!  :)

One law of business seems to be that "cheap pushes out good."  In terms of
our VWs, this means that there is a proliferation of "10,000 mile
rebuilds", ill-fitting rubber and tin, etc.

I try to make it a policy to buy from the suppliers that make a concerted
effort to stock quality merchandise.  I may pay a bit more, but it is
ususally repaid in service and advice.
