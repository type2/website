Subject: Cigarette lighter in my 69 Transporter?


Dear List:

I'm thinking of buying a cigarette lighter for my bus... (see link below, just for the sake of a
picture to illustrate):

The description says it's correct for a panel bus, double cab, etc., but I think I'd like to add one
to the dash of my '69 Transporter so's my wife can charge her cell phone while driving.

One question:  the little push-on clip at the end of the wire?  Where would/should/could I attach
that?  I'm kind of a dope when it comes to wiring...

Any ideas would be a big help!
