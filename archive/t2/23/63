Subject: Fuel leak

Reach up and behind the driver's side battery tray area, toward the front. 
There is a little piece of rubber/cloth fuel line that connects two metal
fuel lines that happen to meet in that area.  That little piece of fuel
line is very prone to aging (well, they all are) and splitting and
therefore failing - most likely causing the leakage symptoms you describe. 
I had the joyous fortune of discovering this same unnerving reality while
2000 miles from home in the desert of Baja California, Mexico; the sight of
fuel pouring out from back there was quite a shock at first.  Replace it
with another new piece of fuel line and you're probably good to go.
