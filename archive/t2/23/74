Subject: Spare tyre

Hi all,

A quick question that's been puzzelling me for a while.

The spare tyre of my bus is mounted on the front of it. Where do you keep
your spare if it's not mounted up front? Does it depend what equipment
you've got inside, or is there some secret hiding place I've missed :)
