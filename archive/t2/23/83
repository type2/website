I've installed a Bus Depot setup, but it wasn't sold as a "package".  I
just asked for a complete system.

Not hard.  You might want to brush up your selection of blue words for the
more challenging bits.

Lots of Liquid Wrench, applied every day for several days before you take
things apart.

Dunno.  When I asked them for everything, I got everything.  I don't
remember the price.

It's pretty quiet.  You'll hear more engine mechanical noise.

When I bought my parts, I bought as many Liestritz brand parts as they
had.  The difference in installation ease is well worth the additional
money.  I don't know if the $99 system is Liestritz or not.
