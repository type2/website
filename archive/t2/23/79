Subject: Fuel Problems Still

Thanks for all your input guys.
I  know its not crud in the tank because i had it "re-newed"
Fuel Lines seem clear (i can blow air into the inlet hose and hear air
bubble up in the gas tank) When i pour gas in the carb it starts right up.
 99% of the time it stalls again right away but if i pump the s*#t out of it
and keep it reved high it stayed running  for a bit untill i decelorate.
