Subject: fellow bus driver

My best friend, a vw bus driver, was involved in a serious car accident on
the weekend. He is at the University of Baltimore Shock Trauma Center and he
is not doing well. He has severe bruising on the right side of his brain and
he has broken bones. He was the passenger in a BMW, exceeding the
speedlimit, and the driver lost control of the car. He is a victim of
circumstance.

Pray for my friend, please.
