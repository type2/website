Subject: Re: [T2] leaking gas (yes i know its bad)

I just repaired some leaks on my 78. I had to replace the fuel filler
neck(was not the source of the leak,but was cracked) and the hose going from
the fuel filler pipe to the tank. This hose is not available anywhere. I
tried using
radiater hose and that swelled up and looked like crap after two weeks. I
ended up finding a good used one.
If you try used ones give them a squeeze and look for cracks and make sure
it's still pliable. If you can't find a
used one go to a marine supply store and try to match up with some of their
fuel hose. They have some large
sizes and some different connectores that might work. If I couldn't find a
used one I was going to cut back
the metal filler pipe so the hose would make a nice sweep to the tank and
use a piece of marine gas hose.
Let me know what you find and use. Also you have to pull the engine to do
this.
