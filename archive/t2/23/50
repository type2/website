One of my wife's relatives is a flight attendant. Her boss gave her some
time off to find an apt. She was scheduled to be on one of the flights that
hit the tower. She lost all her co-workers that she was training with and is
still in shock.

Sorry no bus content. Just a very lucky relative still alive.
