When I bought an Ebay bus located in Chicago I discovered a dropped valve
seat, with the bus still in the seller's driveway.  When I started the
repairs on what seemed to be a low mileage engine, I discovered a MoFoCo
logo on several parts, and the crankcase was painted gold.  I shopped for a
head and other parts, and every time I mentioned that I had a MoFoCo
engine, I got a negative reaction (usually a groan).

My only knowledge of MoFoCo is gleaned from the negative reactions of VW
guys in the Chicago area, which isn't very far from Milwaukee.
