Subject: Fuel Problems

Can someone help me?
My fuel pump is not pumping enuff gas into the fuel filter for the
carburator to keep my bus running. Sometimes it works real well and
sometoimes is doesnt(most of the time it doesnt)
Is there a vaccum leak somewhere? this is on a 1600 super beetle engine in
my 1970 bus. Its not the fuel pump cause i replaced it.
