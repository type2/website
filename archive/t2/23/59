Just posted the pics.
I really had a great time & am now filled with inspiration for making a quiet 
safe 63 singlecab. (the blue sound deadened seatbelted singlecab in the pics)

I am going to upgrade from this free webspace to a no banner version, any 
suggestions for about 10.00 a month for 100 megs of space?
