Paul:

This is the same one I bought a few months ago.  I also use mine for cell-phone charging.  The red lead goes to 12V, and the terminal on the body of the lighter goes to ground.  You should use an in-line fuse with the 12V lead, and connect it to a 12V source that gets switched on and off by the ignition switch.

Any further questions, e-mail me.
