What year's your bus?

In addition to the standard Muir and Haynes suggestions (yes, you should
have all three--and I sometimes recommend two Muirs, one for your garage and
one for your backseat) try a Bosch Automotive Manual. It is described as the
bible of automotive repair, which is true--this book will teach you how a
car works; important stuff if you're trying to fix one!

Bosch also has a Fuel Injection Manual. If your Bus is fuel injected you
need this book. Likewise a Weber carb manual if you have Weber carbs or a
Solex manual if you have Solex carbs. A whole book about one subsystem will
be more detailed than a generalist manual out of necessity.

There is also a Bosch Electrical Manual. That's good too.
