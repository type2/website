 is at least one 1981 out there with metal
vents
? 
......... I just sold an 81 Westy with metal vents.
In addition it had only three levers on the heater / fresh air control
panel (my 83 Westy has 4)
The 81 had the standard flop out glove box as does my 83.
The 81 had wood grain Westy cabinetry, my 83 has tan/ cream color plain.
The 81 refrigerator had an LP fuel monitor on the front panel.
The 81 did not have a deceleration valve on the engine.
The 81 had about 90K on the engine and it ran very well, the strangest
thing was that the transmission shifted very smoothly and out of the five
or six 80-83 models I've driven I've never driven a smoother shifting
transmission.
