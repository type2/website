I'll bet that (a) this will be easy) but (b) will involve swapping way
more bits than you think at the outset :-)

Yeah, sure it will but you might have to swap the whole dash to get the
mount points you need :-)

OK, as I heard it....  the air intakes at the upper rear corners of the
bus were a metal grill in 1980 only.  In 1981 and later years, that was a
rectangular cutout with a plastic insert.  I am certain given VW's "mid
year change" policy that there is at least one 1981 out there with metal
vents.
