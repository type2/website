Subject: Re: [T2] Found a bus (Newbie again) is Dallas!  & one more Q

My fault -- I caught that as soon as I read what I'd
sent too!  I meant fan belt...  Guess I just had
timing belts on my mind 'cause I've changed so many on
my other cars.

Anyway, it's being looked at now.  Maybe I can hope to
get away with heads only in the wake of an apparent
overheat?

Tks,

Chris
