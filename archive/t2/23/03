Subject: starter nut and bolt specs

Hi, the bottom nut and bolt I removed in order to replace my starter escaped
from their baggie.  I want to replace them with the highest quality,
correct new ones, and I know I won't find them at Homie's.  Is there a
certain rating that I should be looking for?

Thanks

Don J
