A little Bus content, a little Web content. Web content first.

I used to host macsalon.org at Mindspring. Thirty dollars a month for, IIRC,
300MB webspace, email manager, FTP upload/download (including all the
anonymous dropboxes you want), the whole schmear. I was real happy with them
except for the thirty dollars a month part.

Now I'm at aitcom.net. They have two kinds of servers, Linux and Windows
2000. I've got a 20MB "Starter Site" (it's Linux; the Windows 2000 sites are
more expensive but offer more space, and they can even host your website on
a box of its own if you like) for eight dollars a month, and I like it just
fine. I think it's a little better than the Mindspring space...even if it
wasn't enough cheaper that I can now afford a cell phone within my telecom
budget.

Bus content now: Welding on Edelstein will begin this weekend! Got oxygen,
acetylene, little pieces of sheet steel, holes in the floor. I will not have
two of those things when this weekend's over. You guess which two. Also, I
ordered rocker panels and a battery tray from Wolfsburg West. Fun times
ahead!
