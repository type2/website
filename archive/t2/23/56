>>Any chance of getting any 185-R14 or 185-R15 in a D load range?<<

AFAIK the Yoko 356 is available in C & D load range.

try tirerack.com (no, i dont work for them, etc.)

also, once upon a time i had the Bridgestone 603V in D load range.  didnt
have that bus very long after that but the short time i had them i did
think they were a good product.

YMMV.
