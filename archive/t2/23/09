On a Vanagon 2 liter, the dipstick mounts different than on the earlier bay
windows, thus it does not need to be shortened.  I run a temp sensor with
the stock dipstick, and no issues.

The rubber boot is available from the dealer, RMMW, Bus depot to name a few.
I did not cut my tin but instead used a pipe nipple with a tee on the end to
mount my dual pressure sensor.  No issues here.

I too have not ever found a good oil filler gasket.  You can be assured that
the motor you find that elusive gasket on has never been rebuilt..........

Also, there is a rubber washer that goes on the thermostat cable between the
two pieces of tin...............seals that tiny hole!!!
