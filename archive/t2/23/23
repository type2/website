Subject: Fw: Wiring Meltdown

> Help
> You will recall from my post earlier in the week, I wanted to get my horn
> working.  I was troubled by the wiring and mentioned the fact that I was
> gently yanking, not good, remember?  Well HapyBus melted  a few wires
today.
> Shut right down and then a bunch of smoke.  Looking at the scene, I
noticed
> a few wires melted.
> I am going to do this on my own.  Thinking I will have to remove the dash
> for easy access.  Is there anything here I should be concerned about?  How
> about new wire?  Is it a simple as going to FLAPS and getting wire?  Or is
> there something special, certain wire I need?  Then what, just splice and
> repair what is melted?
> HapyBus seems to do something like this the week before every rip I have
> planned.  Supposed to go to Chicago on Wednesday and Whitewater rafting in
> WV over the weekend.
> Oh well, it will be a great learning experience.
