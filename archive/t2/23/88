Subject: Windshield metal, anyone have?

Hi All:

Does anyone in the SoCal area have rust-free windshield metal they want to
sell? I'm looking to cut out and replace the rusty section on my 71 Westy
and hoped someone might be able to help. Maybe someone replaced their front
clip and didn't use the windshield area????
