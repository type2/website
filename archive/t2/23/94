I have these on the 70... like them ok   BUT

They are a highway rib, NOT m/s. When I hit some sand up in the backwoods,
I slid around quite a bit. They are only OK in rain. Quiet, firm ride. I
run them at 40 front, 45 rear, NOT what the VW specs say, but what
BRIDGESTONE told me to run for the weight of the bus.

I was actually hoping to get some Agilis 61s and offer the 603s to the List
to help pay for the Michelins, as they only have 2000 miles on em. Oh well.
