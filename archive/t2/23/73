Subject: RE: Fuel Problems

My guess is that the fuel sock at the outlet from the tank has disintegrated
and the outlet is now smothered with garbage.  One hint that this may be the
cause is to run it until it stalls and then disconnect the fuel line going
into the pump.  If you hear air rushing in as you remove the line that's an
indication that the pump has sucked the line dry.  After you relieve the
vacuum and put the line back on the engine will start right back up again
because the crud in the tank is no longer held down by suction.
