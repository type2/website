Subject: Desperate for solution to clutch problem!

Hi I am writing because a few weeks back I had some crippling problems 
involving my clutch, or at least thats all I am hoping it is. I was driving 
and over time, what was just alot of play in my shifter rod became a serious 
problem where I would pop out of first gear when I stepped on the clutch, 
and even to the point where everything just locked up and I couldn't shift 
into any gear. I tried tightening the wingnut on the clutch cable and that 
gave me my gears back but it is still really scary to drive.... and 
ideas/suggestions? Thanks guys.. talk to y'all later
