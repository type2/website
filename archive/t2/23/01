You are welcome, glad to be able to help.

I have a 1980 VW 2000 Vanagon, but I have not installed the plate. I am
waiting for the fall oil change to come around.  When I do, I had intended
to clip 1/2" off the dipstick.  David Schwarze, who gave me the plate,
told me that this had been necessary on Bluto, his 1973 VW bus (stock
1700, AFAIK) but Jake's comments give me hope that I won't have to.  If
anyone would know from experience, it's him.

I suspect you may be correct, but listen to Jake, and try your dipstick
before you cut...  you can always cut it *shorter* :-)

Nigel, you are out of my area of expertise.  Here in Virginia, with lowest
lows in the teens (fahrenheit), I have never had a problem.  I am running
20W-50 all year and oil pressure will spring right up.  In very low temps,
it will spring up to 70psi, but that is not unacceptable to me and it
sinks to ~50 within a minute or two as I let it warm.

A sump heater won't hurt, so if you can find one, go for it, but it is low
on my priority list here.

Well, yes :-)  First, I cut the cover plate while I was replacing the
engine, so it was out and off anyway.  If I had to do it with the engine
installed, I would have no qualms about cutting the cover plate in place.
I would remove the distributor, stuff a rag in the hole and cover it with
some protective (read: duct tape).  I would leave the old sender in place.
mark the tin for cutting then grind away.  Vacuum up before removing the
stuffing in the distributor hole or the old oil pressure switch.

Second, in so far as tighening it, that is no harder than tighening the
OEM sender, and leakage is as likely as well.  Initially I tightened it
finger tight using the two terminal posts.  When it leaked, I put a
screwdriver between the posts and gave it a *touch* more "hork".  Has not
leaked since.  As usual, all sorts of warnings about screwing steel
threads into an aluminum/magnesium case -- take it slowly, you can always
re-tighten.

Third, sealing the gap is the biggest concern, but still, to my mind,
minor.  The gap is only ~2-3mm.  Since I could not conceive of how I would
get the OEM oil temp sender boot over the pipe and since I only recently
became aware of the existence of such a boot (I have still never seen one
installed :), I think my 3mm gap is far smaller than the 2-4cm gap
(depending on how you measure, radius or diameter) that most people are
running.  I have thought of putting a bead of RTV around the sender to
fill the gap, but am waiting to get a round tuit :-)
