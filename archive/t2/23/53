Subject: Busses by the Buoy


Just a quick report on this outing sponsored by the Vacationland VW club in
Brunswick ME. Very nice campground right on a tidal flat with a beach. I'm
guessing there were about 60 busses, from a 50s single cab, splitties, lots
of bay campers, vanagons, eurovans and a Winnebago Rialta. Lots of nice
people, at my site I had a beautiful splittie westy with safaris on my left
and 2 eurovans on my right, everybody was friendly, no snobs here. Well run
event with a Lobster dinner on Saturday night, raffle, and Ben & Jerry's
ice cream. One very happy vanagon owner won a new eurocamper sidetent, and
lots of other prizes were given out. There was also a free kids raffle
where everyone won a prize! All proceeds were donated to the Red Cross.
Potluck breakfast on Sunday morning and then a caravan from the campground
to a mall parking lot, a lot of fun to be in a long line of busses, with
most of them flying flags.

In conclusion, a long drive for me, about 4 hours, but we plan on going
next year :-)
