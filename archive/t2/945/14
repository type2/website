Subject: Re: [T2] Doghouse cooler

Couple of years ago I "doghoused" my 70 bus which I bought new in 1969. It 
was a bit of work collecting the parts and in particular the flap rod 
connectors and original Hoover piece.

From the driving you describe I would not go to the trouble. Before my 
doghouse I ran 70,000 miles on a Rapid Cool oil cooler mounted behind the 
fan housing. Although this is supposed to be a lousy set-up my engine was 
still in good shape with the additional help of a full flow filter and 
careful monitoring of a dip stick temperature sender/gage.

Subject: [T2] Doghouse cooler


I picked up a 1500 sp engine yesterday. The engine code leads me to
 believe that it was out of a '68 beetle. 30 pict 1 carb. No sloppy lash
 in the distributor, which strikes me as a very good sign. I'll know
 more when I tear the engine down and inspect pistons, valves. etc/

 Thinking ahead a little, I wonder how worthwhile it would be to upgrade
 to a doghouse cooler. I live in the northeast (Maine) and will probably
 be driving my bus on back roads, 50 to 60 mph, no desert or southern
 heat. Some highway travel, some occasional mountain travel (White
 Mountains, Green Mountains, Adirondacks -- not western mountains). A
 doghouse upgrade is probably always worthwhile, but maybe less
 worthwhile in some cases than in others/
