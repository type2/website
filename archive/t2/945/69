That's a great system, and definitely the one to use if you don't need a
CAT. It's is the stock factory setup for '72-83 Buses and Vanagons outside
of the U.S., but starting in '75 we in the U.S. got the more convoluted
crossover-pipe system due to the federal requirement for a CAT. It will
indeed FAR outlast any of the aftermarket extractory systems. Nothing else
even remotely comes close to this system in terms of quality for the dollar.

It is a direct bolt-on for '72-74 and 79-83. Courtney has a '77, however,
which takes a triangular rather than trapezoidal flange at the heat
exchangers. Using this system on a '75-78 requires replacing the '75-78 heat
exchangers with '72-74 ones that have trapezoidal output flanges (and doing
a couple of rather minor mods). That said, I still recommend this
modification. Not only does it make it possible to use the above exhaust
system (by far the best for the buck), but it also eliminates several '75-78
only components that are no longer available, notably the header pipes and
j-pipes that go from the head to the heat exchangers. (The 72-74 heat
exchangers don't require them, as they bolt directly to the heads). The mod
will pay for itself several times over, both by eliminating those NLA parts
and by making it possible to use a cheap yet far superior muffler.

If you don't want to do this mod, then there is the '75-78 extractor system,
which works with the U.S. spec '75-78 heat exchangers. The one I recommend
is the Pacesetter, which is quite similar to the Ansa version made some
years ago. It is a one-piece setup that looks much like the stock system but
connects right to heat exchangers (no crossover pipe). In my opinion it is
far superior to the Taiwanese made Empi in terms of longevity, although
still no match for the OEM setup linked above. The Pacesetter is what I
generally ship under the below part number, although on occasion I am forced
to substitute an Empi when the Pacesetters are unavailable.
