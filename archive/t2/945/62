Subject: Empi vs. Bugpack merged aftermarket exhaust for 77 Westy

Ron et al;
I've noticed that Empi's merged aftermarket exhaust merges and and the collector points directly to the passenger side. The Bugpack collector points straight back. I like the design of the Empi better, as it will allow me to modify any old muffler and attach it. Paying 200 dollars each time my muffler dies is killing me. All I need is the three bolt flange which is readily available anywhere to fit a 24 dollar FLAPS muffler. I have three questions.
1) Has anyone seen this Empi for sale that fits a 77? Ron at Busdepot only shows the one for the early buses with the rectangular exhaust ports.
2) How far down does the Empi header hang, enough to be a clearance problem? Does it hang down as much as the Bugpack?
3) What is the quality like? Someone said the Empi's were actually quite well made.
Thanks in advance,
Courtney
