Pretty nice.  My method when I head up to the Sierras is to mount the
chains on my spare wheels in my nice warm garage.  It is a lot easier to
swap two wheels than it is to reach up inside those dripping, slushy
wheelwells to secure chains!  :)  If the weather looks threatening, I take
the hubcaps off so I have one less thing to worry about.

Another thing to do on the trial run is to wire back the extra link or two
on each side of the chain.  You don't want to cut these links off because
the next set of tires you buy might be slightly larger.  They do need to
be secured, though.

After using the chains, you might add photos on how to inspect them for
cracks.  This step is often skipped, causing problems the next time the
chains are used.

Another subtopic is how to drive with chains.  Keep speeds down below 30
MPH and if you have a choice about driving in snow or on pavement (a
common situation in the Sierras) always opt for keeping the chains in
snow.

With the rubber stretchers, I always use two sets.  That way, if one of
them breaks (and they will) you can just keep on going.

And, my best advice is "Never drive away from home in a snowstorm!"

We actually had snow here in SoCal a couple of days ago.  Real,
honest-to-gosh flakes were coming down for a few minutes.
