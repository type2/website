That depends on the muffler. In Europe two versions of the muffler were
offered, one that had a few carefully placed "dimples" that allowed it to
clear the heater tubes, and one that didn't and therefore only fit a Bus. In
the U.S., you can get the Dansk version with the dimples but not the Ernst
version.
