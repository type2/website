Subject: Re: Empi vs. Bugpack merged aftermarket exhaust for 77 Westy

I've had this one installed since about 1998:

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=071251053EK

It has outlasted aftermarket extractor systems by a factor of many. Only 
problem is that it doesn't support a catalytic converter, but my '79 bus is 
now beyond the 25-year cutoff for Austin's recently-adopted emissions 
testing. If I could find a complete exhaust system with a 3-way cat 
converter, I'd probably buy it, if it was not too godawfully expensive.

Here's a description of it from www.BusDepot.com:

Complete Exhaust System
Premium Quality, European made OEM, for 72-74 Bus. Includes German muffler 
plus tailpipe and install kit. Also can be used on 79 Bus, and on 75-78 with 
modifications. (See notes.)

Description: This setup is far superior in quality to any extractor-type 
system. It is stock in the U.S. for '72-74 Bus. It also fits a 79 Bus but 
with no provision for CAT or EGR. It can also fit 75-78 Bus with minor 
modification if 72-74 heat exchangers are used.

Part Reference Number*: 071251053EK
Availability: Usually ships in 1-3 working days (sooner if ordered via air 
shipment)    QtyPrice
 $169.95
