And I agree with you. I can't see how it can get hot and expand if it's got
cold air blasting over it. But wouldn't that keep the flaps closed?? Doesn't
the thermo expand and open the flaps to make it even cooler?? Geez, I gotta
stop working on type 1's, I think they work the opposite. Hmm, good rum - - -
better engage brain and disengage keyboard to think this through. :-)

  Its like blowing on anything, if you have wind passing over it the heated
air around it will get replaced with cold and the cold air will keep sucking
the heat out of the thermostat.
