Hi Mark,

Thanks for the warning about the H code cases. I'm planning to get a
new aluminum case, so it won't matter so much. Also, new heads
(probably) and new pistons and cylinders (almost certainly). Full flow
oil filter. If I stay with carburation for a while, I'll stick with the
single carburetor. Everything will be measured, ground or rebuilt if
needed, replaced as necessary.

Mark
