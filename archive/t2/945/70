Subject: VW logo carabiner Key Chains for sale

Perfect for your bus keys (or bug, or ghia, or
jetta...)I came upon about 50 of these key chains in a

VW logo and "Drivers wanted" slogan stitched on the
webbing part.  New in package. Buy 1 or 10 or 20 for
$3.50 each and this INCLUDES shipping anywhere in the
US.  Here's the ad with a photo:
