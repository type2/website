Not sure yet - I'm hoping I can get away with putting the top of the 
tank level with the rear deck, just underneath the hatch.  If that won't 
work, I will put it a bit higher than that in the spare tire well.  When 
my bus was "converted" to a camper, they crudely hacked away the rear 
half of the spare tire well to make room in the driver's side battery 
tray.  I could build a small box there containing the overflow tank. 
Maybe 2" higher than the rear deck surface, extending downward.
