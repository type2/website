Actually it's a PIA for the Vanagons. Not enough clearance for the heater
tubes. Some guys bash them in to make the muffler fit, but a better idea is
to sandwich a bunch of gaskets between the muffler and heater boxes. For my
van I cut off the mounting flanges from the old stock exhaust and used them
as spacers. Fit like a charm.
