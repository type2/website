You kinda have to stick your head into the engine compartment, and look 
just where the fan shroud connects to the engine block.  You'll see the 
little "tower" where the oil breather snaps on to the engine.  Right at 
the base of that "tower" is a flat spot where you will find the block's 
engine code stamped.
