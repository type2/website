Subject: RE: [T2] WTB hoop end caps and center surport

Hey Mark,

Derek Gregg of DG Creations does hoops for all years and models.
661-946-1303
Lancaster, CA
+$300 (requires re-welding the hoops because of shipping constraints)

Tom Bueses does the canvases for bays all years and models.
bueses(-at-)earthlink.net
Salt Lake City, UT
+$700

Derek and Tom did my DoubleCab hoops and canvas and their quality is better
than original (if you do the "sunbrella" option instead of the standard duck
cotton). However, the stabilization bumpers are NLA and I haven't seen them
for sale. For the wooden slats, you just go to Home Depot and make your own
out of oak if you are handy with a table saw. Cost was about $40.

My suggestion on purchasing; if you do any highway driving or commuting, you
might consider a cab-height set (which was standard in N. America). My DC's
top speed and mileage drops dramatically with the over-cab Tilt
(standard/optional in Europe) and as a result I find myself not using it. In
fact, I am going to see if anyone wants to trade me for a cab-height set or
I'm going to put the set up for sale.

Hope this helps,

Jon Stiles
