Well, I got the Danish version, and it had the dimples in the muffler, but
they weren't "dimpled" enough. Still too close by about 3/4". There is a
thread on Samba about this and guys who have done it have had to use their
hammers or their creativity. Not a big deal either way, if it lasts as long
as people are saying.
