Subject: Re: [T2] alternator options for my 78 westy

Stock is 55-amp, high output is 70-amp.  High output has a different 
rear cover and round air port instead of D-shaped.  I don't know anyone 
who has switched to the HO alternator from the standard one.  I hear you 
can have a standard alt "wound" to HO specs or perhaps even higher but I 
would think the risk of overheating would be significant.  I made a 
bracket to run a second alternator off of the smog pump pulley rather 
than risk a single HO alternator.  Redundancy never hurt anyone.  :-)

Lots of info in the archives on this subject, and isolators, and proper 
system voltage.
