Hey Don...

You might consider it sacreligious, but when I discovered a shredded AAR
boot on my bus this summer, I found a more robust *Chrysler* part on the
shelf at O'Reilly's. There's a whole section of rubber boots, hoses and
fittings on one aisle, and I took the VW one in and just compared by site
til I found one that worked. Seems to be much heavier/thicker than the
original, and fit right in its place. Something like $3 IIRC. Anyway, just
something to think about...
