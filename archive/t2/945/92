That is the Aux Air Regulator elbow I put in last August. What a piece
of crap!!!

The Guac had been running funny so today before the snow started I
went and started digging, and replacing my TS2 while I was at it.
That's what I found. I've slopped tons of silicone on it to get it to
work for now, but I dislike the idea of replacing the thing every
couple months.

Anybody making a better one?
