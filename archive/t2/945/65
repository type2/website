Subject: New damage to my van

I had to swerve to avoid a car that was coming towards me, and wound  
up hitting a barrier instead.  here are some photos of the damage.

barrier pushed the metal behind the sliding door back about an inch.

Anyone know of a good VW body shop that can get the metal bent back?
