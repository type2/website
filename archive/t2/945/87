Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Empi vs. Bugpack merged header, How low do they

Does anyone have a good picture of how low these hang? I don't want something that is way down there. I know stock is best, but I want to do some fabricating and playing, so want the header part to use as a base for adding the muffler of my choice. It doesn't appear that Empi makes a merged header that has a collector pointing to the passenger side for my round port heat exchangers on a 77 bus. :-(
