Thanks, but where on the block will I find this code.
I am used to working on my 1600 from a beetle.
I know its not a 1600 bc the starter, points and condeser are all different.

Also is this considered a "Pancake"? if not what is the correct term for the 
motor with no doghouse?

Thanks,
Jim
Hampstead, NC
