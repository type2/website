Subject: gas smell sources

As it happens, I have no sense of smell.

My wife reports a strong smell of gas around the bus,
but she can't seem to localize it beyond "the back."

There is no leak that I can see, and the bus has been
parked for a month on a dry floor in an unheated  garage
(it is in for the winter as I do not expose the old girl
to road salt).  Neither the engine compartment nor the
floor show wet.

The fuel gauge has been useless for a year in that it
reads full when full but empty when 2/3 full.

I have neither complaints about nor change in mileage,
and the bus starts well.

There are no open containers of gasoline in the garage;
the gas cap is in good repair and tightened down.

The fuel tank has never been out of this bus.

I pump my own gas and have for years and years; there's
been no abuse of the filler neck.

The gas tank is a little less than full: I filled the
tank, added fuel stabilizer, and drove ten miles ending
up in the garage where it's been sitting for a month.

Them's the facts.
