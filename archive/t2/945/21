hello mark  These weren't the best motors. H number on case with 8mm  oil 
pump studs.  had major problems cracking cases and head studs pulling.  I think 
the alloy mix was weaker on these and B cases. You can linebore them and  
install case savers and get some use out of them. You would be better off using  a 
73 and up case as they came with the factory installed case savers and were  
stronger cases. The best ones are out of the FI bugs but they don't have the  
holes for mounting the mech. fuel pump. Bob(Boston engines) donald preferrs  
these for building Zambonia motors. later  mark  dearing
