well I took my old 71 into some crazy places, I a train buff  probably
the craziest was chasing the American freedom train on a access road
(unpaved dirt road beside rr track) at about 50 plus MPH.....

chased and took photos of train for several miles, until my filling fell
out.......I didn't know a bus could fly I was off the ground that much.

someone on the back platform of the train has 8mm movies, would love to
see em.

took it some really strange other places, haven't taken my current auto
tranny bus anywhere near as far off road. but still it doesn't live on the
pavement

the 78 is one tough bus and will do far more than you can imagine
