yes and no.   I have totally removed the heat system from my 78, so I also
replaced the heat exchangers with J pipes, since there is no place to put
those pieces of tin I tried to run the engine (2L stock) without em. I
have guages and have monitored the engine and found no difference with or
without them installed.,

 now as has been said VW didn't put anything on the bus that wasn't needed
I can only speculate that they were needed to help clear the exhaust air
from the cooling system from aroound the heat exchangers, especially
when the bus wasn't moving and ducting air thru that space.  in any case
that is my experience, your mileage of course may vary
