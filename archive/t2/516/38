Subject: Heater Flapper Boxes

Hi Folks,

Congratulations to the gentleman who posted pix of his new engine -- in the 
immortal words of VW Trends, it looks San-o!

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the heater flapper boxes 
are different from the ones I have on my engine.  It looks like they have a 
vent that directs air down and away, unlike mine which have a Beetle-style 
musroom-shaped vent that doesn't direct air anywhere.  I remember seeing a 
later Bay (78-79) that had little ducts next to the heat exchangers, and the 
owner said the ducts were from the heater boxes.

So, my question is, where can I get me a set of these flapper boxes?  They 
seem like they're superior to the older Beetle-style boxes, and they seem 
like they would keep temps lower near the tranny and fuel lines.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions....
