You might find a better selection at Tahoe, if the weather is nice enough
to get there!

No.  The correct size is 185R14, load range C or D.  The ones you have
will work as long as they are load range D.  Load range C isn't enough in
your size.  The diameter is a bit smaller on the 195/75R14  Wear your
present tires out and switch to the original size!
