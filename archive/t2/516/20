> reassembling the front doors on my '70 westy.    I've got the
vent window, the outside trim piece with the wiper, and the inside
window wiper piece.    Could someone please tell me in what order to
assemble these three pieces?

mike - this is what i always do: install the outside scraper with aluminum.
before you do the first clip for that piece, it seems useful to line up the
next one and so on. inother words have the succeeding clip lined up in its
matching slot before snapping in the previous one. make sure you bend the
tab in, at the end of the top tip part. once that is in install the vent
wing. get the vent wing snug and get the bolt in place (and the screw at
the top of the vent wing frame). careful! not to rip the rubber from the
aluminum on that outer scraper when fiddling around with the vent wing.
install the inner scraper. use a regular screw driver to press in its
bent-metal scraper holder. cannot at the moment remember if you begin at
the front or rear, but one is easier than the other. hope it helps, pmail
if stuck    - steve
