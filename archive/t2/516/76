I've taken my '78 Westy into some lakes accessed only by non maintained
logging roads. Some rocks definately bigger than football size. The main
thing to remember is to place the tires on the rock you want to drive over,
within reason of course. That way you don't have as much risk in ripping of
a shock mount, heater box or worse putting a hole in the sump. Also keep in
mind the propane tank sits pretty low. The bays are geared nice and low also
in first so you can really creep up the hills.

One lake I used to go into had a set of six pot holes off set, three on each
side as you entered the campground that were at least a foot deep and about
two feet in diameter. My bus at the time, a '73 Riviera just rocked back and
forth right through them. As long as you take it slow and easy you'll be
surprised where your bus will take you.
