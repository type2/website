One other thing to consider.  I saw a list of production numbers (or maybe 
it was numbers imported to the USA) for the baywindow line and 1972 was the 
peak year, i.e. more built/imported than any other year bus.  This means 
you should find more of them in the yards than any other year (I have 
noticed that this is indeed the case!).  I had a '72 Westy for a while and 
it was a fine vehicle.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy a '72 model year if I 
was in the market for a bus.
