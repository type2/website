Subject: 72 Vans

One of the best vans I ever had was a 72 hardtop
westy. That car was great. At this age, I think it
mattters more how well a van was cared for then what
year it is. A good condition 72 is better then a 74
beeter.

Oh yeah, if you ever have to replace the master
cylander, be carefull of the resevoir as they are one
year only and NLA

Happy trails
Duncan
