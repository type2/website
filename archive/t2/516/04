Subject: Bus Depot Now Hiring!

The Bus Depot has immediate openings for customer service positions.
These are entry level positions, as we generally promote from within,
but there is growth potential. VW knowledge helps but isn't required, as
we can train. Good references are a must. 

We are a small company and very informal. However it is a very
fast-paced work environment, as we're all overworked and underpaid. :-)
Full time hours are weekdays 11 to 7, with nights and weekends off. Part
time would also be considered. We're located between Pottstown and
Quakertown, PA - about 45 minutes from Reading or Allentown, and about
an hour from Philly. 

Please email me at ron(-at-)busdepot.com if interested, and briefly indicate
your past work experience and approximate pay. If you're not personally
interested, but know of anyone else who might be, please spread the
word!
