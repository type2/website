Subject: HARD TO GET IN REVERSE

Hey,

My last 72 van had the same problem.
I couldn't even get it in reverse...
The first thing I replaced was the infamous
shifter coupler that is right where the shifter meets the
transmission. After replacing this I could shift into reverse
and shift in all other gears like it was new.
This was a very inexpensive fix and the first thing
I would recommend replacing with any shifting problems.
If that doesn't fix it then there are the other alternatives
mentioned by other listees.
Good luck and happy shifting.

Darren
