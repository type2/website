For some reason the knowledge base is very weak in this particular area.

I thought I had replied to this one the other day, but here goes again. I
must be getting absent minded. Where did I put my keys??

Go to shoptalkforums.com to the search page. Search in the "type4-um" only
for "stock cam" and you will find info. I did this just now and there was
some good data, but you have to sift through lots of posts to find it. There
is very little info on the lift of stock cams, but you will find the cam
opening/closing points which will give you the durations.

I might also suggest contacting web cam, they do make two stock type IV
grinds, so they should know what these figures are. Strangely, the stock
grind cams do not have published specs on their web page:

It is also quite possible to find your answers by measuring, you need a
degree wheel and a dial indicator setup on a mocked up motor.
