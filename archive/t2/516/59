Subject: Single Port manifolds

First - thanks to the folks that recommended an Oceanside mechanic. 3-4 good 
mechanics in the area. Should be easier for my son to schedule a tune-up.

Next on the list of things.

The bug, er.. bus was built to 1776cc (69*90.5) on single-port heads. PO had 
a PICT-30 re-jetted and re-mounted. Now, the plugs look OK, and we're 
running smooth up to 4K. We're not burning holes in pistons, but I would 
like to get some more carb on that motor.

What are my options keeping the SP heads? Any options that can use the stock 
manifold? What options for a 2-bbl? And dual carb options? Both Mr. Kadron 
and Mr. Hayden say getting SP Kadron manifolds are going to be quite 
difficult. (Anyone have a set?)

As always TIA -

Mike
