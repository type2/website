Subject: Re: [T2] the craziest off-road trip you've taken in your bus

Hi Folks,

When I lived in Colorado, I took many mountain biking and camping trips, and 
drove a few mountain roads that were 4WD-only, but my Bus went through fine. 
  I have Bridgestone Dueler tires and the roads were dry, so all we had to 
worry about were the washouts, boulders, steep inclines, and soft sand.  I 
found that slipping the clutch a little helped out with the steepest climbs 
and boulder crawls, and I found that a steady throttle and well-conserved 
momentum worked best with sand and mud.  I was amazed at how well my 
25-year-old vehicle stood up to the abuse.  Best of all, I was happy to have 
a comfortable place to camp once we got to the camping spots.

My craziest, however, was here in North Carolina.  We found a great camping 
spot off a Forest Service road, but the access to it was up a short, steep 
stretch of road.  Worse, there was a drainage ditch off the main road, and 
the overhang at the front of my Bus was too much to keep from hanging up.  
So, with darkness falling, we piled logs, boards, and whatever else we could 
find into the ditch, and I managed to get across while scraping and denting 
my front belly pan.  Then, with engine roaring, wheels spinning, and friends 
pushing, we made it to the top and camped on level ground.  On the way out, 
I got my (cheap EMPI) exhaust hung up and tore off a muffler, so we even 
ended up with a trophy for all our craziness.

Man, I love these vehicles!
