Todd,
A much better idea would be to have the pushrod tubes zinc, zinc nickel,
or cad plated.
If your going to take the time to remove them--I'd do it right--once is
enough for this job.

It doesn't cost much either---zinc or cad plating is cheap--

If you have any trouble locating a zinc plater--no problem--

My best friend is the largest in the state of ILL. he has a plant--a
whole city block in Chicago-- --ship them to me and I can get them
plated.

I give him all kinds of stuff --screws, nuts bolts, hitch draw
bars--etc.--when I want the stuff to look as new--and factory fresh-- 

This would be your best bet--
