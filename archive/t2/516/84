Well, when you ran with carbs, what ratios were you looking at on the 
WBO2 meter?  David thinks 12.5:1 is good for WOT, would you agree with 
this number.

I have found that if I have too much decel I get bucking.  Others have 
said that some decel fuel cut also helps out with mpg.

I have a fully adjustable EFI, now I'm just looking for the numbers to 
fill it.  I unfortunately don't have engines to burn up, so I'm looking 
for the numbers from other people that have done the testing.  I would 
venture to guess that there's a good number (such as 12.5:1) that is a 
good compromise between power and heat.

Thanks,
Mike
