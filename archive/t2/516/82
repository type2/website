If you're heading out on 80, there's a Firestone tire center on 
University in Berkeley (at Milvia, right after MLK).  Call them (510 
843 5454) and ask if they have chains for your tire size.  They seemed 
to have a large stock of chains when I was in there not long ago.

Correct size for a '76 is 185R14.  I'm almost positive that's correct 
for a '72, as well (all Bus years?)  That same Firestone shop has a 
pretty good price on the correct size / load rating / load index 
(185R14 C 99P) tire for a Bus (including campers), $50/tire (Capitol 
Radial SV-820).
