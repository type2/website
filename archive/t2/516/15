Subject: 2000cc engine would turn over??

Ok - I'm a dumb A**!  The engine on a vw bus that I just purchased doesn't run.  for a while, while I was trying to find out what was wrong with it it turned over fine.  It had good compression in all the cyclinders and it was geting fuel but it would not even spudder.  I check the timing the best I could, it seemed ok.  Then all of a sudden it stopped turning over?  Something was binding.  I turned the enngine over be hand in the opposite direction.  It did turn a half of revolutiong than stopped again.  Then I had a bright idea, not really, I use a socket and a large breaker bar on the stud that is in the middle of the crank shaft....YUP you guessed it it turned over a half revolution, hit the binding spot and snapped the head of the bolt off....I know like I started this email, I'm a dumb A**!!  Since then I've pulled the engine and I'm preparing to find out what went wrong.  But before I start i have a couple of question.
1. how the heck do I get the bolt out of the crank?? will an easy-out work?
2. any suggestion on what may be wrong with the engine??
3. I have to buy some bolts to put the engine in a stand, do you know what size I need??
--Please help--spring is coming and I hope to be on the road by then....Thanks in advance..
