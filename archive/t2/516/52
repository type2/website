You can forget about what you found in there being original. It was 
serviced with a good
general purpose grease at some time by someone. At any FLAPS you will find 
a shelf with
at least a dozen different brands and types of Gerneral Purpose grease. Pop 
the lid off
them and inspect for something similar in color and consistency to the type 
in there
now that seems to be a very good general purpose grease for this 
application, and
probably for quite a few others as well.
