 Don't know if it will be valid after 2/17/2004.
 I ran it on my 87 Fiero... I wanted to run it on my VW Bus, but
 apparently it only lets you do one (per IP I suppose). So use it wisely.

You can only do a CarFax on 1980 and up vehicles with the 17 digit vin #. 
It will not work on 79 and back buses.....
 
 
> 1 - I was replacing my turn signal lenses in the front (73 Bus). 
 Never the less, I removed them and discovered that there are TWO light
 bulbs in each turn signal. There is the regular LARGE bulb, that serves
 both as a turn signal light, as well as the parking light... and then
 there's a little small lightbulb that sits on the side. I put a lightbulb
 in there and it doesn't seem to do anything. Can anyone tell me what the
 SMALL light bulbs are for? Are they for the turn signal, parking, what?
 My wiring may be messed up, because they didn't turn on.

You know those orange reflectors on your doors that don't light up?
The little bulbs in the upper front lights are the side marker lights. They light up
at the same time as the red rear side markers. they come on when you turn your 
lights on.
  
> 2 - Is it important to have the BOTTOM tin pieces in the engine
 compartment? I'm going through my whole motor and am installing the flap
 kit I bought from BustedBus (thanks!). The two tin pieces I am talking
 about are the large ones that go on the VERY BOTTOM of the engine, not
 the small ones that go above the pushrod tubes.

Nah....you don't need them. VW wasted time and money putting them on every engine!

Yes, you should have them.
