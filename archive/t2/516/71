Howdy-

Well, with a lump in my throat I sold my last bus today. Both have gone to
great new owners who will be able give them the time that I am no longer able
to.

The best thing for me about owning a bus has been being part of this
community. Through this list, I have greatly enjoyed helping and being helped,
laughing, learning, and even the odd spirited argument! You are a great group
of characters!

Thanks for being part of my life, and best wishes to you all.

Cheers,
Matthew
