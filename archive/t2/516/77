By far the most memorable ; Driving a 1965 bus , I went down the north
side of Mt. Lemmon , north of Tucson, Az. At first it was pretty easy
going, a couple of long muddy level sections almost got me stuck , but I
gassed it and made it through. Then came some serious down hill sections
ending in a place where the road was washed out down to boulders! Well,
I couldn't go back up , too steep , so I went for it  ,do or die! There
were points when I was on only two wheels but gravity kept me moving
forward/down. And this with a brake master cylinder with only one
resivoir(sp) no backup if it failed! Further along there was a hill used
by motorcyclists for hill climbing ,about a 1/4 mile up getting
progressively steeper and I made it more than 2/3 of the way up that,
far past 45% from vertical. The bus had "snow" tires on the back ,which
helped, and in sandy dry riverbads it did O.K. but in loose sand it
would tend to sink in if I gassed it. Another great ride: In Canada
there are backroads that gofor 100's of miles  with empty camp grounds ,
zero traffic , streams full of fish , but remember to bring extra gas ,
food , etc. because if you get stuck or broke down you may not see
another car for days! One trick I learned , Put tubes in your tires and
use the old vw jack to break thebead and you can fix your own flats!
Another , sometimes you can BACK up hills you can't climb in first !!
Happy Trekking !! Tim
