Subject: Info on GA/FL camping spot/bus parts

Hey folks, I will be leaving in the next few days my very cold and grey 
country for a better world :-) (FL) and some sunshine in my 73 Westy 
without much heating. So the first 2 driving days will be some cold one. 
Am running the single Weber so I still wonder about icing, I did a 100 
miles test drive at 25F and everything look fine, just some small 
hesitation at stop sign, ok on freeway.

Anyway, I was wondering about nice camping spot in FL, I know that it's 
a crowded state in Feb. and March but still, they must be a few nice 
places to camp near the ocean, not to crowded with 30 foots RV's. I have 
the state park camping guide. Private campgrounds look expensive to me, 
from $40 to $100!!!!!! a night.

Am also looking for some VW parts scrap yard/dealers/garage in FL, just 
in case.

Any recommendation, advices would be appreciated.

Best regards, Ben (Montreal)
