Subject: check your fuel lines

So I was at my parents home today to bring in the mail and while i was there i decided to start my 1976 bus. I haven't started it since i put it away around Thanksgiving. Of course the battery was dead no problem I said to myself so finally after 5 minutes the engine started right up. After I was done backing my fathers car up to the front of the driveway i went back to my bus in my parents garage I decided since it was a nice day in Ct i was going to take her out for a spin as i was about to close the hatch I noticed a smell all of you reading this story knows the smell of gasoline coming from the engine. I noticed the gasoline was flowing out of the fittings to the cold start valve and a T fitting my first reaction was turn off the vechile which i did I forgot to mentioned she was running for about 10-15 minutes without me knowing the gasoline was flowing out onto the engine. After turning off the engine i went back to check the engine i noticed smoke coming off the warm engine block so not thinking about i do have a fire extinguisher in the from of my  bus but i think it is time to get a second one. So anyway i ran into my moms house she keeps one near the front door when i returned to the bus the engine was cooling down and the smoke finally disappeared so i called my good friend and vw club member at freccia brothers in Greenwich and he told me to bring it down to him. So i called AAA everybody who drives a vw much have AAA plus. So to make a long story short "everyone check your fuel line" before the warm weather comes it's a cheap thing to fix to save the life of a type2
