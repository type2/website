Hi, I've been off the list for a few months because my ISP kept bouncing
type2.com mail :-/

When I rebuilt my engine I used stainless button head socket screws and a
small dab of copper grease on each.  They are maybe double the price of
Phillips but look very neat.  One of the advantages of this head is that
there are many different ways of driving them - allen key, ratchet drive or
even ball ended screwdriver.
