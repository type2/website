<When I did mine, I heated the back side some with a torch and then used 3m 
super weatherstrip adhesive....Chris had the luxury of doing his *before* 
he had paint on his bus....mine was already painted and I was worried 
about the heat.>

Maybe I gave the wrong impression along the way <sorry> but I did mine post paint job too. I never heated the bus, always the tar panel. Never a problem with geting the panel too hot as it was always cool to the touch (judging by pressing with a hand on the outside of the panel). Glue was iffy (operator problem), heat seemed to do the job better. A combo like Dave mentioned prob would work better.
