Oh, you want some abuse do you? Start an engine debate? Abuse! Abuse! <grin!> 

I'm a fan of the 2.0 engine. Like that it is a HD verison of the Type I. 

Pros: Durability. 
Cons: Cost, rariety... I've gathered a few core engines so I can drive without fear of finding a 2.0 crank when I need one.

Beware of the 911 cooling, no cooling control. I have one in (for) my Beetle and liked it for 7500 miles but that was in the summer. Planning some sort of Corvair style cooling control.
