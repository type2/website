"Exhaust smells in the cabin are a big deal.  Don't go
around breathing carbon monoxide!"

Question- my '74 Westy exudes a lot of engine room
smells, ie. hot oil. I don't think it's CO (although I
know it's "colorless & odorless). Of course, it gets
more pronounced when I turn on the heat, but is always
present.

My bus is pretty pristine (43k original miles) but
does have a few oil drips which, of course, are
probably the culprit in my case. Any ideas?
