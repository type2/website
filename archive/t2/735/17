Wow.  I don't know how best to say this other than
using a household CO detector in a vehicle is bad
advice.    
    
CO detectors, like smoke detectors, do not work in
drafty areas, unless they are certified for duct
usage.  Research UL standard #2034, and pay attention
to the number of HOURS CO must reside in the detector
to trip the alarm.  70PPM CO (seventy parts per
million of Carbon Monoxide) can take as long as 4
hours to alarm and still certify as a residential
detector.  Also research usage instructions for
virtually all home/residential/RV CO detectors.  Like 
    
http://ccicontrols.com/3400RVIN.pdf#search='carbon%20monoxide%20detector%20operation%20instructions'
    
From the CCI link above:  "Do not install the CO Gas
Alarm...within 12 inches of all windows, exterior
doors, heating or return vents or other drafty areas."
  
This is because CO detectors ionize the air, and look
for the very narrow and unique wavelength of ionized
CO gas.  The gas cannot be blowing around.  It must be
diffusing around.  And to detect the gas, it has to
sit almost motionless in the detector some minutes or
hours at a time.
    
A household CO detector would not ever alarm in 100%
Carbon Monoxide, IF THE GAS WERE "MOVING."
    
Now if you wanted to still try to use a household CO
detector, and this is sketchy at best, you would need
to follow a complex non-approved protocol:  (1) Mount
a CO detector "high" in the bus interior.  (2) Be
driving the vehicle with the burned oil smell
noticable (What I believe Newby was describing).  (3)
Pull over to the side of the road, (4) Turn-off the
engine, (5) Quickly close all windows, (6) Shut-the
door quickly, and (7) Wait for 6 to 8 hours to see if
the detector trips.  If it did, you have CO
confirmation.  If it did not, you still cannot be
certain a CO problem does not exist, due to the
technology of household CO detectors.
   
Sorry.  I don't like to pound peoples opinions into
the ground, but Newbee (Newby) has a safety hazard on
his hands that most likely cannot be diagnosed with a
household CO detector.   Sorry Bob, and sorry Newby to
display discord on the T2 list.  :-O
   
To accurately measure CO in a car interior, you would
need a machine nearly identical to the DEQ Exhaust
sniffers, but with a higher testing range.   I hope
this is not much ado about nothing.
