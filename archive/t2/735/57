And if you think you want to do an engine conversion beware, the conversion oil pan might be closer to the ground that you expect! The crossmember (version 1.0) on my Corvair is quite a bit closer to the ground than the bottom of the 2.0 VW that it replaces. Oil pan not a problem. I'll prob go back and build a Porsche 911 style crossmember that supports the engine from behind to regain that clearance. 

Same problem with the Subbie conversion folks - that oil pan is too low without rework. Also same with the VW Golf engine conversion unless they tilt the engine and use a diesel oil pan. 

Convert and then consider if you REALLY want to lower it. 

Greater handling gains made through wheels, tires, sway bars, etc than just lowering. Saw a Eurovan with a 911 engine in back on Dwelle. Despite it's tall self, it apparently handled very well!

I can't give up the wheel travel myself.
