Everything said here is true and good, and I learned a lot from the
discussion, but before we push the panic button, often the smells are
from oil leaking onto the heat exchangers. One the leak is fixed, the
oil will burn off after several hours of driving.

If CO is suspected, maybe the bus could be left closed and idling
outdoors for the CO buildup to occur in non-drafty conditions?
