I certainly bow to your far greater expertise in all matters, being quite
nearly a neophyte myself, but.. now that my head is bowed, I must reiterate
that when I switched to Mobil 1, within a minute of starting my engine for the
test run, it started leaking profusely (to the point of being undriveable)
from not one but four places where it hadn't leaked a drop of the NAPA 10W30
dino oil that had been in there before.  And I really mean not a drop -- this
is still a relatively new engine, and it has never required me to add any oil
at all between 3,000-mile oil changes.

All the leaks were easy to fix (new valve cover gasket, retorque case studs,
tighten and re-clamp oil hose, more torque on the sump plate nuts), but...
that sure made me a believer in the idea that synthetic oil does a better job
of finding leaks than dino!
