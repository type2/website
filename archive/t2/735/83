Guys,

When I did mine, I heated the back side some with a torch and then used 3m 
super weatherstrip adhesive....Chris had the luxury of doing his *before* 
he had paint on his bus....mine was already painted and I was worried 
about the heat.

I have only had two panels that I put in come loose so far(120F weather).

The difference in the side panels and doors is just *awesome*...knuckle 
knocking down the side of the bus...it sounds better than a Lexus or 
Infinity.

And *no* worries about condensation rust....

YMMV

Cheers, dave

 I tried a blow torch and a hair dryer. Both worked okay. Your best bet would be a heat gun (super hair dryer). Go see teh Harbor Freight or Northern Tools guys out near Hamilton Place Mall.
