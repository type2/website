Subject: newby again 

cheers everyone for the responses, i am a bit more knowledgeable about
synthetic v standard oil and also when i replace the exhaust will probably
go with something original but as good as new i can find rather than trying
to add something performance

another basic question.....and tried searching the archives but didn't seem
to be working on my work comp.

i have been using high octane premium (98) unleaded fuel and adding a lead
replacement substitute and i was under the impression this is what's best
for my bus ......leaded being hard to find these days........any
advantages/disadvantages to this?......i just read that the air cooled bus
doesn't need the lead replacement additive.......

am i just wasting my dough shelling out extra for high octane fuel and the
additive when i will get the same results with normal unleaded by itself?

and a final query.......my air cooling hoses/tubing in the engine have had it
and need replacing ......however my bus is still running pretty cool and i
haven't detected any heat problems......any damage be done driving around for
a week or so without them until i can get out to a shop and get some new ones?
