What I learned was that putting glue on both surfaces was not a suggestion... <grin!> 

Be SURE to heat it enough to get the tar panels to lay flat before you try to glue them down. They will try to curl if your tar material came in a roll. On a curved surface I would prob test fit, heat to curve, glue, and attach. Then more if needed to get it to lay just right.
