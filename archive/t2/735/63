Hello Don Chris      Pros durability ??   how about extra oil leaks, dropped 
valve seats , an exhust system that sucks.  LOL   I personally would go with 
the 1776 type 1 built on a late  FI bug case . makeing sure that all the flaps 
and themostat etc was there . using a type 4 oil cooler and a porsche fan 
pulley and stay away from tawian chrome or anything made there .  It pays to 
invest in big valve heads .  Headers and carbs are other choices that you will need 
to make.   later and have fun mark Dearing
