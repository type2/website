'79 Westy was the only bay window camper to have a "Westfalia"  
sticker on the rear of the pop top as shipped from the factory, I think.

Steering wheel changed in '78 .. but that's easily end-user  
replaceable, so maybe it's not such a good indicator.

Campers are easier to tell apart year-to-year up through '76 ... from  
'76-'79, the Westfalia campers were the same, except for the  
aforementioned sticker.  I think '75 was the first "front facing" pop- 
top (with full upper bunk).
