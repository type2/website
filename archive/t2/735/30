Subject: CV joint boots

Greetings,
     I am starting to revive my '72 Weekender, and part of the process
is that I will have to replace the CV joint boots.  I replaced them
about 16 months before I quit driving the bus, and they were already
cracked and no good.  I want a boot that will last longer that 16
months.  I did check the archives and found reference to Rockford CV
(http://www.rockfordcv.com/)  Is this the best boot for our busses?  If
not, what do you all suggest?

Thanks,
Stuart Neil
