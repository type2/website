<Go to your local roofing supply and look over their big rolls of
asphalt roofing material.  One side has a tear away liner.>

Exactly what I have used. I haven't driven the van yet so no comment on it's effectiveness but it does mimic OEM materials I have found in other cars. 

I have lined the doors and wow what a solid sound they have... 

Van sat outside for several years after this was installed. No stink, no melting runny tar. So far so good, contact cement did a good job of sticking it to the steel but I recommend heating it (one side will melt) and using that method. I did my sliding door that way with better results than the glue. I wouldn't use it in the engine compartment without some testing. Thinking it it might melt. Put a piece back there and go for a hot drive. Even if it did you could encapsulate it in plastic wrap with heat sealed seams on the plastic making a bag. I plan to combine it with jute for a mat over the engine compartment. 

About $50 (in TN) like Dave said for more than you'll ever use. Hmmm, didn't see my roll when we moved. Need to look for that!
