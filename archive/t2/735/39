Subject: grease

While changing my brakes I had a bad wheel cylinder, bus has set 5 years 
grease all over every thing, I had read about using any purple liquid I had just 
washed a load of clothes IM a widow so I had liquid tide brushed this on and 
hit it with the water hose I have never had anything work that fast no grease 
left at all. Also i used it full strength on my window rubber also worked 
great,Neal
