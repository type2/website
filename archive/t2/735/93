Subject: stereo wiring double check

one goal for my 69 bus was to re-wire my stereo so it will come on without
the ignition key. the PO had it wired with the yellow wire [the "to constant
battery" *] on fuse number 10 [the accessory fuse], and the red wire [the
"to accessory fuse" *] on fuse number 1 [the hot fuse]. if i reverse this
situation am i complete?  - steve
