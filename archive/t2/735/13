and now you run nothing but synthetic ????   yes I suspect it leaks out
easier, but for the same reason it lubricates better.   Synthetic has a
smaller molecule size and gets into the places that need lubricating
easier.

  as for me I ran dino oil for the break in period (ever wonder why you
can't break in an engine with synthetic??)  switched to synthetic and
haven't put a drop of anything else in there since.
  heck also use synthetic final drive oil, auto tranny fluid, even
synthetic brake fluid...
