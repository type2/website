I had this problem.  My heating system has been
unplugged since I got the bus.  No big loss, heh. 
Anyhow, I later found this smoke coming from the FRONT
of the bus.  Only when the engine was real hot.  The
local VW told me, 'you have an oil leak.'  What does
that have to do with it??  Well, oil is leaking from
somewhere (I suspect the dipstick tube and have bought
a new one), and dripping down to the heat exchanger
(disconnected, and building up in the heater
circulation (or whatever you call them) tubes.  If I
left the vents open, no problem, the air pulled the
fumes out the back.  When I had the vent closed, the
smoke built up until it seeped out the vents up front.
 Fix for me:  I just disconnected those hoses. 
Nothing going to the back at all.  But I don't want
the measly heat that they produce anyway.  I have
other options, har har.  Unless somebody could tell me
why I need it??

Good luck...KR
