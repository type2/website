Last I heard, the '68-71 Bays were the only thing where even Jake Raby 
doesn't recommend a T4 engine.  Something about the hanger bar being
an absoulte nightmare, IIRC.  While I'm sure it can be done (anything
can be done if you throw enough dollars at it), if *Raby* steers away from
it, you know it ain't gonna be easy.

Cooling options -- there's also a DTM for Type 1 engines, and for the T4
you could build a NextGen upright, which I think lets you use the 
thermostat.
