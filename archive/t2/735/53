Subject: Re: [T2] "upgrading"

Do what you want but my Beetle is lowered 2" up front, 1" out back. The "look" is right, the ride is not so hot. Choppy. Much less suspension travel to soak up crummy streets. 

I have a Type IV 2.0 in the Beetle and had one in the bus. It's fine in the Beetle and honestly if 60-65 mph is your goal, in stock form the 2.0 is fine in the bus. However it is still underpowered and undergeared for 75 mph. Not to mention brakes, suspension. Talk tot he guys at Shoptalkforums for hints on bigger engines. They build them. Raby is an option.

You might be a better candidate for an engine transplant. once again Shoptalkforums... Don't hack before you research. Hacked cars sometimes won't resell for as much as a none hacked vehicle. Who's going to work on it? (assuming you can't). 

Higher gear options are as far as I know limited. The 1978/79 had the highest gear ratios in the baywindow line and that still isn't very high. You might be looking for aftermarket gears or a Porche 901 tranny which had a BUNCH of gear options. It's a 5 speed too so you get whatever top gear you want and can have a close ratio 4 speed as well.
