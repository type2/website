Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Choices for a 71

The aluminum cases are garbage!

My recommendation is to keep the style engine the van came with from the
factory. This can be improved, but don't switch to a T-4 for this instance.
Build a nice engine, a stroker if you can afford it, with dual carbs, and
you'll be very pleased.
