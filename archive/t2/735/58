Subject: Engine Choices for a 71

Yes, I have a 71 a-comin'. It'll be in my garage tomorrow night. The
price is right too... FREE.

I'm getting an opportunity to take this bus to something resembling
perfection since I don't have to drive it. So I get to take my time,
do things right (or as right as I feel like doing 'em), and do things
as time and funds permit.

Anyway, I'm sketching out my basic plan and am torn between a solid
1776 engine and a 2.0 Type 4 with either the Porsche cooling, or (if I
have the $$) a DTM. Note that the engine purchase isn't happening
until the next time I get a bonus... Possibly many months away.
Depends on the rest of the team here...

The 1776 will be slightly cheaper, and I like the idea of having a
type 1 engine to play with.

I feel the Type 4 will be more reliable and I have more experience there.

(A stock 1600DP isn't in my plan unless I stumble on one for free or nearly
so.)

The bus currently doesn't have any engine at all, so I'm wide open
here. Fuel delivery choices will be made after the primary engine
choice.

Opinions? Especially from folks who've done both... =)
