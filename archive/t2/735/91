Subject: Fuel Additives (was: newby again)

When I first got my 73 when I lived in California I ran super unleaded.

Someone on this list said it wasn't needed, so I switched to the
bottom grade. Not a difference was seen!

Here in Denver, I've been dabbling with advancing timing and using
higher octane gas. I can get 1-2 degrees more advance before pinging
with super. (This is a really long process since you have to drain the
tank before changing grade if you want accurate results.) Whoopdeedoo.

I doubt any engine that's still running now needs those additives.
It's almost (note the "ALMOST") guaranteed that older engines have
been rebuilt, or at least the heads, with hardened seats, tougher
valves, etc.
