hello rogelio    I would pull the motor and replace the whole cluch unit  
disc, plate and tob  Also use the super clips that are like a spring and have a 
loop on them so that they can also be wire tied to the crosshaft to keep the 
TOB from coming off the crosshaft  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
