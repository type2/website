The crossmember (version 1.0) on my Corvair is quite a bit closer to the ground than the bottom of the 2.0 VW that it replaces. Oil pan not a problem. I'll prob go back and build a Porsche 911 style crossmember that supports the engine from behind to regain that clearance.

The Subaru dunebuggy folks have come up with a shallower oil pan that
helps, but you will still lose ground clearance relative to the stock
engine.
