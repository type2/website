Subject: Koni Shock Auction [UPDATE]

Couple update's as the auction comes to a close.  I updated the auction page
again with more info such as the weight of the shock's.  (Only needed by
International bidders since I'll pay full shipping for US/Canada) Also, a
receipt will be created in the name of the winner so they can take advantage
of the warranty/rebuild offer from Koni.  

Again, the auction end's this Friday (05.06.2005) at 8pm MST (GMT -7)

Current high bid is $450.00
