Subject: RE: Noise in Clutch

Hi Rogelio,

I just ran across this article on the clutch Bowden tube. It is the best explanation I have seen on the subject. If it is not adjusted properly, it can lead to clutch vibration.

Good Luck,

Now, driving there is a sound coming from that area and the clutch pedal 
vibrates a lot, but if I depress the pedal a little bit the noise and 
vibration go away. Do I need to tighten or loosen the clutch wing nut? Or 
am I looking at something different and more involved?
Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks,
