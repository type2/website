Subject: RE: [T2] Engine Choices for a 71

     I like the type4 motor, for the reliability and power.  I think it 
depends on what you want out of this bus.  Anyway, I have NOT done both... 
yet, so I will refrain from offering too many opinions.  I have worked with 
both type1 and type4 motors though, and I preffer the type4 to drive and the 
type1 to work on :-).  I am working on setting up a type4 motor for a bug, 
though, so I will point you to info on the conversion:

Random pages I came accross:
http://www.aircooledtech.com/type4_upright_conversion/
http://www.dolphinsci.com/typeIV.html
http://www.tunacan.net/t4/howto/starting/

This is the book that explains how to make the cooling yoursef out of type1 
and type4 parts:
http://www.nextgen-usa.com/

And here is the DTM page, which I'm sure you've been to:
http://www.massivetype4.com

     I would think you could put an upright type4 into the 71 without too 
much trouble, if you are willing to spend the time uprighting the type4 
engine.  I would just make my own rear support hanger out of all-thread and 
box steel tubing, like the bug motor supports for performance engines.  
Since you have plenty of time, and seem to preffer the type4...  I dunno, 
that would seem the more fun route to me.

    I was a lucky ducky and found a 'used' DTM kit with EVERYTHING included, 
never before put on an engine, for $250!!!
