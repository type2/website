<Two questions:  How do you heat the stuff? 
and..Where in TN are you?>

I tried a blow torch and a hair dryer. Both worked okay. Your best bet would be a heat gun (super hair dryer). Go see teh Harbor Freight or Northern Tools guys out near Hamilton Place Mall.

I'm in Cookeville - about 100 miles north of you.
