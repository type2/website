Subject: Carb Solenoids

I asked this over on The Samba but haven't really gotten anywhere. So
time for ya'll to jump in. =)

The flat solenoid on my 73 with stock dual solex carbs doesn't click
when power is applied. I had 2 more in a box and tried them. Same
results. The housing lists "65 Ohms" so I checked from the spade
connector to the housing. Zero continuity.

I then decided to take it apart and see what it is, exactly:

The mushroom shaped thingee is a plunger that blocks one of the two
air ports. The other one is always open. Both ports line up with holes
in the carb.

The battery looking thing appears to be a capacitor. And it shows
67-ish ohms, awfully close to the marking on the housing.

The flat part appears to be a lever that lifts when power is applied.
It lifts the plunger from the hole. But power doesn't make it from the
spade connector through the cap to the lever.

What function does this doohickey serve?
Does the cap need to be charged for a while before it starts dumping
juice to the lever?
Would anything be harmed by either just removing the plunger or
removing the doohickey altogether?
