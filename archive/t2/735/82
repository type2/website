John,

As Richard said, this is a typical port installed(or dealer) butchered A/C 
compressor install.  When I worked for VWOA(VPC) back in the 70's all mods 
to the cars like this one were approved by VWOA before we could sell the 
A/C kits.  The actual installation involved a template to be used for the 
cut...needless to say, when the port installers did the actual cutting, 
they were getting paid by-the-install and cut corners(no pun intended) 
anyplace they could.

When I restored my bus, I sent bustedbus a pic of what I needed from a 
donor bus and they cut out a piece that fit and covered it almost 
perfectly.

I used two sheet metal screws to hold the new body piece in and I suspect 
that not many people would notice it after being painted as it matched in 
with the square area on the body to the left and rear.

When I reinstalled my A/C I mounted the new rotary compressor totally 
*under* the tin.

Some people have fabricated plastic pieces to "rebuild" the missing body 
tin.

See the archives.

Cheers, dave
