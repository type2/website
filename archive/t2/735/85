Subject: Re: [T2] Missing tin?

i often have been guilty of using roof flashing ....buy it in roofing section at lowes homedepot etc..
cuts real easy and does the job for covering holes and using as spare tin......
poke small hole in it and screw a tin screw right in it hold it in place...
can even cut to near perfection of normal piece of tin that is missing,.
serves the purpose.
peace

Some people have fabricated plastic pieces to "rebuild" the missing body 
tin.

See the archives.

Cheers, dave




Peace and Love
Chris
