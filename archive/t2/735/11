I bought a new Muir when I first got my Bus, then a few weeks later I happened across a second edition (circa 1971) at my favorite used bookstore for $7 - it looks almost new!  The bookstore has since wised up and has started pulling "vintage" books off the shelf and selling them at a premium in a seperate section - I saw another second edition there recently for $40...
