Subject: source for heat shrink tubing in bulk?

All,
     I've used little multi-packs of heat shrink tubing from Radio Shack and 
I like it:

http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&product%5Fid=278-1627

    I think they probably charge too much though.  Does anybody on the list 
know of a place where I could buy a larger quantity of this stuff?  I did a 
search on the net, and the number of options and carriers made my head hurt. 
  Maybe there is a place that sells it specifically for automotive use?  The 
3/16", and 1/8" seem to come in handy the most (seem to work well on auto 
wires).  If there are suggestions of the best size to get in bulk, I'll take 
those too.  I was thinking of getting something like a 50' spool of the two 
most useful sizes.

Thanks,
Jaybird
