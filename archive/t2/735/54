The suspension and brakes were designed to work at the speeds that the
original engines were capable of providing.  Pushing a bus faster might be
a wee bit dangerous.

Lowering?  Religious argument.  My philosophy is to leave things as is
unless there is a good engineering reason (and I am an engineer) to change
them.  One of the things I really like about my bus is that it has great
ground clearance and I don't want to join the modern minivans crawling on
the ground.
