Safety alert.  Newbee, I would assume the worst.  If
you are smelling engine odors during engine operation
(versus sitting in the T2 with engine off) then your
heating system integrity is compromised.  So is your
safety.  You must assume Carbon Monoxide accompanies
the hot oil smell.  After all, the hot oil gasses are
further pressurized by blow-by gasses, which certainly
DO contain Carbon Monoxide.
   
There is the possibility that positive crankcase
pressure and fumes are leaking into the "fresh air
space" above the engine.  They would then be aspirated
or "breathed in" by the heater fan blower.  But CO
poisoning can cause death.  I don't know your level of
Air Cooled T2 engine expertise Newbee, but I would
strongly suggest you seek-out a competent mechanic to
diagnose and correct your engine smell problem
quickly.
    
Excessive blow-by.  Improperly assembled Crankcase
ventilation.  Exhaust smoke into the "fresh air
space."  Missing or damaged engine compartment access
door seal.  Leaky exhaust, complicated by missing or
damaged around-engine foam seal.  All conjecture.  But
your safety is paramount.
   
Do you get headaches when you drive the bus? 
Headaches are a symptom of CO poisoning, I believe.
