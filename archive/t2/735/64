Most of the systems I looked at that were based around upright cooling had cooling control. There was one system that you built yourself from Type IV shrouding and Type I parts. I liked it alot (home built fits my budget). 

What you did was buy their book and they showed you how. I have a copy. Cna't remember the name, maybe someone else can tell us. 

Look at the Corvair engine cooling system. Works fine. Would work on a VW too. Fan belt is not so good. As long as you learn how to adjust the fan belt (loose enough that you can rotate the alternator fan with 1 finger) it is fine. Lots written about special pulleys, springs, particular fan belts (wrapped construction), etc. 

www.ahnendorp.com sold me my 911 replica system in 1995. When I put the Beetle back together, I'll have their fan but the cylinder shrouding will be custom made by me from Type IV shrouding, and the lower tin will duplcate the Corvair lower tin work giving me cooling control. ALOT of work but I REALLY like the look and the function is fine I think. I did some heavy work with my 2.0 with that shroud and the head temps were normal bus temps (350F). Now there are others (Raby among others) that prob have alot more testing behind them to clue them in.
