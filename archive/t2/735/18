Subject: Great gear oil pump

Getting gear oil into a bus tranny is not exactly a fun task. I have tried a
few delivery methods that have all worked fair at best. A while ago I picked
up a little gadget at a chain parts store (not sure which one - could be
Advance or Pep Boys): an "Outboard Motor Lower Section Oil Pump". Tonight I
finally got to use it for the first time and it works great! I have to admit
that the first time use was on the MGB and not the bus, but getting to the
differential oil plug on the B is similarly inconvenient.

Here is a picture from the manufacturer's (?) website:

The packing of mine says Powerbuilt 648960, but powerbuilttools.com does not
list it anymore. So, look for this thing in some other brand's repackaging.

Jay Ollom saw this on my work bench (still unused) a few days ago and
suggested that the pump from a GOJO (?) hand cleaner jug has worked well for
him and his buses.
