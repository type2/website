Subject: Re: [T2] Who actually still uses the Muir?

I totally agree... I found a really ratty copy of the 25th Anniversary Edition
of the Muir book in my 73 Bus when I bought it. It was sitting next to several
dirty burned spoons, a couple of empty film cases, and some brillo pads... (I
won't ask, but I've got an idea...)

I started to read the book and found it very entertaining. I ended up buying
the newest copy of it off of Amazon.com just a few short weeks later. It was
green... (not to be confused with the Bentley manual) and I think it was the
30th or 35th anniversary edition of the book? I've somehow misplaced the new
one.. but I've got the 25th right next to me. I seem to remember that in the
new one there was some sort of section dedicated to this guy. He apparently
died shortly after that last edition or something to that effect???

Either way, I completely agree with you... this is the first time I've
actually ever read any kind of technical manual that somehow ends up being
entertaining. I mean... even something as mundane and unbelievably boring as
talking about headlight wiring... he manages to somehow make it interesting
reading...
