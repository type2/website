Will,

Go to your local roofing supply and look over their big rolls of
asphalt roofing material.  One side has a tear away liner.  

References in the archive from several different people...how to glue it 
on side panels etc....

Works absolutely great.  I can't tell if the engine is running or not at 
stoplights.

About $50 for waaay more than you need.

Cheers, dave
