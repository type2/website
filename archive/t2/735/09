Subject: Noise in Clutch

Well,

I just dropped the engine on my 69 bus because the clutch throw out bearing 
keeps popping out of place. I put everything back making
sure that the bushing of the throw out lever is properly in place (no side 
to side play) so hopefully this is last time I have to deal with it.
Now, driving there is a sound coming from that area and the clutch pedal 
vibrates a lot, but if I depress the pedal a little bit the noise and 
vibration go away. Do I need to tighten or loosen the clutch wing nut? Or 
am I looking at something different and more involved?
Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks,
