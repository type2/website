I've had them on my bus and bug long enough that I forget exactly what
year I installed them (probably '98).  They are still working fine with
no cracks.

I had very bad luck with "Qualitat" and "Lobro" boots before I
tried the Rockfords.  You'd think that the Lobro boots would be good, as
they are the suppliers of the CV joints!
