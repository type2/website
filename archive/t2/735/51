Subject: "upgrading"

My 74 has a stock setup..1800 dual carb..
I am thinking... if I were to put in a 2L or larger type 4 with 
new FI system and a modified tranny so that the gears were "taller"
I should be able to run a bit higher freeway speed .. say 70-75..
with less stress on the engine.. with a bigger engine I wouldnt miss
any of the lower end gearing... like in 1st.
  So I guess the general question would be.. 2.2Liter with megasquirt?
is 2.2 possible without losing longevity?
also considering a 2" or so drop.

thoughts?
suggestions?TIA
