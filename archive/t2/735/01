Subject: re: Missing tin?

 The two hoses to the left of the engine are leftover from an old ac unit so
 that makes perfect sense.I was hoping I could just bolt another piece of
tin
 in.I just went out in the basement and found the correct piece of tin.I
 bought it at a swap meet but must not have looked at it very good cause I
 didnt think it would help.Its much better now but I still have a gap on the
 front left.If you look at pict1772 you can see where they cut the lip.I
 might try to fabricate something out of some aluminum sheathing and screw
it
 in there.Or I guess I could cut the lip off of a junk bus and have someone
 weld it in.Thats a really shitty place for someone to screw up the
lip,right
 above the oil cooler.You couldnt pick a hotter spot to let air in.Oh
 well.guess Ill get some aluminum tape and duct tape for now.Maybe shove
some
 of the old seal in there till I can get it fixed right.
