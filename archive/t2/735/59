Lowering is indeed a religious arguement around here.  I *think* I've got my 
co-worker convinced *not* to lower his '70 Westy, but can't be too sure about him.
Did manage to convince him (via a road trip to Puyallup) that 185R14's are a 
better tire for a Bus than his 165R15 .. not trying to start another tire jihad, just
sayin'...

Whether the 2L/FI is a worthwhile upgrade is subjective, and I can't really say.  
'75 is *supposed to have a 1.8 FI engine, but when I bought mine it had a 1.7L
with Weber ICTs.  Engine blew a few weeks later, replace it with a 2L, still using
the carbs until I can get one of the other cars on the road for some FI-installation
downtime.  It's *much* better with the 2L than it was before, but my baseline
for reference is screwy.
