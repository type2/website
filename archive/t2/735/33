Subject: ADMIN: Language

Folks, I've noticed that some of us are getting a bit loose with the
profane language.  The type 2 list is a technical resource that should be
accessable to everyone, so everyone is asked to keep our language civil.

Yes, this is a car list, but not everyone involved with buses is crude and
rude.  The "F" word is definitely out, as is the "S" word.  Even the "D"
word should be used with utmost discretion.

When posting, pretend that your mother, your wife, your priest, your boss,
and your 6-year old daughter will all read your words.  It's a pretty
safe bet that someone's mother, wife, priest, boss or daughter will read
them, so respect should be shown.

Thanks for your cooperation and for making the type 2 list the best source
of bus information on the 'net!

George Lyle
