Probably not.

Red is for battery power to the stereo
Yellow is for Clock, Memory (station memory buttons),
fake car alarm (blinking light on the dash).  Yellow
goes to +V (not switched) so that the clock, memory,
and "fake alarm" all work with the key off.

The Red wire only gets +V when car is switched on.
Means you must have key in on position (burning
points?) to have radio in operation.


To use radio without key:

You have to get both RED and YELLOW to
+V (not switched) where the yellow is at right
now.

I know this because I just wired mine up, and yes,
I wired mine so I can listen to radio without the
key.
