Subject: Re: [T2] "upgrading"

Hi Leftcoaster,

The golden rule for engine building is this:  There are three factors 
to any engine upgrade:
POWER, RELIABILITY & ECONOMY.
Pick two, and build accordingly. You can't have all three at the same 
time.

A powerful and reliable engine is possible, but it is going to cost you.

Suggestion:
The 1976-79 "091" transmission has a 5% higher 4th gear... that would 
get you moving faster without the need for the engine to be upgraded. 
The power difference between a good-running 1.8L and an FI 2L is 
actually a lot smaller than you might think. The main advantages are 
that the powerband is flatter with FI, and emissions are lower. You 
will have to swap bell-housings and linkage parts to fit an 091 tranny 
into a 74 bus.


Happy trails,
