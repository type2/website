The H4 headlights are not street legal for a reason. In addition to the
added brightness, the beam shape is not correct and will shine into oncoming
drivers' eyes. Be curteous and safe... stick with the street legal
headlights. No one wants to be involved in a head-on because they were
blinded by some redneck's brights. The Whitney catalog has the street legal
Hellas for the same price as Bus Depot's H4's. Don't let money be the reason
that you don't go street legal. The Hellas are plenty bright.
