The crankcase is supposed to vent into the S-Boot (intake). What isn't
normal is there's a leak in the crankcase somewhere. Or the breather
is supposed to be valved to only release at a pressure in the
crankcase that's higher than manifold vacuum.

I just need to find out whether the thing should be valved.
