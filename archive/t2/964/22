Subject: Picture or Length of Hydraulic lifter push rod

Hello

Recently, in the past few months, Richard Atwell posted a picture of the
solid lifter push rod and the hydraulic lifter push rod side by side.  I
believe he also mentioned their respective lengths.

This is the best I can find via the archives:

I could not find a picture on Richard's site:

I am looking down two push rod tubes on a GD coded engine and I see the
'paper clip' retainer on both lifters, so the lifters are definately
hydraulic. I am just having a senior's moment on the push rods themselves,
so an actual LENGTH would be appreciated.

Thanks all.  Happy camping....
