Gentlemen, and ladies, of the list, take time,...to enjoy who you are and what
you do...and if you are an associate of this list....what is your ride....and
take a "Big Look"... and "breathe", and say.....aaahhhh! These "buses" are an
icon of a "space in time", and no choclate rabbits, or "cute ladies", with
pink ears, will ever change that fact,.."Dig" in and enjoy...there are
immeserable "things", that come with "them"!  Have a Happy Easter, or
Chocolate Rabbit "time"
