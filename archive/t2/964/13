Subject: Locked up #1 main bearing  

Recently built a 1641 with nicely machined used parts.  300 miles later the
engine would not spin with the starter,  thought hmm

The cranks (engines) last failure was a stuck #1 main bearing also.  It is a
VW welded up to be a counter weighted crank.  So I sent it off to RIMCO to get
cut.  was a 010 under, Got it back a 020 under crank, thought all was good.

Case got cut to .04 also, nothing on the thrust

ETC.  put it back together

Then it started being hard to turn after about 300 miles in the morning after
it all got cold.

Then Friday morning it did not want to turn over, luckly at home.

I set the endplay on the crank using a dial indicator, so I don't guess that
is what caused it.  Im not seeing any friction on the back of the bearing, or
the shims, and it did not look like it took off

What should I be looking for or should I just scrap the case and crank, or
just one of them?

Thanks in advance.

p.s. engine building is fun when you can take the engine out in under an hour,
and swap a spare in.
