Hi Joshua,

It's not just Sunday today, it's Easter Sunday. For those who  
celebrate Sundays, this is a big one, if not the biggest. (Superbowl  
notwithstanding)

Why are you pulling the head? Have you checked the valves and done a  
compression test yet? ?

Working inside the engine compartment of a 72 bus sounds like torture  
to me. Without that top hatch it's a huge PITA to get at things.  
You'd be better off in the long run dropping the engine.

But before you go that far, tell us the compression numbers. Maybe  
the problem isn't in the head.


Happy Trails,
