If you haven't done this simple SIMPLE upgrade yet,
DO IT NOW.

I didn't even get the nice ones, rather some cheaper versions off of 
eHaaay for $30 and they are SOOOO much better than the stock lights.

I have already upgraded the wiring and improved the ground connection, 
but this was night and day better than even those improvements.
