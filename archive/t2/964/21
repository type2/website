this is in the harness by the double relay 
one pic shows the other plugs coming from the cross plug 
  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not enough pics of the whole harness. I need more of the area by the double relay.

That cross plug looks like it goes to the speed limit switch on a 80-83.5 Calif Vanagon. 

Do you have a Vanagon?

Is there another plug right near the the double relay plug with 5 terminals in a row?

Is there a single green wire in the harness? [ALL the others are white]

How many terminals are in the black plug going to the AFM, 6 or 7?
