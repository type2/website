Sitting here in South Bend, Indiana looking at 2" of fresh snow on the
ground this morning.  Very depresing!  The snow is covering the wood lillies
and trillium that popped up in last week's 70 degree weather.  That weather
had us in a bus frame of mind and preparations were being made for the
season.

Hard to believe only 6 weeks from today Buses by the Beach will hold it's
5th Annual Spring gathering!

I just posted a call for items for the Saturday raffle on our website at
www.busebythebeach.com

Can't wait for bus weather!
