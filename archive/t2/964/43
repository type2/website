Subject: Vacuum Leak in Crankcase?

I've been hunting for this bugger for months. Checking every hose and
connector. Even finding minute cracks in the S-Boot. But none of the
work completely cured the vacuum leak symptoms:

Bucking under light throttle.
Rough idle.
No idle when cold.

Today I pulled the hose off the crankcase vent and pinched it. No
vacuum leak!! The hoses themselves are fine. I've noticed the bus runs
rough when the oil cap is off, so this makes sense...

I checked the filler cap and neck and the dipstick tube. All appear to be good.

Is the breather supposed to be valved to prevent this?
