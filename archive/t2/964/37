Subject: before or after?

Hi all,

We live close to the beach in Calif., and we're both trying to get hired on 
as teachers in Arizona (Prescott, Humboldt Unified, Chino Valley, Mingus, 
etc. We've also applied to Pinon).

Anyway, here's my dilemma: since moving Chaco back out to California 2 years 
ago, (we bought her in NM), the teeny little rust spots have grown. Ocean 
air is terrible for progressing rust faster than usual. Should I bother 
trying to get at them now, or wait until a possibe move to the drier AZ 
climate in August? I've put a stop-rust spray on it for now.

Also looking to meet AZ bus people, get information to clubs, good paint 
shops, etc.

Thanks, Stephanie
