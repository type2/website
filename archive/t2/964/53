Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Leak in Crankcase?

I am having a bit of trouble following this, but......is the vacuum pulling from inside the crankcase, like an internal vacuum leak?  Is that possible?  No crankcase pressure because an internal leak is sucking away the crankcase pressure?
Sometimes the stupid questions lead to unrelated answers
