Gary,

 

You might want to check for a Porsche 914 "taco plate" some are already
drilled and tapped to accept the sensor.  That's what I did. wish I could
remember where I got it. sorry.

Hi

I want to install an oil temperature gauge.

I am looking for the diagram on where to drill the hole in the plate under
the engine often referred to as the TACO plate for mounting the VDO oil temp
sensor. Does anyone have a link to that or details on this process?

 

Thanks
