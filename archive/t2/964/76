and the other side of the story, I had a tractor trailer clip me (driver
fell asleep at the wheel) spun me sideways into his trailer, the spare on
the front of my bus hit his wheel and kept me from getting close enough
for the box to actually hit my bus, I was pushed away and had some
relatively minor damage, at 55mph. I think if the spare wasn't there I
would have hit him broadside with the front of the bus since the bumper
would have passed under him....
