Subject: Re: [T2] How do I mount this thing???

If a spare has never been mounted on the front of your bus .. I wouldn't do 
it now .. a guy pulled out in front of me and I slammed on the brakes but 
still hit him .. 90% of the damage was caused by the spare .. in fact, I am 
sure that at the speed with which I hit him .. if it had not been for the 
spare I would only have had to replace my bumper .. but because of the front 
mounted spare I had to have the whole front clip of my bus replaced.
