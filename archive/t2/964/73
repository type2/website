Subject: How do I mount this thing???

I just got one of those front tire mounts from Bus
Depot that allows you to mount your tire front first.
However, after looking at the front of my bus, I
really don't have a clue as to how to mount it.

I am guessing that the diagonal bars to the sides
mount inside the bus after mounting holes have been
drilled. If that is correct, I still can't figure out
what to do with the two bolts at the base of the
contraption.

Anyone mounted one of these things that can give me
some guidance? Maybe a picture or two?
