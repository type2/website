Subject: Sliding Door Lock Adjustment?

Re-assembled the sliding door mechanism, it all works
just great except for one little thing...

The lock works fine when the door is open, ie it moves
up and down freely using the inside thingy or the key.
 Unfortunately when the door is actually closed (and
the lock might be useful) it won't move all the way
into the locked position.

Is this an adjustment issue? Or is the thing broken?
