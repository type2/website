Use a rust conversion chemical now. Ospho is a good one available at 
any marine supply or most hardwares. Any exposure of bare metal 
should wait until you are in the hot and dry desert climate.
I am in Rocklin just easterly of Sacramento. If you will be coming 
through, let me know and we can meet and look over your Bus with you.
