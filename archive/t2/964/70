Hey, Raymond.  I pmailed that I'd slide under my bus and look at mine. 
Jamie said that one of them is a vent, and the fuel line is just to
keep the dust out of the pump.  Could be, makes sense that the other
side of the diaphragm has to have access to air.  I thought it was an
overflow, but either way, you do want a short stretch of fuel line on
that bottom port and route it back (RIR).  At least that's how mine is.
 I'd swear I've seen a drop of fuel come out of there after a long run.
 Maybe my pump is going.  Hmm... time for some of my own research, I
think.
That's the one that points straight down.

There are 2 others: one that points straight up and one that points to
about 10 o'clock when you're looking at it from the front.  On my bus,
the one that points straight up runs to a fuel filter and then to the
tank.  The one that points towards 10 o'clock runs to the firewall and
then on to the carbs (or in my case carb).

It has been widely encouraged to put the filter on the supply side of
the pump to prevent fuel line blow-offs.  So, when the filter
inevitably clogs, there is less pressure building against the filter,
reducing the likelihood of a fuel line blowing off, and ultimately,
throwing gas all over, etc..  This also protects your pump from any
junk that could appear in your tank.

I hope you found this helpful.... and accurate,
