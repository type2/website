Mike, here's what RAwell says:

So how do you tell that you've got them. There is no guaranteed way unless
you examine the lifter itself or you happen to be the original owner. Clues
to look for in order to determine if you have hydraulic lifters:

   1. The engine case number begins with GE (bus) or CV (Vanagon).
   2. There is a sticker on the fan shroud indicating zero lash.
   3. The case lacks a bolt with a large 13mm triple square head on the
   right side of the case between the push rod tubes.
   4. The rocker arms are separated by a wavy spacer washer instead of a
   spring.
   5. The push rods are one piece steel instead of a large aluminum tube
   with small steel ends.

I went out to my workbench and found one of each.  Now I know.

The Hydraulic =

(1) all steel  vs mechanical is steel tips with aluminum body;
(2) skinnier, like a lead pencil (10mm vs 12mm);
(3) shorter (260mm vs 270mm approx);
(4) one piece the entire length for hydraulic vs 3 piece for mechanical,
both with hole down the length of rod for oil lubing

The magnet told the truth.
