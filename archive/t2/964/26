Subject: idles and runs but timingset too high

checked the archives and other sources, including the recent
discussion about a similar issue related to a 71 type 1 engine.  mine
is a 75 FI, automatic.  recently reinstalled the engine w/ new
remanned heads.  she idles and runs but to get her to do so i have to
have the timing set (-at-) 20 BTDC or higher.  if i retard the timing she
dies or idles very low and then dies when i drop her into drive.

these are the things i have fixed or confirmed that they work:

pulley mark is accurate
dizzy is in correct position
vacuum lines are hooked up correctly
no vacuum leaks
pulled plug wires and all cylinders are firing
all FI stuff is new or tested ok

things i will check:

gas vent lines make sure there are no kinks or blockages
make sure valves are not too tight, there seems to be some valve clatter


does anyone else have any suggestions?  i also need to get rid of
exhaust leaks (-at-) all joints.  the new gaskets just don't seem to be
sealing well.

thanks,

jeremiah
