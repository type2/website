Subject: oil temp sensor

Hi
I want to install an oil temperature gauge.
I am looking for the diagram on where to drill the hole in the plate
under the engine often referred to as the TACO plate for mounting the
VDO oil temp sensor. Does anyone have a link to that or details on this
process?

Thanks
