	Having invested in several thermocouples (as mentioned a 
month or so ago), cyl head temp being the most important to my mind, 
I wonder whether another one could be installed as the washer on the 
oil drain plug.  The temp thus shown will not be quite as high as the 
temp of the oil just up thru the metal, but it's the trends that 
mainly count in this game  ...
	Any ideas welcome
