Subject: Need Helping Hands in Portland, Oregon

So today I started tearing down the engine, I am attempting to remove the
head with the engine in the bus (1972). If anyone in Portland Oregon has
done this and I could use your help I realize it is Sunday and it may be
raining and I do not have a garage, So if you cannot help hey thanks for
reading.

I also need a torque wrench for this process which I do not have. Could I
borrow yours.. Also needed would be Jack stands and a jack say a floor jack.




I discovered a couple interesting things.  The PO who installed the
carburetor seems that he had no idea what he was doing. Instead of using the
proper seals in used some sort of goop. That sucks.

My carb (a holly bugspray) I think, seems to have been broken for a while. I
have no clue if it was ever working properly. It seems as though only one
barrel has been firing. Due to the fact that one barrel is blacked with
build up the other is clean as a whistle. Then I press down on the auto fuel
button and fuel only shoots into one barrel. The one that is back as night.

Any ideas on whats going on with the Carburetor?
