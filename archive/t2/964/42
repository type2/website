Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp sensor

I thought I had a picture that Karl or somebody sent me but I can't find it.  You really don't need one, though.  It has a raised part on it.  You can drill either to the right or left of that raised part mid-way between it and the edge.  That's what I did and it worked fine. If the raised part is pointing up, I drilled to the left of it.   Don't use thread sealer or you'll mess up the ground.  Just use a good seal and it shouldn't leak.  I didn't read the directions good and used the thread sealer and mine was erratic until I grounded directly to it.  If you don't have a good ground, your readings will pretty much be useless.  Good luck...KR

I want to install an oil temperature gauge.
I am looking for the diagram on where to drill the hole in the plate
under the engine often referred to as the TACO plate for mounting the
VDO oil temp sensor. Does anyone have a link to that or details on this
process?

Thanks
