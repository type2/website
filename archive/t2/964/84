Subject: Re: [T2] WOW!  

About 8 years ago, when I bought the engine and tranny
that were going to be the ones that would last me
forever, I had a quote from one major VW wrecking yard
as "we'll give you everything you need to build a 2
litre for a hundred bucks. No problem... but the 091 -
we have to have $750 for that just as a core!" He said
he could sell every one he could get his hands on for
$750. They filled semi trailers with 'em. Big market
in off-road use.  I just traded two of them away for
building a high quality third one. Hope it works! -BaH
