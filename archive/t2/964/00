Subject: Lucky Seven report from the Geigers . . .

We still have a long way to go, but you can see what's happening at the moment

Thanks to all the good advice and suggestions from the two VW lists, I think
we are making progress . . . one thing I forgot to mention was that we also
had the fuel lines replaced.
We can't help smiling when we get so many negative remarks about buying an old
'82 air cooled camper, without AIR in Arizona, but we LOVE it!  How and
Why????  We've never been able to figure it out . . . and doubt if we ever
will.  I guess it has something to do with not wanting to grow TOO old!  (We
LOVED the remarks about saving forever for a Fat Boy Harley, but getting a
bigger thrill from seeing a Volkswagen driving by  . . HA!  John's sentiments
exactly . . . John never did get his longed for Fat Boy, but we both rode good
ol' BMW'S).  "VW Fever" is positively incurable!  There's just something about
riding along with all the windows down, hair blowing in the wind, looking back
through the camper to check on the puppy in his cage, and knowing we've got it
ALL!
       If anyone has the time to look at the pictures and can think of
something we might forget, please let us know.  ALL advice will be most
welcome!  (Will post this note on both lists . . . sorry if you spend the time
reading it twice.)
