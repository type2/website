Subject: RE: [T2] Need Helping Hands in Portland, Oregon

Yeah I know Easter and all. Too bad its raining here in Portland Oregon as
well. I only got partway through the work today before I had to stop. But I
got the rocker arms off got the bus up on Jack stands.

My original post on the samba looked about like this.. .



So anyone who has been following whats been going on with my bus knows I
have needed a compression test. Well today I was able to make it out to the
parts store and get a tester. Here are my results.
#1 130
#2 0 as in zero (I Checked 3 times)
#3 132
#4 128

So I dropped down under the bus and pulled the valve cover off to discover
that it looks like my rocker arm is screwed or the push rod Im not sure
what one because I am not sure of what I am looking for. I have attached a
photo of what I saw.
So in the picture you are looking at the passenger side(in America) valves
and you can see that on what I thought was number one the second from the
front rocker arm has a gigantic space in-between the locknut and the end of
the rocker arm.
At this point I dont know what I should do. I love my bus but damn Im
frustrated. On top of the fact she is my ONLY car..
What steps should I take next? Does anyone have any ideas on what happened?
Will my wife leave me if I try and rebuild this motor in the front room?
Should I know more than I do before trying because I really dont know much?


Does anyone know how much something like this would cost to be fixed? Can it
be fixed or am I up a creek without a paddle?



And before that my bro posted



So my friend brought his bus over this morning (1972 Riviera) and we gave
his poor running bus a tune up. When he arrived his bus would not go any
faster than 40 miles per hour. We checked the valves and all were very loose
so we brought them back to spec per Bentley. Next we changed the points and
adjusted the gap to a 47 dwell angle. Timing the buss was pretty hard
because he's running a 009 with a Holley carb. It seems that when you pull
the throttle to raise the RPM it wants to stay at like 30 degrees and slowly
returns back to a lower rpm, at about 12 before 0 mark. We tried to take it
for a test drive and it would not go any faster than 15 miles per hour.
There must not be any advance, and I don't have a compression tester. What
can we do to check for any major problems? Can we take the valve covers off
and check to see if the valves are working properly? They should just open
and close right, or?? Now his bus does not go any faster than 15. We need
some help.
Thanks for any help and advice.



If anyone is interested there are pics of my engine and bus on my flickr
photo album. Here is the link

Hi Joshua,



It's not just Sunday today, it's Easter Sunday. For those who celebrate
Sundays, this is a big one, if not the biggest. (Superbowl notwithstanding)



Why are you pulling the head? Have you checked the valves and done a
compression test yet? ?



Working inside the engine compartment of a 72 bus sounds like torture to me.
Without that top hatch it's a huge PITA to get at things. You'd be better
off in the long run dropping the engine.



But before you go that far, tell us the compression numbers. Maybe the
problem isn't in the head.





Happy Trails,



Greg Potts

done this and I could use your help I realize it is Sunday and it may be

reading.
