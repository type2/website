	Just a little more on the general idea:  I'm involved in 
developing solar water-heaters, and want to read the temp at various 
altitudes in a HW cyl.  To make a hole in the metal cyl and stick in 
a thermometer without risk of later leaking is no pushover.  A 
physics prof friend whose career has been in heat-transfer assures me 
that all I need do is stick the thermometer on the outside of the 
metal, with heat-conductive glue, and then slap thermal insulation 
outside that; this thermometer will then read very near the T of the 
water just thru the metal.
	The VW sump isn't copper, but its metal has nearly as good 
thermal conductivity; it is several times thicker, which makes more 
difference, both to the T drop and to the dynamic response as Don 
says. I suspect the time lag would not matter in practice.
	Is there any real worry about sticking some thermal 
insulation outside (i.e below) the thermometer?  The sump will then 
run slightly hotter, but the thermocouple will read nearer the actual 
oil T.
