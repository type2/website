figured out the timing issue.  seems the flamethrower coil is 3ohm
resistance and the bosch blue coil is no resistance.  i was running
the flamethrower.  i think this is what was causeing my timing to be
10-12 degrees advanced (-at-) idle.  switched to the bosch blue coil and
timing is now a 7.5-8 BTDC, which is correct for my dizzy.


now i just need to know if there is a form-a-gasket that withstands
high temps.  with brand new metal gaskets every joint in the exhaust
leaks.  this is the 75 FI system sans egr stuff.  any suggestions on
how to seal these better?  i would love to be able to take Goethe w/
me out of town this weekend.

thanks,

jeremiah
