Subject: Weatherstrip Help

Well, I'm in a bind.  My paint guy didn't do the
weatherstrip channels, so they still have some old
adhesive  >:O<

I need to get the weatherstrip in today before I leave
for a 4 week trip...

I know the right answer is to remove the old stuff,
prep, prime, and paint the channels but that's not
going to happen today.

Realistically, if I install the weatherstrip over the
residual crap how well might it hold up?  Or is that
guaranteed not to work?
