So what is the procedure? Drill the plugs with a 1/8" drill, pop them 
out with a slide hammer, ream them to a certain size and then tap that? 
Install threaded plugs with Loctite? Why not drill to the size specified 
by a drill/tap chart? Not trying to be ornery, just trying to learn 
something. Dip the taps in grease to catch the chips?
