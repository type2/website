Subject: RE: [T2] Hard Shifting

Is the shift plate, the piece at the bottom of the shit rod, where the shift
rod goes through the floor. I remember replacing that on my '65 as well. It
was so long ago-I don't remember what exactly prompted it. I also don't
recall how to adjust it.

As for the clutch cable...how do I know if it has gone bad? Last time one
went bad, I remember pushing the pedal felt really different. It seems like
pushing the clutch pedal feels the same it always has.
