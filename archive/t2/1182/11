Ron,
I just used the new site. Being stuck out here in Kandahar Afghanistan,
the internet connection is trying. I just order a Popup Tent and some other
items for my 78 Westy and the site worked well and I was notified that all my
items were delivered to Piston and Rotor's in Orange Park Florida where my
Westy is. Yep, there are a few glitches, but now my daughter can find parts
for her 01 Jetta and once the wish list is working, I will be loading it up!!!
 
 
Cheers from Afghanistan!!
