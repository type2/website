Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Power

Let me try to explain what I found, fuse #7 under the dash is gone.. the
socket looks like its all burnt up. According to the wiring diagram I believe
that is the heater fan.. The PO wired a fuse to the hot-side of #7 block that
went to the solid red wire going into ignition switch..  It had a 30A fuse
that I found was tripped, I replaced the fuse and once I turned ignition on it
popped again.

Looking at wiring diagram when you turn the key on it provides power to the
black wire going to coil and the red-yellow wire going to fuses 10/11/12 and
the headlight switch.. The red-yellow wire wasn't passing the continuity test
so I pulled those fuses and there was still a something popping the fuse right
before the key.. all I did was pull the headlamp switch out and push it back
in and all my readings on that line changed.. continuity was suddenly ok.. I
could turn the key and trigger the starter relay for the first time without
blowing that fuse.. I put the fuses back in 10/11/12 and I can turn the key on
and all my idiot lights come alive and I could still trigger the starter. ..
If its not the headlamp switch why is everything working now?

I havent got the bus started yet, thats my job today.. I unhooked a lot of
stuff to troubleshoot and now I got to put it all back in sweltering heat.

Cheers,
