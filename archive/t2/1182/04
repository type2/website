can't help noticing that the signs resemble those of fuel-supply 
blockage, in e.g  an added in-line petrol filter cartridge that has 
become partly blocked, &/or partial blockage at the outlet from the 
tank by similar debris that blocks filters.
	So I ask whether higher T can facilitate such blockage  ...
