recently, I found a suggestion ,,, using cedar shakes for tapered shim, i 
put them in the window, between the inside and the outside scraper.. then I 
used a dental pick to tweak the clips into place.. and the shim makes it 
easy to pop them into the hole...

I put the original wire spring into the new scraper to make it a LOT easier 
to install

so, 2 secrets there.. replace the wire spring with a OG one.. and use about 
5 or 6 wood shims to help you hold things in and as a way to disperse the 
pressure to pop them in the hole without distorting the steel

hope that helps
Jamie
