Hey Sami,

I've had the same problems with clogged filters. When under suction, the
junk from your tank clogs the inlet or the filter. Let it sit for a few
minutes and the suction has released, and fuel flows again. I finally
pulled my tank and cleaned and lined it, but in the meantime I just kept a
bunch of extra filters with me.

Ned
