Subject: Mysterious fuel delivery issue

Hi all,

Around this time last year my van, KK, began acting up. With the help of
the list we figured it was some sort of vapor lock occurring. She has been
fine for the last 8 months but now it has resumed. Here are the conditions
and symptoms:

Engine:
   - 1600dp with an aircooled.net SVDA and a new as of last year 34 pict-3
carb. Stock fuel pump.

Conditions:
   - Weather has to be warm outside, 75 degrees or hotter
   - The van has to get up to speed for more than 1 minute of sustained time

Symptoms:
  - Bring the van to a stop and let her idle, when you want to go again it
dies unless you floor it and slowly let the clutch out
  - If you shut her off or she dies the only way to restart her is to floor
the gas while cranking until she catches and smooths out

2 weeks ago I did 115 miles straight on the freeway, came to a stop and she
was fine, no problem what-so-ever, it was around 68 degrees that day.
Yesterday, I drove for about 30 minutes on the freeway, and she stumbled
after the exit while resuming from a stop. The only difference seems to be
the temperature as yesterday it was 80 degrees out.

I will be double checking my valves and timing over the next few days as
time permits but it seems so odd to me that it will run like a top when it
is not hot out and then just give fits when it is warm. It is very
frustrating as it takes away from my feeling of it being a reliable vehicle
and the summer is the best time to camp.

Am I missing something obvious?

Thanks for the ideas and community,


Max
