Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

Alright all,

The issue still persists. A quick recap, "KK-Louise, a '71 Westy" has a
standard 1600dp engine with a 34pict-3 carb, SVDA distributor, and
mechanical fuel pump. She is properly tuned and generally runs as
flawlessly as a 40 year old should. However, after the engine is at full
operating temperature and she comes to a stop the bus will eventually
behave as if she wants to die. I have to floor it after idling to get fuel
back to the carb.

My most recent trip had the behavior happen after I exited from the freeway
and drove around town for several minutes. She was fine at first but after
an extended period of idling she acted like there was no fuel.

Once I arrived at my destination and looked at the fuel filter, nearly
empty, barely any fuel visible. At this point I expect the pump does not
pump properly. Is there a simple cheap test to verify fuel pressure or is
it a job better left for a shop? I searched the archives for a mechanical
fuel pump pressure test but only found ones relating to electric fuel
pumps.

I have rerouted the fuel line away from the intake manifold, replaced the
filters, replaced the bakelite fuel pump insulator as it was cracked and
given the bus a full tune-up.

Many thanks and safe travels to all,

Max
