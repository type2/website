Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

I had almost the same symptoms you describe. It drove me crazy. I replaced the
fuel pump and the carburetor. 

Finally I crawled underneath and traced the
fuel line from the gas tank to where it passes into the engine compartment.
This is what I found:

There is a small hook or clamp that is designed to hold
the fuel line on the driver's side above the heat exchanger. The fuel line had
fallen from the clamp and was lying on top of the heat exchanger. Naturally,
in hot weather and higher temperatures as you describe, the heat from the
exchanger and the inability of the ambient air to sufficiently cool caused the
gas to boil and vapor lock to ensue. This also explained the difficult
starting after a stop once the engine was turned off. Once I reconnected the
fuel line to its retaining clamp the problems went away.

Hope this is of some
help.
