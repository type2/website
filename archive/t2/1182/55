Subject: Re: [VB] Remembering Steve Dolan

Bob was a bit snobbish in that regard, great smart guy, but thought Vanagon
folk were second class citizens.  I think because of the Inuvik trip perhaps,
who knows, indeed it might have been said at the time that a lot of Vanagon
drivers on the list had more money than sense.  Perhaps times don't change...
 Anyway, Bob another good guy long gone.

Uncle Joel Walker could likely dig
up when Steve joined vanagon.  I know there were only about 50-60 people on it
when I joined and Steve was on there well before me, so must have been pretty
damn early, Joel kept pretty close stats back then.  He of course got fed up
with the pansy ass vanagon folks (sorry Jim) and no longer follows, but his
email is same as it ever was.  It was indeed at the beginning of the www, I
recall NCSA Mosaic 1.0 coming out right about that time, as I surfed on a Sun
workstation in my office in grad school, and of course I presume vanagon like
the corrado list were spin offs generated from rec.autos.vw, I know I joined
from seeing it there.

Anyone know what happened to Gerry in the long run, he
stopped by in Morgantown once with his wife and kids and I treated him to
Mexican, I recall his kids were probably like 5-7ish, must be in their 20's.
 Hopefully he is well.

John

I think that I was pretty early on the
vanagon(-at-)lenti list when I was living in Christchurch. This was before www and
Coyote Ron ran it? Bob Hoover seem to welcome the great split up of the lists.
He thought that only spitty and early bay drivers could fix their own bus.
