Hi All,

B 

First of all, I don't know if Steve Dolan was an original member of the list
since I have been a member since only around March of 1994. I do know that I
remember posts from him at that time, as well as Unca Joel, Gerry and Bob.

Bob Hoover was a T1 and T2 snob with a big preference to T1s. I remember one
comment he made about Vavagon owners "not wanting to get grease under their
fingernails" right before the air/water cooled list split. Gerry and I talked
about that comment as we were taking a break while converting his Vanagon
Westfalia from diesel to gas and after I had the transmission out of my
Vanagon Syncro to replace the clutch and main seal. So, Vanagon owners don't
want to get grease under their fingernails.

By the way, I still have my silver Vanagon.lenti.umn.edu sticker on the back
of my '72 Westy.
