Mike, it's been years since I last did mine but the clips that came with 
my replacement parts were garbage. Not even made from a spring metal. 
Looked like they were made out of aliuminum as I recall. If I compressed 
them much they stayed that way.

What I did was buy black nylon push button clips from the auto parts 
store and then used a grinder or sander to modify the heads into little 
squared off things that would fit where the clips were supposed to fit. 
The nylon push lock end (other end) grabbed the same hole in the door as 
the clips that came with the scrapers I bought. Now years later the 
nylon is holding up just fine and the rubber scrapers have shrunk just a 
little.

To simplify - took generic nylon clips that were the right size on the 
locking end to fit in the original hole in the door. They came from an 
average FLAPS. I then trimmed the heads down with wire snips and a 
sander to that instead of being big and round, they were squared off. I 
think mine ended up looking like little bars. Make them whatever size or 
shape that will fit in place of the scraper clips that come with the 
scrapers.

Anyhow - they'll snap right in.
