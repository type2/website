Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

Doktorrim and Jamie, I like the idea of it being an issue with the carb. I
replaced the intake manifold with a good used one last year and the old
leaking German 34Pict-3 with a new 34Pict-3. The new carb took forever to
even get the choke to work properly so I wouldn't be surprised if the idle
circuit had issues.

I am not much of a carb guy, I like them, just not very good with them. I
may ask my favorite shop to measure the fuel pressure from the pump and to
take a gander at the idle circuit. Perhaps I will get courageous. I drive
back tomorrow morning so I won't have much to report for the next few days.

Keep them rolling,

Max
