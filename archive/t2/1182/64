Subject: Re: [T2] oil gallery plug taps

Thoughts...

Don't fuck it up.  It is easy to do with some of them,
particularly those around the filter boss area and out the the cooler.  The
big ones straight into the galleries are pretty easy, and all go 3/8 NPT.  The
little ones that go 1/4 NPT are tougher.  You pop them all out with a little
hand slide hammer with screw tip after drilling em with a 1/8 hole.

So Mike
what you really need that is harder to get than the taps (which can be found
anywhere, any good hardware store, in WV it was the Bridgeport Ace Hardware,
in AK it would be any AIH, for me for instance) is NPT tapered reamers, and
they will be pricey unfortunately.  And you do want them.  Which brings the
best likely place for all of these things.  Enco.

www.use-enco.com

page 68
for the reamers, page 103 for the taps.

The chinese/Enco stuff will be fine,
spring for Polish if you care, American if you have money to burn.  I presume
McMaster will have them as well, but probably double Enco prices.  a 1/4 an
3/8 tap together will be all of $14 or so, but unfortunately the reamers, are
quite spendy, about double what I paid when I got mine, looks like $55 for the
two.  Ooof.

Now if you search NPT reamer on a certain auction site you can
get a set of US made 3/8-1" for $46, and I bought a set from the guy to get
the bigger ones about a year ago (would be about $250 for Chinese from Enco.)
 He must have bought out the inventory of the long closed Keystone reamer
Company, however one was unuseable (corrosion) but he did swap it out for
nothing fast.  Might email him and see if he has 1/4" ones and could do you
something, they certainly are nice US made tools as long as the surface
corrosion isn't on the cutting edge.

Also start looking for where you are
going to get your aluminum pipe plugs from BTW, Aeroquip of course is fine but
pricey, in WV a good NAPA around me used to stock non anodized ones much
cheaper.

Chance it without the reamers if you like, I did them without for
quite a while, but I screwed up one good race prepped 914 case and never did
it without again.  (Well actually the case ended fine as I just had all the
galleries TIG'd shut on it, which is another good solution, though not
cleanable, it is an old 914 racers solution.

Last thought, you certain you
want to do it?  I've never ever had a set of galleries I peened let go, can
peen a whole case in 2 minutes with a hammer and a $2 center punch, it will
take you a solid 2 hours to ream and tap em your first time.

YMMV

Does
anyone have source suggestions for obtaining reasonably priced
NPT (HSS?) taps
for doing the oil gallery plugs on a Type IV 2.0?

Also - if anyone has any
thought suggestions on the process, I'm happy
to listen, er... read.
Procrastinating on this a bit as I'm concerned
about mucking it up!
