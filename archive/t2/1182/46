Yep. Turned into some sort of rant... ;) It was time to step away from 
the keyboard... LOL!

Just hated seeing all those nice buses toasted beyond saving b/c of bad 
luck, amateur mechanic skills or folks ignoring their fuel system. At 
different times I've been all three of those types.

I also frankly think VW did a lousy job on the fuel system design. My 
Westfalia as I recall cost $10K in 1978? And VW couldn't do what GM was 
doing for a fuel pump on the lowly Vega in the early 70s? I just don't 
like gravity feed fuel tanks that can dump to entire load of fuel b/c a 
fuel line starts to leak or burn. Especially since it'll be in our 
attached garage at least part of the time. Do any other brand vintage 
vehicle burn as frequently as the old aircooled VWs? Well besides 
Lambroghinis and Ferraris... GRIN!

I agree that a fire suppression system is a worthwhile investment. ~$350 
to save a $10K van (roughly at 2012 restored prices). Or another way of 
looking at it $350 to protect thousands of man hours... Just protecting 
the time spent stripping the paint off of this old van would be a good 
motivator.

I'll be looking into that as well. I want something that can be 
activated from the front of the bus and then continue the battle with a 
bottle if necessary. One clever guy had proposed adding a port to the 
engine lid to push an extinguisher nozzle through. Not a bad idea. He's 
thinking. I want to drive this Westy. I have a local friend with a very 
nice Riveria that she painted/restored the interior on a decade ago. She 
won't drive it now for fear of a fire. Guess I need to update her Westy 
with whatever solution I choose for our bus too.

The Corvair guys have a fuel pump problem that some are solving by 
eliminating the stock mechanical fuel pump. Due to vintage pumps wearing 
out or b/c some new replacement pumps are lousy and because GM just 
didn't do it right (either) - their fuel pumps are allowing fuel into 
the engine crankcase and diluting the oil. Don't want to ruin a $2000 
engine...

Anyhow that is the motivation of the guys who fear bad mechanical fuel 
pumps... ;)

There is the solution with part numbers. Not sure that I'd tie the fuel 
pump to the VW fuel gauge sender. The replacement parts for roadtrips 
are available off the shelf in most places too.

For my VW I might weld in a second port for the fuel pump. Won't know 
for certain what I'm doing until I get it apart.
