Hello Max,

Your fuel filter does not have to full or even half full while running. I have
been fooled by this too. You may have vapor lock. A friend of mine had this
problem with his bus.  He used foam pipe insulation on the gas lines in his
bus. This fixed the problem. Cheap and easy.

You also might have carburetor icing.  It is likely that the heat riser tubes
on your intake manifold that bolt to your exhaust might be plugged up with
soot. You could try removing the intake and run a metal coat hanger through
the heat riser tube. If not successful, you will likely have to replace it
with an unplugged used one. Please, other list members, correct me if my train
of thought is off.
Good luck
