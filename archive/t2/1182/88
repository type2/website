Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

There are pressure gages. You would need to install a "T" in the fuel 
line going to the carb and attach the pressure gage. Not sure what 
pressure you should read, but I think it's around 3-5 psi. Below 2psi 
and I'm sure that the carb would starve.
