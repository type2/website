Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

Hi all,

Thanks again for the continued ideas and support. Today I replaced the fuel
pump insulator, the bakelite bit, and rerouted the steel line farther away
from the manifold. I'll be driving tomorrow with a good mix of the
conditions that have been causing the problem.

The fuel pump pushrod tube was the proper length. If the issue continues, I
think investing in a fuel pump pressure gauge to ensure the proper fuel
delivery is my next step.

Max
