Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Power

so I found the issue, my headlight switch apparently has a short in it.. the
PO had wired a fuse inline on ignition power and it had popped.. replaced it
and it went again instantly.

With wiring diagram in hand I started testing everything going out of the
ignition switch.. Found it when we had multimeter hooked up to show amps and I
toggled the switch and saw a draw when I shouldn't have, but then it went away
and I couldn't repeat Put a new fuse in and everything came on, idiot lights
and all.. Time for a new light switch.

In the end it was something I never touched when I yanked the engine, my 2
year old loves sitting in the drivers seat and messing with knobs while I work
away.. Im going to blame him for a few more gray hairs :-)
