Subject: RE: [T2] 1978 Factory mudflaps

What is the groups recommendation about whether or not to remove the
protective coating from the repair panels before applying primer. 

I found a couple of rust holes in where the gas tank goes, so I'm in the
process of cutting them out and welding in new patches. Also, is there any
wisdom as to using Dynomat or self sticking duct insulation under and around
the gas tank area before I install the tank?

Thanks,

Bob

Hey Volks!

Got a question about the factory mudflaps on the front of a '78 Westy. I 
have the driver's side mounting plate, not the passenger side. Removed 
it last night so I could reposition my jack stand on the driver's side 
in anticipation of sanding the floors where they are surface rusted here 
and there.

is this something I can buy as a repro item? I can make one but I'd 
rather have the "right one".

I THINK this was a factory item. Am not even sure.

Am planning to run mudflaps when the bus is done to keep gravel from 
scarring up the bottom of the rocker panels and the rear end of the bus. 
Stone chips lead to rust, etc.
