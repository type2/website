Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

I have not yet removed the fuel pump. Can the pushrod shorten as the engine
gets warmer? This was not a problem until last summer and this is year 3 of
this engine for me. Generally it runs like a champ unless the temperature
is above 80 or so outside. That is when the odd vapor lock symptoms appear
as well as the massive hesitation after starting from a stop whence having
driven for a continuous while.

I have a short fuel pump. Once I get a new bakelite insulator I will pull
the pump.

Thanks,

Max
