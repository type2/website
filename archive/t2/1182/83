Subject: Ignition Switch Power

I recently removed the motor from my 1975 2.0L FI, redressed it and shoved it
back in..
Now im not getting any power to the ignition switch, turn the key on and no
idiot lights or anything.

Ive got power to the double relay and to the starter.. dome light and radio
work fine.. I checked over everything and it seems to be all hooked up exactly
like it was before I removed motor (took bunch of pics).

Where does ignition switch get power? Is there something simple I overlooked..
After being down for 2 weeks I am eager to get this thing back on the road,
but alas my brain is fried and I cant see what I missed.

Thanks,
