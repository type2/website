Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

I dug up one of my old posts regarding this problem. Here's the message.
There are some 20 pages of posts in the archives that came back when I
searched for "fuel pump rod". All of your answers regarding length,
replacement, etc. are there. I guess there are probably 21 pages now...

Some of us old geezers that used to be on this list are no longer, so they
can't answer your questions directly, but they live on in the archives.
While you're on the type2.com site, read the bylaws. They are more than
just a bunch of rules; There are also a lot of good tips in them.

Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pumps

Anyone have their Bently handy? Does it contain the spec for the length of
the fuel pump push rod? I would check that it is within spec. Expansion of
the case would effectively move the pump away from the cam. If the rod is a
little short, it could work when cold but not when hot. Changing the pump
would not fix the problem.
