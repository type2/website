Subject: 1970 bus w/ newly installed dual port 1600 engine

I just rebuilt and installed above.
Used 34pict3 carb, and cannot get idle to go below 1100 RPM.
Engine is burning rich, as well.

Should I go back to my 30pict3 carb?
I know the jet in 34 is bigger than in 30, but to my mind, all else seems as
though it would work.

I am using no vac boost attachments on the carb, (no disc brakes, EPA, etc.)
Only vac attachment to the carb is my stock vac adv dizzy which is a common
component common to both year engines.
