Subject: RE: Mysterious fuel delivery issue

Max:

Have you changed your fuel pump or its mounting base any time recently?
I've seen your exact symptoms occur before on a Type IV bus a year or
so following installation of a new fuel pump.  THe problem turned out  
to be that the
fuel pump drive shaft was improperly hardened ( or not hardened at
all) resulting in a shortening of the length of the shaft due to wear.
When the engine was operating at lower temperatures, (i.e. not
expanded) the fuel delivery was adequate since the shaft still had  
enough
length to actuate the fuel pump.  However on hot days/high engine
temps expansion of the engine case resulted in the shortened shaft not
being able to pump enough fuel with each stroke to allow the engine to  
run
at speed.  Comparison with a used OEM shaft verified that the new  
shaft was
shorter and a Rockwell hardness made it was clear that the new shaft  
was not
hardened like the OEM shaft.  Put the used shaft in and the problem  
was solved.

So I would check anything related to the fuel pump
