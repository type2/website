If not a frozen intake, I think you ought to consider removing the gas 
tank and look for debris floating around. My '65 Beetle had similar 
symptoms b/c the wire sock over the gas tank outlet had rusted away and 
was allowing floating debris to get into the fuel line. Sometimes it 
would pass through to the filter, sometimes it would block the tank 
outlet. The wire sock would have prevented that of course.

Let us know...
