Subject: Re: [VB] Hard Shifting

Kevin,

I had the same problem with my '69 as well a few years back. My bus had a
brand new Clutch cable and coupler. The problem ended up being the nose
cone of the transmission. I ended up rebuilding the nose cone on my
transmission.

I forget the name of the part but when you pop the nose cone off there is
an L shaped rod that attaches to the transmission and the coupler. Mine was
very worn and consequently very sloppy making the shifting difficult. I
also had to replace the bushing, here is a bit of info not very helpful but
a start http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2579054#2579054

Warning the bushing is total crap, I went through 6 or 7 of them before I
got one that did not break and or was the right thickness, length, shape,
etc... I remember it was made out of the same material as the starter
bushing...

Hope this helps....

- Isaac

PS - Oh yea I got one of these too and it helped as well....
