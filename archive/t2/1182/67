recently,, I found that using hearing protection ear plugs,, the ones that 
have a string in them ,, worked very nice!
I stuffed the foam plug in the hole,,, then used needle nose pliers to push 
it down the galley... this allowed me to reach in when I was done and grip 
the string, and pull out the plug,, and it swept out all the chips with it!! 

yes, I pushed the string in the hole with the plug so I could get the drill 
and the tap in... 

hope that helps
