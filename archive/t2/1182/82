Hi everybody,
Thanks for the suggestions! I should have pointed out that the '75 is fuel
injected.

Last summer, I had pulled the fuel tank, cleaned it and coated the inside with
some POR type stuff (it was another brand, can't remember the name now). Also
installed new fuel lines. It has since sat at my brother's place for a year,
although driven maybe 2, 3 times on short, 20 mile drives,  without issues.

Fuel was low when I picked it up yesterday and I filled it up with premium
gas. So the idea of bad fuel seems a bit less likely and I would be surprised
if there was any sediment in the tank. But of course, I'll check. I'll also
look into the idea of the large hose between pump and filter collapsing.

For now, my priority is to make sure the family gets to do what they had
planned with sisters and cousins getting to hang out. There's not much
patience around me for bus related issues :)

Best,
Sami
