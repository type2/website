Hi all,

The crack is in the bakelite insulator block. Is that what you refer to as
the diaphragm? These folks have a great picture of it nearly halfway down
the page. http://www.vw-resource.com/fuel_pump.html

It is that insulator block that is cracked vertically near the first hole
in the picture referenced above.
