Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition Switch Power

I installed a new ignition switch a few months ago, yesterday I pulled the
leads out of the switch and tested all the wires and none of em were hot.. all
fuses are fine under the dash, I did remove starter to pull the motor but its
all hooked back up and there is 12.8v on the starter lug.. I could try taking
them all off and putting em back on again.

No power to coil either of course so the ignition switch gets power off one
of those leads hooked to starter?

why they are crappy :)  , did you take the starter off and hook the wires back
up, are the fuses getting power, any blown? that connector thing down there
has most of the wires you can bypass the stuff in the Colum if needed
