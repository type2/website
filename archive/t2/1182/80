Subject: Re: [T2] Back in the USA, and bus broke down

the 75 should have a large nut on the tank.. making it "easy" to drain the 
tank..  if draining is every "easy"
I undo the battery neg term,, jack it up level.. and put a 5 gal pail under 
... with a large funnel..
then I drop the outlet out of the tank.. and catch the fuel...
I have a large glass wine bottle... carboy? .. I usually put the gas in it 
to see if there is sediment, or water, or discolour... then I filter it thru 
another funnel back into the gas can,,, but put fresh gas back in the tank..

hopefully you don't have 10+ gal in the tank!
Jame .. I hate gas issues!

but with storage,, I have seen gas go bad in a few weeks... and also needles 
stick to the seat sooo hard the pump pressure won't open them to refill the 
bowl..

what Ned said.. with "under suction".. I had a line collapse FLAT closed,,, 
a few minutes later, or any attempt to work on and open the fuel system, 
that line would expand and allow flow again! ... that was an injected , 
electric pump with the large line between the filter and the pump... that 
large line should be as short as it can be... so it can't collapse... my 
mistake was to leave it long enough to change the filter easier..

fresh gas,,, check for volume out of the pump.. bowls are filling,?, 
accelerator pump is squirting on actuation.... you have gas..
check for spark,, and timing... maybe the dist rotated enough to put the 
timing to the point it won't fire ,, like 90 deg off.. unusual but happens..
