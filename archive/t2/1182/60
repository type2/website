As a previous owner of a motorcycle with said vacuum operated

the ground and flooding the cylinders after a lunch stop on a long ride.

Carter GP-4600HP or GP-4594. Flaps should be able to get them or order
from summitracing.com. Don't forget a good adjustable pressure
regulator rated for the range your carb specs require.

If you put a capped, valved fitting on the fuel pump outlet side you
can use the pump to empty the tank at a little over 1 gallon per
minute.

Clip fittings to the frame and use Tygon fuel line between the
fittings. Not sure what sizes are available though. Primarily used in
powersports applications where it's exposed to bright sun and heavy
abrasion.
