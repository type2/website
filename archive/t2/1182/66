Subject: Re: [T2] oil gallery plug taps

Hi Chris,

From what I've read -

Obtain NPT taps, plugs, drill bits of appropriate sizes.  References
here include:

For procedural low-down on a T1

For drill sizes confirmation

German Supply offers a kit as well.

Several Samba threads via search, and John's earlier response..

Then what I'd planned, more or less as you mentioned - pop them out
with slidehammer, fill backend with some grease, drill, remove and
replace grease if needed (shop vac), tap slowly, checking for depth.
Once cleanly threaded, clean shavings (hopefully all caught in
grease), flush the bloody heck out of the oil galleries, grab some
Permatex/ Loctite thread sealant, and close things up.

John has some valid points about using reamers or just peen'ing them,
so I'm trying to consider those options as well.

Cheers, Mike
