Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Westy measurement

'77 under 100k miles, springs still better than most, only the light camping
gear that I never take out loaded, nobody in it, near new 185R14's:

Bounced
the suspension and let it settle and I get 23", and 23 1/4"

I wouldn't expect
a '74 much different, layouts changed but weight is about the same.
