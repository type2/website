Thanks again for the fast responses and for clarifying that the filter does
not need to be very full to indicate working order.

Fuel Rod Length -  I have checked the length of the fuel pump rod, it is
correct for the alternator style fuel pump which I have.

Carb Icing - I believe this is not a factor, I replaced my intake manifold
with an unplugged manifold last year. At then end of this last drive the
intake manifold was warm and no icing was apparent.

Regarding Vapor Lock - Perhaps though I have relocated the metal line which
use to run near the exhaust manifold to 2"-3" above it and the braided fuel
hose runs around the cooling hose to the pump and from the pump up to the
carb. It does not appear to be near any other heat source.

John, I did check for the fuel line resting on the heat exchanger but my
fuel line goes directly from the tank to the metal line. It does not go
near the heat exchanger. I have a fuel filter inline there between the fuel
tank and the metal line and it is clean too.

It seems crazy that I may have to insulate the fuel lines with foam pipe
insulation. Does ethanol (E10), change the vapor point that much? Have
others been doing this? Logically, if I can run at 55-60 for 2+ hours with
no problems, the fuel pump should be pumping at the proper pressure or
starvation would occur at speed, not idle, is that right.

Thanks all for sticking with me on this ridiculous issue.

Max
