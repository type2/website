If the clutch cable is going you won't feel any resistance until the pedal
is closer to the floor than usual, usually almost to the floor. The cable
is exposed under the pedal and at the transmission, check it and look for
any fraying. The tension is adjusted by a wing-nut where it attaches to the
transmission.

The shifter (stop) plate is indeed where the shift rod hits the floor. You
basically loosen the two bolts and slide the plate around until you can
shift cleanly into all gears (including reverse), and then re-tighten the
bolts. There is typically a 90 degree angle between the rod and the floor
when it is 2nd gear and adjusted correctly.

It goes something like this (copied from internet):

1-Keep the two bolts that hold down the shifter just loose enough that you
> can move the stop plate and shifter
>  2-Shift into second gear
> 3-position the shifter so the lower section below the bend is vertical (90
> degrees to the floor)
> 4-move the stop plate and shifter in the second gear gate forward and
> backwards and find the center of the travel and hold it there
> 5-with a flathead screwdiver push the stop plate to the left untill it
> stops
> 6-tighten the bolts and check the travel of the shifter

I would also double check all the linkages underneath.

Lastly, and more anecdotally, I had a similar problem a few years back and
it turned out that the bracket which holds the intermediate shift lever
(that the "hockey stick" controls) had cracked!! This, along with the ball
joint being severely worn, prevented the selectors from actuating.
