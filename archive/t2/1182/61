Thank you Gerald!

Through much head scratching and hints from other places on the web it 
looks like the ARC 122SS 12V solenoid may be the right valve. They also 
offer a screw on filter but I think I'd rather use a big filter similar 
to the OEM VW Transporter but a steel filter not subject to cracks or 
melting.

I have an e-mail sent to ARC to make sure it is still available b/c 
their website doesn't seem to show it.

Rated for gasoline and all that. Other people have tried it and 
currently run it with success.

Gas tank -> steel fuel line to -> solenoid -> steel fuel filter (outside 
of the engine compartment seems to be the best place for it similar to 
factory filter location) -> rotary fuel pump as detailed by Gerald L. -> 
carb(s) with steel lines in the engine compartment. A short flexible 
line to allow the engine to move a little.

That's easy b/c the Corvair has threaded fittings on the carbs from the 
factory and the Corvair uses steel lines from the factory. I liked a 
picture I saw elsewhere that showed a Type I carb fuel line clamp safety 
wired to the carb with a little space between the fuel line and the carb 
casting so any swelling of the rubber wouldn't pull out the brass fitting.

The nitrous solenoids seem to also be well worth their cash per Bob's 
guidance.

Yay - another hurdle figured out. I now know what other people know and 
can incorporate that into our Westy.

On to fiberglass tops and cracking luggage compartments... ;)

Pressed the balljoints in and am awaiting the balljoint crimping tool 
when GermanSupply gets it in stock.
