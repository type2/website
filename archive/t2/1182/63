Subject: oil gallery plug taps

Hi All,

Does anyone have source suggestions for obtaining reasonably priced
NPT (HSS?) taps for doing the oil gallery plugs on a Type IV 2.0?

Also - if anyone has any thought suggestions on the process, I'm happy
to listen, er... read. Procrastinating on this a bit as I'm concerned
about mucking it up!

Cheers, Mike
