Subject: Parting out '72 bay Westy

No bondo on the bus.
Solid body, but very rusty.

Located in Southern Illinois.

Let me know by p-mail what you need.
Happy to oblige and facilitate all requests.
Will even store stuff for anyone,,,, for a limited time.

Of note .... There was Engine compartment conversion tin that modified a '72
to accept a type 1 engine. This bus has that tin.
