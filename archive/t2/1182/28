Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

Hi all,

The large gasket of my fuel pump has a long vertical crack in it. Perhaps
that is letting air in to the fuel line when it gets warm? I am sure the
crack appeared recently as I do not know how I would not have seen it
before during valve adjustments. I am going to get a new gasket tomorrow.
Is it best practice to swap the pump at the same time? It is a bocar unit.

Results of the tune-up were fairly inconclusive. Valves needed some
adjustment, plugs needed some adjustment but looked good. Cleaned cap and
rotor. Dwell is spot on at 50 degrees. Timing was solid. My fuel filter
between the tank and the firewall looks good as well as the filter in the
engine bay. I have two as I am worried about the blockage possibility
mentioned earlier.

Many thanks for the help so far.
