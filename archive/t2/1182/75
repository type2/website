Thank you! I had heard of something like this but could not remember the 
particulars. More ways than just one to skin that cat...

I ordered two AFC 121SS valves for my two aircooled VWs. Fuel injected 
buses need two, and I'm switching back to stock carbs for now on my 
Corvair implant. Want to go Megasquirt later. I'll capping off one of 
our '78 Westy's fuel outlets with petcock so I can easily drain the tank 
if I want to and I can easily return to the dual fuel outlets later if I 
go back to VW power or upgrade to Megasquirted Corvair.

Your motorcycle fix is $15 and the AFC fix is $51 plus shipping per 
valve. Like you said - cheap insurance against total loss. For me it's 
not just the lost money (and that would hurt) - it's the lost manhours. 
By the time I get this puppy painted, repowered, rebuilt and 
reupholstered I'm going to have a million hours (so it seems) invested. 
I'm doing everything myself b/c my time is cheaper than every shop in 
town. Not to mention it's fun.
