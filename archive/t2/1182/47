Subject: raising a bus and axle length

Hi,
I am helping a friend with his bus project and I think I discovered a 
problem.  He had someone raise his bus, but I noticed that when the rear 
wheels are at their full down extension (bus raised up on jacks), the 
axles have zero sliding play at all.  When my bus is jacked up, I am 
still able to slide the axles towards and away the transmission.  I'm 
guessing that this lack of movement on his raised bus is going to lead 
to CV joint failure.

As a little history, the swing arms were adjusted to raise the bus two 
inches, torsion bar tension raised, shocks were changed to longer Rancho 
shocks, and the CV joints were changed to the Porsche 924S/944/944S CVs 
to handle the greater angles.  I'm thinking that the axles also need to 
be adjusted as well - does that seem right?  Are longer axles available 
and how do you figure out what length to use.  I'm guessing that the 
length has to be just right so that it's not pulling on the CV joints at 
full extension and pushing on the CV joints at full compression.  Any 
help would be much appreciated.

Thanks!
mike
