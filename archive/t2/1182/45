Wow Chris,

Quite the post.  Oddly this is in my mind as I dumped a solid 1
gallon on myself a couple weeks ago when doing a filter, sure comes out quick
if you don't work fast.  Then this week, another 2-3 gallons when I was doing
some starter wiring on a buddies '78 (carb converted) and noticed the 2-3 year
old German braided covered hose out of the tank was not great because
installer had made it too long, so it wasn't in it's clips where it went steel
to crossover, so it was getting NVH issues.

I still like German braided, use
it preferentially over the smooth German FI hose, and I know I differ from
lots of folks on that.  Call me old fashioned but that braid is incredible in
the pressure it can resist, and its abrasion resistance.  Yeah you can't see
internal failure, but correctly installed it will last near 10 years even on
todays gas I think at least, and I think every 5-10 replacement is warranted
anyway.  And when it does fail it tends to seep into the braid, which you
notice on inspection, instead of giving way entirely.  I think Ron (BD) did
say some years ago though that he truely felt the FI smooth stuff was more up
to modern fuel composition, but WTF I'm too old to change now.

I lament lack
of a good cheap easy 5/16" bulkhead fitting mostly, used to be a marine one,
but they seem to have gone away.

I do think the solenoid is potentially a
good idea, but...

Lot of heat up there in that location over a heater box
vent, and space isn't all that great either frankly.  Might get wonky with
vapor lock, solenoid longetivity, who knows what.  I think you hit on perhaps
better option an in tank pump, but would be a bit of a PITA.  Or rigid down to
the solenoid/pump but that can have a host of other NVH/fatigue issues.

To
me, a quality hose (whatever you feel that means) and a routine change
schedule is the most sense.  And frankly like many people, our daily drivers
(a ratty '94 burb and wifes '04 Lexus GX) have hoses far older than those on
any of my classics, which are irreplaceable as NLA for the burb (and custom
crimped assemblies) or because of cost on the Lexus.  Go figure, people worry
about 6-7 year old hoses on a FI bus, but will drive a 10-15 year old
Toyota/Honda/Chevy/VW whatever without a moments thought until one fails.

And
then of course people never replace their rigid brake lines, which fail
without warning from INTERNAL rust if fluid not changed except in all but the
extreme rust belts (or just in general on mid 90's Chevy products, sigh...)
 Reasonable safety is reasonable, but you can't protect against everything.  I
mean shit, one offset front end impact at any reasonable speed and it is all
over anyway, so got to weigh reality in general.

Something else I do feel is
smart on a bus,  in compartment fire suppression system.  I snagged 2 Halon
systems in the mid 90's before they became pricey, and have transferred one
from bus to bus though I haven't put it in the '77 yet, have put one in the
Triumph.  The modern dry chemical ones are fine for stopping fires but messy
as hell.  I do carry extinguishers in the bus in 3 locations, factory location
inside the slider, one behind my drivers seat to grab fast if running to help
someone on the road, and one on the back of the closet cabinet first thing I
see if I pop the rear hatch.

John

I was looking
over pictures of burnt buses and crashed buses last night and it all gives me
the willies. These aren't the safest of vehicles (though better than they
often get credit for) so why not upgrade what can be upgraded to increase
their safety a little? There was a story elsewhere on the web of a bus that
lost traction on icy highways and swapped ends a few times and then did a
barrel roll or several with one of the occupants knocked out (not trapped but
not aware he needed to exit the vehicle quickly). Inside the bus was spilled
campfuel and a lit candle. He did get out safely but the potential for
disaster was large. I'm thinking we'll do away with out under floor propane
tank and switch to the small disposable canisters and a single burner stove
for our roadside coffee. Or a single inside burner for out coffee/tea/hot
chocolate powered by an inside cabinet disposable canister held by a bracket.
Leave the shiny powdercoated propane tank
 outside for looks, just cap it off.
