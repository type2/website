Have you grabbed the intake immediately after this problem surfaced to 
see if it is icy cold i.e. frozen intake?

I've had similar problems when a Type I engine. Higher humidity, cooler 
temps and the venturi effect leads to a frosty intake b/c the crossover 
tube part of the intake is blocked.

Symptoms: runs at higher rpms well but stumbles badly at lower rpms. 
Also seemed to have a problem when the ice thawed and the water drained 
into the fuel/air mix going to the cylinders.

I think using an IR temp gun prob less than $20 at a big box hardware 
store - you ought to read uniform temps left and right on the crossover 
tube. 2" from the end ought to be similar temps at both ends, 6" from 
both ends ought to be similar temps. Muir's book advised to clean it out 
with a broken clutch cable chucked up in an electric drill. Consult his 
book for the details.
