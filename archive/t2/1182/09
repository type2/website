Thanks, John.  The redesigned site is still a work-in-progress (i.e. some of
the diagram pages aren't done yet, and I am still catching various listing
errors here and there), but I'm already very happy with where we are so far.


Some of the improvements are immediately obvious, such as improved
navigation, more products, and more photos. But another major change that
will interest Bus folk in particular is that we now list the entire Just
Kampers catalog from England. JK is Europe's largest Bus and Camper parts
specialist and carries many parts not normally found in the U.S.  We have
carried their parts for years, but this is the first time their catalog has
been fully available Stateside. Some is in stock, and the rest is
special-order (as denoted by the listed lead time) with no overseas shipping
costs, brokerage fees, or duties. Shipments arrive monthly. Your demand will
determine which Just Kampers items we add to our in-stock inventory as this
partnership progresses.

Another improvement is that the new site offers online lookup of your order
status and order history.  As a courtesy to our regular customers, if you
have ordered from us over the last couple of years we also uploaded your
previous order history (under "Legacy Orders" in your Account page) so you
can look up all of your orders in one place even if placed on the old site.


I would tremendously appreciate any and all feedback, suggestions, and error
reports regarding the new site. How can I make it better for you? What do
you like or not like? The redesign was largely based on user comments and
suggestions that I read and saved over the last few years, but like I said
we're not quite done yet.  Since it launched two weeks ago I've made at
least a dozen more changes (some of them substantial) based on initial
feedback.

Thanks,
