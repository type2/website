Subject: Back in the USA, and bus broke down

Hi Volks,
Landed at LAX a few hours ago to reunite with family and our 75 bus. On our
way to San Diego, but bus stalled in Buena Park, in heavy traffic.  Got a
Caltrans tow off the highway and am now parked at Knott and La Palma. Too
jet-lagged to think clearly, but checked ignition and have spark. Oddly
enough, bus restarted 20 minutes later, and I drove 1/4 mile to find a
better parking spot. Could be a fuel delivery problem, dunno. As I said,
too tired to think clearly. Will get a AAA tow to my brother's in Santa
Monica, so don't need AIRS help, but would welcome any ideas on proper
diagnostic.
Cheers,
Sami
