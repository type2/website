According to the wiring diagram, that is the fresh-air fan.

Ugh... Why do people do this kinda stuff.  That means someone had to go 
through the hassle of disconnecting the ignition wire spade connector 
from the hot side of S8 *and* put a fuse in it?!  Someone was obviously 
futzing around in there so I'm not surprised your fuse box is melted.

Let's first get things back to stock - first thing, disconnect the 
ground strap to the battery.  There be a red wire going from the hot 
side of fuse 8 to the ignition switch - make sure you pick the correct 
side with the electrical bus bar.  That should go to the ignition switch 
and there is no fuse.  Then, remove fuse 10, 11, 12, unhook the 
black/yellow wire to the light switch and the black wire to the coil. 
Connect the ground strap to the battery and you should now have constant 
+12 to the ignition switch.  Now turn on the ignition switch and you 
should have +12 at all of those points that you disconnected.  Add a 
fuse one at a time to see if they blow.

If they don't blow, you can disconnect all of the other wires to your 
coil and connect only the black +12v line to your coil.  Then connect 
the black wire to your reverse lights and test those (they're fused). 
Then connect your automatic chokes and start the car.

The last item left is your light switch.  I would test it in the off 
position with an ammeter to see if you have current flowing through. 
You can also use a test lamp.  If you need help with that, just let me 
know and I'll explain how.

Try to get your bus back to stock so that you know what's going where 
and fix the PO mess...
