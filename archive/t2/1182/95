Your problem cannot be the light switch.  I saw your other post where 
you said that you pulled the ignition plug and none of the wires were 
hot - that is not good and you either need to double check the wiring or 
your testing procedure.

If you look at the Bentley, you'll notice that there's a sizable 
red/white wire that runs from the main starter terminal (unfused) and 
heads up to the front where it connects to the fuse box and supplies 
power to fuses 9 and 8 (via a jumper).  You'll then notice that there's 
a pretty beefy red wire (also unfused) that comes from that fuse 8 
jumper over to the ignition switch that this wire is always hot.  Note 
that I said "unfused" because there are no fuses *between* the path of 
the battery and the ignition switch.

Double check to make sure that this wire is in-fact hot because if it's 
not, you might have other problems.
