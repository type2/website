Richard,

Sorry to hear about the crushing. Almost as bad as the guy that told me
about all the 4 cam Porsche Spyder engines he crushed back in the 60's -
guess that is why they get $30 - $50,000 for them today.

Yes, Ken at Busco has come up with some doghouse parts and body trim strips
for my 70. Reasonable prices, quick delivery and a nice guy to boot.
