Well I guess it would have helped if I actually put a link in my email.

Incidentally, contrary to what the other sites say, there are actually
three pieces that make up the Bus rocker panel (an inner, an outer, and
a center), not twol. The center one is not offered by Klokkerholm (the
Danish supplier of most Bus sheet metal) so the other vendors (who for
the most part only source from one supplier) don't even mention that it
exists. We carry all three.

As another aside, you can expect BIG price increases on the horizon on
Bus sheet metal. Klokkerholm (the largest supplier) has raised their
wholesale prices by 20-40%.  While we do use other suppliers besides
Klokkerholm (we have the largest percentage of genuine VW sheet metal of
any supplier, and also import from A.H. Scofield and Just Kampers in
England), those pieces that come from Klokkerholm will start to go up
everywhere as current inventory dwindles and new stock fills the
pipeline.
