Subject: problems with removal of upper torsion arm

Hi:

I need to replace the upper torsion arm ball joint on the passenger 
side of my 78 bus. I've run into a problem removing the torsion arm 
from the torsion bars. It won't come off. I've read the procedure in 
Bentley,  and also Mike Gensler's very helpful article in the library, 
but I'm reluctant to start pounding on it until I have heard your 
opinions.

The car is presently on jack stands with its weight removed from both 
front wheels. I was able to get the upper ball joint out of the 
steering knuckle without removing the lower ball joint. The upper 
torsion arm is now butted against the rubber stop (which I probably 
should have removed before I jacked up the car). I have removed the 
lock nut and set screw from the torsion arm. My understanding is that 
the torsion arm should slide off, but its stuck on there. How do I get 
it off? Sledge hammer? Any tricks I need to know about?

Thanks.

Rob Mead
