So after rebuilding the Dual Relay, and being confused about all sorts
of silly stuff, and breaking off #1 spark plug wire, and not hooking up
at LEAST 60% of the vacuum hoses, I re-adjusted the dizzy drive shaft
thingie, held up piece of romex (house wiring) to the battery, and
turned the engine, while I turned the dizzy and I heard what I thought
was a backfire, then another, and another, coming faster and faster, and
before I knew it my string of backfires were self supporting, and it
dawned on me, that they weren't backfires. Just a VW engine combusting
without a muffler! 
 
Many many thanks to EVERYONE who's helped! I couldn't have done it
without this list! Despite how super dense I might be, I'm learning
TONS, and getting to bond with my bus WAY more than most of my previous
cars. And I haven't even driven it yet. :) 
 
Runs REALLY smooth too considering it was running on three cylinders
with massive air flow leaks (from disconnected hoses)! Runs about as
good as my Buick does. HEh heh
 
Now I've got easy(er) projects ahead of me. Like putting back on the
engine tin I took off and painted, valve adjusting, spark plug wires,
installing pertronix (see my next post), and the gas pedal, and I'm set!
Yay!
