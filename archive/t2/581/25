Jay, I have many new parts and a lot of used ones for the SouthWind heaters.
Someone else mentioned it and I would second it, you would be better off
placing your second battery inside the bus (use a battery box) and place
your heater in the engine compartment because those little heaters are a bit
noisey when they running and take up more room than just a battery.

I need to update my site, the prices aren't current and I carry a lot more
parts now than I used to, but you can see some of what I carry here:
