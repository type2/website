Most likely it is the head of the piston pinching the pencil against the 
head. Try using some tape around the pencil so that it will hold the pencil 
only about halfway into the chamber. I used to use screw drivers and now it 
is the plastic tubing. I actually put a nail through it to hold it up from 
hitting the bottom of the cyllinder.
