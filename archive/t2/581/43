Subject: roof rack for 78

Hiya,

I happen to have something that would work for you.
I don't need them for the westie (they would work for it too) but
they were perfect on the 78 bus I parted out.

I was wanting $100 Canadian for them.
I also have some used retractable seatbelts Im going to sell. Pic's in the
directory.
