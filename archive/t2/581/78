I'm having a bear of a time finding it in the archives, so I'll just ask
whoever happens to be online at the moment. :) 
 
I'm trying to find TDC on Cyl. #1 so I can be sure I'm doing my dizzy
work right. I popped off the valve cover to watch the valve train open
and close stuff. I THOUGHT you could tell the compression stroke by
see'ing when BOTH valves were closed....


You are right... with a 4-cycle engine, only two of the cylinders fire on any 
given 360-degree rotation of the crankshaft.  The distributor turns half as 
fast as the crank.  If the engine was running before you began, you should be 
able to pop the distributor cover and see a mark on the periphery of the metal 
housing.  When the rotor points to this mark, you should be near TDC on cyl #1.

If you have a friend rotate the crank while you watch the valves of cyl #1, you 
should be able to talk yourself through the cycle, but remember to rotate the 
crank in the normal direction.  With firing order 1-4-3-2 lots of us set tappet 
freeplay by rotating the crank backwards, so we set the valves 1-2-3-4.  You 
can visualize this if you write out 
     1-4-3-2-1-4-3-2-1-4-3-2  
and look for the 1-2-3-4 pattern backwards.  Good luck!!
