Subject: WESTY ROOF BED

I have just bought a Type 2 1974.
It has had the westy roof taken off and replaced by a cheap and tacky roll
back sunroof.
I want to put the westy front flip back on I do know it was a front frip
because of the pop up rivets.  But it is like doing a jigsaw puzzle without
the picture. Hard!!
The pictures in the manual show a little but not fixings.
Plus the bed is a large board with fold over head board. Not a hammock as the
original shows.
Can you point me in the right direction.
