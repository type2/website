Subject: rebuild update and sale stuff

These darn vans are great.

Some of you may remember my plans to rebuild the motor on my yellow duck van
(78')
and I wasn't confident enough to do it myself.  The shop (AirCooled Classics)
in Saskatoon
has been awesome. Todd helped me pull it in the shop, let me take the tin off,
strip it
and split the case.  I even had the fun of taking the stuff to the truck wash
and degrease the
unit yesterday.  Wish someone had taken a picture of me in full rain slickers
powering it down
with Grand Slam degreaser. Amazing stuff.

I put up a folder on my website with some pics.

One picture shows a 'thing' ?  Maybe someone could correct me on that.

I also have some stuff for sale although im hoping they don't have to be
shipped
to far.

Seatbelts $120 for a set of 2 (Can$)
4 Cooper Tires with amazing life left.. bought new ones for the other van
before I realized I was not selling the yellow one.. parted it instead etc
etc. $100 Each with rims (C$)  $90 C$ without..
RoofRack.. fits the gutters perfectly and high enough to clear a poptop (with
the top down of course) $100 C$

I am also in the process of making up some sets of magnets like the ones I
have for my van.
2 peace symbols, 12 various flowers and splats.  $200 Canadian.  Color of your
choice. These
will stick on a bus travelling highway speeds no problem.  Done in bright
paint to show the van or bug off.
People swear they are painted on until I tell them to touch them.  They come
off easy and store fast.

Let me know if your interested.
If your interested in custom wording instead or alongside let me know.
Here's an example... had them out for the Drag Races this weekend.
