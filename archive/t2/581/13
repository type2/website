Subject: Crank and head blow out

  Been off the type 2 list for a while, but I am finally back, so I have a blow out special to celebrate

3> 79 to 83 2 liter rebuilt heads, these are GEX with their full warranty         150.00 each outright
1> 1.8 liter head with smog hole again GEX with full warranty                      150.00         outright
1> 1.9 liter water boxer crank      10/10                                                     150.00        outright 
1. 2 liter crank                            10/10                                                      150.00        outright

    All items were overstock from one of my suppliers and am passing on the savings to all
Everything comes with a full GEX warranty, so your covered. I have inspected all items and all appear to be done up to 
standerds, heads all have new exhuast valves and don't appear to be wasted heads refurbished.  All items sold 
outright with manufacturers warranty only. I had a lot more but all sold before I got back on this list,
     I will have a lot more type 2 68 to 79 blow out deals soon
