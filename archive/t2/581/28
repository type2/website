I'm mystified that it would run smoothly on #1 and #2 alone. Shows you 
how much I know.

Anyhow, have you checked for vacuum leaks in the line to the brake 
servo? I wouldn't be surprised if the L-shaped rubber thingie is 
cracked or isn't sealing properly--the connector that fits on the 
manifold near #3.

I don't know if this is kosher but a little squirt of carb cleaner 
directly on the fitting should tell you if there is a leak. If the 
engine speed changes when you do the squirt, you've got an intake leak.

And that's all I know about that.
