<< Tony,

Ummmm...didn't know it came in natural or synthetic.. !

All I can remember is that it is "sterile" and was labeled
with a "medical" reference.  Otherwise just a standard 4-6 oz bottle with 
the manufacurers label on it.

I've an empty "glycerine" bottle from an organic friend and checked it
against the "glycerine" sold at the local pharmacy...I was just curious
if there was a difference in the effect it has on the bus seals...I've
read in a few other books on the uses of glycerine for lubricating
and preserving rubber, but the books were quite old and (I assume)
the glycerine referred to was the vegetable by-product and the
rubber, another natural product not the man-made rubber in use
today...
Anybody with an older British car will remember the results of using
"American" brake fluid in their British Iron...Older brake systems used
natural rubber seals that the American fluid would eventually soften
to the point of failure..."Girling is not a gerund..."
