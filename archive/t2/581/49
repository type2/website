Subject: RE: [T2] ball joint

A special jig is required in order to press bay bus ball joints out of the
torsion arms.

If you look at the new ball joint you'll see there's only two small areas
they can hold the arm with as they press the ball joint out.  (getting them
in is somewhat easier)

If a local machine shop cannot do it, find an air cooled VW repair shop near
you and ask for a machine shop recommendation.

I asked BusLab out here in Berkeley, CA.  The referred me to Complete Auto
Parts & Machine (also in Berkeley) who did it for $15.00 per arm.

Another solution is to order arms with new ball joints already installed
from http://www.bus-boys.com and just send them yours when done...

 Can anyone recommend
someplace in Connecticut, hopefully near Madison, who would be able to
do this.
