Yeah, that would definately suck.  Maybe I'll look for a 75 and

If you have a 76-79 bus (these model years are wonderful) you will probably have to smog it forever unless some relief comes in the form of a future bill. Personally I will be moving out of California on principle to a car hobby friendly state if this law is enacted.
