AutoZone carries the correct Bosch plug wires. 

Do the valve adjustment before timing it. 

You did the fuel lines, make sure you do the filter too, and keep a
couple of spares with you. You'll probably clog up a few times until
you cycle the fuel out of the tank. (Might be worth having the tank
boiled out too. You may have just sludge in the tank. Check out the
recent threads on that.)
