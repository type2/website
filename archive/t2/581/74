Subject: Whistly noise after replacing fan

I replaced the fan (old one had a cracked blade) and belt on the
daughter's 75, using a nicely cleaned one.  On a long drive today, we
noticed  a "whirry" noise at a particular rpm around 1000 when engine
was idling. Thought it may be too tight belt; looosened it a bit but
noise is still there- It does not appear to be a rubbing noise-using the
ear, it seems to come from where the fan is, not where the alternator
is.  Anyone have this happen?
