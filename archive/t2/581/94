Pull the plugs and oil down the cylinders. ATF, 3in1 oil, engine oil, whatever you got. Thinner oil is better so it will creep into enverything. WD-40 is a joke but it still might help. 

Leave the plugs out, try to roll the motor over. Once it does, let it spin to loosen up and blow alot of the oil out. 

Had a stuck Corvair motor. Oiled the cylinders. Rotated it a bit in each direction each day until it would rotate both ways and all the way around. 

Run it, and then change the oil and filter.
