Sorry to hear it, that really sucks. Before I got mine some punk kids had 
gotten to it with rocks. They got windows and body panels.

That is a good start. I can say that I used to be a sissy, too. It really is 
not that hard. I use my same jack and stands.

http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/EngineRemoval.html this is for earlier 
models but same basic principles.

Your poor '82 needs some TLC. Take a day to get to know her. Even if you 
drop the engine take a peak and some pics of the clutch, etc. Then just 
throw it back in and let your mech. do it again later. Then you will have 
gained a little experience, seen your clutch, spent some quality time with 
your bus and most of all you will not be a "sissy" anymore.

If you are going to sell it do it yourself.
