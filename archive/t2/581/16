Subject: Last chance to have your voice heard on AB2683

This is a smog issue for Californians.

This bill is now in commitee in the Senate and an important vote is apparently tomorrow. In a nutshell the rolling smog exemption will be frozen at 75-older vehicles effective Jan 1, 2005. If you have a 76-79 bus (these model years are wonderful) you will probably have to smog it forever unless some relief comes in the form of a future bill. Personally I will be moving out of California on principle to a car hobby friendly state if this law is enacted.
