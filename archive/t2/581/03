Subject: door seals? pop top latches?

Hi Volks-

I have a bruised 1969 Campmobile. I have checked the archives and the 
library, but I would like a bit more input if anyone has replaced their 
front door seals. I want to purchase new door seals and saw a couple of 
posts in the archives regarding the poor fit of the Brazilian 
manufactured ones.  I have found them at gowesty.com, busdepot.com and 
bus-boys.com, west coast metrics.  According to different outlets, the 
German ones are available at a slightly higher cost.  Has anyone 
replaced door seals with either the Brazilian or German rubber, or both 
(!) and which would you recommend?  

Another question, which I have found various suggesstions and answers 
for is regarding the pop top latches on these busses.  (I  need to 
replace my door rubber because of faulty planning on my part a few years 
back and deciding to use a ratchet tie down to secure the pop top.) 
 When I bought my bus in 1987, the latches had been replaced with toggle 
bolt screws.  These were stripped out and failed, and I replaced them 
with one original (?) rubber latch, and a couple of odd latches with a 
spring mechanism inside.  Needless to say these failed after a few years 
and a few travels through windy territories.  I want to replace these 
and have found the rubber kind at various outlets.  Aside from using 
tie-downs and welding a latch on the outside of the bus body, as I read 
about in the archives, does anyone have a suggestion for a sturdy 
replacement latch?

Thanks for your time,
Karen
