Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Timing TDC

I had an engine that had the timing gear installed incorrectly.  This 
meant that the rotor was pointing in the opposite direction of the 
marking on the distributor when it was supposed to fire #1.  I had to 
swap the wires on the cap to make it run correctly.  Not *that* big of a 
deal, but it'll throw you if you don't remember that it's flipped.
