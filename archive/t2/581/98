and hope you don't get a face full of water.

The drain holes can also get clogged with dirt etc I have found. My 73 
had drainage and associated rust issues when I first got it, after 
pulling the panels off the doors I found a large build up of all kinds 
of stuff, pine needles and dirt. As soon as this was cleared out, 
prefect drainage. There shouldn't be a rust "problem" if its draining 
properly.
