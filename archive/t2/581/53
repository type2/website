Subject: Off to the crusher

I'm back on the road again as of last week thanks to the generosity of list
members, once again.

If you remember, I stripped the |ber hard to find bolt that holds the pulley
to the fan on the Type 4 engine. While in San Jose today on various errands I
thought I'd stop at A-German Auto which usually has a lot of engines and
parts. The owner told me he sent 30 engines off to the metal scrapyard a
couple of months back because the demand for the parts has dropped so low and
it was wasting space. I stopped at another German repair shop and got a
similar story.

Not that the junkyards are getting any easier but all of this makes me
apprecitate folks like Ken Madson of The Bus Co. and Joe Mitchell of Busted
Bus who save these valuable baywindow parts from the recycler to keep our
buses on the roads.

Thanks to you both.
