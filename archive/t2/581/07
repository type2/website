Karen,

I think I bought the real German ones from bus-depot when I restored my 
78.  IIRC the price difference was not that much for something I expected 
to last as many years as the original...and wanted to fit as original.

The fit was terrific, but did require some careful application of 
weather strip glue...Look, really look at how the originals were installed 
before tearing them out....digital pics are a godsend.

Cheers, dave
