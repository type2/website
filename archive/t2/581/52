try this. pull off both valve covers. Turn the crank to where the #1
piston is near it's top. You can use a pencil in the spark plug hole
to help make sure. This is TDC. Now look at the valves of #1, while
moving the crank forward/backward about 20 degrees. Do the valve move?
if not look over at #3. If #3 move & #1 don't you are at TDC of the #1
compression stroke. However if the valves on #1 move & #3 remain in
place just rotate the crank 360 degrees.

I would suspect the notch is the correct one, but verify first.

both my buses have a notch so it could easily be

probably, but remember the crank can be aligned at TDC of the
compression stroke & TDC of the gas expel/intake. so you need to
verify with valves. Also if installed correctly your distributor rotor
should point toward the small notch on the distributor if at #1 TDC
compression stroke

see above, but think of it this way. if any of the valves are open
during the compression stroke, how could it compress the air/gas
mixture? 

good luck.
