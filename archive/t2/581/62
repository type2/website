Subject: Front vent wing drainage?

I have my door apart replacing seals, etc. I notice that the rubber vent wing
seal (the large one that fits in the channel on the inside of the vent wing
frame around the top, front, and bottom of the vent) has three holes in the
bottom. There is one ahead of the pivot point and two behind. There are holes
in the metal channel that line up with these holes. I see that water has gone
through these holes because there is some rust around each one. The question
is what is supposed to happen to the water once it gets through these holes?
Is there supposed to be a way for it to eventually drain out the bottom of the
door without rusting the innards of the door?
