i'm not old school enough to know but i have heard that brake fluid was
originally made from castor oil.  is that what you were referring to tony?
on that note can anyone tell me why we don't use hydraulic fluid as brake
fluid?  i know that we use alcohol because it disperses the water evenly
through out the system, but it by its nature attracts water right?
