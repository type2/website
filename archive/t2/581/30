Subject: Re: [T2] sheet metal

  Wolfgang Int imports all of Schofields sheet metal. To this day Schofield still makes the best rockers drivers and cargo,
short rockers and associated pieces for split window buses.  To my knowlage he is the only one who makes decent 
rockers for split bus, better then anything from Brazil, but also twice the price. To save some money you can use 
anyones inner rocker (c channel) or have it made at any decent sheet metal shop out of a nice thick gauge steel. Better 
then and tin can Brazilian junk.
   Bay window stuff shop price, most places all carry the same stuff, or buy a rust free shell from Az or Cali and cut out 
what you need.
