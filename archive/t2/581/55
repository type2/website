Subject: RE: Timing TDC

I have been using a piece of 1/4" Plastic Water Line tubing. It is curved 
just enough that I can hit the top of the piston.

This link should help you find that mark. The fan can only go on one way. 
The lines you have sound correct for a keen PO. White at the #1 and #3 TDC 
and Red at the #4 and #2 TDC.

Pull the Dist. Cap and line up the mark when the rotor gets to the #1 firing 
position, this is another refference you can use.

Good Luck,
