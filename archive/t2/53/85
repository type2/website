Paul,

If you are going to go this route (and after 4-5 go-rounds with the horn
on my '73, I am *certainly not* saying it's a bad route to go), I would
ditch the whole stock horn button concept.  Head to your local FLAPS.
They sell generic horn buttons, buy one.  Buy one that includes some sort
of strap to strap it to the steering column.  Install the button on the
steering column.  Run a wire from one contact of that button to
the body of the bus (ground).  Run a second wire from the other from the
button to the horn. check both wires that lead in to the horn for 12V.
put your new wire on the contact that *DOES NOT* have 12V!  Bingo, yer
done.

The stock horn circuit is one of the bigger PITA's that VW ever came up
with.  I have worked on it, I have gotten it to work, but it requires
total insulation between the steering shaft and the shell, which is
verrrry difficult in vehicles as old as ours are.  About the only excuse I
have for maintaining the stock system other than my vintperv fascination
is that it does force me to check the isolator disk at the bottom of the
steering shaft every year or two.
