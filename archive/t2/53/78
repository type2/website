Subject: Sway bar installation...

For our one year anniversary my wife bought me EMPI front and rear sway
bar kits. (What can I say, she's super!)

I just finished installing the front kit, and it was pretty easy over all.
The directions that came with the kit (made by EMPI) where pretty sucky,
so I checked the archives and found some great info on what I needed to
do. Thanks type2 list archive! The holes for the bolts where too small, so
I had to drill them out, which I guess is the EMPI quality that I have
seen mentioned. However, I am happy with the new handling, and would
recomend the bar to everybody.

I found a little bit of info on the rear kits, but just enough to peak my
curiosity. The directions that come with the kit indicate that you have to
bend part of the frame down, and drill two holes in the bent part in order
to fit a u-bolt through that holds the bracket for the center of the bar.
I am hesitant to do this, to say the least. 

One message in the archives indicates that it is possible to attach the
bar to the torsion tubes instead. This sounds much more apealing, as it
does not require the bending and drilling of the frame.

Anybody know how this is done, or done it before? What hardware is
required and where can I get it?

Thanks type 2 list!
