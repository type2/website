Subject: Neat gizmo at Sam's

While I was doing some power shopping at Sam's Club this afternoon, I
came upon an item of interest.
In the automotive supply section, I was looking at the power inverters,
and then moved on about 5 feet and saw this "motorcycle, and ATV jack".
It has a flat open platform that is the right width, and length, to be a
handy dandy engine jack.
The darn thing lays almost completely flat, is on steel swivelling
caster's, and jacks up by foot pump !  

This jack really was neat, and inspected it for about 15 minutes,
imagining all the possibilities---I believe it was about $99.00.

If your around a Sam's check it out---could make a crummy job allot
easier----

I also saw a center console about the size of the Wolf unit I have in my
Van, with the cup holder's built in and all, but this thing had a AC
beverage-food cooler / heater in the front portion of it.

Pretty neat item,and it was only $47.00 !!
I was sad that I already have a console, or it would have been mine----


 
Later,
