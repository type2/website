Subject: Weird engine startup today in my 2.0 L 79 westy

My van sat for the day in dismal rainy weather, it really poured all day.
When I went out to start it, it just turned over and over. I popped the
dizzy cap thinking it was wet inside, (engine was all dry) but it was dry. I
went back and turned it over again, and pumped the pedal which is a no-no
with fuel injection. It finally caught and fired up, but ran just like a
carb does when it's totally over-choked. It chugged along on what sounded
like 1 cylinder (you know like mega choke on a carburetor) - chug - chug -
chug, as I feathered the pedal up and down, and finally gave it 2/3 gas, and
it cleared itself as the revs went up, but it took about 10-15 seconds. Then
it ran and idled fine. Shut it off and it started up normally? What do you
guys think? cold start injector? I swear it ran just like my old carbureted
Ford did when it was way overchoked.
Thanks for any direction,
Courtney
