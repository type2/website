Welcome to the late model bus scene.
Rule #1: =

It is not a bug. =

Unlearn what you have learned.

Never run any engine for any more than a few seconds with no exhaust syst=
em.
For sure  don't try to tune it up (!) with the exhaust system off. Reinst=
all
it and make sure it doesn't leak.

Diagnose and repair all vacuum leaks. There is a 1/2" port on the manifol=
d (or
should be) that actuates the brake booster. The line runs all the way up =
to
the booster. There are several pieces of rubber line that can leak.

I'D DO THE FOLLLWING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
Tear the Weber down and clean the bowl and jets thoroughlly.  It is a sim=
ple
beast. Careful with the gaskets or go in with a gasket kit. In any case,
making sure it gets clean and sealed up well is the idea here. Use a good=

gasketgoop that ignores gasoline. Not too much...you don't want it IN the=

carb.  Use your goop between the carb and the manifold as well.

What was done to the engine while it was out?  If it was a full rebuild, =
were
the dots on the cam and crank gears lined up right? I've seen them 180 de=
g
out. Did they install the dist drive gear correctly?  See your new Bentle=
y
manual for installation. Is does not go perpendicular like a bug.

Valve adjustment?  Points gap/dwell?  =

Sure its a 1700? access was right - a 77 westy ran a hyd-lift 2liter.

good luck - hope this didn't sound too harsh.
