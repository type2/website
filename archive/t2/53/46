Subject: Re: [T2] chrome tipped exhaust (help)

Chrome paint is just very bright silver paint - I don't think you'll ever 
make the mistake of thinking the paint is real paint. Might look good at 20 
feet but may also burn off with the heat of the engine.

Is this a rust hole? A poor weld done by the factory? A manifold heater 
fitting?

In my experience, EMPI is just a name applied to alot of cheap stuff made 
in Taiwan - lots of shiny glitter and chrome, fancy catalog pics. No good 
fit, no good quality, no good function. Just average or below in every 
category. Maybe there is something I'd be satisfied with, probably not. At 
one time (way back in the 70's) I hear they had good stuff. I was still a 
young kid back then though.

You have to search to find the good stuff or make your own.
