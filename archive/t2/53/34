Subject: WT Trade: my Weber DFAV for stock Solex dual carbs

Anyone wanting to replace carbs on their bus? I have a used Weber dual throat 
progressive, with manifolds and air cleaner adaptor. It came off my son's bus 
and was working before the rebuild. It has some wear on the throttle plate 
shafts.

I want a complete stock dual setup, including linkage, air filter box, and 
hoses.

I also have an 009 dizzy that I would trade for a stock dual advance dizzy.
