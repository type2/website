Subject: heater knob question

i'm closing in on finishing my heat setup.
1. Good heater boxes.
2. Flaps locked open.
3. Insulated the duct pipe to the front of the bus 
4. Set of  circa '71 bus heater blowers hooked up.
5. Doghouse holes blocked
6. Plugged the vents under the "way-back" seat

Heat temp good, but the air velocity at defrosthers is
meager. (Part of it is that Those VW blowers aren't
exactly tornados.)

I'm trying to figure out how the narrow vent under the
walk-through between the front seats works. I have a
knob under the driver's right leg that has something
to do with it. Is out ON and in OFF? Of course, it may
be disconnected--where does that cable go? I can't
find it under the bus. The terminus of the ducts is
covered with a vinyl/asbestos boot that I'm afraid to
move without an EPA permit.
