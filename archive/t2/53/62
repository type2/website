Subject: Damn Dome Lights

List,
I'm having some problems with my dome lights.  One day I have both, now
I have neither.  Only the drivers door and the dash knob actuate the
lights (when they work) but now nothing, not even switching them on at
the light.  I checked the fuses, all look good.  Is there somewhere I'm
missing?  Any thoughts?


Later,
