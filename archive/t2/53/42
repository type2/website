Manifold vac.  I cobbed together a "T" from some brass fittting (no plastic
to be found) to go from the 1/2" to the 1/4" vinyl reinforced hose I used.
(See in the archives the recent postings of Mr. Eric Raits re: this, or
p-mail me if you don't have any luck calling them up. I've got 'em
somewhere.)

1/4"  works nicely and is available at your local home depot, etc.

Good luck.
