Subject: ADMIN: The Library is missing some books!

Hello all!

There's nothing like having a once-dead link end up pointing to a porn
site to get you off your butt about updating your Web pages.  :)  I
have finally completed a pass through the Library at type2.com that
I started (mumble) ago.

You will note that some of the articles in the Library are now marked as
dead links.  I have also compiled a list of all the dead links I found,
and included it at the end of this message.  I know that some of these
documents are probably dead and gone, some of them have been misplaced
on type2.com, and some of them probably just need minor adjustments in
the URLs.  I will be chasing each one of these myself, but any input from
the lists would be great! 

If anyone knows more current URLs for these documents, please p-mail me
and let me know what they are.  Any other information, like a contact
for the author, etc, would be helpful as well.  Please send these to
me, mattroberds(-at-)home.com, directly, and not to the list.

Thanks very much for your help!

Matt Roberds
Type2.com Librarian (ssshhhh!)
