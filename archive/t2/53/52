You're off to a good start.

First, if it's just the Woodruff key in the shaft, why
not just replace the key? 

Alternator vs. generator is according to your
priorities, but for my money, I like the added boost
of the alternator, especially in a Westy, where you're
more likely to run lights and stuff without the van
running. Plus, alternators aren't that much more
expensive.

Not necessarily - 60k is not a lot of miles for one of
these engines. According to your climate, you may not
be seeing smoke, but steam, as condensation
evaporates. You might also try a good tune up before
you go spending money on a rebuild.

Yes, you can. I'd recommend a set of machine-in 88mm
pistons, to bring you to 1678cc's. Of course, if
you're going to do this, I definitely recommend doing
the full rebuild. I'm building this very same engine
for my '71 Bus, with a little guidance from Jake Raby
on best practices. Here's the specs on mine as it
currently stands, if this will give you an idea:

New AS41 case
69mm counterweighted, balanced crank - DPR Racing
New Web Cam 86 grind camshaft (.358" lift, 270°
duration)
Web Cam lifters, cryogenically treated
CB Performance 041 heads (40mm intake, 35.5mm exhaust)
Gene Berg 88mm machine-in P&C's
Full-flow oil system
1.5qt extra sump
Bosch alternator
Swivel-foot valve adjusters, cryogenically treated
H/D valve springs
Dual 36mm Dellorto carbs with Berg hex linkage

I chose this combination on two recommendations. One,
a buddy in my VW club has a similar 1678cc in his 70
Westy, though not quite as tricked out as mine, as his
goals were slight different. Jake Raby built his, and
it's pretty phenomenal. Stump-pulling torque, and a
decent top end. Climbs hills like a goat, still will
do seventy all day, and it doesn't get hot. Mine's
designed for a little less torque, little more top
end, but similar goals: more performance without
sacrificing a lot of reliability.
