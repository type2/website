Subject: Do you need separate oil temp and pressure sender?

Hi,

I have a 71 Westy with Oil Pressure guage. There's a sender connected right
at the stock oil pressure switch. Now I want to put in an oil temp guage and
do I need to put in another oil pressure sender or is there one that does
both? What is the best way to connect, keeping the stock oil pressure
switch? Also, how difficult is it to install a head temp guage?

Thanks!
William
