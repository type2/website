If I were going to split the engine from the tranny I'd invest in a pilot
bearing, new clutch disk, new throw out bearing, starter pilot bushing,
pressure plate. I'd most likely replace the CV boots as well. Although
the dollars seem to be climbing you'll pretty well be buying about 45,000
miles of prepaid insurance on your drive line. Pulling a tranny is a PITA
and replacing the CV boots is right up there as unpleasant so I like to
clean house while I'm in there. Installing a new crank seal at the same
time you're there would be reasonable thinking.
