If by "sensible" you mean "you can just barely feel it" then it's probably
OK.  If you can see denting on the splines or in the hub it probably
isn't.

The spacing between bearings is, IIRC determined by the spacer between the
inner and outer bearings.  It takes all that stress when you torque down
the nut.  If the bearings couldn't float a bit, you would stress the
bearings.

Big snap ring tool.  No substitute for proper tools.  You don't have to
pay Snap-on prices, but get the right one!
