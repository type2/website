it will be tough to get much of a useable HP increase without major engine
mods. also, one assumes that all of the free or almost free things have been
looked after.

there's one simple thing you can do to the injection system: replace the
fuel pressure regulator with one that delivers a SLIGHTLY higher pressure,
therefore delivering more fuel for combustion. i believe a bosch regulator
from a datsun 240z is supposed to do this well. there are no other EASY FI
system mods that i know of. i will double check this in my emails and make
sure this is correct (about the datsun 240z)

a good extractor exhaust will help a bit, but may be difficult to find for a
1978, i'm not sure. the 1978 exhaust is pretty convoluted, yes? this can be
replaced with something that flows more freely.

there are excellent aftermarket distributors at aircooled.net which will
give some extra HP, but they do cost. for a street bus, look for the mallory
units with vac advance, and open up the wallet.

does "bolt-on" mean not taking the motor either apart or out of the vehicle?

there are significant gains in HP to be made by rebuilding the motor with a
larger displacement, and if you were contemplating a turbo, you'd need a
high level of confidence in the innards of your powerplant, not to mention
having to pull the motor to fit the turbo properly anyhow.
