Subject: Horn

2nd attempt at sending this.  Sorry if you get this twice.

That's right!  Again the horn subject.

Time to deal with the mess of wires under my dash.  While there, I'd
thought I'd attempt to deal with the horn.    I have the typical
"Horn-don't-shut-off" problem.  I figured the cause was the system was
grounded in the steering column, which seems to be the
common cause of the problem.  But, instead of going the route of pulling
the column, I decided to bypass the column all together.
Seemed simple enough.  Run a hot line to one terminal an the horn, then
a line from the other terminal to a button and from the button
to ground.  But (as always) I've hit a unforeseen snag.  The horn
appears to grounded at the horn.  With the ground line
disconnected, if the horn gets power it still sounds.  So, I tried a
bench test.  I pulled the horn off the bus, set it on the front seat and

ran wires as stated above.  Worked normally.
The horn (or at least the mounting bolts) are metal and connected to the
frame, this is where the grounding appears to occur.  Should
there be rubber washers or plastic parts separating the horn from the
frame?  I could simply run a hot line (with the button switch in
the middle) to the horn, since it's already grounded the horn will sound
when the button is pressed.  Will that cause any new electrical
problems?
Suggestions welcome.
Thanks
