Subject: chrome tiped exhaust (help)

Greetings,

OK it's like this.  A while ago, since I didn't like the stock exhaust set 
up on my bus I ordered the empi GT 2 Tip dual sport style exhaust system 
('72-'74).  It looked cool in the picture but I didn't like the paint job 
(which had many runs and they even missed some spots).  This coupled with 
the fact that I was warned by a fellow list member that they used crappy 
paint I decided to strip and repaint it using a high temp manifold paint.  
Well that was great until when it was hanging up to dry my dad decided to 
move it and accidentally dropped it about three feet onto the chrome tip 
DOH!!! So now instead of it being nice and round it has a distinct oval 
shape on the one side.  But the worst part is that it chipped some of the 
chrome, and I am sure that more will come off once I bang it back into the 
right shape.

So the question is this: what is the best way to fix this?  I was talking to 
one of my friends on icq and he mentioned that you can get a chrome spray 
paint.  But I want to seek the wisdom of everybody here before I try 
anything.

Besides the crummy paint job there was a small hole (aprox 1/8") on the
manifold by the flange.  I got that welded up but I guess the moral of the 
story is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" and this is the last time I will 
ever buy anything empi.  Anyway if anybody has any great words of wisdom I 
would appreciate it.
