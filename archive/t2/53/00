Subject: Re: [T2] Tires for Westy

Don, the best tires for the bay (even the manual states this) are "D" rated
tires.  For one reason the load limit is pretty high (a loaded westy will
weigh around 5000 lbs.) but also the D rated tires have a stiffer side wall
for more stability in cross winds.  Believe me, here in Kansas before I
could put new tires on the last bus I purchased, I almost got sick driving
60 miles to KC in a cross wind!!  You will love the way the stiffer tires
handle.  Have you ever been driving on a windy day and had your bus do the
"semi shimmy" behind a big rig?  D rated tires will take out most of the
jumping when a big rig passes you.
