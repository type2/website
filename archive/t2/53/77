I TOTALLY agree with John. Lower CR does NOT mean lower engine temps....What
super low CR does mean is NO tunability, super hot exhaust temps, and gas
mileage like a V8.

I'm not advocating high CR, but dynamic CR is wghat that really matters,
anyway..Add a small cam, or headwork, and watch the dynamic number drop
substantially..

I have customers engines, running 8:1, all the time, and up to 9.5 on full
street cars. 8.2:1 with all our performanxce engines, is the norm, and
mostare at 8.5:1, static.....



A bus is a little different story, but we still keep them at or above 7.5:1.
