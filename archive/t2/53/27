Subject: Brake servo & A/T vacuum

On the main (13mm) vacuum line to the brake servo ther is a small "t" after
the check valve with a small (2-3mm) hose coming from it. Does everyone have
this and does anyone know where to connect it?

I have a 73 with Automatic trans.  Does any one know if the vacuum valve in
the trans gets manifold vacuum or throttle vacuum?

Maybe thats what the small hose off of my brake vac line goes?  the
connection to the trans valve seem larger like 10mm
