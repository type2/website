Gentlepersons-
                      Can't afford to re-engineer an H2O heating system? Con-
cours quality sheepskin seat covers just out of your reach...Try your
local thrift/resale shoppe for recycled shearling coats...A little creative
stitchery and that $5 xtra large coat can warm and protect your seat.
My neighbor and I turned 20 bucks worth of coats into enough for both
vehicles...old bike inner tubes supplied the fastening "system".
