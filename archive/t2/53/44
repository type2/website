I would agree UNLESS you are painting the vehicles I have worked on which 
had half a dozen paint jobs already! But Terry is right - when you get 
close to where you want to be sanding wise, better move down a notch to a 
finer grit or you will indeed be spraying a BUNCH of primer to fill those 
scratches.

I had a chance to use the high-build primer that several of the paint 
manufacturers offer and they are wonderful for building a scratched and 
bruised car body back to straight. Whole milk (maybe even like cream?) 
versus skim milk.
