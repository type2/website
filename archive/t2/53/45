Okay - where did you get adapters and how much??

The last time I researched the topic wheel adaptors were mucho-expensive 
AND the manufacturer stated that they were for light duty - whatever that 
is... <grin>

I too have a set of Cookie Cutter wheels and would love to run them.

And I agree the only speedo calibration problems are one coming from a 
change in outside tire diameter. Bigger rim, shorter side wall. There are 
easy math equations that can help figure that.

Of course that is the reason I want 15" wheels - less sidewall, less 
wander, better handling, and yes I'll be adding sway bars too.

Thanks for the good post Jim!
