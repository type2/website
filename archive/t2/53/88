Hi,

Sounds like a pilot bearing problem. The parts costs about $2. The 
motor must come out and a shop might charge you 5 or 6 hours of labor 
to do it. That can get ugly fast.  You can pull your motor and do the 
job a few hours. If it is your first time you may find a local VW nut 
to help you out. It is not very hard to yank the motor on a 71 bus 
and you will learn a lot while you impress your neighbors with your 
shade tree mechanic act.
