Subject: MPH question

Gear ratios and all that make my head spin. So looking for "general" 
basic answer here.

What speed would a '79 bus with a stock 2.0 engine, stock 091 tranny, 
and stock tire sizes be running at 3500 RPM in 4th gear?

p.s. For that matter, anyone know what speed a stock '75 super beetle 
would be running at 3500 RPM?
