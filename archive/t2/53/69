Subject: oil leak due to ??? cold??

Question to the list since everyone here has been such a great help in the
past.  1600DP engine no problems except a little hesitation on startup....
til it warms up....and never an oil leak at all..... not even a very small
drip.....it has been a little hard to start lately..... have to pump the
accellerator..... Well. today.... went out.... started it up....and let it
warm up a bit, then when I pulled out of the driveway.. there was a large
puddle of oil, kind of thick since it was cold. and I noticed in driving out
the driveway, there was a steady stream of drips.  Also, when I came out of
the store, there was a large puddle again..... I put in a quart of oil...
she started right up... brought her home. and she is dripping again.....
fairly large puddle.  Engine is running good... plenty of power, and no
smoke.
Any ideas would be appreciated....... hope it is not time for a
rebuild...... we are looking at that on my '78.
Thanks,
