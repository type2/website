Subject: 15" wheels and Fat Boy Muffler

Hey all:

I just wanted to address the thread of 15" wheels for busses.  I've done al=
ot of checking lately, including looking at Audi wheels, MBZ wheels, and ne=
w VW wheels.  New Audis have the right bolt circle, but the offset should b=
e checked to see if they're OK for busses.  The same with wheels on new Mer=
cedes'.  I never got quite serious enough about these wheels to research it=
 myself.  New VW's don't have the correct bolt circle, so they're out.  I w=
ent with 15" Porsche Cookie Cutters, which came stock on 944's.  I've never=
 seen a bus with these wheels, and I think these wheels look "retro" enough=
.  Since the bolt circle for Porsche wheels is different than bus wheels, I=
'm using wheel adapters.  I know some of you in list land don't like wheel =
adapters, but if they're well made, they shouldn't be a problem.  I ran an =
old Datsun auto-cross car years ago with wheel adapters, and that car went =
way faster, with much greater G-loads than any bus, and I never had any pro=
blems with my wheel adapters.  Also, I keep hearing about the speedometer/o=
dometer being out of calibration if you put 15" wheels on your bus, but thi=
s is a semi-myth.  Keep in mind that the speedo is calibrated for use with =
the tires that VW chose as stock.  If you put on the exact size of 14" tire=
 that VW used as stock, the outside diameter for a 185/14 tire will be diff=
erent from manufacturer to manufacturer.  So even if you stay with the stoc=
k 14" size, chances are you'll be out of calibration anyway.  In fact, if y=
our tires get a little low on air, that will change the speedo calibration =
also.  When you go to a 15" wheel, it's called a "+1" conversion.  You're s=
upposed to use a tire with a lower sidewall profile, so the overall outside=
 diameter of the tire should be pretty close to that of the stock 14" tire/=
wheel combo.  The result is that your speedo shouldn't be off by much.

On the muffler issue, I asked the list last week for performance muffler ad=
vice; thanks to the folks that replied.  I found out that the "Fat Boy" muf=
fler I have was made for a Bug, and that one exists for Bus use, but I have=
 the wrong one.  Being the cheap guy that I am, I decided to make this muff=
ler fit my bus, so I welded some spacers onto the mounting flange, and the =
body of the muffler now clears the moustache bar.  It hangs a little low, b=
ut shouldn't be a problem.  As for performance, I could really feel a diffe=
rence, and it's not too loud, so I'll live with it.
