Phil, If I ground the wire in the harness to ground, would that do the same
thing?
I ask because I dont have a soldering gun. If I just use jumper wires with
alligator clips,
would that do just as well to test?

Thanks for the link Karl, I have that manual, its a good one.
All the ohm readings came out withih spec, and I removed the aux air valve
and heated/cooled it, it works too.
At this point, I can rule out a few things, I am curious about grounding the
T2 sensor,
that is something I didnt play with too much because it was brand new.

Thaks everybody..  Ill keep you posted..
Aaron
