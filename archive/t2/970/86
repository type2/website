Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for fuel injection help (L-Jet)

Well, I ran a new 8g ground wire from the neg. on battery to the block..
I cleaned the battery srap and took apart and cleaned the tranny strap..
I should have good ground now for sure...

The white wire on the neg. of coil is there and I get the pulse at the ECU
plug on #1.
The black wire to the pos. on coil is there as well.
Ive tried:
different 78 ECU
different injectors (although mine just got rebuilt by CruzinPerformance)
different wiring harness
different AFM
different series resistor block
I tried a different dual relay when I was messing with this in the past, but
have one now and will try it yoday.

WTF!?!  I can still start on fluid, but I do not get the pulse at the
injectors and
they still are not firing..
The temp II sensor was new a year ago when this all started. It feels a bit
like its threaded funny,
but I dont see how that would affect it to much, it still would get hot.

I have fuel pressure (30+ lbs) and spark (she will start on spray), the
vacuum lines are fine..
The injectors have voltage, but for some reason the ECU is not grounding
them to fire..

HELP!!!  Does anyone have anything to contribute?
Im pulling my hair out!
I really dont know what else to check, I need a hand..
Thank you in advance..
Aaron
