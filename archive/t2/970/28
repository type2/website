Subject: REPOST: leaky propane tank safety valve/guage

I thought I'd repost my question for my leaky pressure gauge/check valve 
for my propane tank.  Any help appreciated!

-------- Original Message --------
Hey Everyone,
I have a 78 Westy with a propane tank.  I have a main valve, safety 
valve thing (w/ pressure gauge), and then the regulator.  The way I turn 
the gas on is by opening the main valve and then press down on the 
safety valve/gauge.  The gauge goes up to whatever level the tank is 
filled to and pressure is held in the system.  I think the safety 
valve's purpose is to ensure that there is not a wide-open leak as that 
will cause the valve to close if pressure is not held in the system.

Recently, however, my safety valve has started leaking around the place 
where it slides in and out whenever I press it down.  I can jostle it 
around and eventually it stops leaking, but I figure it's probably best 
to replace it.

Does anyone know where I can get a new one?

Thanks!
Mike
