Subject: Re: REPOST: leaky propane tank safety valve/guage

Hi Mike,

 These folks may not be in your neck of the woods but I have found them to be extremely helpful, and very knowledgeable on all LPG topics. unlike some folks they have the reference materials to hand and are willing to show you exactly why they recommend a certain course of action.   They know how to do things safely, have a very good inventory of parts, and know where to get most anything else.  I find them to be a first class outfit. jon

I thought I'd repost my question for my leaky pressure gauge/check 
valve 
for my propane tank.  Any help appreciated!
