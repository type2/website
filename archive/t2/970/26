Not entirely true.

If you only have liability coverage you're insurance company doesnt cover
anything if you're hit, period.  Nor will they "go after" anyone for you.
My insurance company handled opening a claim with the other insurance
company, but all they'll do is assist.   If the other guy has no insurance
or the other company denies the claim, then it's entirely up to me.

Also:  There are No Fault policies available, but not all policies are
like that based on our /other/ experiences over the past few years.
