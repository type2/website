I used the ones on the right... I don't think they were from Vdub parts, 
but I think my mechanic must have sourced them from the same place 
because they look the same.

Having said that, I would say that the ones on the right would tend to 
seal better because they have a raised "O" area to help seal when the 
exhaust flanges tend to bend in towards each other.
