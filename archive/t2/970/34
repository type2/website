Subject: baptism in fuel

Here you are talking about a VW "rite of passage".

 

It is called the "Baptism in fuel".

 

I have one more baptism to go, at the gas tank to the fuel regulator at the
firewall.

thanks for the responses from 10 days or so ago.

 

i haven't had time to go fault finding for a while (time off work lining out
the inside of our new home)  Finally checked on Thursday a found the hose
that runs from the fuel tank to the pump has had a fuel filter installed on
it.  The line coming out of the filter was split at the filter.

Removing the hose, holding the end so fuel doesn't run out, cutting the end
off the old hose with the other hand & then pushing it back on again while
fuel runs down my arm is not my favourite job (yes, I know I should have
clamped the fuel line, but by the time I had remembered that advice, the
hose was already off).

 

Now all I have to do is get rid of the smell from the heater tube as fuel
had been leaking on it for the last week.
