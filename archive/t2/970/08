Darn, missed by 300 kms. But, if you want a boring 3 hr drive...

You could have helped me rip apart the left
cylinder bank to see if a valve actually broke, or if it's just a
dropped seat (followed by requisite Calgary micro-brews)
At any rate the engine will be dropped out of the Van tomorrow morning.
