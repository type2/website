Well they sound nice. Didn't actually see any drifts,
but that double cab was sure doing something after it
got outa sight - you can hear the revs kinda warbling
there as he throttle steered. Toward the end there was
a nice over-rev also.

My take on bus drifts is this (from years of
experience!):
You can go 15 degrees out without a problem. You
cannot go 16 degrees - only 15 degrees! The next
number after 15 is 180! - and if yer lucky, 360! -BaH
