Damn, you make that sound easy.  But then you're the guy who can do an engine drop in 35 minutes.  The rest of us should be so lucky.  I've got to make a remote starter.  

Did I miss something when you said:

Exhaust JUST starts to move open, STOP, adjust intake.
Intake JUST closes, STOP, adjust intake.
Did you mean: Intake JUST closes, STOP, adjust exhaust?  

Thanks...KR
