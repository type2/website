 its been 25 years, so pardon the vernacular.  Out here, its called "the coast".  You say "shore" out here
(and I have) and everyone looks at you kinda funny.

In the east you go 'down to the shore'
In the west you go 'to the coast'

Just like if you are on the west coast, you say you are going 'back east'
On the east coast, you are going 'out west'.

Never ever are you going back west......
