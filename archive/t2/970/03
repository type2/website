How observant your are Anthony.

Yep--TV Pro Tek, Subgum Miracle oil additive, would have allowed his
wife to go to the grocery store, take 10 hot laps on a road racing couse
on the way home, throw sand into the crankcase, and then hose it down
prior to driving it into the freezer where it would still fire right up
after a night of sitting in sub zero temps.
And all in less than 12 hours, and with no fear of burning the engines
bowels up---

Tough stuff that Pro Tek---and you caught this one right away
Tony---what a top of the line product obserever you are--

Good call---  ~ 8 )-
