Subject: Transmission drain plug with '80s hairdo

After a few months of kicking myself for not getting around to it I  
finally checked and changed my transmission oil.  I bought this bus  
in August and haven't put more than a couple thousand miles on it  
since then, but I still hated myself for driving on an unknown  
quantity of gear oil.

When I pulled the drain plug it had a whole bunch of shavings  
attached to it in a really nifty star shape somewhat reminiscent of  
rock and roll hairdos in the '80s.

There were no chunks of metal on the plug, just really fine dust/ 
shavings suspended in the oil.

Here are the photos:

Should I be worried about this quantity of material, or is this a  
normal amount?  I have no idea of the care and maintenance of this  
bus prior to my ownership, but the old gear oil didn't smell burned  
nor was it super black or particularly old looking.

The bus is a 79, CA originally, but with the FI system replaced with  
a Webber progressive by some PO.

On a separate note, I replaced the 009 distributor with an SVDA unit  
from CB Performance.  Wow what a difference that made!  Sometime this  
summer I'll finish putting together a complete L-jet system and get  
the thing back to stock (Federal, at least) levels.  I can't wait to  
get rid of that carburetor.

Thanks a lot,
Zack
