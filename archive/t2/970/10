We had a uninsured crash our  SOB but this information is in Calif, 
unless you elect more than the uninsured coverage was limited to $2500,  
this was something we did not know.
So for all to check their state insurance regulations.
Also the insurance accepted craigslist.com value as it was a unique truck.
