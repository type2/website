 Hi Luis,

 Remove the rear hatch lock handle. there's a 4-digit code on the
 side. That is the code for the key.  Send that code to Steve at
 www.steveslockshop.com and he can cut you a replacement key for a  reasonable cost, and ship it fedex so it
gets to you quickly.

A 73 does not have a 4 digit code.

It will be 2 numbers, the letter R, and 3 numbers.

As an example: 12R345
