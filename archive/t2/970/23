 The gasket on the left was from Autozone. The one on the right is from Vee Dub Parts in Huntington Beach, CA.
Neither came with manufacturer information.

 The Autozone one is just some thin metal around a thick paper gasket.
The VeeDub one is layers of metal. So which is better?

 The Autozone one would be more forgiving, but the VeeDub one would be more durable.

Either will last as long as the flange is flat or convex. I have been known to use a BFH and tap each ear.
This way when you tighten the bolts, the center makes contact and then the ears pull down.

If the flange is concave, no gasket will last......
