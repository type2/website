Hoover once wrote: "When you've checked all components in a system  
and found them functional, yet the system does not work, then the  
fault is in the system itself and not the components".

Like many Hooverisms - it doesn't apply here but it's always  
interesting to read. :-)

My theory: the ECU can only bring the injectors to the same reference  
level as ground. If the voltage differential between the battery and  
the case is not enough to energize the solenoid inside the injector,  
you won't get fuel. If may not even be enough of a voltage drop to  
trigger the ECU circuitry to pull the injectors to ground voltage.

Since the injector coils and the series resistor packs have specified  
resistance, double check those.

You are not getting fuel at the appropriate time as evidenced by the  
fact that if you spray in fuel before cranking the engine, you can  
hear it fire up until the fuel runs out.

Assuming you haven't already by this point, I would go on an  
electrical witch hunt to determine what the exact voltages are in  
your system between battery, positive cable, starter, transmission,  
ground strap, engine case, frame, battery negative cable, etc. Don't  
forget the coil.
