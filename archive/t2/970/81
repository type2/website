Subject: Re: [T2] urethane or rubber torsion arm bushings (Donuts)

My experience has been that while Urethane Spring Plate Bushings are heavier
duty, they are more solid than the original rubber style.  Urethane mounts
and spring plate bushings tend to transmit more road, engine and
tranny noise than the originals.  Urethane's great for off-road, but for the
regular everyday driving on the street or for long road trips, I would stick
to the rubber variety.

YMMV

Coming to you live from a campground wi-fi in Elk City, OK tonight
