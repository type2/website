Woooo !

I am wondering now if we really need oil in our engine ! maybe its just 
marketing and we don't need to  waste our money to buy those expensive 
Mobil 1 20W50 oil !  it will ultimately fix my engine oil leak also ! ;-)

I don't think you damaged your engine because the engine was probably 
cold , your wife obviously did not drive very fast, and they were 
probably enough remaining oil to lubricate the moving parts of the 
engine for a couple of minutes.
