Crumb.  I'm gonna have to slide under the bus and see.  Its been a
while since I last did this.  If I'm confused and it is valve overlap,
then my believed TDC is wrong.  Hazah.  If I'm not confused and there
is a dead space, then... what's the deal?  I'll get under the bus
tonight and see what's what.
