Yes, I suggest reusing your original heads.  Aluminum does not fatigue 
so new ones should not have a longer life expectancy than used ones. 
Your original heads are obviously made of superior material to have not 
cracked after all of those miles - why replace them with an unknown 
quantity?  Have them updated with better seats/valves and put them back 
on, man!

p.s. I didn't know that "new" German heads were available... are they?
