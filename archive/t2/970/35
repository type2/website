Subject: [T2] 73 rear brake shoe stars wont adjust

i have put new rear brake shoes on my wifes 73 westy...
   
  when the hub is off i can adjust the stars fine...
   
  when the hub is on i can only adjust them so far before i cant adjust them any longer???
   
  they just wont adjust right when hub is on... 
   
  what have i done or not done?
   
  i took some pictures last night of the shoes on there and looked at them against the pictures in the bentley.
   
  I dont see a difference .....?
   
  HELP PLease its camping weather and we wanna camp in her bus soon...
   
  i know its probadly something i have done to not get a adjust out of the stars...
   
  you can adjust so far but not far enough to give the wheel any drag....
  you cant adjust anymore on either one of the stars after a few turns.with the screw driver...
   
  ps this happens on both wheels.. so i have done soemthing the same to them i guess...?
   
  thanks
  chai
