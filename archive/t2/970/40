right just looks better.  In my experience (I worked in a shop where we did
exhaust) the main thing is a good, flat non-leaky seal.  Leaks are what eat up
gaskets.  You could get some slightly smaller diameter tube and sleeve the
connection.  Almost a guarantee of a leak free seal.  Many leaks are from
manifolds that were designed to have a sleeved flange and prior work left it
out.JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1. 62 404.1 Kompressor 2. 58 VW panel 3. 66 sedan
