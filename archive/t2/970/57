You say "just as the exhaust closes, the intake will start to open". 
On my bus, when I do this, there's a few degrees of both of them
closed.  Not many, maybe 5* at most (less than an inch on the fan
pulley).  Does this mean my camshaft is rounding or am I 180* off base?
 I've heard others say the same thing as you just described, and I
hadn't really thought much about it.... until now.
