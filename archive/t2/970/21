The gasket on the left was from Autozone. The one on the right is from
Vee Dub Parts in Huntington Beach, CA. Neither came with manufacturer
information.

The Autozone one is just some thin metal around a thick paper gasket.
The VeeDub one is layers of metal. So which is better?

The Autozone one would be more forgiving, but the VeeDub one would be
more durable.

Thoughts?
