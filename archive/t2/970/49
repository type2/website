Subject: finding TDC

ok here is a ridiculous question but I cant find the answer in the repair 
manuals I own. I have a 72 westy I am trying to get on the road or else I 
have to have a wrecker come haul it away. I bought this bus for $300 from 
someone who couldnt get the timing set right, so he had to quit driving it. 
There is a scratch mark on the pully that he was using as his timing mark, 
but it doesnt appear to be accuratly scribed. on a 1700cc motor is the 
pulley perhaps keyed on the backside so I could remove it and replace it 
with a pully that is marked properly? typically I would take the time to 
find true TDC myself, but since i am working on this alone its hard to do 
since I cant be cranking the motor while also holding my thumb over a 
compression test hose to #1. Hate to bother this list with something so 
mundane, but I am jsut considering my options while working and not actually 
looking at the bus. I have to figure out how to get it at least started and 
moveable before my momma complains about it sitting in her driveway and i 
cant have a non running vehicle at my apartment complex. Be a shame to have 
to sacrifice this bus with its original motor and complete interior jsut 
because I cant find a few hours to deal with it properly until after it is 
already at least running.
