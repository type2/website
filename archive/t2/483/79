Subject: air preheat system on 72?

A PO replaced the dual carb set up on my '72 with a Weber 32/36. I am
among the many suffering from the lack of pre-heated air entering the
Weber chrome air filter in cold/damp weather (a beter description of
Portland this time of year couldn't be found). When the carbs were
pulled, it appears all related equipment to the old system were tossed.
I've acquired a Sprint air-cleaner replacement (sans the flap
controls), and the necessary tin to reestablish a source of heated air.
After looking in the Bentley, it isn't entirely clear to me how the air
pre-heat system works on the '72. I can't find anything vacuum or cable
related, but maybe I'm not looking in the right place. 
Anyone deal with this on the '72? I know VW switched how this system
worked a few times between '70 and '73, so this is definitely year
specific.
Thanks!
