Thanks Tim,

        It's been a while, but that "by ear" processes sounds very
familiar to what I used to do. 

By the way, I heard you mention earlier about a hot spark. I'm still
uncomfortable with the idea that I don't have a radiator. :)
I own, from another car I used to have, a high output Accel Ignition
coil. Just your run of the mill generic 12 volt. 
Is there any reason why I CAN NOT use this in my VW Bus? It's physician
dimensions are identical to those of the factory ignition coil. Some
people have told me however that the car will run too hot. Is this true? 


Thanks,

Todd
