why bother with welding and body work. what you really want is a
sportsmobile top :)

the project still isn't finished, but it is usable. The sportsmobile
top is HUGE and it only requires cutting a rectangular hole in your
roof between the crossframes in the roof. the top has it's own built
in supports that run the length of the top. easy conversion. I did the
roughin for it in an afternoon.
