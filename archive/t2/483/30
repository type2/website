Since air is moving all around the engine a hissing sound isn't uncommon and
doesn't necessarily indicate a vacuum leak.  I've never been a big fan of
spraying combustible material on a running engine.  I manually inspect all
big hoses and then pressurize the system and check for leaks with a little
soapy water.

No.

Bus Depot's site says they have it.
