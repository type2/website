Subject: Weber Progressive Carb

Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

I've tried and tried, and can't seem to get the Weber carb on my Bus to run 
right.  It may be operator-error, or it may be the thing is just a piece of 
junk.  I've rebuilt it, adjusted it, had a carb guy look at it, still have 
problems.  And it doesn't help that the electric choke doesn't work right, 
either.  At any rate, has anyone found another carb that will fit the 
runners and mounting block, say a Rochester or an Autolite?

Thanks much.

Mike
