Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon resetable trip speedometer

> The speedometers from the early Vanagons ('80 - '81 or possibly '82 Vanagon,
 but I doubt it) have the right gear ratio, and have the screw on speedometer
 cable connection that we would need.

80 to 82 are screw-on speedo cables. But.... I have found that only the 81 will work in bay housings. The 81
measures 37mm from back plate to faceplate. 80 and 82 measures 45mm.
If you try to put one of the 45mm ones in a bay housing, it will fit but you cannot see it at night! The face
is right up against the glass and the backlighting does not go around the edge to the front!
And there are 4 different ones per year. The manual trans ones have shift points, the auto trans ones don't,
and each one came with or without the trip counter.
I have not measure the 83 and up ones with the push-on speedo cable. I can if anyone is interested.
