 Hi Tom... and list....
Never used form-a-thread...... gonna have to check
that out..... but I do know the time serts work very
well..... have used em more than a few times... when
it was time to put "case-savers" in a 1600 engine....
the shop was gonna charge like 90 bucks... I did it
myself for less than 15.....and was done right.... 
 As far as the new heads go...(AVP??) thats rebuilt
heads right.... or is it a whole rebuilt engine???
 Anyway's.... forgot to mention that you need to check
those heads..... pull the valves out.....check those
guides..... did they replace em... or did they just
knurl em..... if replaced, was they reamed
correctly...... man ...this could go on fer a
while..... sorry to ramble on..... theres just so much
more than the obvious.....
