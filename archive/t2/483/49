Subject: Re: [T2] Canadians to BBBVIII?

Hi George,

I'd love to, but a 4700-mile weekend is impossible in a bus. If I had 
any vacation time left I'd try and talk someone local into sharing the 
wheel, but I don't, so I can't. :^(

The next big trip for our club will be EveryBus, we're hoping to make 
2004 our best showing ever.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
