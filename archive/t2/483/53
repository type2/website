Subject: Trap for young (and not so young) players

I was reminded of a simple panic inducing mistake the other day, working 
on the front panel of Tigger, I got a lot of crap over the floor on the 
driver's side. I THOUGHT that I'd cleaned it all up, and headed off hoem 
happily.

About 1 KM into the trip, I was getting worried, trying to work out WHY it 
had no power, the worries got worse as I limped the old girl home, 
stopping a few times to see if she was overheating or I could see or hear 
anything that would explain the problem, to no avail.

Got home , went in for a while and then came back odwn to check over 
everything again, happened to notice junk under te accellerator pedal, 
cleaned it up and took her out for another drive, it was a MIRACLE, 
everything was Ok again ;^)

Yes, I DID feel stupid, but it was rather a relief that the problem was 
all because of the crap under the threttle, and not anything important ;^)

FWIW

BTW: Anyone have any data/experience of the average life of a window 
winder mechanism? I had to replace the driver's door window winder when I 
got Tigger about 5-6 years ago, and it's started slipping, I would have 
hoped that I would have gotten longer than that out of the mechanism.
