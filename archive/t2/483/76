Subject: fuel filler hose size on 69 single cab

ok, i replaced my fuel sender today & now my gas guage
is working again. yeah!!!  & actually, i did not have
to drain & remove the tank like i thought i would have
to. even better!

however, i did notice that the hose that goes from the
fuel filler neck to the gas tank looked kinda shot, so
i think i'll try to replace that tomorrow.

so - does anyone know the correct size for that hose?
i'm also assuming that NAPA will likely be the best
source for it, given what i read of others
experiences.

TIA,
