Hiya Christopher,

My Bus is a 70.  The sliding door warning is screened on the column support 
on my Bus.  I think most of the earlier Bays were like this.  I don't know when 
VW went to a sticker/decal although I am aware they did go that route.  At 
present I am having a local sreening company "redo" three column supports.  If 
appropriate for your Bus and if you're interested zap me a p-mail.  By the way, 
this company also does decal/stickers.
