Hi Stevo,

Well, the fact that it didn't poor smoke is a good sign. If you let the 
smoke out of an electrical component, it won't work any more; the smoke 
is what makes the electrons do as they're told.

Seriously: Does it have a functional antenna??   Without a good 
antenna, you'll get nothing but static from an AM radio.

Happy trails,
