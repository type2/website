Hehe!

I love mine! It's glued in place with yellow weatherstrip glue
(3M/Permatex). It stays there at my service for decades, til the tranny
needs replacement. Clean up all relevant surfaces and bolt, remove the
insert on the engine, get a 17mm nut ready, and glue it in when you do
your next install. It'll be there like a good friend, easy to deal with.
