The lifters, and cam, are not submerged in oil,, if you fill the crankcase
that full, you will find the rocker covers will be "full" too. The normal
full level as shown with the dipstick is below the pushrod tubes

What I mean is, if the oil level is above the lifters, it will be above
the pushrod tubes... so the oil will fill the pushrod tubes and the rocker
box to at least as high as the top of the tubes..

this would cause great problems with the venting of the rocker box, if you
wanted to adjust the rockers, you would have to drain the oil, ....
