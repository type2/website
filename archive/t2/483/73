I know if and when I get to such for my 72, I will measure out the Vanagon 
hatch. If it is not more difficult to install that one it's a bunch bigger. 
But the stock Loaf FI series hatch would be better than nothing. Are the 
carbed hatches for 73/74 the same or different than the 75 on FI chassis???
