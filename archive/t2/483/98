I'll ask again,, with more information supplied this time!  Doh!

I would like to aquire a 1971 Volkswagen BUS rear bumper,, buy or borrow
would be fine preferably it would have the frame brackets but not
necessary.
bent, buggered, or rusted is ok as long as the center section between the
frame is straight along the bottom edge

Please contact me with your price including shipping
zip code N1R5S6

Thanks!
