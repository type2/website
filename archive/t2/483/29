Subject: Vacuum Readings

I have just checked the vacuum reading at idle on my 78' 2.0 Fi and got
12-13". That seems a little low and so I am going to put hose clamps on all
of the vacuum lines that I can including the 4 intake runner tubes. I seem
to detect a hissing sound that could be leak but as of yet have not located
it, will try with carb cleaner. Can the intake runner hose sections from
the plenum to the manifold be relplaced without removing the intake
manifolds? Also has anyone found a replacement for the little elbow from
the aux air regulator? This motor has 12k on it since a full rebuild and
runs great. Idles nice, plenty o power, starts effortlessly. Other concerns
for vacuum of this range?

Thanks Volks,
