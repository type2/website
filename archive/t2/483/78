Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filler hose size on 69 single cab

> however, i did notice that the hose that goes from the
 fuel filler neck to the gas tank looked kinda shot, so
 i think i'll try to replace that tomorrow.
 so - does anyone know the correct size for that hose?
 i'm also assuming that NAPA will likely be the best
 source for it, given what i read of others
 experiences.

I have an original 68-71 bus filler neck hose in my hand right now.... it is 2 1/4" [57mm] x 7" long.
