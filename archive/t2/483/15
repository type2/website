I know it's painful to listen to.  I recently had a rebuilt engine 
installed that has hydraulic lifters, and it scared the Hell out of me 
the first time I heard "bled-down lifter noise" (I posted about it 
here, complete with an audio clip :-)

I would think that the lifters will be less likely to bleed down if you 
keep your oil level at the top "full" mark on the dipstick (not all of 
the oil drains down into the sump, right? ... so there would still be 
some oil covering the lifters).

OTOH, maybe you should make a habit of going out there on a Saturday, 
starting it up, letting it warm up, and giving it a rev or two to keep 
the lifters pumped up.  Besides, wouldn't it be nice to listen to your 
Bus's engine while having your Saturday morning coffee? :-)
