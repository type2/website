I don't think so although I have to say the original hose did last 25 years.
Bus Boys said it best I think:

"Genuine Continental 7mm High Pressure Fuel Hose with smooth covering, no
outside braided cloth. Our opinion is that this a much better hose than the
original braided hoses you find on the some of the FI Buses"

"Note: We do carry the cloth braided variety for the fanatics"

I'm not sure what genuine means because my bus came with braided hose. I
went with their advice and used the Continental hose: it's good looking
stuff.

That still 1mm...I found that hose at the local vwflaps.
