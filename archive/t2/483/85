Subject: Re: [T2] air preheat system on 72?

From how it reads, it seems like the air-intake flap is controlled by a
cable that is attached to the cool-air control flaps' shaft at the back
(back is back) of the engine. It appears that after '71, they added a
vacuum piece that allowed cool air on cold days when their was a demand
for more air for acceleration. I'm unclear on this piece of the puzzle,
but the Sprint cleaner doesn't have any way of using vacuum, so I'm
gonna skip that part. Anyone see problems with doing that if the cable
system is in place?
(Bentley) I'm looking at sect 5, pgs 13 & 21. All of the stuff on sect
3, pg 26 was removed from my bus by a PO. I'm hoping someone out there
has dealt with this pre-heating issue after all of the original stiff
had been removed. If not, can someone tell me how the original cable
should have routed so I can retrofit a cable for the same purpose,
adjusting the flap on the Sprint cleaner?
thanks.
