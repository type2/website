Subject: Re: [T2] emergency flasher [From New List member]

Fortunately I know this not from experience but from investigation.  My 
new-to-me 1968 Kombi's flashers work as stated earlier.  The flashers work 
and the knob flashes red when the ignition is off.  With the ignition on 
the turn indicator lights will also flash.

My bus came from my uncle who was the original owner.  Almost everything is 
stock, so there is a high probability that this is how it worked from the 
factory.  The radio even works with the ignition off (as all cars and 
especially all VWs should behave).

As I mentioned in my first sentence, I had to go to the garage to verify 
this.  Upon obtaining the bus my friend and I drove it from San Franciso to 
Chicago.  It's a shame we only had 3 days, which made for long days when 
you don't go over 60 mph.  We didn't have to use the flashers much, just 
going up the steep mountain passes at 35 mph :-).
