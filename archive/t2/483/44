Subject: Hello again

To old friends and new,

I am back on the list again, for a little while, although I won't do 
much posting. Peregrine is still in my garage, waiting for a new 
camshaft.

For the past six months, I have been working on a book about Peregrine, 
her role in my midlife crisis, my love for Arizona and the American 
Southwest, as well as biographical sketches of the first scientists to 
explore the deserts and plateaus of the region by motor vehicle.

For anyone who is interested, the first page or two of the book can be 
found on my website. The URL is 
<http://www.ocotillofield.net/peregrine.html>.

Because it is an essential part of the story, I will mention the almost 
daily contact I had with the type2 list and its members over the course 
of my story. I may quote my own words to the list, but I will only 
quote others' if I get express permission from them to do so.

I have one small request. For most of my life, I have kept a daily 
journal. I know what I did every day except during the year I signed 
onto the list and bought Peregrine. I must not have had time to keep up 
with the list and keep a journal. Fortunate for me, all of my posts are 
still in the archive, where they'll remain till the end of time.

But for those who remember me when I couldn't be bothered to check the 
endplay on my flywheel and other such stupidities, and who would like 
to remind me what a moron I was, I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks, all

Mark
