 You can get a flourescent lamp at schuck's/kragens's/pepboys for circa $10. It plugs into the wall.  and the bulb doesn't break when you drop it, so it may end up being cheaper when you factor in all the bulbs you don't buy.

I used to have one that ran on 12V, but eventually I killed it in an accidental but very creative way.
