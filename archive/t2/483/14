Dear Todd
Since it's a virtual Friday, I'm going a little tongue in cheek here:

Here are my suggestions for how to handle this dilemma:
1. Since the lifters are draining, you could store the bus on it's side when 
not in use, and just upright on the infrequent occasion of driving.

2. As my buddy tells me - just drive the snot out of it - they're better off 
being driven.

3. Trade with me - my bus likes warm, dry weather and trips to the beach. It 
doesn't have rattly lifters (2.0 f.i. w/hydraulic lifters) though at the 
moment I can't testify to it's oil pressure. You can have visitation rights 
any time you come up to New Hampshire.

Personally I'd recommend option 3.
Glad I could help.
