Subject: Results of Welding prep advice

thanks so much for everyone input into the questions about some of the
ways to cut tubing in a nice fashion. A few weekends ago I spend a
Saturday cutting/welding up a rack for my 66. It came out great. There
are a few things I would change now, but I'm happy with the results.
It's quite light (< 15 lbs) and holds a bit of stuff. We have made two
trips using it so far and it has held on quite well, carrying such
things as camp chairs, firewood, camp stove and the like. I snapped a
few pics here:
