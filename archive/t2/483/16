Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Rattles on a cold start!!

Hah! Yeah, I'm sure my neighbors love it too. I pull the bus in, so the
exhaust faces the outside of the garage when the garage door is open. 
The previous owner of the Bus installed some Pace Setter dual exhaust
system. So when I start it up... it's a little loud. I plan on replacing
it with stock when I can find a good replacement.

Since we're on the subject, I occasionally also hear a poping noise
comming from the exhaust. It's intermittent, and sporadic.. there's no
symmetry or rythm to it. It just comes in randomly. Wow, I just said the
same thing about 6 times, using a different word each time. Anyway, what
could that be? Could it be because of the type of exhaust that it has?
The Bus runs fine, no hesitation. The idle is a little high (2-bbl
webber). Before I got it, 4 months ago, it hadn't run in like.. well... 4
years at the least. As I drive it more, and "shake off the dust" I can
adjust down the idle more and more. With no worries of it stalling out. I
probably should figure out some way of tuning the carburetor.. hmm..
that'll be my next post.

So you say it's normal then? That's good to hear because I thought I was
doing some serious damage to the cam and lifters. 


Thanks,

Todd
