Bob,
Yes it was the one that BD sells but I didn't want to bad mouth Ron as he
doesn't make the mufflers just gets the best he can.  I am glad your muffler
is holding up better than mine did.  As for the inside.  Next time you take
off your muffler hold it sideways.  If you hear the sound of a large piece
of metal shifting from one side to the other you will be experiencing the
same failure I have had on 2 different SS exhausts.

I am sure I had over 10,000 miles on each of my mufflers before the
failures.  1.5 years is a lot of bus miles.. :)

May your exhaust live for many years to come...

Peace,
Snoopy
