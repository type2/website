Subject: flywheel seal finally blew

Well, the flywheel seal finally blew. I've been nursing a small oil leak for
a couple of weeks now. It was definitely engine oil and not gear oil judging
by smell and color. Most recently it started to drip from the bell housing
where the starter mounts and then the situation was escalated to defcon 3.

The clutch failed to engage smoothly yesterday (shudder) for the first time
and I had a bad feeling I had a lot of fluid in the bell housing. This
morning I noticed oil sprayed in the engine compartment with a little pool
of it just below #3 intake runner. It was easy to see the oil coming from
the flywheel inspection hole. I don't know how you can look in there but
it's easy to put your finger in and feel if it's wet or dry. Engine off
please! ;-)

I have to drop the engine again...I knew I should have changed that seal
when the painter had the engine out. Frustrating. The painter left
sandblasting media everywhere and I'm starting to wonder if the seal got
contaminated.

I'm living in an apartment right now and I could use the assistance of some
local bus folks. None of the garages in the complex are available right now
and I need some driveway space to get this done.

I have all of the tools and parts (still need to get the dial indicator but
now I'm even more motivated to get it) so I'm pretty much self-service. I'd
also like to change the bushings in the nosecone of the transmission and
replace the plastic bushings in the shift rod while the engine is out since
I've collected those parts too.
