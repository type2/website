Subject: Re: [VB] Bar and Chain Oil

I know some folks that have been painting old engine oil underneath their morris minor woody wagon every winter .   I think it's a 69, and they live in the UK. It's not rusty.   Now they do have a modern car as well but it was their only car when I was small.

Anyway, it never rusted out.

I guess the draw back to painting w/ oil or tar is if you ever weld or paint there in the future you have to clean it off really well.
A friend who does welding & paint was there when the mangled door was taken off my 61 deluxe.   Due to rust, a torch was used on the hinge screws, which tookk off paint.   Damon grimaced when I grease up the area with the burnt paint to prevent rust.   Well, that was 6 years ago and I still haven't painted the bus.

I smear grease from greasing the front suspension on the underside of the bus.
