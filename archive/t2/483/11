Subject: Vanagon resetable trip speedometer

>Yes indeed :-)


I installed a Vanagon Speedometer in my '78 Westy.  It has the resetable 
trip meter plus the odometer.

Now, the rest of the story:

The speedometers from the early Vanagons ('80 - '81 or possibly '82 Vanagon, 
but I doubt it) have the right gear ratio, and have the screw on speedometer 
cable connection that we would need.

I guess if you got a late Vanagon speedo with the bayonet speedometer 
connection, it would work if you also got the bayonet conecting speedometer 
cable from the Vanagon.  But that was just a bit too much trouble for me to 
check out.


The back of your type 2 instrument cluster will need some new holes drilled, 
but no problem there.  Here, you can measure once and drill twice, or even 
drill three times - like I did the first time!!

There need to be a hole drilled in the 'glass' speedometer face to 
accommodate the reset button on the new speedo.  I did drill a hole in the 
original glass, but I broke the glass.  It was very sensitive at the new 
hole.  So I got some clear Plexiglas strips and cut out a circle to replace 
the glass.  I drilled a hole in the Plexiglas with no problem.


Now, here is the hint on how to cut a round replacement piece in the 
Plexiglas for the face of the new speedo:

(1) Leave the paper on the Plexiglas until you are finished

(2)  use the original glass as a pattern.  Put the glass on the Plexiglas 
and scratch a circle in the Plexiglas with a sharp 'box cutter'.  You will 
NOT be able to cut he Plexiglas, but try  to get a deep scoring of the 
Plexiglas.  ABout 5-6 times around should do.  Put the original glass away 
in a safe place.

(3) with a straight edge, make four DEEP tangents scores on the new circle 
in the Plexiglas.  Like a square.  Unless you were forethoughtful enough to 
make the circle against a corner, and have two sides preformed already!!

(4) with a large Vice Grip, break the Plexiglas along the new tangent lines. 
  If you have a real vice, use that.

(5) now you have the idea.  Make more tangent lines, and break at those.  
Continue until you have a reasonable circle cut out.

(6) smarten up the Plexiglas sharp edges with some sand paper.  It doesn't 
need be perfect, because the edge of the Plexiglas will be hidden after 
installation.

(7) Mark and drill a hole in the Plexiglas for the trip reset button. (Tap a 
nail in the Plexiglas to get a good starting point for your drill bit)



If you plan to drill a hole in the glass, and you are going out for a glass 
drill bit, get a BIG drill bit, like 3/8 or even a step highter.  A 1/4 
(2/8) will not do the job.

Reason:  From my experience of drilling 28 holes in glass plate for my 
daughters science project, if you use a 1/4 glass drill bit to drill a 1/4 
hole (that would be a good size), the bit will go wild as it make the final 
hole cut, and creates something that is not a circle, but a triangle looking 
thing.

If you use the 3/8 bit, you could drill on one side (5 minutes, at least) 
until you come through the other side, then come into the glass from this 
other side.  You will see a nice circle cut, with some beveling at the edge 
of the hole.  Continue on either side to get the hole size you want, but DO 
NOT go all the way through.

Then you will have a pretty round hole that has a bevel at the inside.  Not 
some stupid triangle looking hole!!!

(8) after you are satisfied all around, only then take the paper covering 
off the Plexiglas.


There are two different early Vanagon speedometers that have the screw on 
speedometer cable.  Karl van Salzen knows the difference, but I lost his 
e-mail.  Either will work.  The one I installed needed some spacers to push 
the instrument cluster back from the face.  The speedo needle was touching 
the Plexiglas.

For spacers, I just cut about 3 finishing nails in half, and made them into 
circles, like washers, but thicker.  I could even pinch them on the screws 
on the instrument cluster so they didn't fall off..

That's all.

Good luck.

Just get the Vanagon speedo that has the screw on speedo cable connection.

And make sure that stupid little early Vanagon speedo gear is not cracked!!
