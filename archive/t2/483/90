this thing holds all of the grease into the CVjoint. The other side is
missing this thing. The one that is on there is kind of dented. I'd like
to replace them both and repack the CVjoint with grease while it's apart
but i dont know what it's called .

Equal in diameter to the CV?  I don't know about that, but there is a
dished washer that goes between the CV and the shaft.  That one is easy,
leave it out!  According to Bentley, anyway!
