Subject: WTB 1971 rear bumper

I would like to aquire a 1971 rear bumper,, buy or borrow would be fine
preferably it would have the frame brackets but not necessary.
bent, buggered, or rusted is ok as long as the center section between the
frame is straight along the bottom edge

Please contact me with your price including shipping
zip code N1R5S6

Thanks!
