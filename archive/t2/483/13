Hmm, that's weird. Or could it be part of the
US-specifications? As far as I know all the European
emergenceflashers/turnsignal-indicators work as
follows:

Without the key in the ignitionlock only the emergency
flasher works. The red light in the knob blinks and so
does/do the green light/lights on the dashboard panel.
The turn signal indicators only work with the ignition
turned on. Of course the emergency flashers also work
with the ignition turned on.
