Subject: RE: [T2] Door Weather Stripping????

I bought a cheap door seal from Bus Depot and never got it installed right. It
just did not want to fit or stay, even tried glue. Not worth the trouble. I
ordered a seal from oeveedub.com. It was a perfect fit. They were on sale and
only cost me $31 each. I recommend these seals to anyone having problems
getting other ones to fit. My door now is a little hard to close, but that is
only due to a nice new seal and not an oversized non fitting seal. Of course
this is just my opinion from my own experience. Get original when possible.
