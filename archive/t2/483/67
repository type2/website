Subject: Stainless Steel mufflers (my results)

I have seen many requests about the durability of the SS exhausts.  I have
purchased one for my 73 (pancake engine) and one for my 71 single cab (upright
engine)  I have had the same failure on both types within 1.5 years.  A part
in the body of the muffler comes loose causing a very loud exhaust noise.  I
don't know of any way to find out exactly what's happening short of cuting the
body of the muffler apart to see what broke, but then it would be useless to
me as a muffler.

For my $$ next muffler I buy will be the regular steel ones.  At least I can
judge by the outside when it is getting ready to go and I can save some
cash...

YMMV
