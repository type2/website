Subject: draining fuel and checking for debris

How should I check this? Last time I took the fuel filter off I
ended up with a big mess and I smelled like gas for days. How should I go
about draining the fuel without getting it everywhere? Anyone know anything

that will take the smell off of me when I'm done? Any other places along
the
fuel line I should check?

Kyle,

To start off it makes it a lot easier if the bus is on a lift or at least
jacked up some. Remeber to use the proper safety equipment when jacking and
don't smoke while draining the tank... What I do is use a small pair of
needle nose vise grips to pinch the line between the tank and the filter,
there are special plastic tools for this but ise grips have always worked
for me. Not to tight or you will damage the hose. Get a pan like for
changing oil to catch the gas that will drain out of the filter and fuel
rail. Hopefully your tank is not full... I then used a 5 gallon jerry can
and stuck the hose in it, released the vise grips and let er roll. When the
can got full I put the grips back on and got another can. Once the tank is
drained you can get fancy and put a valve in there if you like for future
use.

Someone can correct me here but on carburated busses I thought there was a
way to remove the metal line from the bottom of hte tank and get to small
screen of sorts that can get clogged. It was like a 17mm hex nut I thought
with the line coming out the middle. I don't know if you can do this with
FI tanks. Either way, drain the tank look at your filter and then decide if
you need to go all the way to removing the tank to have it cleaned and or
restored. If you have some debris in there once you drain the tank and it
gets low you may be able to tell. Like if the gas stops flowing and you
rock the bus and it starts flowing a lot again... If there is a lot of rust
in the or crap in the filter you may want to pull that tank. As for the
rest of the lines I would pull all the rubber hoses replace if needed, and
blow compressed air through all the lines to make sure they are clear.

This problem was a loss of power for no reason then the power returned type
of problem right? I think you said you already checked your ignition
system, how about the wiring? Loose connections? Broken insulation on a
wire causing it to ground out? I still suspect fuel problems though....
