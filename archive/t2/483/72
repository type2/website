I think the baffles inside rust out, become loose and start to rattle. The
factory stainless exhaust on my wife's 96 Acura rusted out this way and we
replaced it because of the irritating noise. The replacement is exactly the
same unit and comes with a lifetime warranty (for as long as we continue to
own the car!). It will be interesting to see how the new muffler lasts when
it reaches the same mileage the original failed.
