And what do you think of Bondo? And how much do you really know about Bondo? 
At one time, a long time ago when they made cars that were ment to last a 
life time they also use lead as a body filler like in places were seams came 
together or where the top was welded on. Well that was the 60's and things 
changed, lead was now poision to people and we need something as good but not 

deadly. Guess what? Bondo! Starting in the 70's cars now had Bondo in the 
same places that used to be lead. And if you go to any junk yard and look you 

will find the same results as was the cars in the 60's and before, no rust in 

them areas. Amazing, if use as it was designed it will alst forever. As with 
most back yard body persons of that time era they use it to fill holes (with 
cardboard as backing) and dents (with out knocking it out first) therefor 
Bondo became bad. Now get out you sandpaper and grinders and check out your 
brand new, fresh off the show room floor vehicle and you will be surprised:) 
Bondo requires proper drying time and should not be use in the rain (high 
moisture), but when applied very thin (less than 1/16th of an inch) it dries 
fast and will last. But do not let Bondo'd areas set for any period of time 
because it does absorb moisture requiring drying out. (like overnight) put a 
primer/sealer on it. Take the time and do the work, don't just fill and 
paint. the closier to perfection the work is the less amount of Bondo 
required. I am talking from over 30 years of body work with no repeats.
