Subject: In need of odometer gear...

Buenos noches all!  I'm looking for that little white gear that turns the 
odometer shaft, which in turn, turns the miles. I've searched my local scrap 
yards and come up empty handed.  I would be very grateful if anyone might 
have a spare!?  Peace to all
                                           Mike

"Bound to cover just a little more ground"...  No matter the mileage!
