Subject: Re: [T2] black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel

The best steering wheel covers I have seen are made by Wheelskins.  They are
a bit pricey, but they are made of very high quality leather and look great
(no spiral wrap like the cheapo vinyl covers).  I had one on my old MG and
will probably put one on my '72 as soon as finances allow.  Check out
http://www.wheelskins.com for more details.  Looks like size B would be just
about a perfect fit for an early '70's model.
