Volks,
	I have to agree with Chris here. In my experience, the STOCK 
heat from a T4 was quite adequate in my '74 Westy. I DID have to go 
through the bus and make sure all the holes were sealed up and that 
all the hot air channels were airtight, (duct tape over the black, 
plastic grill on the front of the bus helped ALOT) and although 
that's not as exciting or fun as creating some new way to get heat 
out of our engines, it was pleasing to actually feel the fruits of my 
labors the next morning. The one thing I did do that was not stock 
was replacing my rusted out heat exchangers with a solid piece of 
tubing. In the T4 engine compartment, there is that small fan mounted 
to the top of the engine comparment that's plumbed into the heating 
system via two black tubes. Whichever of those two tubes is longer, I 
bought two more of that size. I took a combination of duct tape, 
muffler wrap and bailing wire to attach those tubes between the 
heaterboxes and the "Y" tube under the bus, located under the back 
seat. They worked great. The only "problem" was that I couldn't turn 
my heat off. But I didn't WANT to turn my heat off, I live in the 
Northeast.
YMMV
Joel
