you're clutch is slipping.  Either it is adjusted way to tight, or the
pressure plate has gone bad, or the disc is covered in oil.  If it is the
later, it usually wont do it till the engine has warmed up a bit.


Does the clutch pedal still feel normal? Or does it seem to "release" very
far up from the floor, instead of around midway?  If it does, i'd try
backing the adjustment nut off until you only have a half inch of play or
so in the pedal and see if the clutch is still slipping.


If it isnt that though, time to pull the engine..seal replacement (and
clutch disc), or entire clutch replacement.

good luck.
