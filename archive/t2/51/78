Subject: RE: [T2] On FI

Cheers Bob,
I'll stow that email and examine it more and see if I
can apply the new system.
I was talking to my VW mechanic the other day and he
says,quite apart from other problems,the reason most
bus owners in Australia tear off the TLE system is
because we can't buy the parts like you guys can.
:-)
Cheers
