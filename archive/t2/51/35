Subject: oil heat


A guy named Don at Volk Tech in Burlington, NJ makes a nifty sheetmetal
gizmo to capture waste heat from the doghouse cooler on type 1's.  Fits into
the doghouse exhaust and installs into the drivers side heater box.  So all
the hot air from the oil cooler goes into your normal heater box flow.  He
sells it for a bit more than a c-note.

I don't actually have one of these things. Would be smelly if the cooler is
dirty though. Where does the Type IV cooler exhaust?
