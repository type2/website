Subject: Heating with oil cooler

Speaking of running LONG lines to an aux oil cooler, I ran an aux oil 
cooler all the way up under my sink cabinets (right behind the driver's 
seat) on my '74 westy. I just couldn't find anywhere else I felt 
comfortable mounting it. I used a plate that screwed into where my oil 
filter would, and just relocated the oil filter to next to the aux oil 
cooler.  I never had any pressure problems, but I did develop a leak where 
one of the hoses was rubbing against a piece of engine tin. My pressure 
started dropping, and it just kept on dropping! I couldn't figure out what 
was going on. Of course I was running the engine all the while I was 
staring at the needle going down... All of a sudden it registered to me and 
I quickly shut off the engine. No damage.
My oil lines must have been like 10 feet total.
Good luck,
Joel
