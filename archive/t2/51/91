Subject: steering wheel covers

Hey Keri and list

I don't have the leather cover info, but I was hoping someone had found a
wheel cover to fit a bus at a FLAPS? I checked at PEP Boy's per advice and
found 14 1/2 to 15 1/2 covers for vans and boats, but it didn't come close
to fitting. That's the biggest they had, I haven't checked at a truck stop
yet however, any way how big are our Steering Wheels?

Thanks

Meredith
