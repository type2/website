Subject: 009 question (a new one this time)

I was talking to a guy in the town where I work who owns a 71 bus.  He SWEARS everything is all-original and stock.  Yet, he has a 009 dizzy on his 1600.  So, I told him that I didn't think the 009 was ever standard or a factory option on any bus, but he continued to insist that it was in 71 models. Question is:  Was a 009 EVER a standard or optional dizzy from the factory, or is it strictly an aftermarket part??  One of us is more clueless that the other and I simply want to who it is ;-)
