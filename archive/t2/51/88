At least two of them had a lot of "duh" content, meaning that in typical HVW 
fashion they sell you a magazine and then restate what is already in the 
repair manuals and now adays, widely available on some great web pages (ex: 
type2.com).

One of the articles can be summed up as saying "drill large holes in your 
dash and install three gauges next to the radio.

Another dared to suggest that you could improve the handling of your bus by 
properly adjusting the rear torsion bars and installing new shocks.  It also 
suggested that you install heavy duty front and rear sway bars and oversize, 
non-stock mud and snow tires.  The final improvement they offer is to leave 
off the hubcaps for that "aggressive" look.  : )
