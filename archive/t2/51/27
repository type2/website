Subject: Re: [T2] More alternator/voltage trouble

If your voltage with the engine running is 13.x then your 
alternator/regulator are probably working properly, so all you 
have to worry about is the malfunctioning light.

Review the troubleshooting procedures in the library at 
type2.com.  They worked for me last time I had this kind of 
trouble.
