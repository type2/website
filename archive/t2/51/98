I can say with experience that the flat plate cooler I ran on my Type IV 
Beetle (18"x18") and a fan put off alot of heat when the engine was hot.

Don't know how even the temperatures would have been if used inside as a 
heater with different driving conditions - idle, highway, idle, city 
streets, etc.

It would be easy to create a fan that would only come on if the oil temps 
were high enough but those times might be different from when the interior 
needed the most heat.

I'm thinking an oil cooler heater might only be suitable for aux heating - 
you certainly couldn't warm the interior up in the morning because I THINK 
it would require some drive time to make heat on a cold day.

At least something that uses the exhaust pipes would make heat quickly...

I do like the oil cooler heater and have one thought up and the pieces 
located in my catalogs. Might still use the idea.

Any thoughts or comments?
