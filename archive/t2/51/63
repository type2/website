Hi Art,

I think you should do this yourself, as a bug isn't that big, and you can do
one piece at a time.

I've tried lots of different ways to strip paint.  Although the paint
remover chemicals work, you can't just spread them on and hose them off.
You actually have to get up close with a wire brush and a scraper.  That
means you end up coming in contact with the stuff, and it is very
unpleasant.  I gave up on it after doing a couple of parts.

I used a combination of my DA sander for large areas and my andblaster for
tight places until I discovered Scotchbrite pads clued to Makita grinder
disks.  Ordinarily, you wouldn't use a grinder because it goes too fast and
makes too much heat, and the abrasives gouge the metal.  But the scotchbrite
pads zip through the paint, don't make much heat, and last a long time.
They're made by a company called SAIT, and they cost about $10 a piece.  My
local tool store orders them for me.

I'd suggest that where the original paint under the respray is ok, and
there's no rust or body damage, you should use a DA sander to get down to
it, then coat with epoxy primer and then go to sandable.  Everywhere else,
use the scotchbrite to strip down to metal, repair any damage, and then
proceed with primer and paint.

Regards,

Grant
