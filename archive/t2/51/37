Worn-out clutch disc. You have to drop the engine to fix it, but after
you've done that, it's an easy fix. On a Bus with a T4 engine, I'd unhook
the CVs, drop engine and transmission on two jacks, unbolt the transmission
from the engine and roll the transmission forward ; that way you don't have
to take the engine out from under the Bus.

Wear a good dust mask; you will find huge amounts of clutch-disc dust in
there.
