I have had good results with Bondo IF it was put over solid sheet metal - 
if any moisture can reach it from behind you are back to doing bodywork in 
justa  few months.

Yes, if applied over good metal, in dry weather, and painted quickly it 
will be okay.

I never seem to have all those conditions and now use metal impregnated 
filler everywhere, not much more expensive and alot more appropriate to my 
needs.

Amazing, if use as it was designed it will alst forever. As with

I my case the metal around a repair (if there was a rust hole there) would 
continue to rust and the bondo would begin to swell or simply fall out.
