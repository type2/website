John:
No, not on 71's, they were all dual vac advance.
The 009 is a factory reproduction of a 36 hp distributor used on 36 hp buses, (I think) from about 1958. The original 009 was a cast iron distributor very similar to old 356 Porsches. Some 36 hp had vacuum only advance, some had centrifugal only, and this was the 009.

So, I told him that I didn't think the 009 was ever standard or a factory option on any bus, but he continued to insist that it was in 71 models. Question is:  Was a 009 EVER a standard or optional dizzy from the factory, or is it strictly an aftermarket part??  One of us is more clueless that the other and I simply want to who it is ;-)
