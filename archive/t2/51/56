You could try the Citrus Strip; it probably wouldn't work since car paint
and furniture finish are horses of different colors, but what the hell, it
just might. You could sand like a maniac. I'd think about finding someone
who does plastic media blasting, or baking soda blasting, and have the car
stripped there. (Among other benefits, they're equipped to deal with the
pounds of lead-based paint that will come off your car.) Home-style
solutions? Aircraft remover. (It's paint stripper, but when I first saw the
name of this stuff I thought, "if it can remove a whole airplane I want
nothing to do with this." Turns out they're just talking about the paint.)
