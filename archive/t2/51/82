Have you seen the new Blink 182 clip for the song
"First Date" with the red and white samba?
Very cool:-)
There's also a TV show on out here called "The Lone
Gunmen" based around the newspaper that Fox Mulder
used to get resources from in "The X Files"
They have a green and white Panel, a 72 I think that
has, cop this, retractable licence plates.
VERY COOL! :-)
Cheers
