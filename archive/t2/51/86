Subject: more heating questions

Hey all-
As long as the subject of heat is going around....
I have recently finished my installation of a
fantastic type 1 motor in to my 72 Westie.  One issue
I am running into however is the heater boxes.  It is
starting to get cold here in Wisconsin.  

The problem is that the cables that run from the cab
to the heater boxes and work the flaps mount on the
opposite side of the boxes than on the new motor.  Has
anyone else run into this problem?  Is is possible to
reroute those cables?

Thanks everybody.
