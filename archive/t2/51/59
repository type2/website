At the risk of being obvious.

I have been the victim of four and going on five buses. When 
everything is as it should be, a stock heating system provides good 
heat, especially in a bus with a type4 setup. Most buses suffer from 
incomplete or poorly sealed heating systems.

Many buses have bad window and door seals that allow drafts in the 
bus. Sealing the bus up like it was when is left the factory floor 
can be expensive  but rewarding. Good German heater boxes are not 
easy to come by but can be had if you look hard enough. Properly 
connecting and sealing the air delivery systems including the oft 
holed center heat tube ( it needs a blanket to work) can be a real 
challenge but the results are fantastic.

The bus must reach correct operating temperature in order to produce 
heat. This means having your flaps and thermostat installed and 
properly adjusted. If you bus reaches proper operating temperature 
quickly as the stock setup is designed to do you will get heat faster.

When driving a bus with an upright in the winter I cheat a little and 
bump up the idle to about 1000 or 1050 rpm to keep the air moving a 
little faster at stop lights and in slow traffic.

If everything is sealed well and the stock system working properly 
you will find that when warming up the bus on those 20 degree 
mornings it helps to have the passenger side wing window open a 
little. This keeps the air moving out of the one way system and will 
defrost your windows faster. Try it sometime even with your leaky old 
bus. You can tell the difference in the rate the air comes out of the 
vents.

Then there is the BN4  :)
