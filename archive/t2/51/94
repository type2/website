Subject: Re: [T2] ridge at top of ring travel

I absolutely agree with you about the complete teardown. All you have to
do is convince the guy wanting the one cylinder set up that he should do
it.
When someone tells me that they want one cylinder with a piston, wrist
pin and ring set, I don't try to sell them a full set.
They are telling me that they are on a budget and are going to do a get
by fix.
I offer advise whenever I can and since I'm only getting $40.00 for the
piston, cylinder and new Grant rings installed properly its not going to
kill me to not Sell the parts. I throw away bad parts of all types and
never sell a part that I wouldn't install on my Westy except Eberspacher
heaters (don't need the weight or the heat).
He says he's got 8K on the engine and with a little cleaning of the
crankcase with kerosine power spray, vacuuming of the small debris
through the cylinder port I'd say he could get all of the loose debris
from his crankcase.
There are various sources for rebuild kits on the list and I assume that
the persons buying the parts from me are aware of the costs involved in
splitting the case to do a thorough job.

You need to look at the rest of that motor. If you have a  holed piston
you probably burnt a valve or dropped a seat. The chunks of  that piston
and valve have probably fallen into the case and have trashed  your cam
and crank. If not I would imagine that there are pieces of  aluminum in
your oil grinding away at the bearings.
