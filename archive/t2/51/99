Your local home improvement store (HARDWARE!) sells round, random orbital, 
electric sanders by several of the bigger tool manufacturers for $50-$75.

I bought one for woodworking and it really cuts the material down fast. 
MUCH faster than my old Black and Decker Professional (read  pre-DeWalt) 
square pad sander. You can buy these too at the same place but they sand 
much slower.

Mine is a Porter-Cable. As good as the good air tools.

Still prefer air tools but I lack a big air compressor.
