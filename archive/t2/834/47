inverter, 400w, on auction sites:  $25
advantages: power any 120v AC appliance

12dc power supply:  $100 and above
?advantages? power 1 appliance (laptop)

I should measure the current draw of my
inverter while it is running my laptop (that is
the main reason for my inverter) and post
the results here
