I found this today:
-----------------**

If a battery is fully discharged and continues to have a load, for example
leaving the headlights on, it is possible for one or more cells to reverse
polarity. When the battery has been recharged with reversed polarity the
polarity can change. This is referred to as "cell reversal". To change
polarity, fully discharge the battery and recharge it with the correct
polarity.
