Subject: Heat And Muffled Backfiring

Happy New Year to everyone! I had a very productive New Year's day working 
on my '75. Weather here in Virginia was mild for January, so I got to work on my 
heating system. The right side was missing the heater flap ever since I bought 
this bus, so I installed a new one yesterday, and got the right side hooked 
up  I've been getting a small amount of heat with just the left side hooked 
up, but now with both sides connected it's pretty damn good (for a bus). And 
this is with the asbestos cuffs removed from the center tube, once I get those 
insulated, I'm guessing it will be even better. Second on my to do list was deal 
with the muffled backfiring I've been getting at idle and during decel ( I 
should mention it's a '75 with a '74 dual carb engine). Armed with David 
Schwarze's write up from the type2 library, I fiddled with those ^%$! carbs for 
nearly 2 hours-end result was no more backfire at idle, but it's still there on 
decel. It's got me damn near ready to yank the dual carbs and stick my single 
Weber on it. I also today put in my vacation requests for : Everybus, Natural 
Bus, and Buses of the Corn (just a few of the events I plan to go to this 
year).  Happy Busin' in 2006!   Jeff
