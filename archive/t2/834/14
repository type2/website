Subject: T4 Crate Motors

I've got a 76 Trans and have decided to look for a crate motor to replace mine
and to do my first rebuild on the existing motor as a spare later.

I am looking for recommendations of where to buy a crate motor and advice for
the replacement.  A couple of points to know...my 76 was converted to a weber
progressive and the FI was robbed.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,
