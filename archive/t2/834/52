I didn't know this... thanks! I'll check it out.

Thanks for the info! I had a couple of other people e-mail me and told me more 
or less the same thing. That I would in fact be better off installing the dual 
carbs. I'm curious... you said that your fuel pump isn't sufficient enough to 
power the dual carbs. Are you using the stock mechanical pump? I don't 
currently have a mechanical pump installed on my car and instead use a 
Purolator "Bug Pak" fuel pump. It's labelled as a "Bug Pak", but it looks 
identical to the Purolator pump that I pulled off another car that I stripped 
(76 Camaro). 

Do you think that is sufficient enough to be used with my dual carb setup? I 
have these two realy nice carbs, and I really think I want to install them now. 
What kind of vacuum advance distributor would you recommend for this setup? (I 
have an 1800cc motor).


Thanks!!!
