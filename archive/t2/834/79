Subject: 1972 Westy For Sale $2500

Here's a great deal on a sweet bus, 'cuz I'm moving at the end of
January and she needs to go!

Sally is a rust-free 72 with a rebuilt porsche engine from the PO, 150
lbs in all cylinders, clean interior, in great shape.  I am the second
owner of this bus and have all of her paperwork, including the original
sale paperwork.

She needs some buttoning up from bodywork to the nose, painted a few
years ago but the body work done then was not completed correctly, not
concours quality but it'll do.  We corrected the poor bodywork but have
run out of steam on the project.  The new windshield/seal and washer
nozzles need to be installed,the dash buttoned up and seats reinstalled
and probably a few other minor items.  She's got a new brake booster and
master cylinder, and I think the vac lines from the booster may not be
installed correctly and the brakes need to be re-bled.  She's also got a
new emblem.  There's some paint for touchup and some other parts,
inlcuding the original solexes, I had new webers put on her awhile back.
   There's also a Bentley (with the colored wiring diagrams) and an idiot
book that go with her, and the original owners manual along with the
paperwork.  Clean non-op title.

$2500 or make me an offer, a bargain price because she has to go NOW!
I've got too much on my plate!  If I get the 2.5k for her, I will also
throw in the new poptop canvas, otherwise I'll keep it to sell separately.

This bus is located in Angels Camp, CA in the Sierra foothills.
