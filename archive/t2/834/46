The only sources I know of are the discussions that have happened here and
on the Samba.

Just keep in mind that you have a limited source supply - Your alternator.

That alt only puts out 55amps (or more if you're canadian... You might be
lucky!) and a good chunk of that is used to keep your bus rolling,
headlights on, charge your battery, listen to tunes...etc. You see where
this is going.

I have 2000 watt inverter. My battery would start draining before I reached
that level of power if everything is turned on. But as you say, charging
your laptop should be fine in most any condition.

I recommend getting the best quality and lowest wattage inverter you can
afford. Especially if you plan on hooking yours up permanently (as mine will
be when I get to work on my cabinets again). There is a small amount of
juice lost to the conversion, so I add 50% to the rated wattage of whatever
device I plan on plugging in.

Also, some things are sensitive to the funky waveform of an inverter. There
are inverters called "modified sine wave" converters that supposedly resolve
this issue, but that's open for debate.

In your case, since the only thing you want to power is a laptop, you might
be better off buying a 12v power supply for it. They're available for all
models of laptops, and if you buy off that bay place it'll be reasonably
priced.
