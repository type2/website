Good idea Don.

Go to the Bus Depot and buy the cheap chrome hub caps that are made in
China.

Buy the genuine made in Germany Taiwan hub caps from them if you choose.

Lets see----both set's got a real nice red, rusty patina in about a
week.

Do some searching for prices on the plating----a good chome job will be
worth it's weight in gold--if you don't care for rusty hub caps anyway.

Been here , done it, and got hosed twice on junk caps from the BD.

And I'm sure, wherever you been looking for the low buck caps are the
same supplier.

They are JUNK.

If you want a set of low dollar BD caps, I have one set I'll sell
you--pre rusted.
