Subject: to chrome or not to chrome my hubcaps

the other day i was noticing my original vw hub caps
were getting rusted so i decided to call a local
plating company for a quote the guy gave me a estimate
of 80.00 per hubcap. Is that a fare estimate should i
pay the over 300 to get all my hubcaps rechromed
