Yes. Below is from The Samba.

The specs for the carbs on a 2 l manual* engine are as follows:

Carburettors: 34 PDSIT

Main Jet: x132.5 (Left & Right)
Air correction jet: 160  (Left & Right)
Pilot jet: 52.5 (Left & Right)
Pilot air jet: 130 (Left & Right)
Aux. fuel jet: 45 (Left)
Aux. air jet: 0.7 (Left)

The manual is "Intereurope repair manual #233 Transporter"

* It doesn't give any specs for an automatic.

Cheers,

Martin
