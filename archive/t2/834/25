Happy New year all

I was needing some more advise from you all on My
THING engine ping problem. I finally got time to check
the valves and OH MY GOD I dont know who had been
keeping maintenence up on it but those valves were so
tight i had to turn out the adjust ment screws several
times just to get my feeler gage in. Got them all
adjusted But it still pings pretty bad....the timing
is set to as close as i can get it.......for how its
running...plugs are gaped good and are ok.I put one of
those electronic Point adjusters in it with a high
output coil..OH and one valves when i was adjusting it
just kept coming out and out....i never could get the
gage in it to adjust it....whats up with that??
So do i need new heads? or have i killed it? and need
to start over with an overhaul?
Thanks
Rus in bartlesville,
74 thing
