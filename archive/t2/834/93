I was thinking so too. I tried premium gas with octane booster
additive, and no luck. I thought about using aviation gas or racing
gas. I asked a local builder who makes VW engines for experimental
aircraft about going to the airport and filling up with avaiation gas,
and he said it wasn't legal. I'll have to check into where to buy
racing gas.
