Subject: Polarity flip!

I've heard of this but never seen it in person...

Troy's battery did a polarity flip!

He was trying to get it started (finally! WooHoo!) and the battery drained.
No biggie he thought, just jump the bus with another car.

When he hooked the cables up the battery sparked like the cables were
crossed. He triple checked + to + (and on the phone I told him to double
check) but it's right. He put his voltmeter on and got -7v. Bizarre.

We took the battery to Autozoned and they put it on the tester there and got
the same thing.

So what could suddenly (from one moment to the next) cause the polarity to
flip like that?
